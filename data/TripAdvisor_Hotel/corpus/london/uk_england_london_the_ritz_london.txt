	Mostly good...	Our room was very nice and beautifully decorated. We stayed 4 nights and it was my birthday on the day we arrived and the Ritz had put champagne in the room and a little cake and that was lovely. But we also got some strange treatment in that we asked if we could have a later check-out (not really expecting it because the hotel seemed quite busy) and were told we could have a one hour extension, then got a call at 11.45pm (yes, at night) to say that we couldn't have the extra hour. Very odd to call so late when they could have told us the next morning. We also needed to book our seats on BA and asked if we could use the business centre (meant to be open 24 hours?) computer. No. We had to hire a laptop for $30 or $40AUD and used it for maybe one hour and then had to have the boarding passes emailed to reception at the Ritz, and when we checked if they had them they didn't, but when we checked again they'd been put in the junk folder and they told us so, which was just not professional and the way they handled it was quite insulting. The dining room is spectacular and we enjoyed our dinner there both nights, and we also liked the room service. Breakfast was ordinary. The ladies in the beauty/hair salon were pleasant and thoughtful. If you're the type who gets offended at being asked if you're a guest each time you re-enter the hotel, then don't stay here. We would just have our card handy to show the doormen when we returned. If you aren't the type to dress up each day then don't stay here because there is a dress code and it was great to see all the beautiful clothes, shoes, bags and hairdos, but if you're on a tour then it's difficult to have enough appropriate clothing. We can't rave about the Ritz, but it was an experience we wanted and we get a bit of a buzz to think that we've stayed at such a famous hotel.	
Nov 20 2009 	mixed feelings	The room was very beautiful, classic furniture, but the cleanliness wasn't what expected from &quot;ritz&quot; standard.Service careless, pointing fingers at costumers not elegant.But the breakfast was great it is absolutely worth coming there just for it, the restaurant was in gorgeous rococo room, egg benedict delicious !!!	
Nov 18 2009 	Dishonest - stay away	Cancelled booking twice , due to Fathers fatal stroke , but charged anyway!I was asked to supply e-mail address so they could verify my cancelation . I did this but now they refuse to reply.You can probably book last minute if you must stay here but save your money and don't book ahead. Lyndalle	
Nov 13 2009 	Glad we chose the Ritz	Stayed at the Ritz while traveling with my wife for our Christmas vacation. We spent a week at Claridges and decided to extend our trip and try a different hotel. This was our first time at the Ritz and we throughly enjoyed our stay. Our room was spacious, well kept, provided huge amounts of closet space, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was a well laid out marble clad affair typical of 5 star hotels with an enormous deep soaking tub and separate shower. The hotel's location is hard to beat - you are at the bottom of Bond St and within walking distance of just about every major sight in London. There is a tube station located less than 1 block from the hotel. In short, the hotel is the epitome of old world elegance you can find in few other places. Many older grand hotels have pictures on the website that make the common areas look amazing but in reality they are tired and have been subjected to renovations of varying quality. The common areas of the Ritz live up to the hype and then some. They didn't spare anything when they renovated the place. The dress code (which requires a tie at dinner and in the bar in the evenings) contributes to the general old world ambience of the place. Frankly it was rather refreshing to see people dressing up for dinner/drinks especially given the general splendor of the common areas. The dining room is truly one of the most grand (and well done--not to big, not to small) hotel dining rooms I have been in. I wasn't wearing a tie when we checked in the hotel (or when my wife and I entered/exited the hotel during the day) and didn't feel, nor did the hotel make me feel, the least bit awkward. I did wear a coat and tie to dinner because (like many nice restaurants) the hotel requires it (since when is this unusual or onerous?). I found the service very personal and not the least bit snobby or condescending. For example, during afternoon tea our waiter provided us with an extra plate sandwiches/tea cakes to take to the room when my wife told the waiter how much she enjoyed them. The hotel also obtained dinner reservations at the times and places we asked for (something other hotels seem to have a hard time doing). They also got us on guest lists for several of the bars in the surrounding area so we avoided any wait for a table. In short they did what they were supposed to: make our stay enjoyable. The cons: I thought tea here, while wonderful, wasn't any better than other places in London (the Lanesborough, Claridges, etc.). So if you don't get a reservation (I couldn't until I stayed at the hotel) there are plenty of other equally good options. The bar isn't a see and be seen type of place (as the bar at Claridges appears to be) but that was fine with us. If you are looking for a hip bar scene this isn't the place. It was, however, a nice place to get a well made drink after a long day of seeing the city--never had to wait for a table and the service was great. Frankly we got exactly what we expected from the hotel--gorgeous grand common areas in which to eat and drink, a quiet bar that makes good drinks, a well appointed room, and exceptional service.	
Nov 5 2009 	A fantastic hotel- This really is the best!	We have been lucky enough to stay at the Ritz on several occasions and have always found we leave wishing we were staying longer. The purpose of our recent stay was for my birthday and when we arrived at our suite they had left a cake and card wishing me a happy birthday - what a lovely gesture!The staff are always friendly and helpful and always go out of their way to help in any way they can.We will be returning to the Ritz soon for a short break and we are really looking forward to it!	
Oct 5 2009 	Overrated. DO NOT GO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WEAR A TIE EVERY DAY.	Comparing American luxury hotels with European is like comparing apples and oranges. Europe hotels simply cannot compare to the American ones.The Ritz is nice but it would probably not be considered a 5 star in America. As with all of Europe, it's showing its age (in good ways and bad.) I suspect Europeans have lower standards for cleanliness and wear. Where do I start?BATHROOM-Spacious for Europe. Marble. Towel warmer seemed to leak natural gas. I stayed in two rooms and management didn't seem to think this was a problem. Don't smoke in the bathroom. BTw, who in Europe thinks that those glass partitions are superior to shower curtains. Slow drains. Faucet in one room had hot AND cold faucets making any attempt to wash with WARM water rather difficult and painful at times. Hairdryer was quite humorous to see and was probably was one of the first ones ever made.BEDS-Spacious again for European standards. Bed is a joke. Very soft. Too soft. Kinda like a bed that was new in the Eisenhower administration. ROOM-Worn. Telephones were outdated although internet was available. In Hospitality Suite, no printer avaible to print itemsSERVICE-Honestly, not bad but you get the stinkeye if you walk thru their precious lobby not wearing a suit and tie. Few of the staff are below 50. Same with the guests. At 37, I was probably the youngest person there. They are attentive to your needs but unless you're in suit and tie, they seem a bit wary of you. I would deem service good and it would be better if they didn't have this insipid looping video on their TV (channel 2, I believe) saying essentially how awesome they are. On a down note as well, urgency doesn't seem to be their focus whether at check -in/out or at the concierge.OVERALLThis place is OK but loses points for not seeing it needs to improve (especially in &quot;American&quot; (if not global) terms. If you think you are going to be staying at a place similar to Ritz Carlton, Bellagio, Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons, I got news for you...you're won't be.	
Oct 4 2009 	Rather disappointed	We spent our last night in London at The Ritz and admittedly booked it on a whim. So, we might not have been put in the best room on the best floor (we got room 226). The hotel IS splendid as you walk through its immense, luxurious lobby. You really have to see it to appreciate it. And, the bell staff were quite attentive, pointing out every feature and amenity in our room. But, the room itself was a disappointment.First, it was hot. And there was only one A/C vent - in a window sill on the far side of the room - laboring away rather unsuccessfully. Thankfully, the room had electric roll-down window shades and they helped. We also requested, and got, a small in-room air-conditioning unit that also helped. But even with that, the room was still too warm for my tastes.Second, it was noisy. We heard people walking in the hallway, heard our neighbors' voices through the vent in the bathroom, and heard someone running back in forth in the room above us at 11PM as we were trying to get to sleep. We also heard the water in the adjacent room go on and off - loudly - several times.Third, only the most basic amenities; shampoo, conditioner, lotion, two small bars of average soap. Yes, there were robes and slippers. But, the TV was small and inconveniently placed on a small chest of drawers far away from the bed and partially blocking access the the bathroom. Also, the door to our room had only one lock - a simple push-button doorknob. Fourth, the bed wasn't all that comfortable. Actually, make that the pillows. They were all too big and overstuffed, and I woke up in the morning with a stiff neck.The only meal we ate there was breakfast the next morning and it was good. But, nothing to write home about.All in all I'd say The Ritz is a lot like my Grandmother. Old, worldly, a little old-fashioned, and a little dated. I'd go back to tour the lobby again. But I'm not sure I'd want to stay there again.	
Sep 15 2009 	fantastic stay!!!	I have just returned from a weekend break to celebrate my 40th birthday at the Ritz hotel. We are a family of 4 with children aged 15 and 12 yrs. I have to say that from the moment we got there this hotel had the wow factor! There was a card and a birthday cake in my room upon check in. Everything was taken care of and the staff were wondefull. Our package included a junior suite, breakfast and we also booked afternoon tea on the day of my birthday. The room was lovely and the bathroom huge. The breakfast was delighful with a delicious selection and is served in the ritz restaurant with all it's beautiful surroundings. Afternoon tea was served in the palm court and again there was plenty of choice i highly recommed this for a special occasion. Room service arrived exactly at the requested time but i have to mention the jewel of the Ritz - Tony the concierge, he provided us with excellent tickets for a show and also recommended and booked us a table at an excellent restaurant again at a moments notice, nothing was impossible or too much trouble for him. Despite this being a 5 star hotel the children were welcomed which we have not always found in the past with this type of hotel, every night milk and cakes were left for them and all the staff went out of their way to speak to them. We wanted to do some shopping on our last day so after we checked out we left our luggage in the hotel and they were placed in the car for us, when we returned to the hotel the car was brought to the front with all our belongings ready to leave. We really did have a fantastic 3 night stay here and cant wait to return. I shall expect my husband to take me to the Ritz for every birthday and as he enjoyed it so much himself i think i am in with a good chance !!!	
Sep 11 2009 	Fantastic Hotel!!	My husband and I stayed there Bank holiday weekend and it was the best service we have ever received. From the moment we arrived, the staff were genuinely friendly and efficient. The doorman took our luggage and radio'd through to reception our names so we didn't even have to tell them who we were.Everything ran smoothly and the receptionist showed us round the hotel before taking us to our room.There was a small birthday cake waiting for me and the room was lovely.We had booked a different restaurant so didn't eat there that night but when we came back to the hotel the restaurant was still buzzing because the have a dinner dance on Saturday nights which we wish we had booked instead!We had a nightcap in the hotel bar, I had the Ritz 100 cocktail which was recommended by the receptionist and it was lovely.When we returned to our room they had done a wonderful turndown service with his and hers slippers, lovely souvenir to take home!I can't wait to return, it was very special.	
Aug 27 2009 	Timeless treasure	The ultimate London joy, a stay at the Ritz. The first view of the room was jaw dropping, gilded ceilings, gilded faucets and champagne! The treats didn't end , our rate included dinner with 4 courses, and a full English breakfast the next morning. The staff was willing and delightful. I w as celebrating my 60th birthday, and I think it is almost worth turning 60 to have such a lovely time. Thank you Ceasar Ritz and all who follow !	
Aug 27 2009 	Perfection	The Ritz London harkens back to an era of grace, manners, elegance, and unparalleled service that seems more often than not today to have all but vanished from our society. I have been lucky enough to stay here a few times, and it remains my hotel of choice in London. In my view, nobody comes close to doing hospitality like the Ritz. The service is second to none; I don't know where they find their incredible staff or how they train them, but I have never stayed anywhere where the employees were so inviting, friendly, and constantly helpful in ways that go far beyond what is merely required. In addition to being constantly good-natured, accommodating, and amiable, as one would hope for but so often doesn't find even at a hotel of this caliber, they went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant and memorable as possible. They made nightly reservations for us at London's best restaurants, places we would never have gotten into on our own; on our way out when we stopped to ask for directions, they offered us the hotel's Rolls Royce free of charge to drop us off; the doormen even learned our names--not to mention remembered us from our earlier stay and made mention of it, despite the hundreds of new faces they must take in daily. In the world of service at luxury hotels, the rest would do well to take notice of the way it is done at the Ritz. The rooms are of course superb, flawlessly clean and lavishly elegant. Our suite was as spacious as it was beautiful, with high ceilings and a simply amazing marble bathroom with a whirlpool tub and glass shower. Housekeeping and room service were as beyond reproach as the rest of our experience at the Ritz, and I think I could very happily have given up my house to move into that lovely room.We arrived immediately following a stay at the George V in Paris, a hotel that is often described as perhaps the finest in the world; despite having a wonderful stay there, we found the Ritz far more charming. Everything about it breathes gentility, from the beautiful decor to the strict dress code required in the Palm Court, bar, and restaurant. I understand that this formality is not to everyone's taste, but it never ceases to amaze me how people will complain about it as though it were a fault of the hotel. The sense of the elegance of a bygone era is one of the Ritz's distinguishing features, and if it isn't to one's liking, then the solution is simple--one ought not to stay here. For my part, I find it refreshing in this world of torn jeans and endless informality; in its sophistication, its charm, its spectacular service, and yes, even its formality, the Ritz pays heed to the niceties of the past, and for that, there is nowhere in the world I would rather stay.	
Aug 20 2009 	Afternoon tea at the Ritz - DO NOT GO! Go to Claridges instead!	Well I have to say that I am not at all impressed with afternoon tea at the Ritz. Reading other reviews one feels some similarities are clearly evident. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very pleasant dining area manager. However, after that it was downhill all the way to the exit. Firstly, when one goes to the Ritz you expect the waiters to be attentive. Yes, they were attentive - they did not leave you alone and were constantly hovering checking the tea pots and leaning across you when seated. The sandwiches had very little filling and the smoked salmon was somewhat tough and definitely not of a good standard. Never mind there was the cakes to look forward to.... Upon arrival the cakes looked very nice but upon eating them they were stone cold and clearly refrigerated to a very low temperature indeed - so much so it put one of my guests teeth on edge. Another member of my party was gluten free - clearly the Ritz does not feel that Coeliacs should be given the opportunity to eat comparable food to their gluten eating dining companions. No scones if you are gluten free and one piece of carrot cake that was frozen in the middle! No other cake was offered - a very small plate of fruit was sent in place of cakes I guess - strange as I thought a cake was something that was made and baked? The surroudings are nice enough but one could not help feeling that the Ritz staff feel pretty special about themselves. The music aspect of things was also disappointing as there was no music for the first 30 minutes and this only lasted for 1hr - no piano music just a harpist trying to be heard over the noise that was being created. One final thing that astounded me was that as other diners left the tables the afternoon tea area turned into a what can only be called a canteen area with table cloths being whipped off and shaked, cups and saucers being clattered. Waiters chatting very noisily - clearly this was our cue to leave and we did amongst the dirty table cloths being shook ready for the next diners. The best bit of advice I can give you is to go to Claridges, we have been there and never been disappointed - the staff are lovely, attentive and down to earth. Gluten free is no problem whatsoever, with a full range of pastries being offered (including scones). I am sad that I cannot write a positive review but feel that I must express my disappointment at what should have been a superb afternoon. Summary: Go to Claridges instead - you will love it!	
Aug 19 2009 	Fantastic can't wait to go back	We went here as a special treat for our silver wedding aniversary and received 5 star treatment from the minute we got out of the taxi. We had booked the romance package which included fruit champagne etc on arrival and a meal with wine in the evening. When we went to book in the reception staff were polite and very attentive they congratulated us on our anniversary and we were upgraded to a suite which was beautiful. The room was supurb and the facilities at the hotel were as expected we were treated like royalty from we arrived untill we left. The experience of dressing for dinner and breakfast will live long in the memory and the service was outstanding. We could find no faults with the hotel and can't wait to go back again. A super treat which was well worth waiting for and the dress code made it feel special. Casual dress has its place but not here. Experience it once in your lifetime you will not regret it.	
Aug 10 2009 	A great place..	I booked the Ritz for my fiance's birthday as we were in London shopping. It's just a great place. I'm sure there are better equipped hotels with more facilities - bang and olufsen toilet roll holders etc but this place has got a very special feel about it. The decor is as you'd expect all old school glamour, and it's very old fashioned all round but you can just feel the history and class of the place from the moment you arrive. Rooms are not massive, but are well laid out and are very comfortable. It's very intimate for a grand hotel - about 135 rooms but you are made to feel very much at home and the staff attention to detail is second to none. Having read a few reviews previous, the main theme seemed to be the dress code which is pretty formal. You're ok going in through lobby and to the room in short or jeans etc but if you want to use the bar or restaurants or main communal area then you'll need to have trousers, shoes, jacket &amp; tie. If this doesn't sit well with you then go to the Sanderson, it's just how this place works. Location is obviously great and all round well worth the money for a special occasion.	
Aug 9 2009 	In need of refurbishment a bit like a snooty English Golf Club	We stayed at the Ritz for our wedding anniversary, we have stayed twice before and standards have slipped. We booked in for Friday and Saturday night and forgot to book afternoon tea in advance. We telephoned prior to our arrival to say we would like to book afternoon tea but were told they could only serve us at 7.30pm, who has tea at 7.30pm?Upon check in I said I was disappointed they could not offer us afternoon tea , especially as we are paying £550 per night. I also explained we had recently stayed at Claridges and they held back table for their paying guests. The receptionist did try to help us and offered us tea at 11.30am and 7.30pm - we declined. So book afternoon tea in advance if you want to tea as the proper time - the fact you are a guest holds no weight.Check in was an experience - we had booked a junior suite but were offered at check in a two room suite for an extra £200 per night. We declined as we felt £550 per night was already a huge sum of money. After a bit of discussion, not prompted by ourselves, they said they were very pleased to offer us the two room suite for no extra charge. We were very pleased until we arrived in the room. Our complimentary bottle of champagne and anniversary card was there waiting for us which implied to us we were going to get the room anyway but they thought they would try to get us to pay for it! We opened our champagne and proceeded to run a bath and quite unbelievably the bathroom was unacceptable. The bath was in desperate need of re-grouting and there was mould growing around the edge of the bath. The loo ( pottie ) seat was old and looked like something out of B&amp;Q ( Home Depot ). We decided we would prefer our lower standard room. There was no separate shower and the fittings were all worn out. We called down and said we were not happy with the room and were told we would be shown another room. We were taken to another room, even bigger but the bathroom was only mediocre. It was clean and there was no mould but it was in desperate need of refurbishment. The bedroom, sitting room and hall , were beautiful but were really let down by the bathroom, again no separate shower or double ended bath. We had to wait 30 mins for our luggage to be transferred and then they did not bring down our opened champagne. We called down for this to be brought to our room, this took another 45 mins and we expected a new bottle but no they brought the old bottle! This all took 2 hours from check in and was a real waste of time. Our view is they keep this room for their ad hoc guests who will be so pleased with an upgrade that they won't complain!The dress code is a pain, no jeans at breakfast or around the hotel, jacket and tie at dinner but that is part of their brand and offering as a result we cannot really complain about their proposition, however there were some dreadful outfits coming in for afternoon tea and dinner!Breakfast is served in a beautiful room but is underwhelming - the toast was like cardboard and the scramble egg inedible.We spent our wedding night here and subsequent anniversaries but this will be our last visit until they refurbish this establishment	
Jul 31 2009	A must do experience... fantastic!!!	The Ritz Hotel in London is one of a kind. I stayed there for one night as a treat with my mum and dad and thoroughly enjoyed being treated like royalty for one night. I must admit that when you first arrive at the hotel you feel almost awkard but that doesn't last for long. The service at the hotel is exquisite and the food is devine. At Dinner and Breakfast I was in heaven as I was in when in the room. My parents went off to see a show and I stayed in the hotel where my every need was attended to. I went down to the front desk to ask for DVDs and was given a brilliant choice of films and I was pleasantly suprised when house keeping turned up at the door with complitmentry bath soaps. The only down side in the hotel which is not a problem for most people staying in London is the facilities. There is a gym in the hotel but it is rather small as is the salon but they offer a wide range of treatments. The thing I love about the Ritz is the fact that after a long day shopping in the busy streets of London you can return to the tranquility of the Ritz and you almost feel as you are in a completely different place. Overall the Ritz has been a truely sensational stay and I look foward to returning soon.	
Jul 31 2009 	Grand and very good	The Ritz combines a grand interior with great comfort and excellent service. The suite facing Hyde Park, was large and extremely comfortable (great bed, Bose stereo, enough cupboards for a whole wardrobe, etc.). The bathroom was lightly modernised but in keeping with the classic style of the hotel (red and white marble, gold fittings) and the toiletries were full-size bottles from Floris (a smell I have never seen at their shop).Lunch at the beautiful restaurant was a unique experience (where else do you get a perfect lamb Belle epoque served by liveried waiters?). The Rivoli Bar has a different atmosphere, more like Lalique 1920s. Breakfast is a buffet (very good quality but there could be more variety) and a separate menu for cooked items. Again, the decor of the restaurant and the excellent service stand out.The service throughtout the hotel is world class, warm and very personal (maybe the best doormen, concierges and bellboys I have come across). The dress code is strict, but it adds to the style of such a grand place.One negative: small fitness room, no real spa.Conclusion of my short stay: The Ritz does the grand hotel experience in an unforgettable way (far better than the other historic Ritz property, in Paris).	
Jul 30 2009 	THE BEST EXPERIENCE FANTASTIC HOTEL WONDERFUL RESTAURANT	I have been to the Ritz and i relize my dream.The Hotel is fantastic staff performance very excellent especially in to the restaurant where you can have very good food, and very good service.I am italian and i am sure when i said very good food quality.I be back to the Ritz any time i can if possible!!!Unfortunatly i cannot use the Palm Court tea experience because always full, but i will definitly try again!!!!	
Jul 17 2009 	hmmm. Debatable ..	We stayed here in Feb 09 and i feel like i should have written a review then but needless to say i have taken my time .. grand it is, faultless it is not ! We stayed here on a package deal which included a suite, breakfast, afternoon tea and butler service.Immediately on checkin we were referrred to as 'Mr. &amp; Mrs.' we are not married, i would have thought better of a hotel to make a presumption.We were shown to our room by our butler which was a fabulous suite with great views of Green Park and Piccadilly being a corner suite. You cannot fault the rooms decor nor cleanliness and the same can be said for the hotel throughout.Our butler promptly served us our afternoon tea which was fresh and well presented although they did forget the milk for the tea (a small point but needlessly annoying). Upon my request for a sowing kit the butler said he would bring this .. it never turned up .. the following morning breakfast arrived delivered by room service (not the £325 butler we had paid for) and again the milk was forgotten and the juices along with our requested newpapers - too many incidents !We did complain and we were informed that they were having some issues with the butler services at the time and that they would refund half of the fee and write to us, we are still waiting for that email !!!!! To top it off they charged us again for the afternoon tea and did not pay the full 50% refund they had promised for the non-existant butler service.What can i say really other than that for such a prestigious hotel i would not stay here again and i would not recommend it.	
Jun 13 2009	Celebrate in style	To celebrate a retirement and a 21st birthday five ladies from my family aged from 21 to 62 took Tea at the Ritz on Friday and we were not disappointed. We were greeted by everyone from the Doorman to the cloakroom attendants. The waiters attendended to our every wish. The pianist's choice of music was delighful and added to the atmosphere. The welcome host enquired if we were celebrating a special occasion and unexpectedly presented my niece with a birthday cake whilst happy birthday was played by the pianist. The tea is the best in Britain, and more food than we could eat. A special place for that special occasion. Will be back soon.	
Jun 6 2009 	Century old elegance	Feel very lucky. This slideshow from SwitchYard Media puts it very well:http://switchyardmedia.com/images/stories/showcase/historic_hotels/slideshow448-framed.html	
May 31 2009 	Old school glamour exudes reception but the rooms are a let down - better value for money at Claridges!	I have always wanted to stay at The Ritz- well you hear so much about it, it is the hotel everyone thinks of when they think of London! But the truth of thematter is that it went rapidly downhill from the minute I steped out the car! I was running late for the theatre so I literally wanted to just hand my keys to the concierge as I so often do at Claridges ( where it is dealt with very swiftly) but no five minutes later the doddery concierge ( and no, I am not age-ist - he was under 50!) was still looking for a ticket to give me! Checking at reception was no quicker, although at least my partner could star spot, working in TV, thats a little by the by for me! But the biggest disapointment was the room, small, dated, faded furniture, nothing special at all, nothing more than one would hope for in an £80 a night country house hotel. Thankfully the bathroom had been revamped but was nothing special, standard bath, shower and vanity unit. There were good quality ath products but only one set of it, one shampoo, one shower/ bath gel, two soaps and one body lotion. No conditioner - I wish I had known!!!!! After my partner and I had had a bath and shower before going out to the theatre, there was nothing left for the morning and the turndown service didn't see any of the products get replenished, we did however recieve a not so useful bowl of stale chrisps! All in all I am glad I have 'done The Ritz' but I doubt I will be returning, in fututre I will be sticking with Claridges where the rooms are twice the size and the service is twice as efficient!	
May 30 2009	Disappointing Afternoon Tea - doesn't live up to its reputation	I found my experience at the Ritz disappointing. I agree that the Palm Court is a beautiful setting. However, the whole experience was extremely rushed, the staff rude and abrupt, and the waiters did nothing to make the experience 'special'. The food was nothing to write home about, and the bread on some of the sandwiches seemed a bit stale.The worst part was that the waiters were trying to clear our table after only 35mins, and after we refused to leave the table (after all we had around 50mins of our booking left!), they repeatedly returned to the table after this period to hurry us up and attempt to clear our tea away. Finally, buckling to their pressure to move us on, we asked if we could take the petit fours with us - but we were told very strictly that this 'was not allowed'. It angered me that I had paid for these items (they were part of the original setting, not replenished items) and yet I was prevented from taking them with me. This experience very much upset my relative who I had taken there to experience her dream afternoon tea for her 80th birthday. I was also prevented from taking a (non-flash) photo of my relative at her birthday celebration (not just in the Palm Court, but anywhere in the hotel!). I was surprised that our tea was not poured for us, and the strainers let the tea leaves through, meaning that after one cup of tea, the cup should have been replaced. But it was impossible to gain the attention of the waiters and we simply ended up drinking mouthfuls of tea leaves. Not the best experience.I have written to the Palm Court manager about my experience, but received a very disappointing response. All I can say is don't waste your money - Claridges is so much better!!	
May 14 2009 	Simply the best	I have just enjoyed 4 days at the Ritz, and what a treat!  Location cannot be better. Close to piccadilly, regent street and trafalgar. 10-15 min to harrods and oxfordstreet. It has also good transport outside. Underground right outside and open doubledeckers for tour guiding start outside. The service is beyound compare. The staff has an incredible feeling of the correct service level. It is never too much or too imposing. They seemed genuinly interested and not superficial, high nosed or &quot;tip me attitude&quot;. I cannot praise the staff enough; checkin, checkout, dinner and breakfast personnel, door men and butler service. Room. We were lucky receive a upgrade to a suite at checkin. It was a rather spacious room with everything necessary including a laptop. The bed is really good. Everything very well maintained. FoodThe bar is definitely worth a visit. Intimite and fast service. Good champagne selection.Dinner was the best experience. Great winecard and a good sommelier. I asked how many sommeliers they had. &quot;6&quot; ! During you eat an orchestra of 4 people played soft classic music. The food was very good and best of all again the service. It is so easy that it gets to much, that you cannot put down a glas without someone watching you over the shoulder and refill it. The Ritz had a very good feeling of that and you felt relaxed and not watched. The tea serving is great, especially the food, but a little commersial. We did not get a chance to order what tea serving would like and when we asked for the champagne. they served it together with tea, which then was cold when you finished the champagne. Generelly i felt a little stressed during the tea serving, many servants, could they remove anything, were we ready. The porter adressed you by name and was very efficient, but i preferred the doormen, which was very helpful and attentive.The staff at the SPA area were very skilled, friendly and attentive. Tried massage and reflexology. One thing more and that is that Ritz is very well organised. We had several reservations for dinnings, massages, car transport and everything was always in order.It is an remerable experience to stay at The Ritz . Unlike many other 5 star hotels in the world, not only because its history but for it personalised genuine service.	
May 8 2009 	Fabulous	I have always wanted to visit London, never knowing that my stay at The Ritz would change my life forever. This is by far one of the most spectacular hotels I have ever had the great privilege to visit. I was fortunate enough to enjoy one of the magnificent signature suites - The Trafalgor. The splendor that is upper class London can be glimpsed through a week's stay here. If you have ever dreamt of being The Princess of Wales, visit the Ritz. High Tea in The Palm Room, a trip to the spa, being pampered by the most incredibly customer service oriented staff on the face of the earth. You will never see the world the same way again. In a word -- Fabulous!	
Apr 29 2009 	A Beautiful British Experience	I'll start by saying that the Ritz isn't for everyone. The service is from a different era as well as the decor and ambiance of this remarkable hotel. My husband and I stayed for four nights over my birthday weekend, April 16th-19th. The hotel is welcoming, elegant, plush and over the top in decor. We arrived on a rainy night and were escorted to our room by the front desk. Our bags were shuttled away and arrived in our room without delay. We were upgraded to a lovely room with a huge bathroom and a beautiful fireplace. The bed was extremely comfortable and the heavy terry bathrobes always welcome. I enjoyed the robes so much that I purchased a PINK version during checkout. A few things about the Ritz are that you must leave your key whenever you leave the hotel. The key is huge and heavy so this isn't a bother but a relief. Leaving the key also helps to build rapport with the concierge staff and security. Its actually very charming. The concierges are also helpful and friendly. The other thing is that the Ritz has a very strict dress code. No jeans or sneakers are allowed. We thought about this before booking, but decided to try proper dress for a weekend and it was great! Its quite an improvement to your photos and there wasn't one attraction or restaurant that we felt out of place! One other thing about the Ritz is that they don't allow photos to be taken in the restaurants or public space which is a bit of a bother, but not too big a deal.We had tea at the Ritz on Friday evening and it was lovely. Its just one of those things you should do in your lifetime if you're into that sort of thing. My husband and I relished every minute! The location of the hotel is fantastic. Its literally across the street from the Green Park tube and the Wolseley Restaurant. Fortnum and Mason is a 5 minute walk and 5 more minutes to Picadilly Circus. Buckingham Palace is a 10 minutes stroll through the park! Its fantastic!	
Apr 25 2009 	Don't stay at the Ritz!	The driver from the Ritz was frightning, skinhead with earing. Room was hot and they did not fix air conditioning until next day. Toilet did not flush. Shower did not drain.Suite was beautiful but sofabed was unusable. Staff was unhelpful, condescending with a bad attitude. Staff entered room without permission. Rivoli bar was superb.Spa consisted of two tiny rooms.Internet was very slow.We moved out to the Gore Hotel.	
Apr 20 2009 	An amazing experience	I took my wife for a weekend on March 14. We were met by the Assistant Manager and shown to our upgraded suite. All the personnel we met were nothing short of extraordinary. When traveling to London, I cannot think of a place that has treated us any better than the Ritz. Afternoon tea is an experience that should not be missed. We would go back anytime.	
Apr 10 2009 	go to high tea here if you want to be abused by the staff	After being given a birthday gift of having high tea at The Ritz, we turned up on the incorrect date- our mistake. Instead of being nicely informed of this, I was treated terribly by the elderly maitre-d, who not only was rude and abusive he unbelievably, made fun of my Australian accent to my face. I have never been treated so badly by anyone and still to this day am totally stunned and disgusted.The only good thing about this experience was the intervention of the High Tea Manager who sent the maitre-d away and who then gave us free champagne and apologised profusely. No doubt this has happened before and i feel very sorry for those people who have had similar experiences from undeniably atrocious behaviour from this front of house staff member. The hotel manager would be appalled!	
Apr 5 2009 	Would i go there again? hmmm.	Yes i probably would, but i really would like to see some of that ridiculous stuffiness being done away with. The no jeans and no trainers thing i understand, especially the no trainers, i have however seen some dreadful suits in there! why should i be subjected to those? when a very smart pair of jeans, clean and pressed looks far more presentable than some tatty twenty year old suit thats never visited the Dry Cleaners, lets be honest, if you are the sort of person and are lucky enough to be able to afford to stay at the Ritz, you will want to look smart, so even your jeans will be nice jeans! Anyway, i had steak and eggs there for breakfast this morning, i could not get my knife through the steak and the eggs were undercooked and i was not the only person sending food back! So i decided to be very unforgiving about it all and left the breakfast room with my nose in the air, just to give them a taste of their own medicine, very satisfying!	
Mar 24 2009 	A great stay - a place to make an occasion a special occasion.....	I booked a room at The Ritz as part of my wife and I's silver wedding anniversary. I mentioned to the hotel that is was our 25th and were very pleasantly surprised to find a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting for us on our arrival - the had also upgraded our room at no extra cost. Nice touch - they didn't have to do that, and it was appreciated.Tea at the Ritz was great - expensive, of course, but I'd recommend it to anyone. We spent a couple of hours in The Rivoli Bar - champagne cocktails were (again) expensive, but very nice and, of course, beautifully presented.The standard of the staff was impeccable - sometimes almost TOO forced, if I'm being honest and - whilst I'm personally a big fan of a dress code - I felt that there was sometimes quite a 'big brother' approach to guests behind the beautiful veneer of impeccable manners. As an example, we had tea in The Palm Court - I took my camera downstairs with me, not intending to be so crass as to take a photo in there (but intended for use later) and I placed it on the table. Immediately a waiter swooped and, fairly curtly, but politely, told me that taking photos was not allowed.As I mentioned, I had no intention of doing that, but to be told not to in front of other guests in that manner is potentially embarrassing and takes a bit of an edge off the occasion.The decor of the hotel is grand - the Louis XVI style is probably too overblown for my tastes, but as an occasion, it's terrific and I thorougly recommend it. To prove that point, my daughters 21 next month and she wants to go to London - we're booking The Ritz.Very minor gripes aside, it's a great hotel.	
Mar 2 2009 	Beware the stuffy and outdated dress code	How can the Ritz justify not allowing me in their bar on Sunday evening when Claridges (where I go frequently) are only too happy to. Apparently being dressed head to toe in Armani and having a Prada handbag is not good enough for this officious and petty hotel simply because I happend to be wearing very smart black jeans! I could perhaps understand if they were either blue or ripped but they weren't. Pathetic - and frankly humiliating to be turned away in what I can only describe as a condecending fashion.I was going to book the hotel for my husband's special weekend birthday treat soon but won't bother. The staff are unhelpful and mostly too foreign to understand queries adequately. Go to Claridges instead.	
Mar 1 2009	Afternoon Tea at the Ritz - great waiters frosty Maitre De!	I would recommend Tea at the Ritz, I had a very pleasant afternoon with my Mum, celebrating her birthday.I can't fault one of our waiters who was sweet and attentive. However, the other waiter forgot our scones and we had a wobbly table. I wouldn't even mention it if it wasn't so expensive and you would expect a high level or service of the Ritz.However upon arriving, it's not clear who to tell that you've arrived for tea. We spoke to the Maitre De who was considerably frosty towards us and looked at us with a confused expression and sent us away to hang our coats up. When we returned all of one minute later, we were met with the same confused look and asked our names for a second time! Yet perfectly helpful and friendly towards the people he seated prior to us. I do feel that this was a class issue - the people seated before us appeared wealthy whereas we are just normal every day people having a birthday treat.We had a nice afternoon but did feel slightly overlooked and invisible at times! I would stil recommend an afternoon there as the sandwiches are nice, but at £38 a pop, I would expect a warm welcome at the very least. Shame on the Maitre De who's coldness left us feeling a little worthless as a paying customer.	
Feb 24 2009 	Lovely Hotel fierce security!	We had just one night at the Ritz in an executive king room with breakfast. Room was lovely nice and big for London as well. It was fully booked which meant we had a 20 min wait for breakfast which was a pain but not the end of the world. Breakfast was really good which made up for it. Security was odd, when you try to walk in they ask you who you are and what you're doing htere, when they find out you're staying they are very nice but literally as soon as we check out they were trying to get us out of the hotel asap! Whilst whole thing was a nice experience we wouldn't stay again as it was all a bit much ie dress code etc.	
Feb 17 2009 	Sheer Elegance	We booked a Junior Suite at the Ritz over the Valentines Weekend for 2 nights and were totally wowed by the 'experience'.Hotel is very much a 5*, very grand and elegant and is what you would expect or hope to expect from this Landmark Hotel.The Staff are amazing, professional, friendly and cannot do enough for you.You notice straight away the Security and that they do not let people in to wander around which is perfectly right and fitting!Reception staff are warm and friendly.Junior Suite is spacious and the photographs do not do them justice. Very elegant and attention to detail is noticeable everywhere.We had breakfast in the elegant dining room, everything you could ask for attended to by staff who were available to attend to you.We did not have the afternoon tea at the Ritz which is very popular and many people looked to be thoroughly enjoying the scrumptious food on offer.The Rivoli Bar is open to Residents and people who 'book' very sylish and also hard on the purse! Drinks were expensive, i.e. £17 for a glass of Champage or similar price for a gin and tonic, but then you wouldnt expect it to be cheap either!Dress code is strict, ties for men in the bar but not required for Breakfast.With this Hotel you get what you pay for, it is an 'experience' not to be missed and would I go back again? You bet! Would recommend for a romantic get away or even just go and spoil yourself, everyone has to have a bit of indulgence!	
Feb 15 2009 	Loved it but dont forget your trousers!	Stayed at the Ritz for valentines weekend, stay was lovely butwish I`d read reviews before I went. We stayed in an ex. king room witch was lovely it did smell a little musty, rather like an old house. The only bug bear was we wanted a drink at the bar but were told there was a dress code, I can understand a dress code for dinner, but just to have a drink. Having gone just for the weekend to shop we only had casual clothes with us . Apart from that the staff were friendly and helpful and now knowing I need to bring smart clothes I would definatly go again.	
Feb 10 2009	Tea- fantastic!	On a recent visit to London I decided to have Tea at the Ritz with some friends. What a great experience! Everything was great about it. It started by waiting for the table in the lobby- whilst we were here it was great to watch all those who had no idea about the dress code get knocked back from the bar etc. How can you go here and not know about the famous dress code? Lots of fantastic strops!! When the table was ready, the food was fantastic- don't be worried about there not being enough as they top everything up for you! I would say if you are in London- this is a great thing to do! Reading the reviews about heavy security and people in the wrong dress- well what do you expect? Given the level of people who stay here security is needed and if you don't know the dress code or think you are above it- then more fool you really! A fine British institution- well worth a trip.	
Feb 2 2009	Grandeur opulence and beauty.	Just arrived back after an amazing weekend at this beautiful hotel. We had booked a exec. king room for my 40th birthday and on arriving at the hotel we were upgraded to a Jr Suite as a birthday 'treat' from the hotel! From the moment you arrive at the Ritz the service you receive is second to none and the quality of the hotel is nothing short of breathtaking. Yes it is expensive but for a special occasion it's the perfect venue.We did not encounter any problems with security as mentioned in other reviews, nor did we feel uncomfortable as the staff are all very friendly and cannot do enough to help you. For those who complain about not being aloud in parts of the hotel without jacket and tie then they should go to other hotels. It's nice that everyone is made to dress smart in an age when 'anything goes', as it all adds to the sense of occasion.	
Jan 4 2009	Best Value Hotel in London	The Ritz is a throwback to how hotels were before they were put in huge global chains and staff left every other week. Its a fantastic experience which anyone travelling to London should experience. Its expensive but all five star hotels in London are when compared to regional or international standards and I think the quality make it exceptionally good value. You can stay in five star hotels nearby which are slightly cheaper but nowhere near as good. The hotel has everything: great atmosphere, comfortable rooms, amazing attention to detail from staff, superb location. I think the answer is staff retention, something too few hotels nowadays focus on. I hadn't stayed at the ritz for 14 months and it was amazing how many faces I recognised. This ensures you have professional staff not some spotty teenager or eastern european with limited english. Its great to see a hotel investing properly in its people. I am amazed at how they remember names, we were only there for two nights beofre christmas and when we returned after christmas the doormen welcomed us by name when we stepped out of the cab.	
Dec 16 2008 	Great service though not flawless	My friend and I stayed at The Ritz for one night in December. We booked the cheapest roome (even this was £300 for the room without breakfast). There was a mix-up over our check-in time which was entirely the hotel's fault, and this was rectified efficiently. We were given a free breakfast worth £30 each as an apology. Everything else about the room was lovely. It was in very good condition, although if you looked closely you would see signs of wear and tear so I wouldn't describe it as immaculate. Nonetheless, the service overall was impeccable, with doors opened for you everywhere you went, doormen with umbrellas accompanying you to your taxi and conciereges most helpful.All in all, this hotel deserves the reputation it has.	
Dec 7 2008 	One of the most beautiful hotels	I stayed at the Ritz in a superior queen room on Saturday the 29th November this year. I've previously stayed there in a junior suite (later js) with my family.I was happy with my stay, no problems at all. I arrived quite early in the morning (before 11 am), but my room was ready, so I was able to unload my luggage and go shopping straight away. The check-in and the check-out the next day were exremely efficient and friendly.The room was smallish (as compared to the js) but ok for one person. Also the bathroom was smaller and the shower was in the bath. But of course you get what you pay for (the js is about 50% more expensive). The Floris toiletries were nice, the bathrobe and all other textiles of an excellent quality.I had room service twice (the dinner and the breakfast), it was promptly delivered and good. The service was excellent, as it is allover the hotel. I especially liked the fact that you are addressed mostly by your name by the staff. The first time was when I arrived and put my foot out of the taxi! How do they do it?! The door men are really helpfull when you need a taxi etc.I didn't have any problems at all with the security staff as I was properly dressed. I think it's nice that there still are places where people dress up a little bit. Some afternoon tea tourists, however, slightly OD'd on the dressing thing, I noticed. (Of course it's none of my business.)All in all, if you like elegant and beautiful grand hotels with excellent service, the Ritz is a place for you. Not so much, if you are keen on latest technological gadgets, megasized tv's etc.As you probably know, the location is the best possible, you can walk almost anywhere. It's still one of my favourite hotels. Last, I'd like to recommend the Renaissance faces exhibition at the National gallery. It¨'s great and at the same time very informative.	
Nov 12 2008 	Great Service	We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon, and we're welcomed by the doorman. After he took our suitcase, we checked in and went to our beautifull room. Changing our traveloutft to our afternoon tea outfit, we went down for the afternoon tea. And that was superb! Such a lovely afternoon tea, big choice of items, very friendly international staff (love that). It took us almost 2 hours from start to finish, that is how good it was!We went out for diner and the theatre, but when we arrived back we had a drink in the bar with a few cocktails, and again fantastic service, very relaxing.For breakfast we got a great variety of items, which were perfectly cooked. And the service was fine, nothing special.The only hickup we had was a roomservice charge on our bill, whilst we didn't had any roomservice. But that was instantly adjusted by the receptionist. So, yes, it was expensive to go the Ritz, but we loved every minute of it.	
Oct 21 2008 	Afternoon Tea	We visited The Ritz for their famous afternoon tea and weren't disappointed. The atmosphere was both relaxed and opulent and the service impeccable. Sandwiches, scones and cakes were excellent and we both enjoyed the Earl Grey and Jasmine Flowers teas. Security wasn't an issue for us and had no problem assurring the staff who we were and why we'd come to the hotel. I think some of the reviewers are missing the point about hotel security; they're there for your safety and security as well as the other hotel guests, some of whom may have more security needs than others.	
Oct 6 2008 	best hotel in london	All i can say about thye ritz is perfection. every moment of my experience in this historic hotel was comfortable, enjoyable and stress free. from the moment I walked in with the staff carrying my bags from the taxi to them waving me goodbye as i left i was stunned by the elegant and nostalgic decore, the spacious rooms, the impecibly polite and prompt service and last but not least the world class restaurant. i ate there twice during my stay and both meals were delicious and wonderfully presented, the wine was wonderful and the classic design of the dining hall tops it all of as it seems to almost transport you back in time. there is no other place in the world that has had such charm, class and elegance as the ritz in london. some people have complained that the dress code as well as the attitude to those in informal wear can seem to be snobby. however the ritz is a special establishment with an old fashioned feel that should be respected. if you do stay at the ritz it is a special occasion and an effort to dress up accordingly should be made. after all you would not dress casually for a wedding or a black tie ball. anyway i would recommend the ritz to anyone in search of an unforgettable few days regardless of the occasion as long as you are prepared to dress up and spend big because perfection isn't cheap.	
Sep 25 2008 	Can't wait to come back	Me and my husband went to the Ritz on his birthday 16.08, I booked Ritz Romance package and Afternoon Tea. It was a surprise for him so I was anxious and stressed after reading all those negative reviews thinking that were were about to endure the disappointment of our lives! The thing is that my husbands idea of birthday party is a picnic or barbeque with the nearest and dearest but I wanted to organise something really special and different this year. On arrival we got a complimentary upgrade to Delux room, staff were VERY polite and descreet. Absolutely impeccable service in Palm Court as well as in the restaurant. My husband was deeply impressed and asked me to book another Afternoon Tea asap! Unfortunately, due to enormous popularity &quot;asap&quot; turned out to be 5.11.08 that was , probably, the only drawback - no availability. Now we are both looking forwards to our next Tea at the Ritz.:) Hope some of you will find the following things useful. When you arrive they check your card for &quot;sufficient funds&quot; which is the price of a room PLUS £150 deposit for the room service, so if your rate is , say, £515 make sure you have £665 available. When you check out you will only be charged for the room (providing you didn't use room service of course) , no need to wear a suit when you check in , just something smart (NO JEANS) I saw the staff giving dirty looks to a young couple in denim , but in the end of the day its the rule of this hotel so if you are not happy with it there are plenty of other places to stay. What surprises me is that people knowing full well there's a strict dress code in the Ritz still wear jeans and then complain when turned down?! And the last tip - don't take pictures in the public areas , it is incredibly tempting as the hotel is very, very beautiful but you'll be immediately approached by staff and security and that would be very, very embarassing. That's it , hope you'll enjoy your stay as much as we did xxx	
Sep 18 2008	Loved the Ritz	This Hotel is for those who like extravagance and for the affluent. If you want modern, high tech or hotel chain style service and, or, accommodations then this hotel is not for you. However, if you seek formal elegance, world class service and that formal old world charm, this hotel simply cannot be beat. If you can afford it, I recommend a stay in a junior suite, and you must endeavor into the Ritz Dining room for their weekend dinner dance. The whole experience is so extravagant it's to die for. We loved the location and would do it all over again in a heartbeat.	
Sep 18 2008 	Simply the best!	My partner and I stayed at The Ritz in August for four nights. We had notified the hotel that we might be late in arriving since we would be on the Orient-Express from Venice and there was absolutely no problem when we arrived. We were assisted from the taxi and our luggage brought into the hotel and received a warm welcome from Reception, which upgraded our accommodation and then escorted us to our room. As we had to be at the Victoria Palace shortly thereafter, there was no time to drink the Champagne which awaited us, nor later since we dined at Sheekey's, quite the best seafood restaurant in London. The Champagne was kept for another night.Breakfast the following morning (and all others) was excellent, including the finest fresh raspberries I have ever had. The fresh orange juice left something to be desired - it certainly was freshly squeezed, but not as sweet as we are used to in California. Beautiful omelettes though and excellent service, if a little leisurely by American standards. However, we were not pressed for time except for one morning, and having mentioned this on arrival in the restaurant, the service was speeded up to allow us to eat rather more swiftly.The room itself was everything it should be - we did not have a suite, but compared to one at the Waldorf=Astoria Towers (New York) it was quite as acceptable. The beds were comfortable, the drapes let in no light and there were no noises from outside. Room service was prompt and the beds were always turned down before we returned. The bathroom was immaculate and had a separate door from the vestibule. The decor may not be to everyone's taste, but it matches everything else in the hotel in a grand luxe manner; it is in no way minimalist! The Hall Porter was always affable and helpful, although he did not actually believe we had a private tour of Buckingham Palace! Every time we arrived back, whether early or late, we were greeted by name and made to feel at home, which was greatly appreciated. I rather like the &quot;old fashioned&quot; keys and was pleased not to have a magnetic-striped card, which inevitably fail once or twice.On our last evening we dined in the Restaurant but, like so many contemporary establishments, found the offerings a little too clever, but probably appealing to younger 'foodies' since our taste is more for The Ivy and The Gay Hussar, the latter no longer fashionable. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the meal and then retired to our room to pack for the flight back to Los Angeles. Altogether a most enjoyable stay; whether we would stay there on a regular basis I can't say. Certainly it is most convenient, whether for walking, taking a taxi or the 'Tube'. But it certainly should be done once in a lifetime since very few of us actually live like that from day-to-day. Highly recommended!	
Sep 18 2008 	The Ultimate in Turn-Off Snobbery!!	I have to concur with the other reviewers who complained about the over zealous security at the Ritz. It boils down to one word: snobbery. It was such a turn off that I'll never return. A friend and I stopped in to talk with the reservations desk to see about room availability for a later return to London (we were on a London - Rome - London itinerary). We are attractive, professional looking people and were dressed very respectibly (not wearing jeans as per another reviewer's comments, not that I think there's anything wrong with that either). As soon as we entered and walked toward the front looking for the reservations area, the security man practically chased us down -- you would've thought we were criminals. It was incredibly embarrassing. He was &quot;politiely rude&quot;, if you know what I mean. While very openly looking down his nose at us, he ushered us back toward the door and told us we would have to make our enquiries at the information desk by the exit. Okay, so if he'd been polite and not condescending I would've called him helpful, but that was not the case. My reason for arriving unannounced to make a reservation in person and for staying there was to do an incognito site inspection, as I'm a meeting and event planner and was considering the hotel for a major upcoming booking which would have brought them a nice chunk of revenue. I don't want my guests being treated like that, however, and it sealed the deal. My friend and I left and I never considered this hotel for another event since, nor would I. There are too many other good options available where my guests will be treated with dignity from the moment they walk in the door, as it should be. It is the hospitality industry, after all. Elegance and snobbery do not have to go hand-in-hand, in my years of travel and planning experience. You can do better than this.	
Sep 5 2008 	Ritz Hotel London don't go thereunless you're David Beckham.	I spend last weekend at the Ritz in London. What a disappointment ! Because I booked by phone, i didnt recieved an conformation with the dresscode from the hotel. I was there to do some shopping at Old and New-Bondstreet. Because i wear a suit all week, i was wearing a comfy darkblue jeans, lightblue shirt with a darkblue pullover and brown leather shoes.All from Prada. (doesn't matter,but to give you a picture..) If my name was David Beckham i wonder if it was a problem then..I was treated like a beatnik! I was checking in and asked if i could use the bathroom after an 5 hour trip. The answer was &quot;No, i'm sorry, you are not allowed wearing jeans, and i wasn't allowed in the bar or have breakfast dressed like that!Every time i came in the hotel, security asked me who i was, if i could show them my key etc etc... EVERY time i came in!I travel all over the world, but i've never been more insulted in my life then there at the Ritz.Because i wasn't allowed to have high-tea at the Ritz, i wend to the Landmark hotel. They know how to tread their guests! Even wearing jeans! Wonderful hotel ,excellent service,great high-tea. So my advice is: go to the Landmark hotel, it's a little more expensive then the Ritz,but worth every penny!	
Aug 30 2008 	Birthday tea at the Ritz real treat	Five females from 22 to 60 in various garb arrived for tea. Lovely reception warm and friendly. Excellent cocktails - don't look at the price it's scary! Loved the tea -birthday cake was a lovely surprise and was delicious. Ritz roses were beautiful. Palm Court was delightfully OTT. I felt the staff were genuinely nice - it didn't seem to matter who you were.It's a special treat and we enjoyed it. Thank you to all the staff	
Aug 22 2008	Excellent Sevice	Fabulous hotel, fantastic location, it was brilliant to meet the Queen at afternoon tea. Special thanks to Jeeves the butler, top guy.	
Aug 21 2008	Over zealous security	We returned to the Ritz after having stayed about eight years ago for Valantines day - it was a disaster and a huge disappointment then, but we had a letter from the Manager apologising and that we should contact him when we next wanted to stay. It was our anniversary and we wanted to stay at Clariges but The Gordon Ramsey Restaurant was full, so my huband booked us two nights at the Ritz instead, we booked a Romance package for one night and the theatre for the next. The Romance package included a bottle of champagne in the room, flowers and dinner/dance in the restaurant to include a bottle of wine. We were given a room upgrade and greeted by the Duty Manager, the room was large and decorated in rich silks, the bathroom was of a good size, all gold taps and marble, with classic bath, tiny separate shower cubicle and gorgeous Floris toiletries. The Ritz is in a fantastic location and is a beautiful hotel but I have given the Ritz only one star rating due to our disappointment again. The trouble with world famous hotels is that they tend to have over zealous security and consider most people entering the hotel as sightseers or criminals. Therefore it is extremely annoying to have security keep asking you if they can help you, whilst the rest of the six or eight staff stare at you. We wanted a glass of champagne in the bar before dinner, so we asked for our restaurant order to be taken there. Bar Staff were excellent, but it seemed to confuse the restaurant staff that we were in the bar and things did not go smoothly. We selected from The Summer Menu which was included in our room rate along with a bottle of wine - which we had to ask for - this made us feel slightly cheap. The evening did not seem to flow as it should, we waited forever for our starter, there was no pre-starter or bread just awful soggy melba toast already on our table. The band was playing, the room was beautiful but our meal was acceptable but not great, Perhaps it was due to the package we had booked. Breakfast was really good, as of course, it should be. When returning after shopping security pounced, then again when we came back from the theatre. If the doorman can regognise guests why can't security, it was irritating and spoilt our trip. All in all the Ritz is, due to its fame, over-rated, service is fantastic but some staff are condesending, the dress code is nice for the restaurant and afternoon tea, but for guests wanting to use the bar is just ridiculous. Yes of course the Ritz is 5 star deluxe but I would never stay here again and would select a hotel just as luxurious but more modern without the pomp.	
Aug 17 2008 	Amazing place to stay in London	The Ritz is an amazing historic hotel. When we arrived, they upgraded us to an Executive King room. It was very spacious and very well appointed. The bathroom was very large and and it had a deep soaker tub. The beds very comfortable and the room was in very good condition, (The breakfast was good too). It is in a very convenient location for shopping and sightseeing. it is close to the Burlington arcade, the Royal arcade, and Fortnum &amp; Mason. When we arrived, we asked if they had any availability for tea the following day, we got reservations for tea the next day at 11:30. The man at reception told us that normally, you have to make reservations for tea two months in advance. The Ritz is a great hotel and I hope to go back soon.	
Aug 14 2008	Afternoon tea at the Ritz	Afternoon tea at the Ritz was a total disappointment for me! I booked a session at 17.30, approximately two months in advance, hoping that it would be a memorable experience for me and my friend. The minute we entered the hotel a very heavy smell surrounded us as if we were in a cheap restaurant. When we made it to the Palm Court at 17.35, we were seated at a small table at the very front of the room, above the stairs, both chairs facing the entrance door of the hotel. In addition, the fabrics of our chairs were dirty and full of stains, which really doesn't suit the image of the hotel. I believe everything related to such a reputable occasion should be immaculately clean! The table next to ours was of 5 people, so their seats kind of squeezed me. We tried to move our chairs a bit to the other side and, soon, a man, probably the headwaiter, approached us and stated quite conceitedly that we shouldn't move our chairs as it would be difficult for people to pass around. I asked him why in the first place they placed tables so inappropriately, he just mumbled and walked away. After a while, we asked one of the waiters to take a picture of us and he said it wasn't allowed to take pictures, there!? The food and service was OK, but my overall impression was not! Last year I had an afternoon tea at the Dorchester where the atmosphere and the attitude was much better. I would recommend it highly to those who would like to have a nice afternon tea experience in London.	
Aug 8 2008 	Beautiful hotel but level of service depends on who you are	Stayed at the Ritz for four days in July 2008. The room was a good size for London, with beautiful antiques and antique-style furnishings, and all the modern conveniences you could want. The major problem with the Ritz is that it is just too full of itself, and the level of service one receives depends on who you are. When you walk in the door, you see an amazing number of employees, in at least three types of uniforms (I assume the uniform signified something). They are clearly looking at you and mentally assessing whether you are (1) royalty from some country, (2) high government, (3) multi-billionaire, (4) someone else who has been allowed to stay in the hotel, (5) riff-raff who merely want to sightsee. Since the Ritz still uses the old, heavy keys which must be left at the desk and the desk is near the door, people in category 5 are immediately obvious and are ejected. The elevator is near the desk, so category 4 people are expected to go directly to the elevator. There are closed French doors leading to the Grande Allee, off of which are the Palm Court (for afternoon tea), the restaurant, the bar, and several quiet areas for lounging. Unless you have a reservation and are properly attired (jacket and tie for men after noon), the employee will not open the French doors. Your only chance to get thru is at breakfast, before the dress code goes into effect. But even the level of service for a category 4 person is not what you expect considering the prices. Twice in four days I returned from the theatre to find that the maid had not yet been in the room for turndown service. Therefore the choice was to put out the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign and forego the turndown service, or sit in the room and wait to go to bed until the maid had been there. True, she was there within 15 minutes each time, but at RItz rates, you expect turndown to be completed well before 10:00. Also, when I asked the concierge for a London Walks brochure, I received the winter brochure (in July). None of this would matter if the Ritz didn't charge what it does. (For a contrast, see my review of four days at Claridge's on my return to London, where the staff treats everyone the same and provides superlative service without fail.)	
Aug 5 2008	Tea at the Ritz - overpriced and overrated	We thought we were going somewhere special.... but ended up in a place with a bright gold fountain centrepiece. It's fairly crammed in and we were seated facing inwards, for some inexplicable reason, so had nothing other than this monstrosity to look at.We didn't feel the overall experience was worth UKP 38 for a 1.5 hr &quot;sitting&quot;, a pianist who stops playing to give you an oh-so-subtle message that your time is up, and ladies' loos downstairs (how do disabled visitors manage?) that have seen better days, with threadbare carpet on the stairs.	
Jul 31 2008	Needs a refresh!	What a tourist trap!The Palm Court is beautful but it is so touristy for afternoon tea!!!!The Ritz Restaurant is nice however for dinner. Rooms are old and small. Overdecorated in my opinion. And a bad location because it is on Picadilly Road(noisy) and on the corner of a subway stop. Would not recommend.	
Jul 4 2008	Great bed- confused staff	We came from the Four Seasons in Paris so this was a little disappointing. I think it has to do with the attitude of the traveler who enters- if you expect to love it, you will. It is lovely and the rooms are good sized with wonderful beds and pillows. But I have several pet peeves in hotels- first, the bathroom opens into the bedroom directly so if you get up at night, you must shine bright light (no night lights in the bath) into the face of your significant other. Also, there was MOLD in the bathroom around the tub and soap dish. There is no excuse for mold to grow in a 5 star bathroom! Housekeeping left the sprayer on in the tub, so when water was turned on for the first time, it sprayed the entire bathroom! Also, at check in, NO ONE came to the curb to help us. We waited about 5 minutes on the curb (having walked from the tube) and no door man was there. We finally walked into the hotel and had to ask for help. They were apologetic, but well, it was a bad start. The young woman who checked us in at the front desk said we didn't get breakfast in our plan, though it said so on our sheet, so we couldn't ask again until the next day AFTER breakfast was over as to why we didn't get it- and the next day the other clerk said, oh yes- you DO. SO they made about 60 pounds off of us by denying us breakfast the first day. The bed was very comfortable, but we were out of sorts from travelling and having things go wrong. So, be sure you bring a nightlight or small flashlight if you get up in the night and don't want to disturb your partner, and ask for a different clerk if you think yours is wrong. We should have asked for our 60 pounds (the price of breakfast for 2) refund. Also, I agree with the commenter who said they were stuffy- I agree that in this day and age, it is silly for the staff to be standoffish to the customer. One can be professional and still be friendly. The staff at the Four Seasons in Paris proves that. Maybe they think you expect this as part of the British experience? But, it is still the Ritz. So if you want to say you were there, you'll at least get a great bed!	
May 4 2008 	Frustrating stay at The Ritz!	My partner and i stayed at the Ritz for one evening last night with our friends. Having stayed in the best hotels in Dubai, London,New York etc, we feel able to make a fair comparison and i have to say we wont be returning to The Ritz. The hotel itself is beautiful, as expected. The room was well maintained and comfortable with fruit and champagne, all the usual comforts. The staff are very friendly and polite, serving staff are impectable with food and drink being of excellant quality. However we have had some dificulties during our stay. We had pre-arrange for our rooms to be ready at 12 o'clock when we arrived. We were on time however our rooms weren't ready. We hadnt taken photo ID for the Casino which is required. We were informed by the conceige when we arrived that it wasnt a problem, we just needed to have photocopies faxed to the hotel. We called a freind who went to considerable trouble to provide faxes of our passports.He also e-mailed the same. Reasurred that all was in hand we thought no more of it and spent a lovely afternoon in London. We had booked dinner for 8pm however our time was changed to 7pm which was a little too early for us.On returning to the hotel we arranged with our friends to meet in the hotel bar for a pre-dinner cocktail only to be told that we should have booked a table in the bar and that it was full so we wouldnt be allowed in.We told them that we were not advised that we needed to do thisbut we were not offered an alternative. We then decided to try the casino before dinner only to be told that photocopies were after all not allowed and we weren't allowed in there either. We explained that we had followed the instructions given by the staff and that had we been given the correct information our passports could have been sent to the hotel within plenty of time. Again no real apology,alternative or compensation was offered. By this time we were annoyed by the attitude and politely complained. We were shown to the bar and a table was found but we were asked how long we intended to sit at it! The evening dinner and dance was lovely, as was breakfast. Check out was simple and we were able to leave our car at the hotel whilst we went out for lunch. However on our return to collect our car we were stopped from using the hotel toilets as we were no longer guests. Quite embarrasing.The overall feeling we were left with was not one of a weekend of luxury, rather that we have spent the last two days in an institution. We are patient and un-demanding people generally but it did try us.Obviously to maintain standards there needs to be rules, however if the hotel has made the oversites you would expect remorse. Bed side manner was definatly lacking. All in all we feel our money could have been better spent elsewhere.	
Apr 17 2008 	Perfect hotel if you like elegant old style Grandhotels	Stayed at the Ritz for 2 days and really liked it compared to other hotels. Great location, rather large room by London standards. Everything functioning well, well-maintained and very clean, although some equipment (e.g. hair-dryer in bathroom) looks somewhat outdated (remainder of 80ies).Very elegant interior with nice, classical decorations. Service very attentive, although somewhat stiff for modern times. Excellent restaurant.Would definitely go again!	
Mar 30 2008 	Worth the Money	My husband and I were lucky to get a great rate for the Ritz with British Airways. Arrived to a beautiful room with flowers, champagne and a fruit basket that they refilled while we were there. Staff knew our name after check in and always greeted us.Rate included breakfast that could be taken in the beautiful dinning room or by room service. This is one of the worlds premier hotels and to stay here was great. We went to their Dinner Dance that is held on Fri. and Sat. nights. Price was not bad for London at 85.00 GBP each but after wine ( 40.00 GBP) and water (5.00 GBP) dinner worked out to about to about 200GBP per head.  We would go back if we could get as good a deal next time. We went to their Tea a few years ago and enjoyed that too. Do stay here if you can&gt;	
Mar 16 2008	wow!!!	my daughters booked a night for my 60th birthday and wow what a great time we had.from the minute we arrived, when the doormen saw us alight from our taxi and hurried down to take our luggage from us.The service was exellent throughout our stay.we wre given a free upgrade to a superior suite for the four of us which we wanted to stay in all the time because it was so fantastic eg. 2 bathrooms with a telly in each the bedroom and lounge also had tellys.It was lovely to have a taste of how the other half live.Also the breakfast in the morning was exellent.ALL IN ALL AN EXELLENT PLACE TO STAY.rose anderson	
Mar 3 2008 	One of London's Best	Beautiful hotel, perfectly located for theaters and shopping. Public areas of the hotel are lovely, and my single (a.k.a. &quot;superior queen&quot; ) room was very quiet, charming, and quite spacious, with an exceptionally comfortable bed and an oversized bathtub. Nice touches included fresh flowers in the bedroom and bathroom, and a large basket of fresh fruits that was refilled twice during my 5-night stay. The room had french doors leading out to a small balcony. However, the doors were wired shut (and attached to an alarm). I don't know whether the hotel is concerned about the structural integrity of the balcony or the possibility that guests could fall or jump. Although the ventilation system was very good, it didn't quite compensate for the windows that couldn't be opened. All of the hotel staff were helpful, thoughtful, and kind. One day I was ill and unable to leave the room. That evening, the hotel's duty manager called to make sure I was okay and offered to bring me complimentary soup and crackers. Housekeeping staff were excellent and unobtrusive. Check in and check out were handled quickly, courteously, and efficiently.My rate included a full English breakfast, which could be taken in the hotel restaurant from 7 to 11am, or from room service anytime during the day. Breakfast was plentiful, waiters were excellent, but the food was quite ordinary. The scrambled eggs were disappointing, everything else was perfectly fine but unremarkable.Although the atmosphere is a bit too formal for my taste, overall it was a wonderful experience and I will definitely return to the Ritz.	
Feb 8 2008	All pomp no substance!!	Well at a loss how to start - beautiful hotel, central to the theatre district which was the purpose of our trip - front office staff, concierge, doorman, were good (nothing much different from any other hotel). Restaurant staff indifferent, room service first night was as advertised on website, beds turned down, champagne in room etc, however had suite with three people - paid £900 per night - no robe, no slippers for third person (they were very well aware of this) room service and extra's (ironing) was prompt and very courteous (guess the extravegant tips helped!) Have stayed in all types of accommodation, from little huts in backwoods of beyond to 5* deluxe and ALL would beat this hotel on service. There is only so long that they can trade on the name eventually people get wise. Back for the theatre two weeks later, decided on Dorchester - what a wonderful unexpected surprise. Much more reasonable in price and the service was so much better! So yes, if you want to impress and say you &quot;stayed at the Ritz&quot; however if you want to really enjoy your London experience try another hotel and save your money for something special :)	
Jan 13 2008 	Christmas at the Ritz	I stayed at the Ritz for three nights (24-27 December) in an Executive King Room at 360 pounds a night. It was my first stay and was, all in all, a pleasant one.On my arrival (five hours before check in time) I was checked in and shown to my room while being given a brief overview of the property by the desk clerk who, among other things and as mentioned by other reviewers, did point out the dress code required in the area beyond the lobby. Frankly, I hadn't even packed any of the forbidden items, so I wasn't too worried.The room was pleasant enough, but the highlights had to be the bathroom (lovely long countertop, huge mirrors) and the closets. As something of a clotheshorse I loved the wide wooden suit hangers, the cedar-lined closets, the clothes brush, and the shoe horn. Items like this should be standard in any upscale hotel, but so rarely are.On the downside, the view from my room was far less than spectacular, and the broadband internet which was (according to my package) complimentary was charged at 20 pounds a day and wouldn't work over WiFi--only by plugging in. That was certainly annoying.The interior of the hotel was very charming and grand--the lobby in particular, with a huge Christmas tree and all of the polished wood was truly beautiful. Not the grandly spacious lobbies you see other places, but a very intimate space. At other places however (for example, on my floor near the lift) furniture seemed piled in something of a hodge-podge (I mean wardrobes and desks on landings) which did little to add to the environment.As I was there over Christmas, I had made reservations for the Christmas Eve Gala Dinner and Dance in the restaurant. Before arrival (in early December) I had been contacted by the events staff and told of all the events happening over the holidays--they were very helpful. Dinner was good (not stunning) and dancing was very enjoyable. The event seemed largely populated by couples who had made it a standard event of theirs for several years, which meant that many of them left earlyish (before 10 PM) and the cuisine was not particularly innovative. Still, though, my most memorable experience of the stay was the wonderful feeling when at just the right point of tipsiness I looked at my lovely dinner date, around the gorgeous room overlooking the park, at the dozens of waiters and sommeliers and busboys and the crystal and china. The jazz band began playing &quot;Puttin' on the Ritz&quot;, and I had a wonderful moment.Other huge positives were the salon (great haircut on short notice) and the breakfast I ordered on my last day--If I hadn't had a flight that day I would have ordered a second breakfast, it was so good.All in all, a memorable experience, but not a hotel I was so entranced by that I'm likely to stay there again before trying out some of the other grandes dames of English hotels. Also on the plus side, London hotel prices are so high that whenever I travel elsewhere I no longer feel guilty about splurging on suites, knowing that they'll still be less expensive than London stays.	
Jan 9 2008 	Amazing stay	Stayed at the Ritz on a theatre package for a treat and had an amazing stay. We checked in after afternoon tea, a surprise by my girlfriend, on a package which included bed/breakfast in a standard room, theatre tickets, and a post-theatre supper. On check-in, we were upgraded for free to the £1500 per night Green Park suite, which was bigger than our flat with views across the park. Amazing - made our stay rather memorable (although I admit we were a bit lucky!).I'd certainly recommend a stay here. Afternoon tea is a pleasant experience, the bar is good, dinner and breakfast were enjoyable, and the suites are out of this world.	
Dec 31 2007	Fantastic Hotel	My fiance (then boyfriend) and I stayed at the Ritz for our birthdays in 2006. We decided to do this rather than buying one another a present. From the moment we arrived it was a fantastic experience. The hotel really is beautiful inside and the dining room has an amazing ceiling. The food was excellent and the service second to none.The Wolsely next door is a must for breakfast and if they are full but you tell them you are staying at the Ritz (we just said we were staying next door and could they call us if a table came free) then they will find you a space somehow	
Dec 14 2007 	The Ritz = Civilisation at last.	My wife and I have stay and dined at the Ritz Hotel, London on on a number of occasions now, normally just for the one night by taking one of their themed packages.The doormen know us by name now, even if we haven't visited for a while. Having travelled worldwide over near on 40 years and stayed in many countries and hotels far and wide, the Ritz has to be my favourite destination.It is civilisation with respect to the attentative, but not intrusive service, beautiful surroundings and dining - another world together with things being attended to properly.Dining in the wonderful restaurant, especially with the small dance band and dance area on Friday and Saturday evenings throughout the year is exquisite.Yes, it is on the expensive side, then so is the rest of London in comparison.Yes, they do have dress standards, which is a breath of fresh air. If you dress nicely you get treated nicely. The staff have to be immaculately dressed and turned out. Personally, it is worth paying the extra, when booking, for at least a deluxe room, especially with the package offers, as lots of extras come with the packages.In conclusion we have never found anything too much trouble for the staff on any issue. They are polite on all occasions.The security of the hotel is excellent.The whole place makes a lasting wonderful impression on us both on every visit.The Ritz - we love it.	
Dec 9 2007 	A very British Institution but over-priced.	How on earth do we write this without seeming to bemoan a beautiful piece of British history???We are a very ordinary down to earth couple that have done a fair bit of travelling.We feel that there are some things that everyone has to do if at all possible - like running a marathon or visiting the Great wall of China and visiting The Ritz for us was one of those things.We had pitched our expectations wrongly and it resulted in us being disappointed. The Ritz is an institution and we concluded that part of what you are paying for is to be part of that. Our money is hard earned and carefully spent ,and for value for money for us The Ritz did not meet expectations or compare favourable with european comparisons.Little things made a big difference - there was no doorman showing us where to go and reception was not clearly marked. At reception before any form of welcome we were press ganged into being given the hard sell to pay to upgrade our room.The rooms are ostentatious and truly British, but furnishings are chipped, carpets worn and equipment like hairdryers and air-conditioning is out of date although efficient. In order to work the DVD player the remote controller had to be almost next to it meaning we had to hop in and out of bed!! Had we not been warned I would have also bemoaned the lack of kettle!!!!The hotel is stuffy and that is part of it's appeal however when we had afternoon tea then some guests did quite clearly look down there noses at us - knew we should have left the wellies at home!!If money really is no problem then The Ritz is for you. We feel really lucky to have had the experience but would not choose to repeat it. If like us then money matters then be prepared for a sharp blow to the ribs - the price of room service really does have to be seen to be believed and we would have needed to extend our mortgage to keep up. When The Ritz gets it right then nobody does it better - the bed and pillows were to die for and some of the staff were really helpful. The location is perfect.Quite simply The Ritz is overpriced - BUT - it is The Ritz! When we go back to London we will look at The Ritz with a smile but also with a sense of relief that we are not staying there.	
Dec 9 2007 	As good as it gets....in the UK.	There's so much written about this place already that there isn't much point in doing a war and peace here. Suffice to say myself, my wife, and our 15 month old son stayed in a Junior Suite. The room was very large by UK standards, and nicely appointed although we did have to rearrange furniture to make it child proof.Service was good, although a little forced at times. Food was ok although nothing to scream about. I asked for a burger, they asked how I'd like it cooked, I said rare, they sad no - medium is as low as they are allowed to go (nice one Mr Blair). We booked to eat in the main resteraunt and then had to cancel on the basis that they won't babysit for children under 2 (why?!?!?). That was a real annoyance, eating there was meant to be the highlight of the trip for my wife, can't fathom what stupid EU rules they were comforming to.It's a fine hotel, and it's not that expensive when you consider the location and where you are, and I did enjoy it. But to be honest, I think it, just like London, has seen better times. If I ever went back to London I'd definitely stay there, but unlike say the Oriental in Bangkok, it's not somewhere I'd plan my trip around.	
Nov 11 2007 	A very special stay	This was a special visit to London as my husband was receiving an award at the House of Commons on the first day of our stay, so we hoped the Ritz would make our London visit that extra bit special. It did.Sorry to any complainers on this site but our stay was 100% terrific: service, room (good price for good quality). The staff were amazing and this was definitely not because we were perceived as 'upper class' - we are very working class, thank you. The concierge, restaurant and reception staff were friendly and respectful. Service was prompt. Room was immaculately and luxuriously appointed and clean. Some people on this review site seem to object to being near a lift - this hotel is so quiet that we were never aware of anyone using the lift which was directly opposite our door. We did have a room over the infamous air vents (seriously, not over noisy and there are external shutters you can use at bedtime) but if anyone has stayed in NY or Chicago they would say the noise was unnoticeable by comparison; we were on the 6th floor and had a compensatory view of the London skyline from Big Ben to Buckingham Palace.Use the concierge to help you get bookings and advice on restaurants, theatres etc and he will book for you if you like. The restaurant was fully booked during our stay but the concierge got us our table without question, and at the time we wanted it. Do respond to their help by offering a tip at the end of your stay (they will never hint that you give them one, though). The concierge knew our names without ever having been introduced to us - how do they manage that?This hotel is significantly cheaper than other hotels in the same class in London but we don't know why. We booked direct with the hotel on their website and got a cheaper deal for breakfast and room than room only.Currently there is a a table d'hote menu in the restaurant - £45 for 3 courses. You will be offered a glass of champagne on arrival but it's not included (works out at around £15 per glass but varies as there are at least 3 types offered). Food is amazing (and very much to our taste) but if your idea of a good meal is lots of meat and veg you will may be disappointed.In answer to some negative comments made on this site:Afternoon tea - if you are a resident you will get a table but don't just turn up without reception/concierge booking you in. They will think you've just turned up off the street without an in-house reservation. Also, tea and its cakes/ sandwiches are fresh , light and varied. Someone mentions 'mass produced sandwiches'. What in heavens name does that mean? They are tasty, delicate and use good ingredients (and are crustless as you would expect). The scones are not dry. Additional food is offered at appropriate points and staff are not surly - just rather like you would expect a butler to behave (if you were ever lucky enough to afford one!) They treated us in a pleasing manner. Tea is served from late morning until early evening and you will always be allocated a 1 1/2 hour slot - it's the done thing and you shouldn't be offended by this.Dress code - clearly indicated at time of booking, including information on what to wear in public areas. Staff getting Sauvignon blanc and Chablis mixed up - They are not confused but you are. Sauvignon Blanc IS Chablis (Chablis is the French name for wine made with the Sauvignon Blanc grape). Staff will have been too polite to correct you.Stuffy room - the windows do open and there is adjustable air con on the windowsill. If you accept a room tour from your receptionist you will find this out.	
Nov 6 2007 	Absolutely loved it!!!	We stayed at the Ritz on a &quot;Sunday Special&quot; package - superior king room, champagne and flowers in the room on arrival, 4 course dinner for two and English breakfast all for the princely sum of £425. I had umed and ahhed a lot before booking as, albeit the price was without doubt a good deal compared with the usual Ritz prices, it was still a hell of a lot for 1 night!!! But I'm so glad we did it. Staff at the hotel were impeccable from the outset, from the people in reception, the hall porter, to the room service staff (only a couple of over zealous housekeeping maids let the side down by disturbing us - twice - when we were in our room). We never felt that we received the &quot;second class&quot; service that some people believe they received when staying on one of the package deals, Our room was lovely, very spacious although the view was of the main road. Dinner was lovely - pianist playing throughout, attentive (but not overly so) waiters, friendly sommelier and all beautifully presented. The quality of the food was a pleasant surprise considering the dubious reviews I had read. However, I think if we had been paying the a la carte prices we would have thought it overpriced. To overcome the problem of tie wearing at breakfast that a lot of people have mentioned, we had breakfast in our room and I would advise anyone using the hotel for a romantic break to do the same. Was fabulous!! All in all we both loved the experience from start to finish and would definitely consider doing again.	
Nov 2 2007 	Traditional	We stayed at the Ritz for one night this week to celebrate our anniversary. We did not use any of the dinning or bar areas during our stay, but room service was very efficient.The staff and service could not be faulted, particularly the doormen, who really seem to enjoy their job. We upgraded our room, so found there was plenty of space, and the bed was very comfortable. Having said that, the price was eye-watering!We stayed at the Dorchester a few months ago, and although we preferred that hotel, we thought the Ritz has a better location for getting around London. If you seek a very traditional hotel, the Ritz fits the bill. You can imagine yourself in a bygone age.The downside for us was the dress code. We had not realised that a jacket and tie was required for breakfast ! so had to eat at Richoux just up the road. Nevertheless, a very enjoyable outting.	
Oct 30 2007	A Truly Wonderful Stay	My husband and I stayed for one night on the 'Romance Package'. From the moment we walked through the door until we left we found the Ritz to be magical. The Reception staff were courteous, polite and friendly. The room as requested looked over Green Park so we saw the sun rise and set. The room was elegant and quiet. The dinner experience in one of the most magnificant settings was delightful.Yes, we did have a few hiccups which when the management were informed of were dealt with promptly.The doorman remembered our names three times - that is very impressive and we can't wait to return!	
Oct 30 2007 	JUST RIGHT.	I love hotels like Hotel de Paris MC, Plaza Athene, Oriental, ect. Before going to stay in Ritz London, was reading those comments here on Trip adv. I think people who are not top class in behaviour may get that&quot;horrible service&quot; as they called it here. Some negative comments also were written by americans. I love US, and I love americans, and for me personally, if american men are loud, I do not mind. I like their accent, jokes, and all. But in this hotel they have to obey the rules of the house. I saw some loud britsh ladies wanting to go to Rivoli bar, sure they deserve no supprt to go there, from staff. OTHERVISE -If staff will be very very nice to all, we will see lobby full of loud people , coming to see the hotel and drink beer in the restaurant. Or in Ritz Club we would see crowd which is not belonging there for the reason, that they do not know how to handle themselves. Ritz Club was nice. Few people only, fantastic. The only way not to have average crowd in Ritz is to make them feel unwanted. Imagine- What will happen if anybody who has 20 pounds for a drink would come and sit in the bar of Ritz?? The service, was so perfect in Ritz, absolutely awesome. Staff top professional, and if they wouldnt have that strict attitude towards beople who do not deserve to be there, the Ritz would never be so GREAT. Maybe its not according to service rules, but that is the only way. Tips- do not think to stay there if you travel economy class- it is not for you and you will not like it. Even business class travelers may not like it. Its for First class passengers- all is the way the like.Do not stay if you are not elegant, top educated person.Do not stay if your female companion is much younger, nobody will take you serious and in thoughts wont respect. Do not stay there with diff girlfriends, its not class. Staff is so perfect, they will remember you, your name, details how you like things. And staff have 'scanner inbuilt in their brain' they are TOP experts in identifying who you are, from where and why.All the best for RITZ. Keep it the same, its perfect.Miss. S. 35, lith.	
Oct 28 2007 	Elegant	The Ritz London is the most elegant and relaxing hotel i have ever stayed in .From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. The reception staff were curteous and helpful and we were upgraded at no extra charge to a mini suite on the sixth floor which was beautiful. There were so many little touches to make you feel special, like a knock at the door after we had returned from shopping...they had sent up a little tray of mini cakes...no charge! we also had an invitation to look at their jewelery,which we accepted,it was a lovely experience,we were given a free glass of champagne and we just wandered around looking at the pretty baubles! Breakfast was amazing..it has to be the prettiest dining room ever,the staff were lovely and attentive. we opted for eggs benedict and kedgeree.... as u can get a nice cooked breakfast anywhere...im glad we did, they were delicious. Upon leaving the dining room we noticed the new private dining rooms and went to have a little nosy round...we were met by Alex...a very nice gentleman...who gave us a little tour and told us all about the rooms...he then chatted with us about the hotel and its history etc. I cant really understand why some people find it a stuffy or snobish place it certainly isnt... it just has old fashioned standards which is,sadly, a rare thing...i think the hotel and the staff make an effort for you...so we should make an effort for the hotel to look presentable...it keeps its sense of occasion then.	
Oct 24 2007 	Fantastic Hotel	We wanted somewhere special to celebrate my somewhat special birthdy, we chose The Ritz and were so glad that we did.From the moment we arrived and our car was valet parked we were treated special, the Receptionist and Porters were polite and friendly (and not in the slightest bit snooty - which I thought they might be).The room was fantastic and overlooked St James park. There were flowers, champagne and a birthday card in our room, which was lovely.We had afternoon tea when we arrived which too was excellent, again service was fantastic and food was replenished if you wanted.We had a meal in the restaurant in the evening, again fantastic with excellent service as was breakfast the next morning.Would highly recommend this hotel especially for a special occassion, it is expensive but worth every penny.Can't wait for my next Birthday as it has to be worth another visit.	
Oct 24 2007 	Over the top	Probably the most upscale hotel I've ever stayed at. It's very nice and thank the lord we were there on business because I doubt we could afford it otherwise. The bar is very nice to have a nightcap. Had room service one night...5 star food. A little too much for a guy whose wardrobe is pretty much relegated to jeans and t-shirts.	
Oct 21 2007	Afternooon Tea at the Ritz	At 37 pounds for afternoon tea this experience was ordinary and memorable for all the worng reasons in every way. The service was surly. The tea served in tea pots that leaked (notwithstanding which way you held the pot). The scones were dry, the jam ordinary, the sandwiches mass produced. The time we were allowed to dine was limited and all in all it was a mass produced experience. I have had better (and much cheaper) afternoon tea experiences in rural Australia for 1/10 of the price. Save your money for other experiences.	
Oct 17 2007 	American travelers will be sorry they booked	We stayed here twice on the way to and from Paris, and on both occasions the check in clerk insisted we upgrade our room &quot;at a small supplement&quot; starting at double the rate we booked and gradually working down until we finally relented. The automatic upgrade from American Express Platinum is never available.We understood there was a dress code, but didn't understand this included all the public areas including what ammounted to the lobby, bar, and any venue where any food or drink might beobtained. Many aspects were worn, especially the plumbing fixtures. The &quot;regular&quot; rooms are extremely tiny and quite plain but not cheap. It was all an expensive hustle.	
Oct 2 2007 	Exceeded Expectations	After reading some of the reviews here we were a little apprehensive,but if we had known what we know now we would have looked forward to our stay more. Arrival was great, swift check in and shown to our room by a very nice lady. The room was the cheapest but I think we got the best in that category, very big, beautiful decor, including marble fireplace, large windows overlooking Picadilly and we did get a large dressing table with lots of mirrors. Lots of ice in the mini-bar and bottles of water free. All the staff VERY pleasant, smiles all round etc. Hotel very clean and well maintained. Even the corridors were palatial! Dining room an absolute dream, we had breakfast there 3 mornings, waiters very efficient and attentive. Worth the money just to sit in there for an hour. We had afternoon tea in the Palm Court, excellent and as much as you could eat and thesurroundings beautful (the web site does tell you you have book well in adance so please don't complain if you cannot get in). We had a couple of drinks in the gallery which cost OTT but worth it just for the surroundings. We did the tour of Buck Palace but preferred The Ritz, can understand why the Royals have their &quot;do&quot;s there! I do wish people who complain about having to wear a jacket and tie would read the dress code for the Ritz then they wouldn't be surprised when told they were not dressed appropriatelyy. We were really spoilt, wouldn't consider staying else in London if we could get the same rate again, much less expensive than the Dorchester or Claridgesif you go for the weekend. If I could give this review more than 5 stars I would. Location is perfect, perfect for Green Park tube and walks down Piccadilly and Regent St. We were also blessed by perfect weather, warm and sunny. Oh and our air conditioning was excellent. We were in room 412.	
Sep 28 2007 	Overrated	Stayed for one night in conjunction with Orient Express train dinner. Had high expectations which were in general met, but with some disappointments.On checking in at around 2pm we wanted a light lunch and thought &quot;tea at the Ritz &quot; might fit the bill - were told that we could go in for tea no problem. However, on checking at the tea room, we were told that tea at the Ritz is fully boked 4-6 weeks in advance so we had no chance, so we went into the Rivoli Bar instead. (I would have thought that guests at the Ritz should be able to &quot;take tea at the Ritz&quot; without having to make a booking in advance - it seems that tourists are more important than guests).On ordering a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc we were brought a bottle of chablis (more expensive), so we sent it back. When our food order was brought the steak baps had turned into the &quot;proper&quot; steak (more expensive). We didn't say anything about this as it had taken a while to come anyway, and looked ok.After returning from our dinner on the train we again went to the Rivoli Bar for a nightcap - ordered glasses of Sauvignon Blanc and again were brought Chablis. Second order, &quot;more Sauvinon blanc please&quot; - again they brought Chablis. Either they don't listen, or they are trying it on - neither scenario is acceptable in a hotel where you pay such high prices. Dress code is fine, because I think it's nice that gentlemen must dress up etc, but when it is hot in the bar and my husband tried to take his jacket off and a waiter immediately rushed over to tell him he must keep his jacket on I thought that was a bit much, considering some ladies were there with strapless dresses etc. He had a bow tie on and full dress shirt etc, so would not be offending anybody!Room was fine, although we had no view whatsoever, just looked out over a roof full of aircon units. And I thought that the hairdryer was really naff for such a &quot;high calibre&quot; hotel - just one of those plastic tube things on the wall. (We had been offered a &quot;proper&quot; hairdryer when we were shown to our room and we said yes please, but this never materialised - but there would have been nowhere in the bedroom to use this properly anyway as no proper dressing table or mirror). And the room was unbearably stuffy, and you came out the bathroom more sweaty than before your shower.Overall a lovely atmospheric hotel but ridiculous prices and bad service. When you pay such high prices you should expect to have convenience and good service thrown in, but this just didn't happen.	
Sep 7 2007 	English Elegance at its best - except the breakfast	The Ritz is very much an institution, unlike other grand hotels, such as the Dorchester and the Savoy, the decor and ambiance at The Ritz hasn't changed in years and yet it is still lovely. This was my second stay here on business and I do like it very much.They do like a certain type of guest though - the dress code is very strict (unless you are a famous rock star who checked in wearing jeans and nobody batted an eyelid - Joe public would have been shown the door). You also feel very safe as they do keep a constant check on who enters the hotel. However I did return late one evening and waited for the porter to come and open the door to let me in. Not good when you are paying the prices they charge. The service is efficient but not stuffy and , as one would expect , the hotel is clean and well maintained. It is getting a little tired in places and the rooms are luxurious but the furnishings could be more comfortable. I stayed in a junior suite and both the bed and sofa's were hard .The hairdryer in my room was terrible. I called room service and they changed it for another but it was still rather cheap and not very efficient. Dinner in the restaurant is excellent but breakfast is not at all good. I have had better breakfasts in seaside three star hotels. One morning my &quot;organic back bacon&quot; was ordinary streaky. The toast was cold and the service poor. My advice to anyone staying at the Ritz would be have breakfast next door at The Wolsely.The Ritz is a lovely hotel, ideal for a romantic break or special occassion, the clientelle is very cosmopolitan but chic (the Dorchester is full of gentlemen from the middle east and I wouldn't recommend it to women staying on (legitimate) business) . However for the prices they charge they really do need to improve their breakfasts. You cannot compare the two hotels but for service and comfort I would choose Sofitel St James over The Ritz and it is also considerably less expensive. However for a sheer sense of occassion their is nowhere in London to bet The Ritz.	
Jul 16 2007 	Mediocre breakfast - such a disappointment.	The reception staff and concierge were wonderfully friendly and so helpful, however that cannot be said about the breakfast waiters, who were indifferent and remote; maybe because most of the guests at breakfast were business clientelle and not visitors to London. After an extremely warm welcome from the breakfast manageress, waiters neither smiled, nor directed our party to the buffet, which was extremely disappointing. I was expecting so much from the Ritz and cold, thin, indifferent toast, was pathetic. The cold buffet had the usual fruits, cereals and cold meats, with pre cut soda bread on the side. Avoid this - just a waste of time and money - instead find a Carluccio's for a taste sensation of a breakfast. Bedrooms were as usual delightful, although towelling robes and towels were rather thredbare and rough. But remember, don't expect too many extras at the Ritz - it's all about profit: no chocolates, or nibbles, just a bottle of Duchy water at bedtime. No wonder Camilla had her birthday at the Ritz, they sell her husband's products!	
Jul 4 2007 	Fabulous Ritz London	We were expecting something special &amp; we were not dissapointed. Staff were very friendly &amp; helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was a deluxe king, very comfortable &amp; large. Over stuffed lounges, lots of pillows on bed, fluffy towels &amp; nice amenties in bathroom. Breakfast was included in package &amp; served in the very beautiful restaurant. Afternoon tea was something special. An expensive treat to stay there but worth every $.	
Jun 10 2007	an immeasurable remembrance	By valerie arena &amp; nancy gracie Over 100 years ago when Cesar Ritz said to his staff, Never say no when a client asks for something, even if it is the moon, he was not kidding. Yesterday, I checked out of THE RITZ in London, England, after an 8 day holiday . Coming from hot, humid, southeast Florida, I anticipated awakening at about 9AM daily, walking over to my open window, inviting the brisk cool London air to embrace me. Then, tally ho! to the physical fitness center for a work out on a virtual bicycle. For me, exercise is a humdrum routine. Joyously awaiting a stationary bike that included a visual, mind-trip was an exciting alternative to using the plain ol stationary bike in the physical fitness center where I live in Coconut Creek. Alas, on the third day, the physical fitness center was no longer available. When I expressed my gentle woes to the Concierge Staff, Tony and Paul immediately replied, Would you like us to move the bicycle to your room? Amazed. Elated. Surprised was I. Then, I recalled Cesar Ritzeven if it is the moon. The word RITZ has become synonymous with elegance, luxury and probably a host of other corresponding equivalents in Rogets Thesaurus. I bet Cesar never imagined that his family name would be an adjective, RITZY! Or that 22 years after his death Vera Lynn would sing There were Angels dining at The Ritz and a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square . After Miss Lynns performance, Glenn Miller, Nat King Cole, Bobby Darin, Harry Connick Jr. and Tony Bennet performed this Maschwitz/Sherwin song with lovely lyrics of winding streets in Mayfair, enchantment and magic in the air.There have been many thoughts, sensations and expectations, I have never imagined within the framework of my life. . . like staying at THE RITZ. The semantics of this perception were not even a notion or an impression. I became the fortunate recipient of a former students generosity, Desiree Asher, an exemplary student on my Debate Team during the mid-90s. She presented me with this opportunity, and the experience to write about one of the most aesthetically beautiful vacations that I have ever had. As a &quot;so-far&quot;,( I will start reading THE SECRET soon so who knows,LOL), solid constituent of the middle class, I would not have had this opportunity without her generosity. On the last day of March, this ladies vacation began in the immortal, resilient, colossal city of London. The four of us, Desiree, Judith,[Desiree's Mom], Nancy, and I, arrived at Heathrow Airport from Miami, Florida, where a car was awaited to drive us to the majestic Mayfair section of London. Pulling up to the entrance, our weary faces were greeted by Michael, the doormans warm, glowing, smile and his grand good morning at an unkind time of the early morning. Brilliant, we are really here, at THE RITZ, in my favorite city. We did not have to wait very long for room 506. Upon opening the door, Nancy and I felt like Princesses or Ladies or Dames. Well, lets face it. We shared the proximity of Green Park with Queen Elizabeth. She was at her home in Buckingham Palace. We were at THE RITZ. Entering the room, located on the 5th floor, overlooking the St. James/Piccadilly Area, we walked through a hallway filled with exuberant closet space and a mini bar. Three very large windows monopolized and brightened the ivory-colored room featuring gold trim, with beige curtains adorned in fern green and persimmon roses. Ample lighting was provided by sconces around the beds and the marble mantel of the fireplace. In the center was a crystal chandelier with swags and drops, and several Victorian lamps were placed throughout the room. Louis the XVI furniture provided us with comfort and a well-framed picture of Fragonards painting, Les Hazards Heuereux de LEscarpolette was above the desk. In diametrical opposition with all this period décor, was the modern flat screen TV. In relationship to the rest of the room, the flat screen seemed like a mechanism out of science fiction. The bathroom was spacious and extremely clean &amp; modern. Twice a day, the maids freshened the room and refurbished the bathrrom with Floris products, a true representation of the local color. The first Floris shop was established right down the street from THE RITZ on Jermyn Street in the elegant St. James quarter in 1730 by Juan Floris. The first Royal Warrant granted to J.Floris Ltd was in 1820 to King George IV . Ever since , Floris has always held at least one Royal Warrant, and today holds two: Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince of Wales. So, one would shower or bathe, wrap oneself in a towel from the warmed- towel rack and slip into a comfortable, soft, robe and slippers. A variety of pillows were available and we chose a pillow gently infused with the scent of lavender to induce a calm sleeping experience. The perfect nights sleep was a very positive feature of THE RITZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.One not only felt safe and snug within ones bedroom. Safety was of paramount importance throughout THE RITZ. The security staff maintains 12 very astute, intense, yet charming individuals who learned names within hours. My initial conversations were with Nigel and Chris. I enjoyed greeting them daily and definitely felt secure. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to meet and talk with Barry Gendron, the security supervisor. Mr. Gendron was raised in the Seychells, one of 6 children, and when he came to London, he became a part of the New Scotland Yard. For the past 11 years he has worked at THE RITZ. This handsome gentleman spoke quite eloquently, like an interesting college professor, about his position in a place which upheld tradition, interacted with the community, and enjoyed fantasy and an exquisite form of life. He stressed the fact that his staff was approachable, friendly, flexible, and created collectively to achieve an atmosphere of safety and satisfaction. With benevolent warmth, Mr. Gendron exclaimed, nothing is impossible at THE RITZ. Again a reflection of Cesars Never say noeven if its the moon.In all honesty, we believed the breakfast food could have been more delectable. One morning I had eggs benedict and the lemon flavor of the hollandaise sauce was hardly noticeable. That same morning the bread basket, for 9 pounds, was hard and stale. However, Nancys porridge was fantastic and the tea was extremely tasty. We never had dinner since the prices on the menu were out of our middle class range. Dinner for two would have cost about 130 pounds without wine. But the Rivoli bar was beautiful with soft lights, comfortable seating, great service and delicious wine for 9 pounds a glass. Well worth it, just to relax in this awesome room.Although Desiree visited London once, briefly, it was Judiths first trip. Our first walk was down Piccadilly,a right turn from the hotel, toward Piccadilly Circus. We passed the famous Fortnum &amp; Mason, a grand store offering specialty products such as fine tea, perfume, an assortment of exotic foods ,such as cognac butter, my favorite, hampers ,which are RITZY picnic baskets, and two restaurants. It is truly a mecca of opulent splendor. The next block featured the Burlington Arcade, an area dominated by luxurious shops, the Royal Arcade, a museum with palladium architecture, and the arts &amp; crafts show at St. James Church which is held a few days a week. Suddenly, within minutes, we were at the junction of five busy streets, and the famous London Landmark Piccadilly Circus with Eros at the top of the fountain with bow and arrow in hand. Then, a right turn down Regent St. to the Mall ,a left turn to Londons Trafalgar Square which is famous for a variety of sculptures, especially the lions, fountains, and an enormous population of pigeons. The pigeons are not sculptures. They live,breathe, and wait for an opportunity to catch someones snack disposal. This Square is surrounded by my favorite museum, the National Gallery, St. Martin of the Fields Church, which holds 20 services a week, and has a café in its crypt, eerie, and a series of streets leading to a plethora of other great landmarks. We stood in the center of the Square, smiling, enjoying the temperate whether, a contrast to our enervating heat at home, and said,This is beautiful London! and carefully selected the street leading to Covent Garden, the Strand, for shopping ! But, its not just about shopping. Covent Garden is a happy ,happy, location highlighting a variety of performers. We always return to the Crusting Pipe Wine Bar,on the lower ground floor of the Market,sit outside with our wine,hot chocolate, tea, or coffee, and listen to classical musicians play Vivaldi,Mozart, Beethoven, Ravel, etc. Finis! Enough for one day.During the 8 days we visited museums, Harrods, Oxford Street, Harrods, ate pub food, Harrods, and saw 3 plays, Women in Black, Billy Elliot, and Equus. I was determined and fixated upon seeing Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe in his first adult roleand there were several minutes where his adulthood was quite evident. LOL. Desiree and Judith loved to eat at Shepherds Market and this area seems to be a secret since so few people seem to know about it. Upon leaving THE RITZ, one makes a left, walks in the opposite direction of Fortnum &amp; Mason, and looks for White Horse Street, opposite Green Park and 5 streets away from THE RITZ. This cozy area in the heart of Mayfair is like a village featuring narrow streets and alleyways. There are a variety of restaurants and they are all intimate ,snug, and comfy. Desiree and Judith would know this best because out of 8 evenings,they ate there 4 times!!! Another place we enjoyed was Ben Crouchs Tavern located on Wells Street, Fitzrovia section, not far from Oxford Circus area. This gothic-themed tavern included a genre of grotesque art such as the devil himself, gargoyles, cackling toilets, plates with spiders painted on them, coffin-shaped bowls, and the famous seven sins cocktail.I could go on and on ad infinitum about London. This city is the veritable love of my life. The opportunity to spend 8 nights at THE RITZ was truly fantastic. If you have the monetary means, I would highly recommend this awesome 5 star 101 year old landmark at 150 Piccadilly. In 2004, the English Speaking Union awarded me a scholarship to study for 3 weeks at THE GLOBE in London. If there was a scholarship to study at THE RITZ, even though I had to shed my cherished blue jeans and tennis shoes to sit in the beautiful Rivoli Bar, I would apply for that scholarship with wholehearted effort. Desiree Asher, my dear, eloquent, debater from the mid 90s, gave me an immeasurable gifta luxurious, aesthetic experience that will forever reside in the reservoir of my heart...an unforgettable,boundless,	
Apr 28 2007 	could get a taste for this	I'd booked tea at the Ritz with my family for my 40th birthday (having been before and enjoyed it) and since I had to stay the night in London, thought 'why not?'. I paid £370 for a double room to ensure a double bed (why do hotels think people would be happy to pay to sleep in a single bed after the age of 10?). When I rang confirm the day before I did tell them it was a birthday treat. Having read reviews on this site I was a bit worried that I'd be slightly looked down on, but that wasn't the case at all. I'm not really a five star girl, so the experience of having my luggage whisked away to be delivered to my room before I was through the door so that I entered and checked in unencumbered was lovely. The reception staff were genuinely welcoming, seemed to be expecting me, knew it was my birthday, and had upgraded me to a junior executive (£470 on the tarrif). Only comments would be that I like the old style charm of the lobby, and reception itself feels a bit modern and tacked on in a corner, and the outrageous pre-authorisation of £150 on your credit card. The woman who checked me in then took me up to the room herself and seemed genuinely pleased to be helping me to enjoy my treat. When I asked whether I could only get a cup of tea from room service, she offered to arrange it and it arrived very quickly.There are 'Ritz colours' so I think all the rooms are shades of gold, pink and blue, but it was lovely, really spacious, spotlessly clean and my room was not at all shabby as someone else had commented. The bathroom was a frenzy of marble and gold taps with the most hideous pair of scales in it (why?) but the water pressure was great and the bath really deep. I was on the sixth floor and, while I'd have preferred to be able to open a window, the soundproofing was excellent.I'd prefer to be able to make my own cup of tea rather than pay £5 for room service, but it is beautifully served and you get endless cups of tea from the pot. If you don't like strong tea ask for something lighter than the standard blend, which is frighteningly strong!Breakfast was in the lovely dining room (the view of scaffolding wasn't really their fault!) and I found the service constant without being intrusive. You could spend hours working your way through the offerings. One other observation is that it doesn't feel hideously touristy. It's full of people who are either rich or there for a treat, but in a very civilised way.When I checked out I was intending to ask them to store my bag because I was coming back later for tea, but they offered to store it for the day without me having to ask. When I did finally leave, it was again brought straight out to the taxi. I could get a taste for never having to handle my own luggage! My family were blatantly tourists there for tea, but the doorman was charming to them as well in calling us two taxis.Overall, it really was worth it to stay there once. It's marked down to 4 because I'd locked the door to have a bath and as a result didn't get the turn down service (although I did get a card under the door explaining why), the scaffolding, and because if you're the Ritz and charging huge prizes, the service should be this good. But for a slightly glitzy old style treat, it was great.	
Apr 21 2007	Was expecting better	My husband and i stayed for one night and on the whole expected much better. The room was okay was surprised to see it looking a little worn in places and this was an exective double room , no tea or coffee making facilities in the room either ,afternoon tea was okay seemed a bit rushed at times, breakfast was much better felt very relaxed in lovely surroundings. I do wounder if the RITZ is living on its name at times. We spent the next 2 night s of our holiday at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington which was superb ,the RITZ could learn so much from this hotel.	
Mar 29 2007 	Great stay at the Ritz	I stayed at the Ritz for 5 days in March. This was an impromptu leisure trip and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I did not find the staff to be at all stuffy. I did enjoy the champagne tea at the Palm restaurant which was very enjoyable. The scones were excellent and the service immaculate. I received breakfast in my room each morning and it was always perfect and delivered at the requested times. My room was small but well appointed. I admit it would have nice to break out the jeans for a nice walking trip around the city, but for 5 days I managed just fine without them.I contacted the concierge prior to my stay to arrange a few key points of my itinerary- all of which were done to perfection including 4th row seats to Wicked and roundtrip airport transfers.All in all a great stay. I would definitely return without hesitation.	
Mar 27 2007 	good experience on the whole	after a long, transatlantic flight, we didn't appreciate being agressively solicited by the check in manager to upgrade our room for a price. he tried to pressure us (twice) into upgrading upon arrival check in for additional money - we thought this very tacky. we declined to pay extra for a room upgrade, but our originally booked junior suite was lovely. afternoon tea was good, but a bit disapointing based on the cost. the finger sandwiches had no flavor, but they looked pretty. afternoon tea for 2 cost $200...	
Mar 22 2007 	Luxurious and Surprisingly Child-Friendly	We are a family of 3, two adults and a 5 year old girl, who spent a full 7 days, staying in a junior suite at The Ritz. We miss The Ritz already, but who wouldnt?When we travel, we try to be polite wherever we go but nonetheless, we are American tourists and when out of the states, its safe to assume people judge us based on that fact. That said, at the Ritz, we were treated with genuine warmth. The porters learned our names, room numbers and seemed eager to help. Security is tight, so you know you are safe, but the security guards manage to be friendly and professional at the same time. I wanted to mention this because I noticed other people were sensitive. Please realize that the security is a plus and dont feel too self conscious. The porters are also extremely helpful and will fulfill any wish and get you any reservation you need. While we did call in advance, they secured a window table at Nobu pretty easily for my husband and myself.Our room was nice. By American standards, it was medium size, but it was luxuriously appointed. The bed was one of the most comfortable weve ever slept in and the pillows were fine too. Housekeeping had other varieties of pillows on hand, should one not be happy with the pillows given. My daughter was right at home in a pull out sofa-bed which was turned down every night by the housekeeper who would arrange her stuffed animals sweetly and leave her milk and cookies. They also had a bag of toys for her upon arrival.The room had a safe, and one of the brochures mentioned it was a good place to keep your gun. We didnt bring any guns, but it was a good place to store passports. There was a mini bar and a nice TV with plenty of channels. There was also a never ending supply of fresh fruit brought to the room by a nice man who got to know our preferences. He noticed we liked grapes and would bring extra. There was another person who came specifically to water the orchid. There were actually lots of people stopping in from time to time, but you also had the option of putting up the Do Not Disturb sign. What I missed was an in-room coffee pot and an iron. I can see The Ritzs reason for not having those things, when room service is perfectly willing to bring you a pot of coffee every morning for a no-so-small fee, but I prefer making my own and having it right away. Also, an iron would have been nice for touching up outfits. I think perhaps most Ritz guests arent accustomed to doing any ironing whatsoever, so The Ritz offers a speedy yet pricey pressing and cleaning service. The Ritz also has a nice bar called The Rivoli. It is a quiet, cozy place and I noticed both couples and solitary business people reading and eating alone. There is a full menu and wonderful selection of drinks.The Green Park Underground is steps from the hotel, so you are steps away from almost any location in London via the tube. The location can't be beat.It's definitely old-world luxury and far from being trendy or hip, but when you are in a city such as London were everything is trendy, it's nice to have a quiet oasis such as The Ritz.	
Mar 20 2007 	A five star experience	I needed a special treat to lift my spirits so decided on a concert in London and a night at the Ritz. I like to stay in good hotels, but I hoped the Ritz would be something special. I had a wonderful experience.The staff are welcoming, polite and friendly. On arrival I was relieved of my luggage and the receptionist took me to my room after check in without any delays. The Piccadilly King room was large by London standards and beautifully furnished and decorated (see photos). I had a drink in the bar and ordered afternoon tea in my room. Room service was prompt (they ring a bell rather than knock the door!). A little mean on the sandwiches, but generous with scones, cakes and pastries, all very good.The price of the mini-bar, room service and meals is expensive, but not out of order for a top central London hotel. The turn down service is excellent and included topping up toiletries (Floris) and replacing towels. I drink a lot of water and was glad to see a large bottle of drinking water placed by the bed.If you dont like the pillows you can call housekeeping and choose from a selection of five other types. I slept very well, the bed was comfortable and the linen excellent.I took a cooked breakfast in the beautiful dining room. The food was good and there is an extensive buffet. Service was impeccable throughout my short stay.Nothing is perfect and if I were forced to be picky I would say the bathroom was small and the rather gaudy 'gold' bathroom fittings are definitely not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. What is it with London hotels and plumbing?The Ritz is, of course, extremely expensive, but you have to take it on it's own terms. This is a hotel with staff in Edwardian uniforms and a dress code for guests. If you want laid back luxury look elsewhere. I had a wonderful stay and would love to go again some day. Until then I will be boring everyone to death with stories of the night I stayed at the Ritz.	
Mar 8 2007	Putting down the Ritz	No mistake this is an elegant hotel, a bit of Paris plunked down in Mayfair. The decor was magnificent, both in the public rooms and in our room itself. On the other hand, our room was volcanicly hot when we arrived, and overall we felt completely ignored, and hardly experienced the attentive service that the astronomical prices should require. I had to track down someone to take our drink order at the bar, and the two pound coins in change (from a twenty pound note) have been made into cufflinks--a cautionary memento of a stay that is memorable precisely because it failed to be so, but should have been.	
Mar 8 2007	Afternoon tea at the Ritz	We went as a family of 6 for afternoon tea at the famous Palm court restaurant in the Ritz. We chose the last sitting of 7.30pm so we won't fall foul of the congestion charge and parking nearby should be available as meter bays are free around that time.We found parking across the road from the hotel along the side of Green park underground station.We were welcomed at the door by 2 doormen who politely directed us to the Palm court restaurant and wished us an enjoyable time. All the grandeur of the hotel and it's history was there to be seen in the decor and furnishings. We were welcomed once again at the steps of the restaurant opposite the live musicians and offered a glass of champagne while shown to our table. Another waiter came and placed the napkins on our laps followed by another asking us what type of teas we'd like.We all chose different ones and promptly got them in bright silver teapots(all the cutlery was silver).Again the tea was poured for us and this was followed by 2 three tiered silver stands loaded up with assorted sandwiches at the bottom,scones and sliced fruit cake in the middle tier and petit fours and pastries on the top tier.The silver pots of jam and clotted cream were already there and were indeed delicious! We were regularly asked if everything was ok and if we needed anymore of anything which we did and were promptly replenished with more food. I did ask for a stronger flavour of tea and got 2 different teas to try in it's own teapot and not just a cuppa, I was also told that they'll keep changing it until I was satisfied! One of the waiter asks in passing if we were celebrating anything special and I amongst others there obviously were, most were celebrating birthdays and anniversaries. We all got a momento presented by the waiters...a small cake with a candle for birthdays and a long stemmed rose in a Ritz wrapped presentation box for those celebrating anniversaries like us.This was presented accompanied by the live musicians playing the appropriate tunes followed by a round of applause by all. We would go again as the service and the unlimited amount of good food/tea offered, topped with the grand surroundings of the world famous Ritz hotel was an experience to be enjoyed. It's certainly an experience worth trying once, finances permitting of course. You can ask the waiters to take a photo of you as a momento and they certainly seem happy to do so. I took a lot of family pics and therefore haven't got any to show/share apart from the ones taken by my daughters of the &quot;ladies powder room&quot; !!!!! Gives you an idea of what the rest of the hotel might be like!!!Hope you have a good time too.	
Mar 3 2007 	not from this time anymore	A hotel that take the liberty to tell their guests what to wear and not to wear should at least be able to provide something extraordinary itself.The Ritz does totally not live up to that. E-mails with requests for transfers were never answered (ending up taking a taxi). The rooms are ok, but the black TV put into the room just to have a TV is the most ugly scene in a hotel room. Absolutely no style.Food quality is just OK but also never impresses.All in all is the Ritz very 80s and perhaps 90s but certainly not up to the standards and atmosphere of the 21st century.	
Feb 25 2007	not the best	Stayed at the Ritz in Feb .The room was great overlooking the Park and much of what you need for a short stay is in there but the central heating didn't work and it was cold. By the time we realised this it was quite late as we had been to the theatre.If you just want to stay in your room its fine but there is a dress code and one is not allowed to walk past the foyer in jeans. We were waiting to meet up with someone and asked to sit in the small foyer that is not at all comfortable. The breakfast was of a poor standard and the coffee cold and terrible, we did ask for hot milk but didn't get it. I think for the money we paid we could of found a better and friendlier hotel with better service but maybe not such a nice room.	
Feb 25 2007 	We had a lovely time anyway	We were coming to London to visit Hatton Garden to buy a special ring so I thought it would be good to buy the &quot;romance package&quot; directly from the Ritz On arrival we checked in and we were told they had given us an upgrade. That is great. We were taken to our room. All staff were super.The room was lovely and champagne and flowers were awaiting as requested. Sadly the room was above their main extractor fan. If the owners wifes had booked this as a treat for their men and were put in this room for a &quot;romantic package&quot; they would be so ashamed of their hotelI phoned to ask if we could move rooms - which they did asap. Again the face to face staff were great. ( if anyone from the Ritz takes the trouble to read this - she is a small, slim, blonde lady ) The next room was the basic grade of room which I had booked. It was just perfect. Unfortunately we had to wait 3/4 hour for the champagne and then had to ring room service. Really not good. The flowers never arrived. No turn back service happened either. This was very disappointing as I wanted my partner to enjoy these things as a way of thanking him and for it to add to our special evening. I rang to let the reception to know. They said the manager would ring in the morning. He didn't. That made me a little crossService in the restaurant was fantastic. One of the leading staff in the bar needs sending to a &quot;middle east&quot; style hotels for training. Nowhere have I seen such rudeness. I heard him talking about each male clients in a loud voice as they walked away. This is so unacceptableI loved the breakfast and the service was again wonderful. The dining room looks even more beautiful in the morning. It is worth going if only for that. All the public areas are beautifulOn the whole a little disppointing because of the lack of careJennysheepdog	
Feb 11 2007	Afternoon Tea.	We were staying at the nearby Chesterfield Hotel (excellent) butmy son had booked us afternoon tea at the Ritz to celebrate our40th wedding anniversary.We attended the 1330hrs session.It was a wonderful experience, tea was served in a lovely room to the sounds of an accompanying harpist, a nice romantic setting.Tha service was of a very high standard and the food was delicious.There is no limit on the amount you can eat, as the waiters keep returning and offering more. The decor and ambiance made this an unforgettable experience,if you get the chance don't miss it.	
Jan 10 2007 	truly exquisite hotel	Beautiful hotel in the piccadilly circus. a few blocks from buckingham palace. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. Booked an excellent mercedes limo service for ride to the airport. Even the niht porter at 1 am was very nice. The restaurant and the rest of the hotel were breathtaking. Our room was the bed and breakfast basic package and our room was amazing and breakfast was delicious. I would definatley reccommend this place. It is a bit pricey though but you get what you pay for here!	
Jan 9 2007 	Always a perfect stay	Having stayed at the Ritz London over 5 times, we have never failed to be truly impressed by this magnificent hotel. We always book through the the American Express Platinum Card Travel Service and thus always accorded the upgrade and all the usual amenities. We especially enjoy the Junior Suites, which all feature a very spacious bathroom. Service is second to none and we truly appreciate the staffs' attentiveness and friendliness. Everyone delivered meticulous service without any of the stuffiness. The public areas of the hotel are very beautiful and we would never hesitate to return again and again when our travel brings us back to London. Expect to pay dearly, needless to say, but it is worth every penny.	
Jan 1 2007	Restaurant was Truly Excellent	We didn't stay overnight but had dinner in the restaurant and I'm not sure where else to review it on this site. The Restaurant was Truly Excellent and the meal was memorable. The 5 piece band was also a delight. If you have high expectations, they will be met. The 65 pound prixe fix 4 course menu was good value.	
Dec 23 2006 	Service could be better	I checked in at 10am &amp; was expecting to leave my luggage &amp; check-in later but the receptionist told me that the room was ready. She accompanied me &amp; informed me that due to a problem with the boiler there would be no hot water for a couple of hours. This didn't bother me as I was going straight out but I can imagine other guests disapproval when they got up to shower &amp; found only cold water. The room was beautiful as you would expect, there was a fruit bowl with Mandarin oranges, figs &amp; dates &amp; an invitation for a glass of champagne at the Ritz Jewellery shop.The bathroom is a mixture of pink &amp; white marble &amp; the robes &amp; towels are very luxurious.Now comes the negative part. For dinner the restaurant was full so the only other option was a restaurant outside or the bar I decided on the bar. It was very full but the barman said that a table would become available soon I ordered a Negroni and after about half an hour a table became free at the smoking section which wasn't very good but I didn't want to wait any longer. I was given the menu &amp; after about 15 minutes I asked the girl if I could order, she said &quot;Just a minute&quot; &amp; never came back. I then asked another waiter &amp; he said the same &amp; didn't come back either so after eating all the crisps &amp; nuts I left. The waiter that had originally showed me to the table asked if I had enjoyed my dinner I told him noone came to take my order, he said he couldn't believe it &amp; wanted me to return to the bar but I told him I had another appointment.I got the impression that there was actually too many staff in the bar, it's very small but there were at least 6 people &amp; they were all chatting to each other instead of looking after the guests. Anyway this was the only negative point of my stay &amp; I will probably return again mainly because of the lovely rooms &amp; the location.	
Dec 15 2006 	So So	My boyfriend had booked us a night in the Ritz as a treat for my 21st birthday. Needless to say i was looking forward to it for months!!When we arrived we were stopped by the doorman asking 'can i help you?' (3 other people walked in before us and not a word was said, although he may have questioned them before), when we said we had a reservation for the night he looked at us quite stragely and said 'welcome'. When we got to the check in, we were seen pretty quickly although i was amazed by what happened next!The receptionist asked for a credit card (normal i thought....), then said it was declined. We asked what she was trying to take from it, her answer was 'we need to take £150 from your credit card incase you put any charges to your room', my mouth almost hit the floor. Never before have i been to a hotel where they take so much money from your card. We protested that we were leaving in an hour or so to have a meal away from the hotel and wouldnt be back until late so there was no way we could bill that much to our room. There was no pursuading her so we asked if they took switch cards, she replied 'no, it has to be a credit card'. In the end we had to pay £150 in cash, which was just ridiculous. She also tried to offer us a different room 'I know you asked for a city view but i thought you might prefer a (more expensive) view of green park', why would we ask for a city view if we wanted to look at green park?! After 15 minutes of checking in, we were finally told to 'wait around the corner' and someone would take us to our room, so we did. After a few minutes someone did come and take us to our room, which i must say was beautiful! It was huge! After 10 minutes room service arrived with a chocolate birthday cake with a candle, which was delicious!The bed was comfy and the robes were nice, as were the slippers that joined them later in the night!All in all the check-in spoiled what was a lovely hotel. Most people here have payed at least £500 for their room, what makes them think we wouldnt pay for anything we ate!?I think if you stay here often, then maybe you wouldnt get the same treatment but for someone who just wants to stay here as a treat, i would honestly say you would be better to stay somewhere else.	
Dec 9 2006 	Expect to be treated like royalty	We stayed at the Ritz Hotel,London for three days. Though expect to pay premium rates, especially with the not so great exchange rate of the US dollar, the service was impeccable. Everyone was courteous and helpful. Our package included a full English breakfast and it was superb. Expect a bit of a wait to be seated at the restaurant on the weekend, as &quot;Non-guests&quot; eat there as well so we decided to have the breakfast sent to our room the following day. The rooms are very spacious and well appointed. Though I must say, having stayed at the Hotel Ritz in Paris, the latter's rooms are more meticulously decorated. As far as location, it can't be beat. Bond street is a mere 2 minute walk. Hyde Park is adjacent to it. The Green Park underground station is around the corner.For any exercise buffs staying at the hotel, the fitness room is quite small. I was surprised to learn that there is no pool. However, they can arrange for a guest to avail of a nearby health club if desired. All in all, The Ritz hotel lived up to its reputation. This year is especially memorable as the hotel is celebrating its 100th year. Try to stay there during the Christmas holidays, as the public areas are very festive and decorated. There is a massive Christmas tree in the lobby. It will be an unforgettable experience, indeed.	
Nov 24 2006 	Overrated so so service wouldn't return	We stayed at the Ritz after having stayed at some of London's other properties of the same caliber -- the Ritz is an utter disappointment. The concierge desk is always covered with papers and cluttered to the point that finding anything, much less giving a guest attention seemed impossible. The room was ok -- but just that - ok. The bathroom was very large, wonderful but with horrid amenities -- I don't think I've ever stayed in a luxury property with such paltry amenities. The &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door is routinely disregarded -- for jetlag travelers trying to catch a quick nap it was VERY annoying to be woken up 3 times. Twice, it was for services we had not ordered. One shining highlight was tea -- fabulous service, wonderful room and and exquisitly beautiful room. Breakfast in the main dining room however, was the other extreme. Terrible service -- 15 minutes for a cup of coffee -- a buffet that was depleted completely -- just awful. Would I stay here again? No way. I should have stuck with the Mandarin Oriental or the Savoy -- both far superior. Perhaps the most annoying thing about staying at the Ritz is the constant reminders - via email, letter under the door and verbally on check in about the dress code -- WE GOT IT ALREADY-- enough! It would be one thing if they were politely correcting someone offending the dress code -- Reading other reviews I can only surmise that the service levels at this property are very inconsistent. Nonetheless, spending 500 pounds a night on a room should mean that the quality of what you get is darn near flawless.	
Oct 7 2006 	Glad to be at the Ritz-London	My partner and I have just returned from a delightful stay (our second) at the Ritz-London. We spent five nights in very large Deluxe Room and were more than happy with the supurb accomodation and excellent service. The hotel is formal and traditional and they expect the guests to follow suit. With that in mind--we dressed for the occassion and found the staff to be welcoming and delightful. Never did anyone not say &quot;good morning&quot; or offer a smile--from the doorman to the waitstaff--everyone went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying our stay. The concierge desk, run the famous Michael De Cozar--was expecially gracious to us--and made us feel like VIP guests of the hotel. They even arranged for the house car to take us to the theatre one evening when cabs were scarce. The hotel just celebrated its 100 year anniversary--and has the royal warrent from HRH the Prince of Wales---If you are willing to leave the demin and casual clothing at home--the Ritz is an experince that is indeed fit for a king!	
Sep 22 2006 	Afternoon Tea at The Ritz	I would highly recommend this as a treat. Its worth every penny. I was a little apprehensive beforehand but as soon as we arrived at the hotel my husband and I were greeted with a smile and directed through to the Palm Court, yet again more smiles. To be honest I didn't expect the staff to be so friendly and polite after reading some of the reviews, but you are certainly made to feel extremely welcome and special.We went to the 1930 sitting and had a glass of champagne before the sandwiches, scones and pastries arrived and they were lovely, as soon as you had eaten 4 sandwiches they were replenished immediately. It was a perfect evening and one I shall always remember!	
Aug 20 2006 	i did my once in a lifetime...don't say for 2 nights	We stayed for one night with a weekend rate booking. the cost was 450 pounds with free breakfast. i have to say i was quite disappointed. the hotel has class but nothing special about it. the rooms also. i had expected a fantastic bed, but normal. it certainly did not feel like one of the best 5 star hotles in the world!the staff i think is too comfortable with people staying there just to spend money. breakfast was not very good, i have had much better in london.It was a good lesson, go to hotels that really want your business and get value for your pound.	
Aug 12 2006	Tea at the Ritz	I did not stay at this hotel but did have afternoon tea here. It was PERFECT. Everything was just wonderful from the food to the setting. If your idea of afternoon tea is being surrounded by gold fountains and a stained glass ceiling with extremely friendly waiters, then you should come here. It is an experience in itself and well worth the money.	
Aug 6 2006 	A Special Place for a Special Occasion	We stayed here for one night for my partners special birthday. We booked the romance package directly with the hotel and for what is included we felt it was a good deal. We arrived at about 1pm on the day as we were having afternoon tea in the Palm Court and i thought i would ask if our room was available. Didnt have too, they were well prepared and offered us the room immediatley. They did offer us an upgrade which we accepted and in hindsight i think would still have been given even if we had declined. The room was large, fronted onto Piccadily, yet no noise could be heard. We had flowers, fruit and champagne and chocolates all waiting for us. They even swap the champagne for a chilled bottle when you are ready to drink it. It was mid July and during the warm spell we had therefore we were thankful of the airconditioning which was efficient and quiet, as was the rest of the hotel. Didnt hear a sound all night. The evening meal was excellent and in beautful surrounding. A very special evening. The breakfast the following morning was the only very slight disapointment. Slow service and a very much laid back attitude compared to the night before. All in all we loved it and would recommend it. We have stayed in many 5* plus hotels including the Burj al Arab and the Ritz for one evening proved more expensive. Can one compare them.....	
Aug 3 2006	Lovely comfortable place to stay great location	We stayed at the Ritz and thoroughly enjoyed it. I read some of the other reviews and had a hard time undersanding things like the reviewers being &quot;looked at with suspect&quot;, or not giving a tip because of the &quot;way they were treated&quot;. I guess I didn't get a good picture or review from the reviewer exactly what that meant.We were treated wonderfully. Maybe staff were 'suspect' of us, but we sure didn't pick up on it. We often sat in the lobby waiting for friends, and as it was hot when we were there, often sat with friends chatting for a while. Once the staff knew we didn't want to order anything, they were absolutely fine and didn't bother us. We got to know the bellmen and doormen, and all were very friendly. They were especially kind to my kids, including my young son who 'dressed up' for them. The room was lovely, and we had tea there which we enjoyed. Great hotel, perfect location.	
Jul 26 2006 	Disappointing	We were treated to a one night package stay at the Ritz that included tickets to a musical. I was very excited about our stay and felt really disappointed with almost all of it. First when we arrived we were looked at with suspect by the guy opening the door and the reception staff. I am 22 and my partner is 20 but we were both dressed very smartly so didnt think we deserved to be treated as we were. Even when they knew we had a booking the reception staff rushed through booking us in compared to others around us. The guy who showed us our room was nice but we didnt give him a tip as we were so annoyed by how we were treated. The room was a little small and bland. Some of the decoration was breath taking and the bath was amazing (so were the robes).We did have to ring down twice to ask for our theater tickets to be brought up and when we left to go to thetheater and asked to have a taxi hailed the guy outside told us to go and stand at the top of the road and hail one ourselves (even tho he was hailing them for the older clientle).Dinner was included in our package and the dining room was amazing with a great band playing live. The food was ok tho as we were on a special set mean the portions were stupidly small. The decoration of the public areas are stunning. It was fantastic to come back to the room and find the bed had been turned down and see we both had slippers. Also very helpful people on the phone when we ordered room service. When it came to checking out we once again were treated rudely. A receptionist started to serve us then halfway through walked off to serve someone else who was obviously more important and left us standing there for half a hour (i work in the hotel industry I no how customers should be treated unlike the staff at the ritz). Would never return if they paid me to as to be honest the staff made me feel like a criminal!	
Jul 20 2006 	Tea at the Ritz	Afternoon tea as a special treat, the food was wonderful and plentiful. The presentation was poor every waiter of which there were numerous had stains on their cream jackets. The chair my partner sat on was badly stained not a new stain either. Certainly a good experience but slightly marred by the presentation. Value for money ludicrously expensive but the experience justified the expense.	
Jul 17 2006	Perfection personified!	My Husband and I booked in for a night at The Ritz to celebrate our 1st Wedding Anniversary. We arranged for the 'A Ritz Romance' package that included: 'Overnight accommodation in a superior room, Fruit, flowers and a bottle of Ritz Champagne in the room on arrival, A four course table d'hôte dinner accompanied by an especially selected bottle of wine and Full English breakfast the following morning.' We also booked ourselves in for the 1.30pm sitting for Afternoon Tea.Before we went I checked on tripadvisor and was mortified at the number of appalling reviews, most saying that the staff were rude and unhelpful, and that generally the experience was one to be missed. I must admit that I was more than a little concerned that we would be treated like scum!On arrival we were both a little tense but from the moment we walked up the steps we were greeted with a sea of smiles! They couldn't have been more helpful and friendly if they had tried! We went straight to Palm Court and were shown to our table - every member of staff we passed en route (door staff, waiters, pianist etc) all smiling and saying hello.Contrary to former reviews we were attended to quickly and our tea and food arrived shortly afterwards. And my god what food!! It was delicious and just kept on coming! I don't think I have ever eaten so much in one sitting! With the piano playing, the smell of fresh flowers, delicious food and watching the waiters gliding - I was in pure heaven!After we had eaten our own body weight in carbohydrates (not a good place for followers of The Atkins diet, by the way!) we went to the check in desk to be told that we had been upgraded from a Superior King to a Delux King!! We didnt even have to ask. The lady behind the desk was so personable and friendly we felt as if we had known her for years! She even took us up to our room and settled us in! What a room - all silk and gold. We felt like royalty. The bed was enormous and so, so comfortable. Shortly after we arrived the champagne arrived, complete with a bowl of mixed nuts and some handmade crisps. About an hour before dinner we had just started getting ready and the doorbell went, and it was a member of staff with complimentary cheese and biscuits! Lovely.We made our way down to dinner just before 8pm. I wont bore you the details of the entire meal but needless to say it was out of this world. Well what would you expect from The Ritz?? The food was to die for, complete perfection, and the staff were attentive but not overbearing. You barely noticed them filling up your glass! During the meal there was a live band playing easy blues and jazz who were fantastic. The lady singing had a beautiful voice. One thing that I noticed that I thought was great was that there was a large family seated at a big table. They had a couple of young children with them and I spied the waiters handing out bowls of chips! How great is that? Who ever said that this hotel was snobby was way off the mark! After dinner we decided on a nightcap and headed to The Rivoli bar for cocktails. I had a champagne cocktail and once I had got over the price (£16!!) it was delicious. Yet again more food was provided (this is not the place if you are watching your figure!) in the shape of olives, nuts and handmade crisps, but there was no room in my stomach for any more!In the morning we phoned for a couple of coffees on room service which arrived quickly and was beautifully presented, with a linen covered tray, flowered cups &amp; saucers, a silver coffee pot, complimentary shortcake (mmmmmm) and a paper. Breakfast was another feast - we had a full English as part of our package but this also came with pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, cheese &amp; meats etc etc. There seemed to be no end to the eating and all the food that was provided was the most exceptional quality. We really didnt want to leave and we are already making plans to go back from a night for our next anniversary. I have honestly no idea why people have come on here saying that they didn't enjoy The Ritz. I too have been to some pretty impressive hotels including The Peninsula in Bangkok, but The Ritz knocked the socks off of all of them. The people are lovely and very down to earth, but are professional and polished enough to remind you that you are somewhere very special. It really was a pleasure from start to finish and we would go back in a heart beat.	
Jul 16 2006	Fantastic	Just returned from an absolutely delightful stay at the Ritz London. We have stayed in many five star establishments in the past but, I have to say, the Ritz far outshines them all. There is an elegance to the Ritz that we have only found once before in Ashford Castle, Ireland. We found the staff extremely friendly &amp; helpful and, of course, being upgraded did add to the overall expereince! The formal dress code at the Ritz only added to the ambience and glamour of the weekend, making it that little bit more special. We will definitely be returning.	
Jul 10 2006	The Ritz	I have just returned home from the Ritz this past weekend 7-10 JulyI booked direct via their website, and doing so requested that a gluten free diet was essential. Within two hours of making the reservation I had a return email from the hotel asking me whether I would like them to order anything specific with regard to my diet requirements, to which I replied with a fair list of specific items. Upon arrival I checked in and at the same time made enquiries with regard to the specific dietry requirements I had given them, after a brief moment I spoke with the reservations clerk who had originally dealt with my enquiry, and she informed me that all of the items I had requested had been ordered specially for me, I could not have asked for better treatment, this alone was for me, first class service. I stayed in one of the suites, and it was expensive, however I personally feel that I had fairly acceptable value for money. I did supply some of my own food, for things such as biscuits and other snack foods. The room itself was superb, I took advantage of room service as I did not want to eat in the hotel public areas, and again I cannot find fault with the service. Everything was as I expected as far as service goes, and with regard to the dietry requirements, beyond expectations. I do not know whether the exceptional service was simply due to the fact that I had indeed spent a considerable sum of money for the room or simply the norm at this establishment as this was my first stay, however I would not hesitate to return again in the future.	
Mar 9 2006 	rubbish	Work requires both my husband and me to stay in London approximately once a month and over the years we have stayed at many top hotels in both London and abroad. Even business trips are never free, since food and drink (plus shopping of course) add considerably to the cost, even if you do get your basics paid for. But the Ritz was a place that I had always fancied staying at - at least once, and once it will remain for ever. The reason is simple, the hotel is simply trading on its past reputation and name. The staff are AWFUL, rude, and discourteous.Nearly all good 5* London hotels treat you with respect and courtesy at all times. The food was average only, overpriced and service SLOW (not the acceptable slow, where you feel you are not having your food thrown at you and being rushed, but properly SLOW (30 minutes for a drink for example). Ambience shouldn't be confused with decor, etc - the hotel is elegant, it is attractive and the rooms are fine but the most accurate review I read and agree with is that the staff feel above their customers.Definitely a training need for staff.BTW, if you want to &quot;dress up&quot;, there should be nothing stopping you, but why should such a rigorous dress code still be imposed these days, and if it is, then it should be applied to everybody, including people visiting hotel staff for business meetings. It's not a genuinely nice place to stay, unless you are a real snob.Try the Carlton Tower, Knightsbridge, or the Mandarin Oriental, Claridges or the Savoy for much better service - and food.	
Feb 16 2006	a wonderful hotel	We were a little apprehensive having read some reviews which advised that the staff were quite haughty. We didnt find this to be the case. We were made to feel welcome by a very professional and friendly staff.Our room was perfect - there is even a 'pillow menu'! As guests of the hotel, we were offered complimentary membership of The Ritz Club, which is well worth experiencing.Yes, the dress code is formal, and we saw people being politely asked to leave because they wore jeans. However, I think its worth the little bit of extra effort. We stayed for 3 nights, and as we approached the hotel after a long and rainy shopping trip on the 2nd day, I found myself self saying &quot;at last, home&quot;. I'm looking forward to a return trip.	
Feb 12 2006	High Class as expected but some reservations....	The Ritz is a beautiful hotel as one mught expect. The rooms are very tastefully decorated, the bathrooms were large and what one might expect to find in an American five-star hotel (which is a real compliment). While it may be beautiful and certainly well-located, I don't know that any hotel is worth the price of a room here. You should know certain things before booking. When you enter the hotel, you can either go to reception or enter a very small waiting area. The main hotel (75% of it) is off-limits unless men are dressed in a suit and tie and women appropriately. They do not allow jeans except at breakfast. At times, I felt like a prisoner in my own hotel. Also, they pride themselves on a certain standard of security. This is really a lot of pretense. The hotel does not even use the electronic card system for room keys. Instead, they give you an old fashioned key that if lost, has both the hotel name and room number on it. They would not give us more than one key which made our stay awkward as we always had to coordinate our coming and going. All in all, a very nice place but at the price, I would definitely look elsewhere.	
Jan 31 2006	a wonderful stay at this magnificent hotel.	We have just returned from a wonderful stay at this magnificent hotel. From the moment we arrived to our departure I could not speak more highly of the welcome and genuine warmth we received from the staff. We reserved two deluxe rooms one for ourselves and one for our children (age 4 and 8). They were most impressed by a bag of goodies which welcomed them and the contents of which kept them occupied for hours. A selection of childrens DVDs was only a call away to the concierge. We organised a babysitter while we went downstairs to dine. The child minding agency was first class and children were most at ease which gave us enough breathing space to enjoy a romantic meal. (If you are in London on a Friday or a Saturday night I'd highly recommend the ambiance and fine food at the Ritz's dinner dance - I'd give it a 10 out of 10). We found the rooms spacious, clean and very well maintained (I'd give the rooms an 8 out of 10) and the Bvlgari bathroom amenities are a nice change to the usual suspects.  I'm a very finicky guest but the restaurant didnt fail to impress. You will need to book well in advance because if the restaurant is fully booked even being a resident wont improve your chances of getting a table. The same applies for afternoon tea which can dilute a little of the spontaneity which one enjoys on holidays. Unlike other reports we did not find the Ritz in the least bit snobbish. It has ambiance, you can sense the occasion, its romantic. This is a grand hotel and befitting any special occasion its a great excuse to dress up. Naturally in such a situation one would feel uncomfortable in jeans or trainers. The numbers of tourists arriving to take photographs certainly keeps security busy but it is most discreet and its only right as I feel having hoards of sightseers milling around would spoil this special ambiance which guests experience. For Breakfast we choose the buffet. (I'd give it a 7 on 10). Dress code is smart casual. Children most welcome. On check out the bill I settled was 100% accurate which is the way I like it to be. My passion is to travel and have clocked up 44 countries so far. Good hotels are an integral part of the experience and since my stay at the Ritz I've altered my personal top three favourite hotels to 1. The Peninsula Hong Kong, 2. Ritz London and 3. The Four Seasons Bali. In the years to come Im sure we will recall fond memories of our stay at the Ritz London and I look forward to staying again sometime soon.	
Jan 30 2006	Afternoon tea is still wonderful	I think we all have to accept that the dear old Ritz has changed considerably since the brothers bought it. The front of house staff are now obsessed with both their particular dress code and security but perhaps you can see why when you visit the Park Lane Hilton and see how they have let standards slip there. The last time I had a drink in Trader Vicks bar I thought I was in the company of drug dealers and dodgy car salesmen.I found the service in the Ritz still absolutely wonderful, afternoon tea is a delight, but it is best to wear a decent suit to command attention. The public rooms are still very impressive but the ccv camera's are a little to numerous and it can be a depressing to know your every move is being monitored.I don't think the door staff are in awe of any sort of motor car as suggested by other reviewers but they are certainly impressed by a Dorchester umbrella!!All in all not great value for money but still an experience	
Jan 30 2006	Hit and Miss	When the staff are good they're very good, when they're bad they're very bad. Good points: restaurant but only if you're a meat eater. The vegetarian food is unimaginative and bistro standard. Sommellier is very good and enthusastic. The decor is beautiful throughout the hotel. The Rivoli Bar was great, and the Ritz Club is very beautiful although the staff outnumber the customers by 10 to 1 (we were the only people in there at a time when a Club should be buzzing). The showers in the bathroom are great. Beds are very comfortable.Bad points: room service not brilliant - this is meant to be a leading hotel of the world, guests shouldn't have to remind staff to do simple parts of their job such as emptying ash trays when cleaning rooms. Stale crisps and peanuts left in the room, fruit basket not refilled and complimentary champagne not delivered and then charged for.I got the overall impression that the hotel was living on past glories and reputation. Whilst it may share a name with the Paris Ritz it's about half as good. It was a beautiful building and an enjoyable weekend, but we won't stay there again.	
Jan 21 2006 	The Rileys stay at The Ritz	Absolutely superb. No other hotel in the world (and we've stayed at plently) even comes close.Our fond memories of our stay at The Ritz shall be remain with us for many years to come and we congratulate The Ritz for maintaining a standard of service, care and duty, that, I had thought, disappeared many years ago.A splendid experience in every respect.	
Jan 18 2006 	April Sandmeyer feels like a queen at The Ritz	I have always loved The Ritz. Being Bureau Chief of two London based international news agencies, I have visited The Ritz often. I usually stay in Mick Jagger's room which has a marble bathroom the size of my bedroom at home in NY. I love the pink satin decor, merino wool blankets and overall posh luxury. I always feel like I am treated like a queen. Having daily afternoon tea in the lobby is grand and a memorable experience even if you don't stay at the hotel.	
Dec 28 2005	disappointing overall	We were staying with friends in London and on a whim walking past decided to spend the last night in the Ritz. Of course, in retrospect it was mistake to walk in and ask if they had a room for the following night - definitely the snobbiest place I have ever been subjected to. The service was a struggle and we didn't have the right clothes to be in the &quot;public areas&quot; of the hotel after 11 am, so we only had breakfast there. We checked out the bar at breakfast time to see what we had missed and we were glad we hadn't bothered. Our room was large and very comfortable - excellent bed and pillows - but that prehistoric hairdryer on the bathroom wall was a joke. I couldn't find a socket near a mirror in the bedroom to use my own dryer. The view over Piccadilly was great and although there was a little traffic noise, we had a great nights sleep.Breakfast was OK, but not what of the standard we are used to in 5 star hotels. However, this was the first 5 star hotel in the world where there was no bed turn-down in the evening and fresh towels. Not that we need it, but you expect it. Overall, there must be other hotels where the décor is just as grand and the service much better. This hotel is ideal if you stay there very often, the staff know you personally and you like snooty. It probably also helps if you are in the 60  90 age-group (we are 43 and 30). Well be reading tripadvisor avidly before we book another London hotel on a whim.	
Dec 26 2005	My 30th Birthday	I am surprised by all the reviews I see here as they seem to be negative.I was taken to the Ritz by my husband as a surprise for my 30th Birthday and we had a wonderul time.From the moment we arrived the staff were polite and helpful and from the point of being taken to our suite they appeared to be bending over backwards to do anything they could to make our stay even more enjoyable.The suite was beautiful and there was a selection of fruits and Ritz champayne waiting for us. A member of staff brought some flowers to our room as well whilst we were settling in.The bathroom was large with a shower and separate bath and two sinks. It was nicely decorated in true marble fashion.The bedroom was beautiful, very regal in decor with a big bed and lots of stunning furniture and little extras to make it feel complete. The lounge area was as beautiful with plenty of space. The overall size of the suite was great, there was so much space, in fact it was quite a walk from the bed to the bathroom!The hotel is very well situated and we were there on a beautiful sunny day so we popped in M&amp;S and had a picnic in Green Park and then wandered to the Palace. There are also some good shops in the area so theres always plenty to do.We didn't have supper at the Ritz as my husband had booked us onto the Orient Express that evening, which was just the icing on the cake. We did however order breakfast in the room and we were not disappointed. It was fantastic sat there in big fluffy white dressing gowns as we tucked into breakfast. There was too much but we did our best to get through the cerials, fruits, juices, smoothies, danish pastries, breads, toast and jams, cooked breafast, teas, coffee etc.....I thoroughly enjoyed myself and did not notice any snobbish vibes from anyone but then again maybe I wasn't looking for them. I was there to enjoy my birthday and did a good job of it!I had a wonderful time and couldn't think of anywhere I would rather wake up and open my cards. Wonderful!	
Dec 16 2005	Unprofessional staff beautiful room	I laughed at a previous review for this hotel since I actually did arrive in a Rolls and wasn't treated any better.I'm used to staying at &quot;snooty&quot; type hotels and even this place was over the top for me. We usually stay at Claridges but I've always been curious about the Ritz; I'm sorry we stayed.There were a few pros. We had a one bedroom suite which is beautiful and large with two nice sized bathrooms and beautiful sitting room. Also, the housekeeping staff is exceptional. I think they must be psychic, they anticipated every need. The front desk staff is great.However, I am deeply disturbed by what appears to be inappropriate profiling by the security staff. During our first evening we enjoyed a few drinks at the Rivoli Bar. I excused myself to go to the powder room and was followed by a member of the security staff both to the powder room and back toward the bar. After I seated myself the bartender asked us what our room number was and then mentioned that they need to ask these things. I didnt have an issue with this question as I understand the need for security although I fail to understand the concern since we were appropriately dressed and behaved.During the second evening of our stay we returned from an evening out. Again, I was well dressed. As my husband and I approached the reception I saw the same security staff member. I made eye contact with him and said hello and he acknowledged me as well (this was during our third day of the stay). As we were collecting the room key I heard him mention to the other security staff member Shes okay to be here in reference to me. Im rather confused why he felt the need to explain this. He saw that I overheard and walked away quickly.I suppose my spouse and I seem to be a mismatched pair since he is in his fifties (a young 50) and I appear to be in my twenties (though I am somewhat older). However, we are both successful professionals united in a legitimate marriage. Since we were in the process of collecting our room key from the front desk (you have to leave it at the desk if you leave the hotel), why would there be a question that I belonged at the hotel? At the very least I feel the staffs comment amounts to sexism, at the most the implication is far more insulting. I was deeply embarrassed by the lack of discretion exhibited. In his zeal to ensure that each guest met his approval, he ruined my stay at the hotel. My husband discussed this the next morning with the concierge; I wasnt harassed for the remainder of our stay but the damage had been done.The Ritz needs to reeducate their staff as to the importance of discretion and diplomacy. Additionally, it would be helpful if they didnt apply their own clichéd stereotypes when judging the suitability of those present in the hotels public areas. I believe the policy dictates proper attire and presumably acceptable behavior. I met both criteria so treatment with as much respect and dignity as the other guests should have been automatic. I have nothing but respect for their profession, I really didn't deserve this treatment.Both my husband and I travel extensively and enjoy staying at finer hotels. Perhaps we have been scrutinized at some of these hotels but the difference is that their staff is trained to be subtler. We also had dinner at the restaurant. The food was horrible and we actually went to a second restaurant after dining there. I expect service to be at a leisurely pace at a restaurant like this, and it was, but not in an elegant way. We sat there for quite awhile before a server came for our drink order and it's not acceptable to wait 20 minutes for your first bottle of wine or drink. We also had lunch one afternoon, which was fine (had the salmon) and tea twice (entertaining guests). The tea is nothing special but I wasn't expecting much. The sandwiches were typical finger sandwiches and the petit fours were good. Also, a good tea selection.All in all, I'll be staying at Claridge's again. It's a shame since the location is perfect.	
Nov 15 2005	far too snobbish	Found the hotel far too snobbish.if you want a classic hotel with all the style and sophistication you would expect from a hotel of this class, just a lot more friendly, try the Savoy.i stayed here and was made to feel honoured that you deem to spend money with them, i stayed at the savoy as a gift (taking in gordon ramsays chelsea restaurant too, try it, it is amazing) and was given a complimentary upgrade as it was a gift !!! superb !!.the ritz should take some lessons from them.	
Oct 28 2005	You better drive up in a Rolls to be treated well!!!!!	My family has stayed at this hotel for 50+ years. I myself have probably stayed at this hotel 3-4 times a year ever since I was born. I spent my spring semester and summer in London and my parents came to visit several times. On my parents most recent trip, I went to the hotel to pick them up...I had just finished playing soccer and didn't see any reason to change before I walked into the hotel as I had walked through the front door a thousand times before in gym clothes. The valet @ the front actually said, &quot;Um sir, may I help you.&quot; I told him I was there to see my parents - And he wouldn't let me in the hotel!!!! He asked me to wait as he had someone call up to their room(he, of course, asked me for their names)!!!! While I was waiting, another valet realized who I was and apologized...they gave my parents a free night bc I lost it on a manager as he walked me up to their room apologizing the whole way...big deal...I've never paid to stay here, but would bet my family spends more at this hotel/year than most people there make...or more than I make now for that matter. I really could have cared less about this incident but 2 days later I had some friends over to the hotel to charge up my parents bill (w/ their permission of course). 2 girls and a buddy were all stoped at the front and asked if they could be helped for absolutly no reason!!!! One of the girls was british, with a small title might I add. I did loose it on the hotel and they again, apologized over and over again for the rest of my parents stay. However, this behavior seems to be a pattern with this hotel. My parents will still stay @ the hotel, but I will never spend a dime there. The staff is always overly nice to me, with the exception of this one incident, but only because most of them know me and are probably afraid of me now. The employes at this hotel need to remember that the ritz is not a private club, and even if it were, they wouldn't be the members. If you want traditional British Hospitality, stay at Claridges or the Stafford where, like most of the Brits, they treat everyone with kindness...ie, if you are just a tourist and want to walk through the lobby of either hotel, you will be treated kindly. Fell free to email me with questions.	
Oct 12 2005	Tea on TV?	If you're mad enough to go for the afternoon tea you might notice the CCTV cameras peering at you from all over the place. Whether this is because you might steal a tea strainer or streak the palm court, I don't know, but I know I don't like it.You will go away hungry, too.	
Oct 6 2005	ritz? more like the blitz	I went to the ritz london on saturday 01/oct/2005 to reserve a room for the weekend of 29/oct/2005 to celebrate the birthday of my partner. I was rudely greeted by a young man who told me that i could have done this on the internet or over the phone to save 'their' time. I only went down in person as i work a few streets down. I was shocked at the reception i got considering the amount of money i was ready to spend on what i thought was an exceptional hotel, one where i was looking to spend a night to remember. If this was their attitude then i thank my lucky stars that i hadn't booked over the internet or by phone and experienced the first class hostility and arrogance in person and saved myself the disappointment later on. i take reviews i read on tripadviser with a pinch of salt, i now think anyone considering staying here to take them with something a lot more stiffer to prepare them from the shocking, cold, couldn't care less who you are attitude that awaits them. Good luck if you plan to stay here and DON'T assume if you've stayed at a ritz-carlton hotel before that this is more of the same stuff, it's just a bluff !	
Sep 28 2005 	The Staff think they are the customers :(	I am going to be short and sweet about this hotel. I cannot take the ambience away from this hotel, it is grand in its appearance and interior. I booked a standard double and was offered a deluxe suite for about £100 more, over looking Picadilly (the road). All was well, apart from the staff. They have this superior attitude. I felt like I was priviledged to be walking in their presence. All changed of course when I walked out of my chauffered Bentley...suddenly I was not this young guy with the scruffy clothes...enough said. There are better 5* hotels in London who want your business. Try Claridges if you want a classic style hotel.	
Sep 19 2005 	Trading the brand to death.	Unless someone invites me, I won't choose to visit again. Absolutely unremarkable, excepting the enduring legacy of the name. However even that can't take the punishment of the indifferent experience I had.I took the ritual afternoon tea and had to watch the undignified behaviour of a guest (I guess), physically maulling the seated female oriental pianist as if he owned her. Gross. I wish I had got up now and done something about it! She left after finishing what she was playing and did'nt come back.The staff all have a high opinion of themselves, which has to have something to do with the place they work. But when the staff put themselves above the paying customer, showing little humility and not giving the impression that &quot;nothing was too much trouble&quot;; well then I take my dollars elsewhere.I don't regard this as a &quot;Brit&quot; attitude, as most of the staff seemed European.The Casino is a better place to lose your money, than wasting it staying at the Hotel.	
Sep 18 2005	fabulous	Simply fabulous - This hotel is great. The service was terrific and is centrally located to everything. Make sure you eat at the Wollesley (terrific atmosphere), eat at wagamma(asian). Yes, this hotel is upscale but the service and staff were awesome. I couldn't wait to get back to my room to lie on my bed, it is that comfortable. London is extremely pricey, be prepared for that, way more than a New York City.	
Sep 17 2005	A classic hotel	The Ritz is absolutely classic, it is not in the spirit of the mega resorts. I loved the service, room and location! The conceirge desk was incredible, ask for Ray to handle your needs in London.He arranged car to and from Heathrow, restaurant reservations etc.......The rooms large with great beds and character.A world class hotel in a world class city!!	
Jun 26 2005	Fantastic!	Suprerb, is all I can say! I booked a night @ the Ritz for my Wife's 30th with Dinner on the Orient Express, if we are talking value for Money then this has to be it, we had a Junior Suite with flowers, fruit and Champagane, the best service (2 calls to make sure you are happy). Breakfast in bed was a massive feast for 2 and the room was superb. If you fancy treating someone this is the place to go!	
Jun 12 2005	Thoroughly enjoyable	My partner and I stayed for one night on the 9th June. We found the hotel to be exactly what we expected. We were treated courteously and made to feel very welcome. We were in a pleasant room overlooking Arlington St. which isn't too noisy and shortly after our arrival, the duty manager had a complimentary bottle of champagne delivered to our room. Very nice! Yes, a night at The Ritz is pricey, however, it is nice to have 'tried it out'. My partner prefers The Lanesborough but I would be happy to stay at The Ritz again.	
Jun 8 2005	Name 'alone' Does not Ensure Quality	At USD 600 per night my expectations matched the price of the room but I was very disappointed. It is unfortunate but relying on the reputation and name Ritz only gets you so far.I made reservation through LHW and was upgraded to a Jr. Suite.Bathroom- shower spray hose was broken and it did not just happen. Towels were large but rough like sand paper.Room service was poor.What most amazed me was just the lack of hospitality. The front desk manager did move me from one Jr. Suite to another and seemed to realize that there was a problem. She had a good attitude.Rooms are worn and need to be painted and the fabric on furniture is worn. Yes the gold on the ceilings is beautiful but you need to take care of basics.I did write to the GM of the hotel to share my opinion.Bottom line, if I paid USD 200 okay but not USD 600.This should be a wake up call for the hotel management.	
Jun 7 2005	Good but could be better	We received a voucher for the Ritz Finale package as a present - this package included accommodation in a superior room, 2 theatre tickets of choice, either pre or post theatre dinner menu and breakfast the next day. The bedroom we were in was lovely although smaller than expected and expect to pay for everything - even tea/coffee as there's no tea/coffee facilities in the room. Being a light sleeper however, I could hear all the traffic noise at night so soundproofing isn't the best. We found most of the staff extremely polite and helpful although the concierge at the enquiry desk gave us wrong directions to the theatre (it was only 15 mins walk away) and so we were franctically trying to find it before the show started. I would have expected to get the correct directions from 5* star hotel!The restaurant is lovely and the food is tasty - waiting staff are very attentive and the atmosphere is lovely and romantic - a live band were playing the Saturday night we were there and you could get up and dance on the little dancefloor if you wanted.The only thing that I found of very bad service was when I was enquiring via email as to the dates, availability, theatre shows etc - despite constant emails I never got an answer and uended up having to ring the hotel to try and get the information and confirm my bookings and tickets etc, which for a 5-star hotel is shocking service and very annoying!In general though, it makes for a great break for that special occasion for anniversary or birthday, etc	
Jun 1 2005	"return to the ritz every time you can"	my husband and i have stayed at the ritz several times and each time we hate to leave. the hotel is beautiful, but the staff make you feel as if they have been &quot;waiting for you to arrive&quot;. being greeted by name......so very nice. the hall porters, knowing i take lots of photos, often ask in the morning &quot;madam, do you have any film you would like for us to have developed for you today?&quot; one evening while having a drink in the bar, the waiter asked if we would like another drink. we explained we had dinner reservations in ten minutes in the dining room. he said......&quot;i shall bring menus for you and your wife........this is the ritz and we can do anything......to make sure you are happy&quot;. it wasn't arrogant, it was a statement of fact......the ritz wants all who pass through the doors to be happy........! we have been upgraded on occasion.....our favorite room being green park. the doorman (a favorite) the hall porters...there to take very good care of you.......the maids who made the effort to thank me personally for &quot;something left on the pillow&quot;. the ritz is marvelous and we hope to &quot;return to the ritz&quot; soon.	
May 31 2005	Rude Rude Rude	One of our planned visits while in London was The Ritz. Although we were staying at another 5 star Hotel, we made special time for a short visit. As frequent Guests of the Ritz Carlton , we couldn't wait to see this UK gem. Boy--were we shocked at the greeting we received. We entered the Lobby area and were rudely spoken to by someone (apparently worked the Lobby area) and asked &quot;May I help you&quot;?. We explained that we were past guests of the Ritz Carlton and wanted to view the Lobby and restaurant and perhaps reserve Tea--- he scolded back at us replying that this Ritz has nothing to do with Ritz Carlton and any further questions were to be directed to the reception area (off on the side of the Lobby). The reception clerk explained that they are an independent Hotel but use Ritz marketing. So that is why they are so different than our Ritz Carltons that we have frequented and so love? We couldn't believe the rude reception that we and our Friends received-----walked out ---no afternoon tea and will never return !	
May 3 2005 	Old and Young Impressed by the Ritz London	In March I found it necessary to travel to London on a corporate expedition. The trip invovled entertaining guests, so made a booking at the Ritz. Obviously, anyone visiting the Ritz for the 1st time is excited, but I decided to take my mother along for the trip.The Ritz, according to previous reviews may not welcome visitiors. I welcome this wholeheartedly. The staff at the hotel have only one desire - the thorough well being of the guests staying at the hotel. They are proud of being the most secure hotel in the world, and this is evident everywhere you look.We stayed in a lovely suite overlooking Green Park, Buckingham Palace and Picadilly. The suite could not have been more wonderful. While, as a 23 year old man I was impressed by the range of beers in the mini bar and the impressive massive plasma television, my mother was equally as amazed by the wonderful antique fabrics, the brilliant curtains and the bath in which a submarine could be floated.The food and drink at the hotel are expensive, and their is no getting away from that. It is, in my opinion not unreasonably priced given the amazing quality of it and the speed at which it is served. The breakfast is exquisite and dinner menus rival the Ivy and the best hotels around the world.In my opinion, the biggest asset and benefit of staying at the Ritz is the staff. They are amazing. The concierge got us brilliant seats at 8 hours notice to watch Mary Poppins. He managed to get us the best seats in the house (my mother was shocked to discover that she had to sit next to Donald Sutherland)The door staff and concierge are legends and when I am in London again, would not hesistate to stay at the Ritz.If you can afford it, the Ritz is wonderful. If not, get a new credit card and stay there. It truly is the most brilliant place to stay - go with high expectations and you will not be dissapointed.	
Mar 23 2005	Afternoon Tea at The Ritz	I would highly recommend this as a treat for someone special. Its expensive if you purchase it through the hotel direct but (---) do some fabulous deals! The sandwiches were nice, crust cut off and into a rectangular shape with 4 different fillings - Cream cheese and cucumber, cream cheese and smoked salmon, chicken and mayonnaise, and ham. Scones and jam, and then very dainty little pastries. They re filled as much as you liked, you can certainly get your moneys worth! It was also my birthday and i had it played for me on the piano with a free birthday cake! The staff were so friendly and polite, you feel quite humble. Get to the first sitting however, as after that there are queues for the toilets and things but from 11:30 there is no one. The actual hotel itself is spectacular, and the Palm Court were afternoon tea takes place is very oldy worldy. All in all a lovely, and very different day out!	
Feb 2 2005	Very rude - don't like visitors	We stopped at the Ritz on our recent trip to London to have a drink in the bar. It was at 10:30 on a Friday night! Apparently, they try to keep out anyone not staying there because the bar closes to the public by 10:30 PM and you cannot get a drink or even a cup of coffee. The staff was very rude to us and once they told us the policy they turned their backs on us. I have stayed at the Ritz hotels before and have found them okay, not anything exceptional, plus they charge you for every little thing. Anyway, don't stop here to spend your money, they don't want it.	
Jan 17 2005	I expected more	Apart from the public spaces ,which are very elegant and impressive. The rooms are not so spacious although quite confortable: TV and stereo equipment could be better,I expected more from the room service. Afternoon tea worth visiting.The real PRO is the restaurant	
Jan 10 2005	Very over rated	I stayed at the Ritz Hotel in December for a one night stay, on my way through London to Japan. I spend about 30 nights per year away from home and have stayed at many wonderful hotels, so I do regard myself as therfore being capable of an unbiased review. The public areas of this hotel are, absolutely superb, the lobby is gorgeous and very old world, the Rivoli bar is very elegant and almost over the top but the walnut wall paneling with inlaid Lalique crystal is superb and definately worth going to have a drink. There is a high level of formality here at the hotel which means that to enter the bars and restaurants you will require a jacket, some people find this a bit too stuffy however I think it helps to create a very nice atmosphere. i have also had dinner here in the hotels restaurant (not on the night I stayed) and can say that this is one of my favourite dining experiences in London and again I would suggest that everyone must try this at least once in their lifetime. However, Staying at the hotel is a huge dissapointment, while the public areas of the hotel are superb, the rooms leave a lot to be desired, nearly every room at the hotel has furnishings that are unique to that room, however I have seen three rooms in the hotel (all standard rooms) and they are all very tired, the bathrooms are very plain, the room systems such as television and non existant sound system are very very low grade and outdated. The airconditioning system was faulty and was so old, it was very hard to regulate the room temp... it was either too hot or too cold. As a hotel guest the service also left a lot to be desired, staff here seemed to forget that they were employed to assist guests and seemed to beleive that they owned the hotel. I also received a call two hours before check out time and was asked when I would be checking out and then had someone knock on my door to again check tell me that the check out time was 12.00 and since it was now 11.00 would I be checking out soon. The particular evening that I stayed at the hotel I elected to have room service for dinner and ordered a club sandwich. The club sandwich that was served was more akin to something bought at a football match and would be the plainest club sandwich I have ever seen served in a so called 5 star hotel.By the time I checked out of the hotel I was convinced to never again stay at this hotel, which can only be described as outdated and certainly resting on its laurals, old world and antique does not need to equal bad service and tired out dated rooms. I would suggest to anyone coming to London, to stay elsewhere but do go to the Ritz to enjoy their restaurant and bar without the need to accept their low grade rooms. If one is looking for a unique London hotel experience I would suggest The Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge, Very English, very discreet, pretty rooms and fabulous relaxed service.	
Jan 5 2005	bargain!	My trip to the Ritz was a bargain. It was free! I won a trip for breakfast at the Ritz (including a nights stay) for four people.It was fantastic. The building was just how I pictured it to be decorated, and the bedrooms were fantastic.The staff were very helpful and didn't seem to be any more polite to the rich people than us!!Breakfast was a bit intimidating, everyone oozed money from every pore (except me), then to make matters worse I spilt something and left a big stain on the tablecloth. The food was beautiful though, smoked salmon, scrambled egg, fresh berries etcOverall, a great experience. I will never forget eating room service, lounging in my ritz bathrobe and slippers, a real treat!!	
Jan 1 2005	What a wonderful experience	Spending Christmas at The Ritz, London is a real treat. We had a Junior Suite that accommodated our family of four nicely. The hotel is just lovely during the holidays. The room was spacious, and very clean. I definitely recommend this hotel in London. It is close to everything.	
Dec 31 2004	Recent stay-Dec 22-26 2004	We spent the Christmas holiday at the Ritz and had a wonderful time. I was travelling with my wife and two daughter (ages 13 and 12) and the staff really went out of their way to accomodate us. Upon arrival I was immediately upgraded to a Junior Suite (because of Amex Platinum) and was allowed to check in at 9.00 am.The room was very large (approx 500 sqft) and the bathrooms were marvelous.Even though the room was quite pricey (340GBP approx $700) it was well worth it, at least for a once in a lifetime experience.The location is perfect with plenty of nice ethnic restaurants around, and the walks in Green Park were wonderful.The staff was excellent, and very courteous. I highly recommend it!!	
Dec 17 2004	This hotel is no Alvear Palace or Principe Di Savoia hotel	I spent last night at the Ritz and was suprised to read all the glowing reviews on tripadvisor. As a connoisseur of 5 star hotels this hotel is average at best. Pros: All standard 5 star ammenities, excellent location, helpful staff, marbel baths. Neg's: Small hotel elevator is poorly located within the bar/dining area, especially annoying if high tea is being served. The rooms are decorated in a poorly executed Victorian decor (they appear to be decorated in the mid 50's, the only thing missing is plastic sofa covers). The room I had was on the compact side for the price they charge, the carpet was worn but not as worn as the old robes supplied in the bathroom. The room was noisy, I heard everyone elses doors open and close. The king size bed was two twins pushed together and you could feel the crest in your back. (This is unexceptable for a 5 star hotel. If the Hilton Hyde Park has full size king beds the Ritz should!) Unlike other hotels in London there are no tea/coffee facilities in the room. The old outdated TV has one of the hardest remotes I've ever used and the hotel doesn't supplya TV guide. Many hotels include breakfast in their rate but not the Ritz. Also be advised if you do want to dine jeans are unacceptable, even for breakfast, men must wear jackets for lunch/dinner. Be prepared for spending a enormous amount of money if dining or utilizing the minibar. Turn down service nice but ice should be supplied, not requiring a call to room service. All in all a nice hotel but not worth overspending there are much better options in London.	
Dec 8 2004	rude staff	I had managed to get front row tickets for the producers as a birthday present for my mother so as a joint christmas present I arranged to have afternoon tea and an overnight stay at the ritz for the night of the show. We arrived for afternoon tea which was like a cattle market, lots of people pushing and shoving to the front, there was no queue system, and lines of people trying to check their coats. The tea was nice but it all seemed too mechanical, the waiters, although friendly, looked like bored and worn out robots. I suppose everyone should try it once even thought it is an expensive tourist trap. Our room was very nice, clean and lots of room and really comfy beds. We left to get a cab outside at 6.30pm to be at the theatre for the 7.30pm performance. The doorman was very unhelpful in getting us a cab, we were still there at 7.35 and was very rude to me when I told him that we were missing our show. It was actually another guest that managed to grab one and he kindly let us share with him. Because of this we arrived over half an hour into the show, they did let us in but we had to stand at the back until intermission. Those tickets had been bought 7 months in advance and trying to get them again in the centre front row is impossible, until after january 8th when Nathan Lane is leaving the show, unless I pay a huge amount of money to a ticket tout or on ebay, but more than anything I felt really let down, especially for my mother as it was her special occasion. I did complain to the manager the next morning, as did three other guests, about the staff and the chaos with the taxi, he then told me that the doormen could call the cab company and send some to the hotel if they were needed. I will not be staying at the ritz again and cannot recommend the dorchester, the lanesborough or the mandarin oriental highly enough. I have been staying at these hotels over the years and can truly say that for the enormous amount of money that I spent at the ritz, room-drinks at bar-tea and room service I wish I had stayed at one of them. Also when we got back from the show I walked up the steps of the side entrance only to slip in someone else's vomit, the bellboy said yes it was sick but then dissappeared. DISGUSTING!	
Dec 7 2004	Tea at the Ritz is Mediocre	Unfortunately, we too had heard that having tea at the Ritz is a must. Although the surroundings of the Palm Court were nice, the sandwiches and cakes tasted blah! Their pastries are beautiful to look at, but have a frozen food flavor to them. We didn't want to be rude, so we ate a few obligatory pieces and vowed never again!	
Dec 3 2004	RECOMMEND TEA AT THE RITZ	Myself and a friend had afternoon tea,and we were not dissapointed. Our waiter was very attentive, asking us if we wanted anything more, and bringing out extra sandwichs, he even gave us extra chocolates for some friends who couldn't make the tea. The setting was wonderful. I would reccomend it to anyone who is visiting LONDON.	
Oct 28 2004	Top of the Ritz	Just like the Paris Ritz, the Ritz London does not disappoint. Everything is 5 Star from the location, historic building, greetings, check-in, service, top-notch security and food. This property has held it together very well given the age and standard offered at other 5 star properties in Mayfair, St. James of the West End. The Ritz London offers the #1 afternoon tea service in the UK - something one must experience at least once in a lifetime. How can you resist those cucumber and smoke salmon sandwiches anyway? If you can't get a reservation at the Palm Court, then opt for room service (tea); it is excellent!Square footage in their Deluxe King room category is a lot larger and well laid out than its competitors, which translates into a lovely separate living area that includes a couch, coffee table, lounge chair and writing desk for those still working. Euro square down pillows, comfy slippers, plush robes and marble encompassing the entire bathroom from floor to ceiling.Don't miss an opportunity to bunk here - HRH Prince of Wales, Charley must have agreed since the hotel has since been bestowed with the Royal Warrant only a royal can annoint.The excess of Louis the XVI is evident in the decor, but what do you expect at the Ritz? Just book and go!	
Oct 18 2004	superb hotel	fantastic hotel my wife and i just got back it is well worth the money.we did use a few local tour guides but THE REAL LONDON GUIDE were the best by far could not do enough for you contact them it is worth the time	
Oct 10 2004	Special stay at a special hotel	My wife and I travelled from Singapore and allthough we did not stay at the Ritz initially we did take tea there on the afternoon of 4th September, which is our wedding anniversary and my birthday, it was a lovely surprise when I was presented with a small birthday cake and a chorus of &quot;happy birthday&quot; from the pianist and a round of applause from the other guests.We did spend 2 nights at the hotel later in the month after returning from a trip to Rome and Paris, it was a very special experience, impeccable service, a lovely room and great ambience.
