	Smart comfortable hotel	We just returned from a long weekend in London staying at the Place2Stay. It was not our first choice but our usual B&amp;B was fully booked so we had to find someplace else. Very modern and clean. Well run with very comfortable rooms, excellent showers, and efficient elevators. Free WiFi in room. On the downside, it was more expensive than our usual B&amp;B hotel and did not serve breakfast but the room did have a nicely equipped kitchen nook complete with tableware, complimentary tea and coffee, kettle, microwave and refrigerator. The location too was a bit far away from the Theatre district and Oxford St./Covent Garden/Soho, our customary haunts, but very convenient to the Earls Court underground station. Buy an Oyster card for convenient bus and tube travel. For overpriced London, I would say this hotel represents decent value and would not hesitate in recommending it to adults with or without children.	
	Great Hotel Great Location	Really enjoyed our stay. Rooms were a little small, however still big enough, well appointed and extremely clean. Service when required was excellent. Great location only a couple of minutes walk to Earls Court Station. Off Earls Court Road so was very quiet and felt safe at night. I would stay again if I was back in London.	
	Stay here.	From the beginning we walked through the door, Base2stay was great. The staff are extremely friendly and will go out of their way to help you. The location of the hotel is very central and only a 2 minute walk from the tube. No taxi's needed. The room was clean and comfortable. It was a modest sized double room and suited our needs as we were out touring during the day. I would suggest looking into a larger room if you plan to spend a lot of time chilling out in your room as the bed takes up the majority of floorspace, with a desk, lounge chair and then the bathroom. However if you are touring London, this would be perfect.The bathroom was clean and a generous size compared to many other hotels.The staff assisted us with day tours available, offered assistance wherever they could and were very polite. We paid £243 for 2 nights and it was worth it. Overall, the hotel is modern, comfortable, centrally located and the staff are great. I would certainly stay here again and strongly recommend it to others.	
	Modern clean convenient and affordable!	We were pleasantly surprised with base2stay Kensington. All staff members were helpful and courteous. Our double room was reasonably priced, but really small. It wasn't a big deal since we really just needed to sleep there, not hang out. Modern decor in a charming old Kensington neighborhood. Good closet space and nice kitchenette with mini-fridge all hidden behind closet doors. We received 20% off coupons to local restaurants from the front desk. The hotel is a very short walk to the Earl's Court tube station and we were able to travel all around London with great ease. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to London!	
Nov 26 2009 	My week in London	Absolutely loved staying at base2stay, the rooms were perfect - contemporary, clean and loved the mini-kitchen facility. The location was also ideal, as we were relying entirely on public transport, the station is literally just around the corner. The staff were really helpful, particularly Tony he helped with everything from train timetables to the advising us on the best places to eat around town. It was clear he had great knowledge of the area. Will definitely be staying here next time I come to London.	
Nov 23 2009 	Loved it here recommended!	Four girlfriends on a weekend-getaway. Had a spacious room for four on lower level with one king size bed and a sofabed. Ideally we would have preferred four separate beds or at least two &quot;proper&quot; doubles, but it worked just fine. The rpom was clean, newly refurbished (like the whole hotel, has a new feel.) Subtle, modern and lovely decor. Beautiful bathroom and a practical kitchenette with cooker and cofffee, fridge and cups ect. Really practicle! Just five-ten minutes from vibrant Gloucester street with lovely places to have breakfast, for us this was ideal! And after breakfast, just a ten-fifteen min. walk to Knightsbridge and Harrods etc. Hotel was very quiet and felt safe with 24h receptionservice. Nice and smiling people behind the desk:) We liked it a lot and will def. both recommend and come back!	
Nov 23 2009 	Met- Even exceeded expectations!	This was our first trip to London. We were so pleased and impressed with our choice to use Base2stay. The hotel is so close to Earl's Court Tube. We quickly became experts at using the Tube for all our excursions in London. There were plenty of fun restaurants and pubs within walking distance of the hotel. We used the recommendations and discount coupons offered to us by the wonderful staff at the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed every meal. We also made use of the lovely &quot;kitchen closet&quot; for breakfast and snacks. I would recommend strolling over to the nearby Marks and Spencer to purchase breakfast items. We loved the variety of interesting juices and excellent instant porridge cups for breakfast each day. The bed was cozy, temperature controls worked well, the shower was heavenly with big, fluffy towels. Free internet access was somewhat clumsy, but we were able to check our e-mails. This hotel lived up to all the reviews I read before booking it. The size,comfort and ammenities of the room, proximity to Tube, and helpfulness of the staff made it an excellent choice in lodging. So glad we found Base2stay.	
Nov 23 2009 	Great Hotel - A lot of thought has go into place.	The hotel is well situated in Earls Court, less than five minutes from Earls Court tube station, bars and resturants. Also not far from the Natural History Museum, V&amp;A Museum, Earls Court and Royal Albert Hall.A lot of thought has gone into the hotel and the first experience of being welcomed by smiling and friendly staff sets the tone. The rooms are well laid out and well appointed and the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds i have slept in.The information provided in the room was excellent and you can order in drinks or food from the comprehensive lists supplied.The hotel staff can recommend resturants etc some of them offering discounts, we had breakfast at the recommended Balens which was excellent plus %15 off.Great place for this end of London with good facilities with a reasonable price for London. We will stay again.	
Nov 22 2009 	SMASHIN!	Just spent 3 nights at Base2stay and it was great. The location is spot on. Only 5 minutes from Earls Court tube station and plenty of bars/restaurants nearby. The rooms were great - beds were really comfy, free internet on the TV, nicely decorated and very clean. The staff were really helpful with recommendations for places to eat. Hotel has deals with various restaurants in the area for discounts which we made good use of - full english at Balans, burgers at Gourmet Burger Kitchen were superb and the pizzas at Strada couldnt be better.Some good pubs in the area: Princess Margaret, Courtfield, Hansom cab, Prince of Teck to name a few.Word of warning though - avoid the Kings Head in Hogarth place - barely change from £20 for 4 vodkas and coke - rip off.Booking up for next year.	
Nov 21 2009 	Modern and Convenient	My husband and I stayed at Base2Stay for three nights at the end of October. The room, although small, was extremely well appointed - there was a small kitchenette which included a sink, kettle, microwave and mini-refrigerator, and dishes and flatware for two. The bathroom was clean and modern and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in in a hotel. This hotel is located midway between the Earls Court and Gloucester Road Tube Stations in the Kensington area of London making it very convenient for accessing all areas of London. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. We will stay here again.	
Nov 20 2009 	Comfy plush clean modern hotel	Really nice clean hotel, super staff, very convenient location, easy to get around, cool shower..........pay for a room not amenities: who sleeps in a bar or restaurant???	
Nov 18 2009 	Fabulous London Hotel!	We LOVED base2stay and will be recommending it to all our friends. This is the PERFECT location (walking distance from the Earl's Court Tube station-where you may also catch the train to Heathrow) and it was a joy to see a Central London hotel competitively priced that wasn't a tiny dump. Various size rooms are available. You get what you pay for so if you want a big room they are available. Base2stay in fact is gorgeous with large welcoming modern rooms and great staff. Suffice it to say we thoroughly enjoyed our five days at the hotel and hope to return in 2010. We must give a huge bouquet to Mr. Potter, the most welcoming hotel staff member we have ever encountered. It is refreshing to see English staff in the hotel rather than unpleasant and rude eastern Europeans who tend to waste space and rebuff guests in many Earls Court area hotels.	
Nov 18 2009 	Brilliant location great place to stay!	Ok, the single rooms are small...but hey, didn't come to London to hang out in the room and really, big enough for a place to sleep in. Its clean, modern with everything you need. Lovely street, close to Earls Court Station which is on the airport line. Couple of pubs close by was handy but also reccomend the Troubadour cafe nearby for a great feed with a bit of history to it! Staff friendly and polite and free wi fi was great for keeping in touch with friends and family back home!	
Nov 16 2009	Thoroughly enjoyed my stay!	Great value for money, I had totally forgotten about the kitchenette- which was quite handy.	
Nov 16 2009 	Excellent!	Excellent hotel in a great location.We had a wonderful time in London and the hotel was one of the reason why.Staff is very friendly, rooms are cozy, comfortable, clean and quiet.Price was also ok (comparing with other locations in the expensive London)Definitively recommended.	
Nov 15 2009 	Nice location nice rooms on the tube to anywhere you want to go	Location is a really nice area - Hotel is close to the tube (direct on the Heathrow line) and Earls Court Road (lots of places to eat).Stayed with two friends - room had three single beds which is great as often hotels just give a double and a roll out bed. There was a kitchenette in the room too (with kettle, fridge, sink and delf/ cutlery) which was great for breakfast! Rooms also had flat screen TV, free wifi &amp; access to games and music. Didn't use them, but it sounded good! Staff were friendly - couldn't really fault the place and I would recommend it again.	
Nov 14 2009 	Great location - modern unclutered and well cleaned rooms	base2stay is really conveniently located in Kensington which is a nicer part of London and the hotel is therefore not cheap. Close to Earl's Court where there was a good range of meal choices (as the hotel doesn't have a restaurant). We were easily able to get big English breakfasts at local pubs and cafes in addition to meals at other local restaurants. The rooms were smallish but well appointed and tidy. Could have benefited from a luggage stand/rack, but there is space under the bed to store luggage when not in use. Staff were friendly and very helpful. The only complaint I'd have about this hotel was that they claimed to provide free broadband internet access (in addition to WiFi). But to use it (in a system which uses the TV as a monitor for internet access) without your own laptop was painfully clunky - ended up going to a local Internet cafe.	
Nov 13 2009 	Nice Place To Stay	The staff were very friendly and helpfull. The rooms were spotless. The mattress was the best one we had on our week long journey. Very close to tube station. We would stay here again!!!	
Nov 12 2009 	Top notch! No faults what so ever. Would definetly recommend.	Stayed at base2stay and would rate this as the best hotel we've ever stayed in. Great location. 5 min walk to closest tube station and high street. Very nice area. The staff were helpfull and informative throughout our stay. The room was well lade out and very clean and modern. Before my visit i thought the room fee was a little expensive but on reflection i feel this was good value. Would highly recommend.	
Nov 11 2009 	Nicequietcleancentralconvinient	Base 2 Stay is a small and expensive hotel with no breakfast. 5 minutes walking from the tube you can go everywhere easy and fast. Nearby there are not many things to do. Our room (double with an extra bed) was very small, the self service machine had only water,cola and chocolates. Wrong option for a hotel with no breakfast. Tha staff was very friendly and kind. DO NOT GO FROM THE GATWICK AIRPORT! Is really far away.	
Nov 9 2009 	Very nice hotel with friendly staff	We stayed at the hotel after reading about it on tripadvisor..com.Good reviews, and they lived up to it.Good service ,and very helpful staff.Small, but clean and nice rooms,free wifi in the room.No breakfast served,but restaurants near by.20-30% rebate when staying at the hotel.	
Nov 9 2009 	Modern budget hotel perfect for anyone who wants a bit of luxury at an affordable price	Great location, modern, comfortable room with all amenities at an affordable price. Made several changes to booking prior to stay with no problem from reception staff. Being a group booking we were given two ground floor rooms with adjoining patio which was perfect. The only negative was that although we did arrive early, we were not given access to both our rooms, even though it was obvious from the outside patio area of the one room that the other room was ready for use. Fantastic location and lovely hotel. I would definately stay here again	
Nov 9 2009 	Best choice in london for that price	Very good location in Kensignton, close to the subway, nice rooms design lounge style, friendly staff, I will come back as soon as possible...	
Nov 9 2009 	Nice Hotel with very good service	A nice quiete Hotel near Earls Court Tube Station. Clean rooms and very kind staff. I had a great stay at base2stay Kensington!	
Nov 7 2009 	clean friendly and a lovely convenient setting	I was first impressed by their website as i found it to be contemporary, and basic but it gave you all the information needed. enough pictures to give you an understanding of a basic room layout. I was traveling with my partner, and he too found this hotel to be the best suited in that area for a young couple, on a budget.when we arrived at the hotel we were best please. Its easy to find, and only a 5 minute walk from the nearest tube station, Earl's Court. We had a feeiling of security in this area and found it no problem to be walking at night, the area had a &quot;young&quot; feel which we liked. You are also offered discounts in local restraunts which should be accepted.The hotel itself had friendly staff, offering us a free map, and pointing out where the main attractions were, which was greatly appreciated. the rooms were cosy, clean, and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom had a large shower and we were given toiletries that were fairly traded, and smelt lovely! a nice suprise about the rooms also were that there is access to the internet via the television, which comes with digital view, and also you can listen to a variety of music for free also via the TV. I would reccomend this hotel to a young friend, who want to stay in a nice friendly place, and are traveling on a budget.	
Nov 6 2009 	Great service good location and well-appointed room	Great service, good location and well-appointed room. Really enjoyed the spacious bathroom, the kitchenette facility, free internet access, quiet location and tasteful, quality decor. A gorgeous, Georgian building transformed into comfortable, high quality accommodation, near the heart of London. Very close to Earls Court Station and amenities. An excellent base for a visit to London - business or pleasure.	
Nov 4 2009 	I'm A Snob And This Worked For Me!	We've stayed here twice and returning again next month. IDEAL location for exploring all of London. Everything is easy to reach from here. Earl's Court tube a short walk away; good connections to Heathrow; fun bus ride into City/central London/West End; great neighborhood'y vibe. Depending on room type, visitors from the US may be disappointed by space (or lack of it) but you shouldn't be-everything you need is in the room and you won't be spending much time in it. Great to be able to buy stuff and keep it in the mini-kitchen for breakfast or even a night in (M&amp;S, Sainsbury's &amp; Tesco all nearby). For solo women travellers-safe safe safe. Great fun restaurants nearby - Masala Zone, Wagamamma, Balans. Nothing to complain about in either of the room types we stayed in and even the most expensive are a good deal compared to other similar hotels (small, contemporary and cool). No room service but again, that's part of the fun - buy the stuff for less and have it handy in the room. I feel as if I'm coming home when I come here!	
Nov 3 2009	Can't beat this hotel in London	I had read about Base2Stay in travel magazines, but it's even better than they described. The hotel service was top notch, and every employee was quick to help with questions, city information and recommendations for restaurants - which turned out to be all great. The rooms are extremely clean and spacious in a great location of Kensington. Tube station is a block and a half away as well as the great restaurants they recommended. They also helped us plan our outings before we arrived in London and while we were there. I will stay here again - the prices are also quite nice for London. Ready to head back across the pond for this jewel of a hotel.	
Nov 2 2009	Base2Stay is a great find!	My daughter and I stayed at Base2Stay for three nights in October, 2009. It's located on a quiet street in a residential area. The Earl's Court tube station is a block away and connects you with all of London. Not a lot to do within the immediate vicinity but we rarely stick close to our hotel when traveling anyway so that was not a problem for us. I found Base2Stay on Trip Advisor. I expected a budget style hotel and was very pleased to discover a modern, nicely appointed property. Our room was one of the larger ones available and was extremely spacious with very comfortable beds and a great bathroom. The free internet available on the in-room flat screen tv is a wonderful amenity for those of us who do not travel with laptops. The entire property was very clean and tidy, and the staff is friendly and helpful. This property is a great find and I would absolutely stay there again.	
Nov 2 2009 	Just fine	Base2stay is a good place to stay. Friendly staff, very helpful, very clean rooms and bathrooms, 3 minutes walk to the underground, green policy, internet, ... Like it should be.Thanks.	
Nov 2 2009 	Perfect location great service	We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. It's in a great location - a very short walk from the Earl's Court tube stop which is on the District, Circle and Picadilly tube lines. It's very easy to get anywhere you want to go in London from this hotel. There's also a grocery store nearby as well as several restaurants, pubs, a movie theater and some smaller convenience stores and bakeries.The hotel is very clean, new, comfortable and well-kept. A friend and I stayed in one of the bunk bed rooms and it was perfect for what we needed. The beds were very comfortable and we were pleasantly surprised to find we had a little outdoor patio with a table and chairs through french doors at the end of our room. It was great to have wi-fi access and the bathroom was very nice as well.The staff was great the entire time we were there. We were greeted by Tony who was very helpful and friendly and who gave us a map and showed us how to get everywhere we were looking to go. Another night we decided to go to a movie and the girl working at the front desk was so helpful and printed out a listing of all the movies showing at the nearby cinema along with walking directions.I would absolutely recommend this hotel and if I ever go back to London (I hope I will) I'd certainly stay here again. It's a great value!	
Nov 1 2009 	Loved it!	base2stay far exceeded my expectations and was excellent value for money.Hotel and location: located just around the corner from Earl's Court tube station and about five minutes walk from Sainsbury's supermarket, so very convenient. The young staff were unfailingly friendly, professional and very helpful - nothing was too much trouble. I was afraid that for the price the hotel may have been a bit &quot;budget&quot; but I need not have worried - it's unpretentious but simply stylish.Room: I had a standard double which was fine size-wise for me (maybe a bit small for two people). Room was on the first floor (ie, floor above ground) facing the street, and apart from a very little noise from the street I was not bothered by noise at all - no sound at all from neighbouring rooms (and I am very sensitive to noise). Very comfortable, with a good bathroom complete with fantastic shower. Loved the dimmer lights that can be controlled from the bed, and the mini kitchen (hidden in a cupboard) is a great idea - saved me money and stress. And all was spotlessly clean. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend or to return.	
Oct 30 2009 	Convenient location and quality accommodation for a good price	The location was convenient to all of London. The hotel was nicely presented and staff great. The rooms are well fitted out but small.	
Oct 30 2009 	Good clean and value for money	I had a King room which was spacious, well equipped and very clean. It is located close to Earls Court underground station and a host of discounted restaurants along the Earls Court Road (ask at reception for details). The kitchenette facilities were a real bonus. The only minor niggle was a delay at check in because one of the receptionists was on a meal break.	
Oct 30 2009 	So much better than a boring hotel room	the well-named base2stay provided an excellent conveniently located base for a recent business trip to London.The single room, whilst small, was very well laid out with a beautiful minature kitchen in a cupboard, complete with microwave, crockery, cutlery, glasses etc and the proverbial kitchen sink! It's only a couple of minutes to M&amp;S food shop and loads of other similar, as well as being able to order food in - loads better than boring expensive mainstream hotels.The flat screen TV provided free internet, free music selection and film selections for only £2. Will stay again, probably in a double room.	
Oct 29 2009 	Excellent hotel for west of London	Attending a conference at Kensington Town Hall, I was very fortunate to find base2stay. The rooms are well-designed and well equipped. Not huge, but this is pretty normal for London. The staff are friendly and helpful. The free WLAN worked just fine. The desk included a European-style plug socket in addition to the UK socket, which was a nice touch and let me plug my laptop in without digging the converter out. Not important for everyone, but I live and die by my morning shower: the showers here were great (as compared to some places I've been where you get a trickle of luke-warm water).My only suggestion for improvement: in October, it's perhaps not the wisest move to leave the air-con on and set at 16C (on arrival).	
Oct 28 2009 	As advertised	I read a very positive review of this hotel in a newspaper (Daily Mail, I think) and so I booked it for a 4 night stay. It was exactly as advertised on their site and as the review stated. The staff were particularly helpful and pleasant. I reported a malfunction a/c and someone took care of it within 10 minutes.I'm a retired airline pilot who has lost count of the number of hotels visited; for the price, this was as good as it gets.As for the question below, I have already recommended to friends who plan to stay there.	
Oct 27 2009 	noisy if your room faces road	[1] location - good; [2] staff (all friendly except one lady who wasn't particularly friendly and didn't seem like she liked negative feedback); [3] furnishing - great. my wife particularly like the kitchenette and the heated towel rails; [4] sound proofing - TERRIBLE!!! Every step made by the occupant above you could be heard.i stayed 3 nights - first night in a standard room (in room L12) and the subsequent 2 nights in a superior room (in room L17). the first night was generally ok but the subsequent 2 nights was far from perfect. the main problem was noise. L17 faces the road which was about 3 meters away. every single vehicle that passed by could be heard clearly and even pedestrians walking was disturbing.i 'complained' to the front desk but was firmly told that there was nothing they could do since the hotel was fully booked. i would only recommend this hotel if you can get a room that is not facing the road (i was informed that there were about 10 such rooms in total).	
Oct 27 2009 	overhyped and overpriced	just returned from a stay in this hotel and slightly disappointed.the mini kitchen is no more than a cupboard and nowhere to sit down to eat.told when booking that we had connecting rooms for our family but on arrival had been allocated 2 separate rooms.area is ok but nearer to Earls Court than Kensington and didn't feel safe walking back from tube station at night.rooms cleaned every day and washing up done which was good, reception staff not that helpful when we wanted a taxi for the station when leaving.	
Oct 27 2009 	Good value in a nice location	We originally booked the base2stay hotel because of its good location near Earls Court tube station (both Heathrow and the city centre are very good to reach from there). The hotel is situated in the quiet and very attractive area of Kensington. Rooms are tiny, but include everything you need for a 3 days trip to a city (also microwave and a little kitchenette) and the (small) bathroom is neat and modern. The service is great - whenever you need advice or assistance, people are most helpful and friendly. Very good value!	
Oct 26 2009 	not as great as everyone makes out - relieved i got a discount price	Was expecting amazing things from this hotel as the reviews on here are consistently great. I have to say I came away feeling disappointed. The staff weren't particularly friendly, the room was fine but was at the front of the building in the basement so was horribly noisy about 5am and both mornings I stayed, I was woken by the laundry people banging around which was awful. The room could have been cleaner. The bathroom was awesome and the carpet was soft. But apart from that, it was just an average hotel. I got a really good discount so was 'satisfied' with my stay. If i had paid full price, I would have been furious about the noise and more disappointed than I am. Wouldn't rush back.	
Oct 26 2009 	Fabulous clean courteous and affordable	A group of us stayed at the Base2stay in late September. Having traveled extensively in the last 40 years I have experienced many hotels that charge an arm and a leg but fail to deliver.Not base2stay....we were welcomed by the courteous staff ( which is a feat on it's own in London)The rooms, although small by most standards, were clean, pleasant and well appointed. The concept works. No restaurants or room service. Which was just fine. The area around the hotel is peppered with dining establishments and shopping.Mini kitchenettes in every room. Very handy!Would I stay there again? In a heartbeat!I would especially like to commend the front desk staff. Bravo !	
Oct 25 2009 	I would stay there again	Hotel was in a good location. Staff were helpful and room was very clean. Nicely decorated. Had TV, wifi, broadband, microwave, fridge and decent china and cutlery. China and cutlery was clean, not chipped or dented. Nice bathroom, decent toiletries.Blow dryer was actually decent, a powerful one - they are usually pretty crappy in hotels.Room was very small but very compact. Luggage had to be stowed under the bed. I disliked this as I like having my luggage open on those luggage stands. Only other negative was it would have been nice to have a box of tissues instead of a packet of tissues.	
Oct 25 2009 	Simply excellent ! I will return without hesitation	I booked this hotel based upon the good reviews I have read here. I tried to book via booking.com...but this site said there's no place available. So I called the hotel directly and I mentioned I really would love to stay there and they arranged me a room for two the first night and a single room the second two nights...that was helpfull. The hotel is located at 2 min walk from the Earls Court Tube.Reception and welcoming in the hotel all went perfect. The room was very nice and the quality of the bed was excellent (I slept very well). You hear only little noice from the corridor and not from the rooms next door. The wifi is free but if you like to have high speed internet by cable, they charge you (I don't understand why ?). They dispose about an advanced TV system. My room had a modern kitchenette which I appreciated a lot.I will certainly go back next time I'm in London	
Oct 25 2009 	A great location to consider like home	After 5 times, I consider this hotel like my second house. I coudn't think to be in no other hotel in London and everything works fine.	
Oct 25 2009 	Very good and affordable hotel at Earl's Court	We were very pleased with the staff and the room. Also a few nice pubs and restaurants were near the hotel. I would really recommend the hotel for people who are willing to take care of breakfast themselves.Also a very nice bathroom and flat screen TV!	
Oct 23 2009 	Perfect choice for London break	For a family without a ridiculous amount of money to spend on overnight accommodation in London - but wanting somewhere nice and special Base2Stay is a great choice. We stayed for one night with our two teenaged children, there was a slight initial mix up with the beds - however the staff immediately went out of their way to sort this out. The staff were all very professional, efficient and friendly. Our room was a good size and spotlessly clean. The beds are very comfortable, there's free internet connection, a good shower and nice big towels. The temperature control in the rooms is good, we kept it cool which how we wanted it. We were also able to leave our bags early on the day of checking in and until late on the day of checking out which was really useful. We'd definitely stay again, it's located really close to Earl's Court tube where there's a good range of restaurants, we ate at Wagamama's with the discount provided by the hotel. Base2Stay really contributed towards us having a fun time away for a couple of days in London.	
Oct 22 2009 	great place to stay for a short business trip	The staff were very friendly and courteous. The room was very clean and tidy. They only need to put directions from the rooms to the elevator as it's not obvious how to find it, especially when you're carrying luggage up or down the stairs.	
Oct 20 2009 	Excellent! Modernclean top standards mini home with all you need	This is the second time we have stayed at base2stay and we will be back next year. We have our own lovely modern home and we like our home comforts with style so base2stay was perfect. The reception staff are friendly and well organised. The price is very resonable for the quality you get. If you like your own privacy this is perfect as once you are checked in no one bothers you and you can come and go as you please. The appartments are a 5min walk from earls court tube station so perfect for visting attractions, shopping and seeing shows. Also having your own mini kitchen means you can chill a bottle of wine and have a glass before going ti see a show. Overall an excellent place to stay.	
Oct 19 2009 	Absolutely Fabulous	We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel given our previous experience with British hotels. I loved its modern and minimalist look. The room was well appointed and the bathroom a good size. The high ceilings and large windows (which open) contributed to the feeling of roominess. The staff were extremely efficient and friendly. My teenage daughter (who is very hard to please) was delighted with the room's set up. The location is surprisingly quiet yet so close to all amenities and the tube. Having the free internet access was fantastic for checking up on train timetables and opening hours of some of the sites. It was great to have films for hire for only 2GP. We stayed here twice over a two week period and because we had such a good experience the first visit we couldn't wait to get back to our &quot;home&quot; the second time. We recommend this hotel highly. It contributed to a very memorable holiday.	
Oct 19 2009 	Great	Our stay was great. The place is clean, quiet and not too expensive. We thought the staff were very helpful , friendly and effecient. We would definitely stay there again.	
Oct 19 2009 	beyond expectations	We stayed here for a few days. We needed the front desk to arrange an appointment with a chirpracter which they did and gave us 2 options. The beds were confortable, service was unbelievable, location was great - best hotel i've stayed at!	
Oct 19 2009 	An excellent hotel	As a woman travelling alone, I cannot fault the feeling of safety both within the hotel, and walking from the Tube station late at night. The hotel is located in a pleasant and safe area.The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful, the room was quiet, immaculate and well appointed, and The Tube and local shopping at an easy distance.I would certainly stay at this excellent hotel again, and can highly recommend it.	
Oct 17 2009 	Great hotel	We stayed here 1 night in Oct. The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. There is no restaurant on site. There are several good restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is a short walk to the Earl's Court tube station. The room was big! The bed was comfy. The view out our window was not great. We overlooked another building. The room and bathroom were very clean. Our bathroom had a huge tube with shower. The flat screen tv on the wall also doubled as a computer monitor. The wireless keyboard was on the desk, but you could move it and sit on the bed and use it. Our room was quite, no hall noise. The hotel has a lift/elevator inside, but you must carry your bags up the front steps into the hotel. We would definitely stay here again.	
Oct 15 2009 	The only hotel I will return to on my next London visit!	Overall, my experience at Base2Stay was impeccable. From the moment I walked in I felt like I was in a 5 star hotel, and the staff were the most helpful people I met in London throughout my entire stay!My friend and I shared a Twin King Room which was more than enough room, and we made great use of the kitchen by microwaving our meals and keeping our groceries ice cold in the handy fridge. The shower was MASSIVE and I loved the temperature control handle!! In particular, Ashleigh and Tony were amazing hosts and went above and beyond the call of duty to make our stay comfortable. Ashleigh went to so much effort to assist us and made sight-seeing a breeze! The one and ONLY downfall the hotel had was that our beds were not changed for the entire 9 days that we were there, but that was a small price to pay considering the amazing location, staff, and service.We will definitely recommend Base2Stay to anyone thinking of going to London and I can't wait to return!	
Oct 13 2009 	An outstanding base to stay	The Base2Stay was a fantastic and well priced hotel in a convenient location. The rooms were very modern and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The ability to use the in room internet via the television and provided keyboard was also a plus for those who don't travel with a laptop.	
Oct 13 2009 	Second Stay as Great as First	I stayed at base2stay for a second time after first visiting in March 2008. The day I arrived, I realized that my toilet was not working. Within an hour of notifying the front desk, the maintenance crew arrived within the hour and quickly fixed the problem. My room was on the lower level, with the window overlooking the sidewalk. I thought the road noise might bother me, but it actually seemed to be quiter than the first-floor room I stayed in previously.The single room is the perfect size for someone who won't be spending a lot of time at the hotel (although my 27&quot; suitcase was a little too large to fit under the bed). The free Wi-Fi is definitely a plus. I would stay here a third time.	
Oct 12 2009 	Lovely comfortable and friendly.	During my recent week-long stay in London, I actually stayed in 2 different hotels, due to limited availability in each. It was an interesting opportunity to compare experiences. Between the two, I preferred base2stay. The hotel itself is very attractive and situated in a pretty residential neighborhood only a couple of blocks from the tube. One of the features I liked best about base2stay was the staff. They're actually British! It's rare to find that in the hotel business in London these days, and I really appreciated the opportunity to chat and interact with locals. The rooms were quite nice and very up-to-date. My absolute favorite aspect of my stay there was the bed. It was so comfortable. Unfortunately, the remainder of my trip was spent sleeping on what felt like a slab of cardboard, so I deeply appreciated my quality sleep at base2stay. The room was also dark and quiet at night, so the whole experience was restful. All in all, base2stay is certainly a great value, though I did pay less at my other location, where breakfast was also included (not so at base2stay). Regarding location, I liked the neighborhood very much, but Kensington is a little further out of the way of major attractions and the heart of the city than I'd ideally look for in the future. Expect to spend about 20 minutes on the tube to reach lots of the sights from here. With that said, I'm sure the vast majority of visitors to base2stay will feel comfortable, well treated, and pennywise. I know I did.	
Oct 12 2009 	FANTASTIC value in London!	I stayed at Base2Stay for two weeks in September 2009, and have nothing but good things to say about it. Although the room was small by American standards (I travelled alone so I only had a single), it was well appointed with everything I needed: a microwave and fridge, coffe pot, FREE internet, and even a towel warmer! The bathroom was roomy and the bed was comfortable with good (but not excellent) quality sheets and duvet. It is located one block from Earls Court Tube station, which gives you easy access to all locations in London and beyond. Also a block away (by the station) are several fast food restaurants (McDonald's, Burger King, et al), a few pubs, a laundromat, two small groceries, ATMs, and even a post office! While it is not in the heart of the city, transportation to any part of London is quick and easy, and the subruban location provides for a very quiet night.Everyone I encountered here was wonderful and very helpful. I wish I could remember the gentleman's name that helped me the most - he was fantastically nice. I travelled to Dublin for two days and left my luggage at the hotel. When I returned, not only was my room ready, but they had already moved my heavy suitcase into the room! WONDERFUL!I got a cheeky glance into some of the larger rooms when the housekeeper was cleaning and was really impressed! I highly recommend Base2Stay!	
Oct 12 2009 	perfect value for money	we found the base2stay as a perfect place in loondon. it is all you need. very small but very comfortable room in a good area and only 5 min. walk to the underground. we would definitely come back.	
Oct 11 2009 	We hope to stay at Base2stay again	The hotel was perfect for us. The desk staff was friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and comfortable, it was close to the tube, and the price was right.	
Oct 11 2009 	Very clean excellent service nice location	The staff was very helpful and friendly. The place is super clean. The location is very good - close to Earl's Court underground train station and shopping on High Street Kensington.	
Oct 10 2009 	We will definitely return	Exceeded our expectations. We were impressed by the level of quiet and the feeling of 'haven' so close to Earl's Court subway. We felt very safe walking in area. Kensington is posh, and the hotel fits in. It was very well maintained. Some interior noise (i.e. loud doors at night) but not bad. Staff were excellent. Kitchenette was small but well equipped. The M&amp;S is nearby for groceries, but we were disappointed with quality and selection. The Sainsbury's on Cromwell Rd is probably better choice. The restaurants we tried in area weren't great. When we wanted Eastern European food, staff recommended Wodka's at Kensington High Street stop. It was one of best meals on our trip. Tapas restaurant on Old Bromley also excellent.	
Oct 9 2009 	Our London home away from home!	Stayed here for three nights in London, it was a great base for visiting the city. The neighborhood was quiet and residential but only a couple of minutes from the Earl's Court tube stop. Our &quot;local&quot; pub The Courtfield was close by for pub lunches and afternoon pints! The room was small by over-sized US standards, but cozy and just perfect for London. We loved having a little kitchenette in the room, to store sandwiches and make coffee and tea. Staff was friendly and helpful, had good recommendations for local restaurants, and even stored our luggage for several hours after we checked out prior to our train time. I would definitely stay there again in London!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great Experience - Felt Like A True Local!	The Base2Stay was an absolutely wonderful experience that was not only a great value, but also provided an experience that most hotels can't; living like a local. I booked the Base2Stay online about a month in advance, and planned a stay for four nights. As plans changed over the course of that month, my stay was cut down to three days, and a short e-mail to the hotel (which came with a quick response) amended the reservation.I arrived into London Heathrow around 11:30am the day of my arrival, and took the Heathrow Express from the airport to Paddington Station. From here, it was a short ride on the District line from Paddington Station to Earl's Court station, which was within a 5-minute walk to the hotel. The walk was in a very well-populated area, and included passing quite a few restaurants, pubs, banks, and shops. The Base2Stay is in a very unique location, as it is surrounded on one side by a beautiful park and some other small hotels, and surrounded on the other side by some beautiful residential apartments that had to be in the millions.Checking in at the Base2Stay was a very simple process. Rang the bell on the door, walked in to the check-in desk, and just had to show credit card and passport. I was given a room on the Lower level (the &quot;L&quot; level), which was easily accessible by the elevator or stairs. The room, while not &quot;HUGE&quot; by any standards, was more than comfortable for myself. It included a bunk-bed setup, functional desk, spacious bathroom (with a great shower and heated towel rack), as well as a microwave, small refrigerator, and silverware/dishes for eating. Your room-key is inserted into a small slot in the wall upon entry to the room, which turns on the electricity (this both ensures you don't leave your lights on while out, and also that you never forget your key). Things like the air conditioning, refrigerator, and power plugs stay active even while the electricity is &quot;off.&quot;Everything in the room was very functional (including free wifi), and a healthy selection of TV channels allowed for plenty of entertainment in the room. I found the air conditioning to work great, and could get very hot or very cold depending on how you set it. My favorite part of the Base2Stay was coming back to the property and feeling like I really lived in London. I shopped at the local Whole Foods market (only one tube stop away) and was able to heat up food in the microwave or save groceries in the refrigerator.All in all, I would highly recommend this property for its value, great location, and wonderful amenities.	
Oct 8 2009 	Best hotel in London!!!!! AWESOME!!!!!	One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The staff are friendly and VERY helpful. Close to the Earl's court subway station and there are many restaurants nearby. The Nando's is good but the food is very spicy and the Gourmet Burger Kitchen [GBK] is also great for good meals. Two laundromats are within a quick walk. The rooms are small but comfortable. There's also a TV you can use as a computer [I'm typing this from the tv now] and a small kitchen.	
Oct 8 2009 	Great location comfortable rooms relatively inexpensive	Base2stay is located in South Kensington, a block from the Earl's Court Tube stop. This is on the Piccadilly line which conveniently goes to Heathrow and many of the main tourist attractions. There are lots of restaurants and food markets really close and the room came equipped with a small refrigerator. We saved some money and time by getting cereal and milk at Sainsbury's (10-15 minute walk) to eat breakfast in the room as we got ready.Base2stay even has deals with some of the local restaurants to give their guests discounts. The rooms aren't huge, but if you just need a place to sleep and recharge from busy days, it works great.	
Oct 7 2009 	Splendid experience!	My parents and I stayed here in mid-September for three nights. We loved having a mini kitchenette in the room with a mini fridge and microwave and saved a lot of money by preparing a light breakfast before we ventured out to go sightseeing. The hotel was walking distance from Earl's Court tube stop and about 5-7 minutes by foot from the closest supermarket. The rate was very reasonable! With wireless internet access and a flat screen tv with several entertainment features (my mom loved hearing Vivaldi while she ate breakfast), we couldn't have asked for a better experience. All the staff I interacted with were friendly and very willing to help whenever I had a question. (When I asked for more toilet paper in the room, it arrived within 5 minutes!) I loved the decor of the hotel-- sleek, minimalist, and modern. The next time I travel to London, I will be sure to stay here. It truly is a hidden gem.	
Oct 7 2009 	terrific - was the best find in London	Sitting here using the room's free internet with wireless keyboard on the TV, I have to say that this was truly the best choice after hunting on the 'net for ages. There are dozens of eateries nearby - take note especially of GBK, but avoid the Nandos. Two laundrettes within minutes walk, several grocery shops, including M &amp; S Simply Food. The kitchenette helped us quite a lot. We got 30% off GBK and there are similar deals on other restaurants. Our room for the three of us was exceptionally clean and the public areas and hallways show pride in the level of cleanliness as well. Staff are helpful, friendly and courteous. The area itself is very handy to get to Heathrow, as well as the major points of interest in central London. I would highly recommend base2stay if you are planning for the Olympics or any other holiday.	
Oct 6 2009 	Home Away from Home	Base to stay was exactly as it advertised! Clean,modern convenient and welcoming! My husband and I had a wonderful stay , great location friemdly and helpful staff clean and modern rooms. Just like home. The complex was well maintained , smely fresh and had all that travellers neede at reasonable price...We wil be back even if its only for the lollies at reception! Thanks Base 2 stay for making our anniversary a very special one..	
Oct 6 2009 	Noisy room no need for an alarm clock!	Pros: clean comfortable bed, very close to the aminities and tube station, nice area, fridge and kitchenette in the room.Cons: the noise from the road starts from 5 am, noisy fire door in the corridorThe whole point of getting the room was that I did not have to wake up early to catch the train so that I could be fresh for my business. I got woken up by the noise from the street (cars and people) at 5 am and it kept going until I left the hotel. My room (single) did not have double glazing or secondary glazing. When I checked out I mentioned about the noise and was told that I should book a room on the top floor or the back! Why do they have those noisy rooms if they are going to tell everyone not to use them?!!!The room and bathroom are clean although the shower cubicle is not spotless- the usual mildew and mould were at the corner of the seals. However, I would say it was totally acceptable.It is a shame about the noise, they should get it sorted rather than letting guests find out about it after they have stayed in the room.	
Oct 6 2009 	large clean and comfortable rooms	No problem accommodating four adults and luggage. Very clean and new. Excellent location, right by Earls Court tube stop.	
Oct 4 2009 	Really great stay on my first trip to London!	I stayed here twice on my recent trip to London. Initially for 5 nights on arriving in London and once for 1 night after I returned from touring around Mainland Europe. Both times I really enjoyed my stay at base2stay.Firstly its location is great. The nearest tube station is Earl's Court which is on the District and Piccadilly lines. You can catch the Piccadilly line tube service from Heathrow airport in about 45 minutes - really handy that you don't have to change trains. Secondly Earl's Court is the hub for the District line - the District line goes 5 different directions and its centre is Earl's Court. So overall I found the location of base2stay great considering it is only a few minutes walk from Earl's Court.Now hotels in London are not cheap at all - but base2stay is really well priced. Don't get me wrong it is not 5 star but it doesn't need to be. It does everything it claims to - and for me that is perfectly fine.The hotel itself must have recently been renovated because everything looked really new. The front desk staff were really great all the time - friendly and professional - and willing to help out if needed. I stayed in a single room both times and they were of a decent size. I didn't feel cramped at all - the bathroom had enough room to move about in without knocking anything. The TV had free internet on it - and whilst the controls were a little fiddly - I still used it each day with no dramas - it came it really handy. One slight gripe I have is with the shower - the temperature seems to vary slightly all the time - it did this in both rooms - not a big deal but did get annoying sometimes.Overall a great stay in London at base2stay - I'll be back when I return to London.	
Oct 1 2009 	Prime location very good concept and great staff.	We stayed here for 4 nights and had a great time. The staff was wonderfull, professional and very friendly.	
Sep 29 2009 	Great place to stay and terrrific value - easy access to central London	I stayed at Base2stay with my mother in August, after winning a 2-night overnight stay for two in the hotel's business card competition. I have stayed at the hotel many times before and cannot fault their rooms or service. The hotel is greatly convenient when you are arriving in London late or are leaving early. In addition it is very handy for Central London, via Earl's Court Station, located 4 stops on the District Line from Victoria train and coach station. Equally you can get to the hotel from Heathrow on the tube in about 45 mins on the Picadilly line. The staff are always friendly and will go out of their way to help. In addition you can be guaranteed to find a clean room when you arrive. The rooms all have built-in kitchen facilities, which is handy, as there are local supremarkets (5 mins walk) where food can be puchased. The hotel rooms also have listing for local takeaways, who will deliver, and there are vending machines with drinks, sweets and snacks. All in all a great place to stay &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AND thanks for a great prize, which my mother and I both enjoyed greatly.	
Sep 28 2009 	Super hotel.	We had a very good stay at Base2Stay. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. I liked the green ethos of the hotel too. Our 2 young children were well catered for and the ease of having a mini-kitchen helped with grabbing a bite to eat and warming things up for them (it had a good microwave). The bathroom was beautifully clean and well equipped for a comfortable stay. It's situation in Kensington near Earl's Court was very handy for both places to eat and travel anywhere around London. Also the proximity of the museums on the Cromwell Road was great for the kids.	
Sep 28 2009 	Base2stay is a small well-located hotel with a friendly staff and nice amenities at a reasonable price.	The rooms are small but very comfortable, nicely appointed and immaculate. The ingeniously concealed kitchenette is a wonderful convenience if you don't feel like going out for a meal. There are wonderful markets and gourmet takeaway shops just up the block. Moreover, the staff has a &quot;not a problem&quot; attitude about taking care of requests or responding to any difficulties. The price is bargain by London standards where even average lodgings can be exorbitant.	
Sep 28 2009	Great location amazing customer service- definitely would stay here again!	My Mom, sister and I stayed in the triple for 2 nights at base2stay and we were really pleased. The location is very close to the tube and with great restaurants within walking distance. We have stayed in European hotels before this trip so we were aware of the room size when compared to American hotels but our bathroom was big!!! The hotel is very clean and new. There also was a sweet patio attached to our room which was a nice place to unwind before dinner. We would definitely stay here again!	
Sep 27 2009 	Exceeds Expectations	Base2Stay turned out to be a great find. Good location midpoint between two Tube stops: Gloucester Road (Picadilly, District, Circle lines) and Earl's court (District). Nice neighborhood. Although there was a small mix-up when checking in, it was quickly and graciously rectified and I was given an complimentary upgrade. Although the room I initially was shown - L4 - looked good too, and had a terrace! My room on the First floor was immaculate, with a small efficiency kitchenette (microwave, sink, fridge, plates &amp; glasses, etc.). Quiet and good-sized room. Excellent front desk staff who were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Really added to the whole experience. Would definitely stay again and longer than one night!	
Sep 27 2009 	Everything you need and more	We booked a night at this hotel based on the recommendations seen on trip advisor, and were not disappointed. The room was fairly spacious by London standards, with quite a large bathroom as well. I had asked for a room with bath if possible and this was provided. The small kitchenette with fridge and a small amount of crockery and cutlery allows you to make cereal and coffee in the morning, which is great for people that aren't partial to mammoth english breakfasts. Decor was tasteful and the furnishings comfortable. My husband loved the large screen internet access in the room. Staff were friendly and helpful. Most importantly it was quiet, with no street noise, and in a pretty street with charming houses just off the main thoroughfare.	
Sep 25 2009 	Best place to stay in London	I have stayed in London a number of times and have to agree with all the other reviews - this is a GREAT place to stay. Convenient to everything, lovely room, great staff. We had a room on the lower floor and it was SO quiet you wouldn't even know you were in a big city. Air conditioning was very welcome as it was hot in London while we were there. Won't be staying anywhere else on visits to London.	
Sep 21 2009 	Wonderful	My husband and I stayed here two nights and found the hotel to be a perfect way to stay in London comfortably in a nice location. There is no restaurant or room service or massive lobby but that's not what we needed. Our room was very nicely decorated and new and very clean. And I'm very picky The free wifi worked well. There was a small kitchenette even. We were on the 4th floor facing the street and did not notice any street noise. The staff were very friendly and helpful and even gave us 30% off at a near by restaurant. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from the underground. The quality for the price was excellent.	
Sep 19 2009 	In a class of its own!	I stayed 10 nights in a single room at base2stay on my recent London vacation. It met my rather high expectations, based on reviews on TripAdvisor and elsewhere, in most all respects. I already knew and liked the area, and the base2stay staff were invariably helpful when I had questions about local shops and restaurants.My room was tiny but clean, fresh, and adequate as a base for my vacation; I was rarely there during daytime hours. Its single window was large and looked out over a quiet mews; I never heard any street noise. However, sometimes I heard stomping footsteps on the stairs or creaking floors in adjacent parts of the building. The clothes closet was a pretty good size but the hanging area was a bit too short for a couple of my jackets - and there wasn't a hook in the room on which to hang a coat (not counting the small hook on the inside of the bathroom door). I liked the kitchenette-in-a-cupboard, which allowed me to keep some food on hand and enjoy coffee, tea, and a snack or light meal in the room. The fridge doesn't keep things as cold as my home fridge in the US; a review here mentioned this so I wasn't surprised, and it did keep some cheese and a few bottles of water cool enough for me.The bathroom was a winner, with a comfortably sized shower, good sized sink, attractive tiled finishes, a generous ledge for my toiletries, and a wonderful large heated towel rack. Kudos to this hotel's designers, who could probably have fitted in a few more rooms by creating the ridiculously tiny en suite bathrooms found in many a London &quot;budget&quot; hotel, but did not!The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful - Tony in particular! This was great value for the money; the hotel felt upscale, quiet and exclusive, and I was always happy to return to it at the end of the day. It's new, clean, and fresh. The only serious shortcoming, in my opinion, is the lack of a communal sitting room or lobby sitting area. I'm sure that omission is part of the concept, but if this hotel's owners ever build another base2stay, I hope they revisit this issue. I'm already browsing the internet to plan my next trip to London, and although I'm finding cheaper room rates, I'm not finding any lodging options that really compare to base2stay in the same price ranges.It's definitely in a class of its own.	
Sep 16 2009 	GREAT choice!	My husband and I chose base2stay based on location, value, room amenities and its high ranking on tripadvisor.com We were very happy with our choice! This was our third trip to London together and have stayed nearby previously; base2stay was nicer and less expensive. It's a super location just a 3-4 minute walk from Earl's Court tube stop which is on the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines for easy access to just about everywhere the usual tourist would want to see. Its location on the Piccadilly line means direct access to Heathrow in about 40 minutes with no stairs except for the four to the door of the hotel.Front desk was very friendly, yet professional; check-in and out very quick. As requested, we were given a room with a king bed (two twins &quot;zipped&quot; together and made up as a king) in a quiet location away from traffic, elevator, etc.Room small by US standards which is to be expected just about anywhere in London. Very well set-up, clean and comfortable. Tiny, efficient kitchenette with microwave, ref, dishes, cutlery for 2. Bathroom large by UK standards with a window which I liked for ventilation. Loved the heated towel rack. Big ledge for toiletries.Luggage storage space under the bed. Decent sized wardrobe for hanging clothes and a couple of shelves and drawers. We're not the types that completely unpack our suitcases into the available drawers, etc so we did notice there is not room to leave your suitcases out without crowding the room and in our case, blocking the kitchenette. Very nice linens and duvet, mattresses okay, but not great, which I mentioned to the hotel. Might be because of no box springs to allow for the storage space.Earl's Court area has many eateries;we love Nando's for chicken which is just 1 block west of the tube station (that's to the right as you're facing the station). The hotel does offer laundry service if you're desperate, but there is also a launderette around the corner. One BIG TIP to a happy international vacation is to PACK LIGHT!!All-in-all, a big thumbs up on base2stay. Only minor points are the mattresses not being at the same quality level as the rest of the room and the lack of suitcase space. Neither of these would keep us from booking this property again especially since we will NEVER over pack again!! Definately check out their website for more details, etc. Note-single rooms are tiny by US standards.	
Sep 14 2009 	The best service the nicest rooms and a great location	base2stay is located in a quiet area, yet close to Earl's Court tube and is therefore the perfect starting point for trips to downtown London and the Kensington area. The service is A+ and the rooms are high class, especially given the moderate price level. Definately recommendable.	
Sep 13 2009 	Everything was as promised	You alway wonder, after booking a hotel based on tripadvisor reviews, whether it will live up to your expectations. Well, base2stay lived up to all expectations - and more. We arrived at 11am (well before check-in time), meaning to drop off our bags and check in later. But, we were told that a room was ready for us...and we were immediately &quot;at home&quot;. We had a lovely quiet outlook over green gardens. Everything was just right - the hidden kitchen, the internet, the large bathroom, the comfy bed. And after check-out, we left our luggage for safe-keeping, then were given a place to freshen up at the end of our day before we left the city. Just wonderful! So, we were able to utilize the services of base2stay for about 34 hours (with a one night stay) - quite amazing! Thanks for providing a base for us in London.	
Sep 11 2009 	Good value...but SMALL rooms	The location of this hotel is ideal being just 2 blocks from the tube and close to many restaurants and pubs. The decor is very minimalist-chic and the service was very good. The front desk staff was extremely nice. Our only two complaints were that the room was awfully small (but that's understandable given the loc.) and that there were no irons in the rooms. If our 12-yr. old had not been with us, this would likely have been a decent room - especially for the money...but with the third bed in the room, there was hardly anyplace to even put our suitcases, much less walk around one another. When my husband needed an iron, it took thousekeeping over an hour to find one...and then when he plugged it in, it blew a fuse...so that took another 20 mins. to resolve. Not time you want to spend in the (small) room when there is so much to see in London to see! I do believe the relatively small investment in individual irons/ironing boards for each of the rooms is warranted - especially since base2stay is advertised as a &quot;hotel&quot; - where hotel-like amenities are expected. Overall, I think this is a very nice hotel in an ideal location for seeing all of London - but probably better suited for the single or couple traveling and not planning to spend a lot of time in the room...	
Sep 10 2009 	Ideal base2stay	We stayed here for the second time in July this year (previous visit July 2008) and would agree with the positive reviews posted. This place is ideal for travellers who are out &amp; about each day and simply need an excellent base2stay whilst they explore london. The location is great, convenient for the underground but in a quiet road. The staff were very helpful before and during our stays. It is small enough to be friendly and welcoming but with the elegance of a quality hotel. Take time to walk around the Kensington area with its interesting architecture and visit the markets - eg Portobella Road &amp; Camden as well as the busy traditional sights. A visit to the local museums is highly recommended.	
Sep 8 2009 	Clean and modern. Well located. Very helpful staff.	My wife and 9 yr old son were very happy with this hotel. Everything was very clean, with a modern aesthetic. The kitchenette was a plus - tucked away nicely. The hotel is well located. Short walk to Earl's Court tube (direct line to Heathrow), or Gloucester tube (District and City lines for the main sights). Good restaurants on Earl's Court, especially the Gourmet Burger place. Walking distance to the excellent Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Harrods/Harvey Nichols a bit further down. Staff were very helpful. Booking activities, recommending restaurants, keeping our luggage after checkout. Would definitely stay here again.	
Sep 8 2009 	Great hotel if you are an independent traveller	Excellent facilities, very new and high quality. Helpful staff, convenient location in Earl's Court with very easy Tube access, and a quiet street for a good night's sleep. Squeaky clean. Rooms are small (depending on which category you book) but the ceilings are high. The mini-kitchens are very handy and the staff are very willing to recommend local restaurants, some of which have negotiated discounts for hotel guests.If you would like a good location but not in the thick of Oxford Street, a high-service hotel but do not need room service, and are generally pretty independent, then this is a great hotel at a great price. I used to live in the Earl's Court area and I always stay here when visiting London. We have also brought our two-year-old son there and stayed comfortably, but needed to book one of the larger rooms.	
Sep 8 2009 	Posh convenient lovable	Base2Stay was top notch. The staff was excellent! The hotel itself is very newly remodeled and they've done an excellent job on it. Absolutely beautiful. The neighborhood is quiet but very close to 'attractions' if that's what you're into. If you're just there as a retreat, then you'll enjoy the tucked away location away from busy streets. My single room felt more like an efficiency suite (read - very small) but that's typical in London where real estate is at a premium. The bathroom is nearly the size of the room and all of the fixtures are top quality. You'll want to lounge in the cavernous shower all morning! The bed was very comfortable, dare I say the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in. Overall, highly recommended. My last bit of advice, call for the best price.	
Sep 6 2009 	Why would you stay anywhere else in London!	Great location, tastefully decorated and cosy, comfortable rooms (the matresses are divine), staff were great, in-room internet access. Perfect and very secure. A great place to rest after a day of intense sight seeing. And loads of great eating options at your door, from pubs and restaurants to a very handy Marks &amp; Spencers supermarket round the corner on Earls Court Road for in-room dining. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in London and will definitely be back.	
Sep 3 2009 	very nice little hotel in Kensington with free internet flat-tv and more ...	Very nice hotel in south kensington - close to Courtfield road with many restaurants, supermarkets and any kind of shops. 3 minutes to underground station Earls Court. Very attentive staff at the reception.highlite: free internet on flat tv in all rooms - free tv and music on demand.Good service.	
Aug 30 2009 	ideal for staying with children	I haven't read previous reviews, so this is based exclusively in my personal experience.I stayed for 6 nights with my family at the end of August 2009. Two adults and two 3 year old kids.The hotel is very well located, in South Kensington, very close (3 minutes walking) to Earl's Court metro station, which corresponds to three metro lines: Circle, District and Piccadilly. Reaching any point of central London is therefore very easy. If you fly to Heathrow, it is just 35 minutes away on the Piccadilly line.The area is very pleasant and quiet, no traffic and no night disturbance.The hotel is absolutely clean and new, spotless. Not a single complaint in this regard.It is not a cheap hotel in general standards, but it is very reasonable considering prices in London. Besides, we got a huge room, and that is definitely a pleasant difference. I have previously stayed in London in hotels costing double for a room which was one third in size.The kids got a sofa bed which had almost no difference with the main one. Big and comfortable.The bathroom was also big and new, with a really big bathtube. The towels were really plush and we had a lot of them, one and and one bath.Service was very good. Fast, attentive and efficient.There are only two small downsides. First, the hotel does not have a restaurant and breakfast is not included in the price. In exchange for that, you have a small kitchenette, with microwave, a small fridge and a sink. The idea is that you can buy your breakfast and other meals in one of the nearby supermarkets (there is a Sainsburys at 5 minutes walking distance which is open 24h on weekdays and most of the weekend) and have it there. Maybe it is not a comfortable solution, but at least is a cheap one. Besides, if you go with small kids, which are usually picky with the food they like, this solution is probably better than adapting to normal restaurant menus.The other thing we did not like is that they were somewhat mean with the soap and shampoo and we missed other bathroom commodities normally found in hotels. This is certainly no big issue, but it is in contrast with the overall high quality of the rest of the hotel. In summary, I would certainly recommend Base2stay to anyone, specially if they are going with small children. It is comfortable, clean, very conveniently communicated and has big family rooms. I will surely repeat in my next visit. There are many restaurants nearby and there	
Aug 27 2009 	Great Hotel	We stayed here in September of 2008. The staff were very helpful, and even let us into our room early at no extra cost. The rooms were spotless, and yes a bit small, but it's London. The rooms looked brand new, and despite being in the basement with a street level window, it was quiet. Loved the internet on the TV too! Would totally stay there again.	
Aug 26 2009 	Great service friendly clean modern quiet	We stayed for one night. The hotel looks practically new, and the entire place was spotless. Our room was lovely, very comfortable bed, the staff are friendly and eager to please, the hotel location is very convenient, yet on a quiet street. The decoration and furnishings are up-to-date and tasteful. Mini-kitchen is well stocked. In-room films are wonderfully priced, only 2 pounds. With heavy luggage the converted old house style of the hotel is ever-so-slightly inconvenient since there are 4-5 stairs to manoeuver, even with the good lifts, but not much can be done about that, I guess. Staff are the biggest asset, on duty 24 hours a day and full of wordly advice on local attractions, transportation, restaurants, supermarkets, etc. We walked to the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. 24-hour supermarket only 2 minutes away. We will definitely return.	
Aug 25 2009 	Simple but luxurious comfort	Base2stay have hit on a great idea . If you're happy to look after yourself with just a room, fridge, microwave and ensuite bathroom in a &quot;Hotel&quot; that has no other facilities like bar, restaurant, lounge etc then this is completely brilliant.They've taken care with the stuff that matters like lovely mattresses, linen and modern simple &quot;Farrow and Ball&quot; decor and not wasted (your) money on unnecessary frills.The bathrooms are simple but good with fantastic power showers and fluffy towels.Very central but quiet and lots nice places to eat and drink a short stroll away.I'll definitely use it again, as does my fiancee who uses it for business trips a lot.Only drawback is no lounging space in your room or anywhere else so will probably only suit if you'll be out most of the time.	
Aug 24 2009 	Great place for Mother/Daughter weekend	After reading the reviews, I chose Base2stay for our mother daughter weekend. It is located near the Earl's Court tube station. I didn't have a detailed map or directions, so the first time looking for the place took a few minutes. There were restaurants and fast food nearby, to satisfy both me and my eleven year old. The staff was very helpful and accomodating. They booked our bus tour and were willing to book any other sight seeing or theatre tickets. They gave us directions and recommendations. They were friendly and efficient. The room was the perfect size for the two of us. The shower was large with a glass door. The room and the bathroom were very clean. We were able to check our email from the free internet on the TV. We will stay here again on our next visit.	
Aug 21 2009 	Everything About The Stay Was Wonderful!	We found the rooms to be comfortable; the staff to be very accommodating. The location was perfect for our needs.	
Aug 21 2009 	Excellent location and friendly staff that helped make our visit a great experience.	Base2Stay is close to excellent restaurants and the Tube. Hotel staff were very helpful in arranging rail travel to other parts of England. The hotel is on a quiet street. The rooms are a little small but very functional.	
Aug 21 2009 	One of the best stays I've ever had in England!	I was unfamiliar with the hotel when booking, but just needed a place to stay for one night in London before we caught a flight the next morning back to the states. My wife and I, with 2 children in tow (4yr and 6yr) weren't sure what to expect. I've stayed at some high price places in London previously that would have been condemned in most other cities. Imagine our surprise at Base2Stay! From the moment we walked in we were welcomed warmly and thoroughly by the staff. They were all very pleasant and their customer service could have been used for a training seminar.The hotel itself was had all of the attributes that we truly value in a place to stay. It was very clean, all the way from reception and through the halls and the room and bathroom. It had a TV that actually worked, as opposed to 90% of other places we stayed in which the TV is nothing more than a prop. The bathroom was exceptional with a shower large enough for this husky gentleman and water pressure that actually made you feel clean, not just damp. The price was extremely reasonable!If I had to throw in a few cons, they are not much different from other hotels in London. The hallways are narrow, and even if you use the elevator (lift) you still might end up navigating a couple of small sets of stairs. The rooms are also quite small, although the way they are arranged, even fitting 2 adults and 2 small (or one medium, heh) children does not feel cramped.Overall it's the perfect place to stay in London and next time we visit, I'll make sure this is our main stay instead of just a stopover.	
Aug 19 2009 	Good location pleasant staff clean but small rooms	We were there for 2 nights, 2 rooms in early August. Close to underground. nice neighborhood, very pleasant staff. Rooms very small but since we were only there for 2 nights, it was not an issue.. Had rooms on top floor, very quiet. Small issue with rates but was resolved later (in my favor). Would definitely return to this hotel but would book larger room if stay is longer than 2 nights.	
Aug 19 2009 	A base2stay hotel with a luxury tint	I have stayed in the hotel for 6 days and the overall experience was very positive. The hotel is simple, clean with an effort to balance between business and luxury hotel. The location is perfect... near Earls Court tube station (2min on foot) you can reach almost every destination in London... at the same time the road in front of the hotel is really quiet. I have stayed in a single room. Even though I was expecting to see a small room I was surprised by the space provided. It is not big... but it is not small... it is exactly what someone (at least European) needs when booking a single room. I think I have been provided one of the best single rooms because the view was fantastic. One minor issue was the sound insulation of my door as noise was coming into my room (I could listen what was happening in the corridor)... but the hotel is not busy so... it was only a couple of times that I heard something loud.Concerning the issue of Green tourism and ecology I can say that I am a little bit puzzled merely because I find it as a way to eliminate running cost... but nevertheless that is my opinion.In addition Wifi is for free... but sometimes the signal goes off and is not stable... there is also internet TV so someone can read e-mails or surf the internet through the TV or even listen to the radio or music via a TV jukebox... all these for free....The hotel does not provide any special amenities such as bar, gym, breakfast but if you ask the friendly and helpful staff... they will be more than happy to serve you. I do mean it! They will do the best possible to satisfy the customers and find a solution. They always smile and they always support!In overall I would recommend you to try this hotel... at least once... I am sure that it will become one of your favourite choices...	
Aug 17 2009 	Everything you need is here.	I stayed at base2stay for 6 nights on my first trip to London. The location was great - about 5 minute walk from the Earl's Court Underground Station and very easy to get to and from Heathrow Airport. The room was clean and nicely decorated, exactly as depicted on their website. The kitchenette and free internet browsing from the TV were very handy to have, both of which are often lacking in hotel rooms at this price. The staff were friendly and helpful. I appreciate their efforts to make your hotel stay as green as possible. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to London and would recommend this hotel.	
Aug 16 2009 	Great stay.	We really enjoyed our week stay at Base2Stay. The staff was extremely helpful in helping book a couple of tours and also with providing restaurant recommendations and directions. I would definitely recommend anyone wanting a good experience to stay at Base2Stay.	
Aug 16 2009 	Great place to stay in central London	I would thoroughly recommend Base2stay as a stopover in central London. Room was small but had everything I needed. The staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Would definately stay here again.	
Aug 14 2009 	Bijou experience	Nice and very professional staff at reception, nice minimal but confortable decoration. Room too small even for onde person. Enjoyed very much location.	
Aug 13 2009	Funky new hotel - but what's with the doors?	Very handy to Earls Court tube station and lots of nearby eateries. The hotel is a modern refurb and there is a lift. For some reason the doors have a really large gap at the bottom, which means that anyone talking in the corridor sounds like they are in the room with you. A rolled towel in the gap helped.	
Aug 11 2009	Two thumbs up...	The location is great, the staff is friendly, the rooms are excellent and the price is a bargain. I like it and will stay there next time, too... The rooms are perfect for sightseeing or just getting a good sleep/nap - small but stylish. Highly recommended..	
Aug 11 2009	your ideal home-away in London	I am glad i have decided to book at base2stay becuase this hotel is absolutely superbyou feel really like at home and coming back to your room after a day spent walking all over London is so relaxing.The room was clean and spacious. you don't have the same unpleasent feelings you have in other hotels of the same price in london.i defenitely reccomend itFilippo	
Aug 11 2009 	Great place. Great Service.	My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights of sight-seeing in August. The hotel is in a very good location - you can get anywhere from Earl's Court station, and it's convenient to Heathrow. The rooms are well designed, comfortable, and the bathrooms are wonderful. Excellent service from friendly and helpful staff. The only minor negative was the small fridge - an &quot;absorption chiller&quot; as we learned that does not get nearly as cold as what we're used to - or even really much colder than the room... Our milk spoiled. According to the staff a proper fridge would be way too loud. So if you're counting on the fridge, be aware. Otherwise great place.	
Aug 10 2009 	base2feel comfortable	the hotel is a really nice and cosy place to stay. it's stylish but not overdone, just the right style to feel relaxed after a long shopping tour with your best friend!	
Aug 10 2009 	Nice hotel great value good neighborhood	Base2stay is an excellent choice for travelers that plan on being active -- and only use the hotel room as a place to sleep. The room is very clean, it's in a very nice neighborhood and the service from the staff is excellent.The only negative thing I'd say about it is the one chair in the room is VERY uncomfortable.	
Aug 10 2009 	Great stay	Excellent location and room. Very nice to have mini kitchen in London and all the facilities, beds, bath, etc are high quality and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. Staff very professional and helpful, especially Mr. Potter! Overall excellent quality and value in London.	
Aug 8 2009 	Excellent value for money	Although the rooms are small, the hotel is very clean, newly decorated and in a convenient location for site seeing. The small kitchenettes are useful for family breakfasts, and there's a Mark &amp; Spencer food shop within 5 minutes. The front desk staff is very helful. The cheapest single rooms (which we booked for a teenager) are very small...I wouldn't want to spend more than one jet lagged night in one. We actually upgraded both rooms after we arrived to get a bit more room to move around.	
Aug 5 2009 	Fantastic service and cost benefit	Great hotel and great deal: rooms are really practical, very good taste in decoration... bed is very very confy, shower is really good, and you can even find a mini kitchen inside the closet! Very clean and a great place to rest after a busy day.Sis extreeeeemelly friendly and helpful - they even offered me to print some stuff with no charge. Free wireless, discounts in local restaurants and a very fair priced vending machine at the hall reallu show you the hotel thinks about your convenience.Location is great too - 5 min walk from subway station and in a very pleasant neighborhood.Will definetly stay there in my next trips, and recommend it to whoever is looking for a convenient and no frills stay (and that doesnt mean poor, old and bad decor and bad service at all here).	
Aug 5 2009 	Great little hotel	We stayed in a double room for a few nights before we headed off to Bath. It was recommended to me by a friend as being a clean, modern hotel with reasonable rates for London. We agree.The hotel is a converted Georgian building located close to the Earls Court tube station (1-2 minute walk) but set back from the busy streets in a quiet area. We didn't find a great deal of nice restaurants in that area though the pub on the corner close to Earls Court station was decent. The room was very clean and modern with a little micro-kitchenette hidden behind doors which come in handy if you want to keep or prepare food (there is a Mark's and Spencer's nearby). The bathroom was also very clean and modern. High speed internet and a room safe were also provided.The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the rates were very reasonable for London. The only small complaint I would have about our room was that it was small. It's just big enough for you to walk around the bed with a bit more space in front of the bathroom and front door. The ceiling seemed to be a little lower than normal too - and we're small people. They do have larger rooms available for a higher rate though I don't know if it is warranted in a city like London where you will be out for most of the day anyway.	
Aug 5 2009 	Great hotel	Terrific location, 2 minute walk from Tube station, clean, neat room (double was not huge but comfortable), great shower. Extremely warm and friendly staff. Highly recommended.	
Aug 3 2009 	AWESOME TERRIFIC FABULOUS!!!	There were 6 of us in our travel group from Hawaii and London, UK was the last stop on our European adventure. We were all so happy that we chose to stay at Base2Stay...what a way to end our trip! The service was exceptional...ALL the hotel staff went above and beyond for us. They were very knowledgable and friendly. The hotel rooms were just the right size, very clean and modern. Great location, near the Earls Court train station, grocery store and many great restaurants and bakeries nearby. Definitely one of the BEST hotels we stayed at during our trip and we will stay there again in a heartbeat when we visit London again!	
Aug 2 2009 	Great hotel	Base2stay is a lovely, quiet hotel in a great location. Earl's Court is not my favorite part of London, but this hotel is on a quiet street removed from the bustle, yet still close to restaurants, banks, grocery stores, and the many tube lines that serve Earl's Court station. (And the elevator to/from the Piccadilly line means getting to and from Heathrow with no stairs!)The rooms are nicely decorated, with a modern, clean look, and the free wireless is a great bonus. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the rooms immaculate. My room was so quiet, it was hard to believe that I was in the middle of London. While I never cooked any meals in the kitchenette, it was very handy for breakfast (the hotel doesn't offer any meals, but who wants overpriced hotel food, anyway?).	
Aug 1 2009 	Clean comfortable and riduculously affordable	The hotel itself is located in a quiet neighborhood, only a couple of blocks from Earls Court tube station. The front desk staff, especially Tony, were very helpful and polite. I traveled with a friend but we had separate single rooms; though small the rooms were clean and well set up, each having a little kitchenette. For those hot summer stays, the rooms can be air-conditioned to United States standards if desired.	
Jul 28 2009	Good value for moneyneat safe and good location	I had been to London several times and I found this hotel by far was the most value for money. I had stayed in other hotels in London earlier costing more than £150 per single room with less comfort. I payed £96 for a single room at base2stay and my room equipped with a nice and clean kitchenette. There is a nearby bakery round the corner of the street . I chose to eat my breakfast there everyday. The size of the room is small but it was clean and comfortable.	
Jul 28 2009 	Excellent hotel	Great location within walking distance of Earls Court tube etc. Plenty of good restaurants nearby. Smart clean hotel, maybe a bit pricey but was worth the extra money to stay at a bright and clean place with plenty room	
Jul 27 2009 	Clean Comfortable Safe Friendly and Affordable	For 2 women traveling alone, this was a perfect spot. Safe, very close to the Earl's Court Tube Station, clean and the best front desk staff you could ever ask for - knowledgeable and very helpful and all with a sense of humor (rare, anymore). Room wasn't large, but we didn't spend much time in the room, so we didn't mind. Plenty of room under our beds for our suitcases. Beds were very comfortable, the kitchenette was a nice addition, shower was fantastic and it was all we really needed. Quiet location on a side street, but very convenient to restaurants, the Tube, and the supermarket. Plus, the price, made our 3 night stay very affordable, by London standards. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. Keep up the good work (and the sense of humor).	
Jul 26 2009 	Great	I've stayed now several times here in a double occupancy situation, and in different rooms. The place still feels like a great offer for the price range in this area of London. Location is quiet, but just around the corner from Earl's Court Tube station, and so a range of places to eat out, buy food, dry cleaner / laundry, internet cafe etc... Perfect. The style feels still newly renovated and modern, but retains a warm feeling of being well looked after. I mean, rather than that sense walls and railings are painted over ten times already, or carpets cover something up. This is styled in a good way. The details are solid and importantly for me the rooms are quiet (at least inbetween rooms, but like everywhere, it also depends on how loud a guest will be in the hallway too! As a rule though it is quiet) The kitchenette is of course, a small but very adequate unit, the bathrooms always a good size as is the shower, the flatscreen tv big and offerings good, wifi is available for free when I was there. It all works and if there is some issue, as far as I have felt, the staff tries their best to get it right. When I arrived far too early from my flight, they even have rooms to rent reasonably for the hour or so before my room is normally ready, in case I needed to freshen up at least. I never write reviews but I wanted to for base2stay, because until now it has been a solid bet.	
Jul 26 2009 	Excellent for long-term stay	I stayed 2 weeks on business and it was a wonderful hotel for this. The kitchenette was a godsend, the fridge stored plenty of fresh foods and the microwave and teapot were absolutely adequate. As everyone has said, the Earls Court location is ideal, the tube, stores, and many other essentials (e.g. post office) were all within 5 minutes walk. The only slight complaint was that as others said the mattress was too soft, it sagged to the springs in some parts. The twin size bed I had could also be challenging in that it was against the wall, so you couldn't splay out in the bed as you might like. Oh, on the internet, the wifi was perfect on the laptop, but definitely, don't bother with the TV version. The corner room I had was super bright and cheerful and quiet and I would definitely stay there again.	
Jul 24 2009 	Very confortable "base camp" to visit London	Well located in Earl's court. Friendly and efficient reception. Confortable and clean bedroom, but bit small. Tiny kitchen and bathroom quite big compared to the bedroom. Internet with TV (not very practical but useable). A good place as base but not to stay all the day (too small).	
Jul 24 2009 	great for the modern traveller	Base2Stay is a great find, located in Kensington between Earl's Court and Gloucester Rd (about 7 minute walk from each). The hotel is &quot;noveau basic&quot;--no frills like a gym or a restaurant, but nice, clean, comfy/cozy rooms with flat screen tvs, kitchenettes, good showers and in-room internet. Perfect if you're the kind of traveler who wants an affordable place to stay but is past the age where hostels and crappy accommodations are acceptable. The staff are ridiculously nice to boot. The only minor drawback is its location--depending on what kind of nightlife you like, it can be a bit far if you're out past the tube's closing. Nonetheless, I will certainly stay here again if I'm in London!	
Jul 23 2009 	Great base	We had a lovely stay here. Thoroughly updated building with stylish sophisticated decor. Smart bathrooms not cluttered with free samples. NB No hairdryers. Big comfortable bed, Quiet at back of building with pretty view (Rm; Q6). Very helpful staff with discount vouchers for many local restaurants. Close to tube. Made everything very easy, would stay here again and recommend to others.	
Jul 23 2009 	base2stay is best to stay	I just completed my third base2stay vist in the last 18 months. As a frequent business traveler who accumulates over 100,000 miles+ a year, I think this is one of the most unique hotels in the world. Yes, the rooms are small but they are very clean and extremely well appointed. And the staff is always exceptional. If you are looking at probably the best hotel value in all of London and your tastes don't run towards hotels like Clarideg's, look no further!	
Jul 20 2009 	a gem of a hotel in London!	base2stay Kensington was an excellent hotel and we loved staying there July 2009. I traveled with my cousin. This was her first time in London, and my third trip. I wanted a hotel that was out of the bustle of the very center of London, but not so far away that there was no energy. Picking Kensington was the perfect Choice!The hotel is located only a block away from Earl's Court tube station (District and Piccadilly lines). The area has a lovely neighborhood feel surrounded by rows of white townhouses, but just a walk away to the tube station is a lively commercial area with restaurants and shops and a convenient super market for supplies.Our room was clean and well stocked with the usual simple amenities. The kitchenette was great! It comes complete with mini fridge, microwave, sink, and dishes. Comfy bed, spacious modern shower, plenty of closet space, flat screen TV, and free internet browsing were the highlights. The staff were friendly and professional. They gave great advice for what was located around the neighborhood and provided some discount coupons for some local restaurants. I recommend trying the Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Balans for breakfast!.Really a wonderful hotel. Book early to get a good rate!	
Jul 20 2009 	Truly great!	We stayed at this hotel for three nights in mid July. The staff was very fríendly and helpful, the room great, as well as the area. The free internet was useful when looking up restaurants and other places to go.I would really recommend this hotel to anyone!	
Jul 20 2009 	Clean and tidy at a sane price	My wife and I stayed at Base2stay for 5 nights in July, at the peak of the season. Although we were given a room with a view to the trash area, the rest was just great. The room was of good size (compared to previous experiences at European capitals). It is evident that a lot of effort was given to make the room as comfortable as it was, and to keep the hotel spotless. Would definitely book there again. It must be mentioned that there is no breakfast available, but this was not an issue for us, as we enjoyed looking for a new place to get our espresso at every day. Great stay.	
Jul 17 2009 	Great location small rooms friendly staff some WiFi issues	The location within a few minutes' walk of the Earls Court tube station was ideal--from there I got to the airport, national train lines, and every attraction I wanted to see. Although many mention small rooms, be aware that the single rooms are REALLY small--so small I couldn't do some back stretching exercises prone because the walls weren't far enough apart! While the staff were friendly, they did not have the authorization and tools necessary to deal with some WiFi speed and reliability issues I had one day--it was pretty much unusable that day but if you want to pay you can get cabled access that is presumably faster and/or more reliable (I didn't use that.) The authentication system for WiFi is a bit cumbersome--it requires putting in a code every time you connect, so even if you just take a quick break outside with your iPhone, you need to re-authenticate each time you return. Overall from what I've heard about London hotels, though, on balance this hotel is a very good option.	
Jul 17 2009 	Delightful room exceptional service	Lovely hotel and a superb room with patio leading to a small private garden. Although just a few minutes stroll to the busy Earls Court Road (with lots of bars and restaurants), the hotel was in such a peaceful location - no noise at all.The reception staff were about the best I have ever experienced - friendly, helpful and informative. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you.	
Jul 17 2009 	Nice room great staff relatively convenient location	Very nice hotel. I stayed 4 nights in a single room. There was a nice courtyard view, nice furnishings including a desk and of course the very useful kitchenette, shiny modern bathroom, but little floorspace for my suitcase. I had a minor, minor issue with my shower, but it was fixed without my mentioning it the next time housekeeping serviced the room.You can use the internet via the TV, but it's not easy. You can only see a portion of the screen at a time. Good for quick use to check flights or something, but not great for general surfing.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful with local info. The Earl's Court area has almost everything you could need - grocery, banks, bakery, restaurants, and of course a Tube station on the District and Piccadilly Lines.It was a splurge for my travel budget on this trip, but a welcomed upgrade as the last of 5 hotels I stayed in around the UK and really quite worth the price.	
Jul 17 2009	Fabulous service and staff	We went to Base2stay after a rather unpleasant experience at another London hotel. Cheerful staff actually brought a tear to my eyes. Nothing was a problem. Room (twin) was clean, modern, a little small but we were happy all the same. Thank you, thoroughly enjoyed and will definitely recommend.	
Jul 16 2009 	Great hotel and excellent location	A great hotel with friendly, helpful staff and in a lovely location. Would certainly recommend it to anyone.	
Jul 16 2009 	very nice place to stay i'll be back again	good location, very clean hotel and rooms, very friendly people	
Jul 15 2009 	I Just Don't Get It!	That this property appears as the 15th best in all of London is mind boggling!Now, there was nothing at all seriously wrong with my stay here, or my room (a double on the ground floor). It was just all so... ordinary. This is really a serviced apartment more than a hotel - you won't find most of the standard services you'd expect from a hotel. Even if according to Trip Advisor, it's the 15th best hotel in all of London. With virtually no amenities. Go figure...As others have noted, it feels more like a dormitory (okay, a newly-renovated dormitory) than a hotel.The room was quite small (which was expected). And it's impressive how they've fit a small kitchen and ample closet space in there. The decor was relatively new, and I suppose if you buy your furniture at Ikea, you'll really love it!It's well-located if you want to stay somewhere away from the standard tourist areas of London (which I did), in a lovely, peaceful residential neighborhood. The Earl's Court Underground station is about a block away. There are plenty of restaurants and markets within walking distance.As others have noted, the soundproofing in the rooms is almost non-existent. I could hear every door slamming up and down the hallway. And every step the upstairs neighbors took actually shook the ceiling. Someone from the hotel responded to a similar complaint here by writing something to the effect of, &quot;the sounds are more noticeable because it's so unusually quite here.&quot; It IS a quiet, peaceful neighborhood, but that's a very poor excuse for what to me was a major soundproofing issue. And claiming the building is noisy because it's old is also a cop-out. I've stayed in many old hotels that have somehow successfully managed to deal with this issue. This is the single biggest reason I will not stay here again or recommend it to others.But what do I know? Most other Trip Advisor members apparently think this place ranks higher than some of the world's finest hotels.	
Jul 15 2009 	base2stay worked out very well	We rented 2 rooms (spouse and self, second room for 18 and 20 year old sons. Pros: Very good location, minutes from Earl's Court Underground (see tube map) and bus stops and walking distance from many pubs and restaurants. Very nice neighborhood. Desk staff are excellent hosts who were courteous and knowledgeable and accommodating. Management takes cleanliness seriously, has a team approach. Security good, need swipe card to get in front door. Cons: In room internet poor and did not work with AOL but if you bring laptop you will have good internet access. Rooms are a tad small but probably not unusual for London. Small chair and table under wall mounted flat screen TV. Small frig and microwave and pot for boiling water. Outsourced fitness center. Overall we were very pleased and would go back again.	
Jul 13 2009 	All that we expected	We stayed at base2stay for 7 nights. I had done a lot of research before choosing base2stay based on other tripadvisor reviews. I was expecting a lot and the hotel really delivered. The room was well-laid out, looked brand new and had relaxing artwork on the walls. The kitchen, with its stainless steel counters, was very serviceable. All of the staff we encountered could not have been more helpful. They were helpful in accomodating our Sabbath needs, opening the electronic doors for us as needed. We would love to stay there again!	
Jul 13 2009	An excellent base to stay!	We stayed at Base2stay Kensington for 1 night July 2009. There were 8 of us staying in 3 apartments all going to see Take That at Wembley! All 3 rooms were excellent; just what we wanted, a bit of luxury for a brilliant price. We had a misunderstanding with 1 of the rooms which was quickly sorted out by the reception staff. The rooms were clean, modern and fully equipped, we didn't need any thing more. The staff were very helpful, knew the area well and recommended great a cafe for breakfast. All of us would definitely use Base2stay again. A modern hotel in a central location for a great price.	
Jul 13 2009 	Convenience style fantastic service reasonably priced - what's not to like?	This was my second stay at Base2Stay, and I'd stay there again. What took me there in the first place was the &quot;kitchenette&quot; (really a microwave and fridge) that allows you to prepare meals in your room. But what keeps me going back is the immaculate cleanliness, the friendly and helpful service and the convenience of the location. It's within walking distance of a number of key London attractions (Harrods, the V&amp;A, the Natural History museum) and a step away from Earl's Court tube station. The rooms are tiny, and I found the arrangement of my first room, where the desk area was right next to my bed, more convenient than this time, where the desk was at the foot of my bed (it's nice to have somewhere to put a glass or a cup beside your bed), but that's a very minor complaint.On my last day there, I left my bags behind the counter after I checked out. When I went back to collect them in the late afternoon, the desk clerk earned my undying love by asking me if I needed to use a toilet before I set out (I did) - now that's very thoughtful service!	
Jul 13 2009 	First Rate	I wanted to write directly to say that our visit at Base2stay was excellent. The 'green' rooms were great and very neat and clean!The staff was friendly and helped with our train bookings in London and made our transportation go very smoothly.I appreciate the assistance! We were at another hotel that just directed us to a computer, needless to say, Base2stay will be recommended by us to friends from Chicago who visit London often.	
Jul 13 2009 	Wonderful clean great location and helpful staff.	The staff at Base2Stay made our vacation exceptional. The hotel was friendly, quiet, clean and had exceptional accomodations. The location is superb! We will always go back to Base2Stay in London.	
Jul 12 2009 	A pleasant hotel at a reasonable price in the heart of London	We were greeted promptly by the gentleman on the reception staff and assigned a nice room on the first floor away from the street. The room wasn't overly large, but was very clean with a large comfortable king size bed and a sleeper chair for our teen. Free Wi-fi a definite plus. There are ample places to eat (from a quick bite, to pubs, to sit down restaurants) within 5 minutes walk and the Tube stop (Earl's Court) is only a block and a half away (which is convenient for the Picadilly line for access to Heathrow and the District or Circle lines for the popular tourist sites). A bit pricey ..., but not out of line for room costs in a large city.	
Jul 12 2009 	Excellent modern sympathatic hotel near the tube nice neighboorhood!	A very good modern sympathatic hotel with all the things you need. Near the tube, in a nice neighbourhood with all sorts off restaurants and shops. The staff is genuine friendly and not because they have to. Booking.com made a mistake with our reservation, so no room at the arrivaldate. No problem! The staff did really everything to give us a base2stay. We really got a warm welcome!	
Jul 12 2009 	This is a GREAT place to stay!	This was our third trip to London in three years, but our first time at base2stay. My husband and I stayed here with our two young daughters for 12 nights from late June into July. We had rooms L1 and L2, which are on the lower floor and each have a terrace outside. Our girls loved their bunk bed room! It was small, but really well layed out so that they had a comfortable amount of space. My husband and I had a double deluxe which was spacious. All the beds were very comfortable. These two rooms are at the end of a small corridor, so that we locked the door at the end of that and formed a &quot;suite&quot;. It was great! There isn't an actual door that directly connects the two rooms. We were at the back of the hotel and weren't bothered by street noise at all. I don't know how noisy it would be in front, but the hotel is situated off of the main streets. We did occassionally hear people 's footsteps in the room above us, but it was never bothersome.The hotel is extremely clean and bright and looks exactly as it does on their website.The daily maid sevice kept our rooms spotless. They clean any dishes or utensils that you use from the kitchenette, too. We didn't take full advantage of the kitchenette, but it was really handy to keep a few things in the fridge. The location is not to be beat. It's an easy walk to the tube or bus or to find a taxi, with a Boots, a Marks and Spencer's food store, and post office about two minutes away. There are all types of restaurants in the immediate area. The hotel gives you discount cards for some that they recommend and the ones we tried were all wonderful. We ate breakfast at Balan's several times!But what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. Without fail, everyone person at the front desk was kind, helpful and genuinely eager to make our stay as pleasant as possible. They responded to any question or request with such thoroughness and willingness it was incredible. My husband was especially impressed with that and said &quot;I've never stayed anywhere with people so truly eager to help&quot;. We've stayed in many lovely ( many five star) hotels over the years but base2stay really has something on them all. Everything our family really needs and actually uses in a hotel is here. if you're looking for a spa and a restaurant and a conference room, etc, it isn't here. But we never use those things anyway! This is a fantastic hotel and we look forward to staying here again!	
Jul 9 2009 	Just a perfect stay.	We just returned from a wonderful brief visit to London, and Base2Stay was one of the best things about our trip. It's exactly what it's billed as--just what you need when traveling, without any unnecessary extras, and an outstanding value in an extremely pricey city. The hotel is centrally located, a block away from the Earls Court tube station, which is right on the Piccadilly line (45 minute straight shot on the Tube from Heathrow, 10-15 mins into more central parts of London) and the District line (easy access to Wimbledon, Kew Gardens, the Notting Hill area, and all attractions along the river). We arrived really early on a red eye flight the first day, and were checked in by the very energetic and helpful Tony, who apologized that our room wasn't yet ready (it was 8am!), and gave us some helpful local breakfast recommendations. Our room (L4) was immaculately clean (really clean, like Japanese ryokan clean), with simple, soothing decor, comfortable beds, crisp linens, perfect climate control (it was HOT during our visit), a strong, hot shower, nice toiletries, and a lovely little outdoor patio with a table and chairs. It wasn't huge, but it was substantially larger than far more expensive rooms I've had in London on prior trips, and it definitely felt larger than its actual size. They had free wifi, a large TV, and a small kitchenette with a microwave, refrigerator, and plates, cups, and utensils that they replaced each day as needed. The neighborhood was really nice--not far from busy streets with restaurants, convenience stores, a branch of Marks and Spencer with fresh fruit, produce, and lots of prepared foods, and Sainsburys (grocery), but quiet and residential nonetheless. After long days of walking around London, we were really happy to come back to our lovely room, sit out on our patio, and enjoy the nice London weather (we were lucky) with some seasonal cherries, strawberries, and iced tea. We're fairly independent and didn't need any particular assistance from the staff, but they were extremely friendly and always eager to answer any questions or help with any travel arrangements. I wish more hotels would follow the Base2Stay model! We will definitely stay here again when we return to London.	
Jul 7 2009 	Bed Bugs	We stayed here for 4 days mixed business and pleasure trip. The first morning, my partner and I woke up with red welts. Theses continued / increased nightly. This only happened at night at the hotel, including on places of the body covered by bed clothes / pajamas. I was disappointed with the response of the staff, though they allowed us to change rooms. (I was actually asked if I had ever been to London before and if I wasn't perhaps allergic to London.) After the room change, the irritation stopped. The hotel did follow up with a letter, claiming nothing was found. I cannot recommend this hotel.	
Jul 6 2009 	Great place2stay	This is my third time at base2stay, room was clean and fresh as always. Staff are always friendly and welcoming. Depending on what your plans are in London depends on whether it's a good location, for us it was perfect. Hotel is clean and new, little kitchenette was well equipped. Definitely would stay here again for business or leisure.	
Jul 5 2009 	great hotel	I stayed here for 3 nights with my teenage and twenty-something sons.It was perfect for us. The hotel is very clean, nicely furnished with beautiful, modern bathroom/showers, and convenient to everything; short walk to bus and metro, lots of restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, bakeries and pharmacies. We especially appreciated the beautiful, safe neighborhood, the air conditioning, elevator, wireless internet, mini kitchen (microwave and refrigerator), and very reasonable price. The staff was excellent - very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again.	
Jul 3 2009 	Fantastic choice highly recommended for all	Loved the hotel. Great location - beautiful &amp; quiet residential neighborhood, immaculately clean and stylish deluxe room with mini kitchen and enough space for our family of 4 (including 2 teenage boys), terrific and always cheery staff. Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer close by to bring in basic provisions. Easy walk to the museums (V&amp;A, Science, Natural History) and Harrods, and the tube stop is a 5 minute stroll. Just a 15 minute ride to get to Wimbledon. Would recommend base2stay in a heartbeat to anyone travelling to London!	
Jul 3 2009 	Excellent	Thoroughly recommended, nice location - central but on a quiet street, excellent staff, comfy clean room.	
Jul 2 2009 	Recommended	Very good location, great staff, clean bathroom and bedroom. The only minor negative is the very small bedroom, which I expected. Overall great value	
Jul 1 2009 	Fantastic concept good location great service	This is really the way to go for the traveller who does not intend to spend all their time in the room. No room service, no resturants, no fitness centre, no business lounge, no club floor, no breakfast. What they do provide however are spotlessly clean and comfortable rooms, a very clever free interenet service via the TV in each room, a little kitchenette with a microwave where I could heat up food, plates, wines glases and cutlery (a great idea), a kettle and a little vending machine for water and little snacks.Location was not smack in the centre of town, but it is in a nice, safe residential district, and close enough to get into the heart of town easily. The hotel is only 3 minutes from Earl's Court Tube station, which has the benefit of being a terminus for the District Line and being on the Picadilly LIne as well - very easy to get to Soho, West End etc. Earl's Court is also great for the fact that it is one of the few handicap friendly Tube stations, which means easy access to elevators (useful also when you are lugging luggage around).Kudos to the absolutely fantastic staff as well - they were welcoming, helpful and gave the impression that they would do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I was late for a lunch meeting and had to drop my host of rather heavy bags and run without checking in, only returning late in the evening. When I got back, the bags were already neatly in the room, with all the documents ready for a quick check-in. Brilliant.Finally, another great idea was that they have was the availibility of rooms for booking by the hour after checking out. This is fantastic for travllers (like us) who had a flights in the evening. We could chill out in the room, take a bath, use the facilities, before getting picked up to go to the airport. A great boon.	
Jul 1 2009	Home away from home!	As a frequent taveller to London I have stayed at many hotels, but this definitely it the best. It's «home away from home». The location is perfect, with easy acces to the city and Heathrow Airport. The staff is very friendy and helpful. The rooms are very comfy and have all you need. I especially liked the digital radio with a great selection of music. And the kitchenette is just super. This definitely is the place to stay when visiting London. On business or pleasure!Barbara, Bern/Switzerland	
Jun 29 2009 	A perfect Base2Stay!	Previous reviewers have more than covered all of the excellent aspects of Base2Stay, however if I could just mention a few of my own -1) Location - stunning, handy, quiet, beautiful2) 'The Team' - absolutely 5 Star - these folk are genuinely great at prividing hospitality - (note to owners - look after them and keep hold of your staff - there are 100's of other places in London who 'sholud' have staff as good as yours, and who are charging 3 or 4 times the rates you do. But your team's pride in their jobs is obvious - well done all!)3) Showers - nothing worse that a bad shower - the Base2Stay showers are FAB!All in all a great stay - and the Bruce Springsteen concert we attended in Hyde Park was amazing too!	
Jun 27 2009 	Hop skip and a jump from Earls Court.	The first thing you notice is the security of the Hotel - you need to buzz for reception before you can get into the front door, then use your security key once you have checked in. The second thing is the welcoming friendly staff which never ceased to continue throughout our two day stay at the hotel along with the bright, fresh reception area - the large bowl of sweets offered on the reception desk kept the sugar levels up as you leave for a day out shopping in town . Our ground floor room was very clean with a view over a mews courtyard and the on suite bathroom/shower was also very clean, although the shower head had a mind of it's own when it came to getting a shower, it kept tilting forward like a 'limp' lettuce and needed to be placed quite firmly into it's holder for it to work correctly, but over all this wasn't a problem. And once mastered, the push button toilet worked very well.The TV reception was a little pixelated at times but this could be due to the hot weather (25 degs) causing a bad signal and reception said they would look at it if it was causing a problem. We didn't watch too much TV for this to be a problem.The kitchenette was 'compact and bijou' and very cleverly hidden behind closing doors with sufficient, crockery and utensils for anyones needs. Do take some basic supplies when you stay such as milk and tea bags, although supplied by the Hotel, but were not topped up each day - we understand you can order 'Breakfast Boxes' from reception at a reasonable price.Base2stay is a good place to stay and reflected good value for money compared to other family members who stayed in nearby cheaper Hotels with lower standards and noise from the underground trains. Base2stay is just a very short walk from Earls Court Station ( no noise from the underground in our room) giving you easy access to the rest of London - we would recommend the 'pay as you go' Oystercard for travelling on the Underground and Buses. There are many lovely Coffee shops, pubs and convenience shops also within a short walk, which gives it a 'Village' atmosphereKensington /Earls Court has some wonderful streets to wander around with its whitewashed Georgian houses /Mews that reflected the sun. Where flower baskets hung on almost every Windowsill and Doorway. Where the trees in the nearby private parks provided much needed dapple shade on what was a very hot and sunny two day stay in London.	
Jun 27 2009 	Fantastic location great hotel.	This is the best hotel in this price range, in this area. The location is very convenient, close to The Tube (use Earls Crt if you have luggage, it has a lift). The offer of a room to use for showering/changing is great for early arrivals after an overnight flight. The rooms are very comfortable. All the staff we dealt with were extremely pleasant and helpful.	
Jun 25 2009 	Wonderful hotel charming staff spotlessly clean (and green)!!	I shared 2 rooms with my sister brother-in-law and nephew for a total of 6 nights. The hotel was perfect for our stay. Our rooms had wonderful showers, small kitchenettes and a flat panel TV with free WiFi. I think the staff was the best feature of all. Each day they recommended excellent cafes and pubs as well as great trips for sightseeing. The hotel is located just a 3 minute walk from the tube station at Earls Court. I give Base2Stay a 5 Star rating!!!	
Jun 24 2009 	Charming hotel that worked well for us	My wife and I stayed here during a recent trip to London. We had made early booking arrangements for two nights. About a week prior to our trip our plans changed and we realized we actually needed three nights. Upon contacting the staff they were able to help us out. They apologized in advance as we would have to change rooms mid way through our stay. The first room we stayed in had a toilet that didn't always flush at the first push of the button. Nothing happened. Not a big deal as it would flush on the second or third go. The transition from our first room to the next room went very smoothly. The staff moved our bags, and belongings in the fridge, for us and clearly instructed us to check in with them when we left that day, and upon returning. The second room had a glass shower door that opened the wrong way. Apparently a prior guest saw fit to fiddle with it. The door was corrected the next day without me even mentioning it to the staff. I presume they saw this when prepping the room and took corrective action.Some of the rooms can be a little snug, however that is not unusual for a building of this vintage, or for European hotel rooms. The mattress in our second room was more than a little worn out. The internet and tele worked well and as expected, they had recently added WiFi however I can't comment on how well it works as I didn't bring any WiFi devices with me on the trip. I gave this hotel a 3 on the value scale mainly due to the currency conversion rate. While the prices were appropriate based what we saw for other London hotels, it is a bit pricey when converted to USD.The staff was easy to work with and friendly. If you are calling them from the US check out their website for a US 800 number.	
Jun 23 2009 	Great concept which works well!	We liked this base2stay concept. You get a clean comfortable room with some very basic cooking facilities, free internet, nice staff, efficient cleaning services, cheap room movies, air cond, etc, in a great location near a hub tube station in London. What more can anyone want in London?	
Jun 23 2009 	warm and friendly	Nice staff, clean and comfortable rooms. Close to earl´s court undergrond it is a very good place for a city break.	
Jun 22 2009 	Perfect!	Stayed for one night in to see a play at Royal Albert Hall and everything was perfect. Friendly stuff, great neigborhood, clean and stylish room, good value for money, close to subway, really a perfect find for a city like London. Yes, my room was a bit small, but it made me feel like back in student times... !	
Jun 21 2009 	NIce modern design excellent friendly service good location	Location pleasant and very convenient to the Tube, yet quiet. Very clean room had excellent ventilation, great plumbing, many conveniences, pleasant view and good lighting. Service was excellent - got great guidance and prompt response to anything I needed. I traveled with my two children and it worked out very well for us. Safe area. Mattresses could be firmer.	
Jun 19 2009 	Great place to stay with a toddler	We travelled with our son (almost 2) and requested a portacot for the room. This was already set up waiting for us when we arrived. We had one of the larger rooms (Duluxe room I think it is called) and whilst not huge, there was enough space for us, the portacot and toys and books. The kitchen facilities were practical and hidden away in a double cupboard out of our son's reach. The room was very clean and had a great feel about the place and the decor was stylish. The reception staff were really helpful and friendly. We were there whilst the tube strike was on so really appreciated the fact it is an easy walk to the museums. Definitely recommend the place, our only criticism was a slightly hard to use toilet flush which is so trivial it shows how impressed we were during our stay!	
Jun 18 2009 	Super Duper!	We stayed @ Base2stay in April 07 for 5 days. We must say, that everything was PERFECT! The rooms are trendy, clean, and modern, a little small, but at the end of the day, it is just a &quot;Base2Stay&quot;. The Bathroom is amazing, nice limestone tiles and lovely and clean. The shower was brill, lovely and powerful and everything you want in a shower. The Location is excellent, I personally do not think you can find another Hotel closer to a main Underground station (earls Court) and lots of good restaurants in earls court too, but not loud, which makes a good nights sleep!!Base2Stay is a cheap &quot;No Frills&quot; hotel, which when you are in London, you won't be spending much time indoors anyway, so if you don't want a hotel restaurant, a swimming pool etc, then Base2Stay is the place to be!Overall, we recommend Base2Stay and wouldn't stay anywhere else when in LondonThank you for the great hopsitality!	
Jun 17 2009 	Very clean comfortable affordable	My 13 yo and I stayed at base2stay for six nights in June 2009. The staff was very helpful and accomodating, the room and common areas were very clean, and it was affordable in an otherwise fairly expensive city. Very conveniently located one block from Earl's Court tube, too. No room service, but very convenient food delivery options. Overall, it was great.	
Jun 16 2009 	Perfect for family visit to London	Base2stay was absolutely perfect for our our family's first visit to London (my husband and I have been many times, especially me on business and a business expense account!, but this time we travelled with our 13 year olf son). Our room was extremely well designed, exceptionally clean and fresh - the bathroom was spacious and new. The Earl's Court neighborhood was a easy to navigate and not too far from all the expected London attractions - nearby restaurants were reasonable (and the hotel provided special discount coupons for some). A Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Food was a block away - we filled our kitchenette with juice, muffins and fruit for breakfast and snacks to much on before heading out to dinner. With the costs of travel these days, base2stay was a terrific value. I have already recommended it highly to my best friend and her family.	
Jun 15 2009 	great place	i only stayed for a night at base2stay but I was impressed by the value for money. As I was with my teenage son, we stayed in the bunk room. It was small but had everything we needed and was impeccably clean. The hotel is really stylish and modern and I was impressed by the caring and friendly attitude of the reception staff. it's a lovely area of London and only about 10 minutes by tube to Victoria. I will certainly stay again.	
Jun 15 2009 	brilliant base for sight seeing in london	We stayed at base2stay for two nights and had a fantastic time. The staff were polite, friendly and helpfull. The room was plenty big enough for the three of us and was lovely, modern and very clean, it basically was everything we needed. The location is great, a few minutes from the tube and and nice area so that you feel comfortable coming back at night.I would highly recommend this place to any one looking for good affordable accomodation in a great location and hope to go back one day myself!	
Jun 14 2009 	Top quality	I just spent eight nights at Base2Stay and can only give it the highest of marks.The reception / concierge (everyone is extremely polite and eager to help with each and every inquiry) I hope TripAdvisor will allow me to say that Ashley is a real Aussie Doll. She is a true asset to the hotel.House keeping is impeccable. Bathrooms are large and well equipped. Free WIFI is a pleasure. We stayed in several rooms during our stay, as we didn't book ahead and they have returning guests requesting specific rooms. Our favorite is L4 - quiet, spacious and has its own terrace with table and chairs.The Deluxe room unfortunately faces the street and gets noisy.What a pleasure to find the kitchenette with fridge, micro wave, contemporary dishes and even clean up service.Base2Stay is an easy 3-4 minute walk to Earls Court Tube and lots of bus connection.Walking through the residential area is a real eyeopener. This is a very upscale neighborhood. We were very impressed with the large private parks for the individual areas. Lost count of them on our walk to Fulham Rd.M&amp;S Take away has great and varied prepared meals. Boots is close by as are lots of pubs and fast food places.If I do have one little complaint, it was the beds. Albeit, they were comfortable enough,. I did feel the springs. Down pillows were a compensation - where do you find that?	
Jun 14 2009 	Great Hotel met all expectations. I highly recommend to stay here.	My wife and I stayed at this hotel based on other reviews from this site and recommendations. We had an excellent stay! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They helped us with directions, booking attractions, and useful tips about the city. The room was clean, safe, and pleasant. The hotel is very close to the tube stop Earls Court which is very convenient for getting around the city. There are numerous restaurants and pubs within walking distance of the hotel.	
Jun 13 2009 	Unbeatable value for money	All the good stuff people say about this hotel is absolutely true. We were just passing through London for one night, our normal B&amp;B was full and we ended up here. It was more expensive (£132) and didn't include breakfast, but this an excellent, spotless and well run place to stay. The room was well-planned, had everything you could need (including an excellent shower) and the staff works really hard to make you feel welcome.. So, if this is inside your budget, don't hesitate.	
Jun 13 2009 	A Good London Base	Staff were helpful, hotel well-maintained &amp; in an important enough location that was not too badly affected by the recent tube strike.Convenient stores nearby provide surprisingly decent microwavable foods, if you happen to be shocked by London restaurant prices.Would especially like to thank the gentleman at the reception who helped us out on transport alternatives during our stay!	
Jun 12 2009 	Great concept perfect location excellent value	My husband and I stayed here June 2-9, largely based on tripadvisor reviews. We couldn't have made a better choice for value, location and service. We stayed in a standard double, directly behind the reception area. We arrived on an early morning flight and took the tube from Heathrow, arriving at base2stay about 9:30 am. Though the room wasn't ready, they took our luggage and advised us to come back just after 11. We explored the area on foot, discovering that the Earl's Court tube stop is no more than a 3 minute (really!!!) walk away, and that there are tons of cafes, restaurants, pubs, and food shops in the immediate area. We picked up a few groceries at Sainsbury's, had coffee in the in-store Starbucks, and then headed back to the hotel, to find the room all ready and our bags awaiting us inside. Though the room itself was quite small by American standards, it was well laid out. We stashed our two suitcases under the (wonderfully comfy) bed, and made full use of the closet area, which had several shelves, adequate hangers, and a small safe.The built-in kitchenette saw lots of use; there is a small fridge, glasses, crockery and cutlery for two, a microwave, immersion kettle and a small sink. As others have mentioned, a toaster would be really helpful, and there seemed to be an electrical outlet which could accommodate one. We had breakfast in the room each day, which was very handy.Our bathroom was large, and it seemed equipped for persons with disabilities, as there was NO shower door or stall, as such...just a walk-in area with 3 shower heads (a people car wash, as it were!) After a first disastrous shower with water EVERYWHERE, we learned to just use the middle shower head, and all was well. The towels and bath products were wonderful, and there was one large, and a smaller sink in the bathroom. The staff at base2stay was terrifically helpful, especially when there was a glitch with the WiFi (which came in wonderfully handy.) It was the quietest room we have ever stayed in, and we slept better than we ever have at any hotel, which is saying a lot, as I generally don't sleep very well away from home.Take advantage of the often significant discounts offered at local restaurants; we loved As Greek As It Gets, Strada, and Gourmet Burger Kitchen, and the discounts really helped, as food was generally more expensive than I had expected. All in all, an outstanding choice; we would stay there again in a heartbeat, though we might try to spring for the superior double next time, for a bit more room.	
Jun 10 2009 	Great for families - none better!	This was the perfect base for our family trip to London. It is close to the tube and busses, it was comfortable, modern and clean, and a very good value for London. Instead of paying high prices for restaurant meals that our young children would barely eat, we brought in food from nearby shops, used the kitchenette in the room, and everyone ate well without the high prices. The staff was always helpful, for example they ordered pizza delivery for my son, and gave us travel advice.	
Jun 9 2009 	Loved this little friendly hotel!!	We chose Base2stay for our London trip based on Trip Advisor recommendations and were not disappointed. The location was excellent, it felt residential but was only a 3 minute walk to Earl's Court Tube and close walking to High St. Kensington and local shopping. Our room was very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. The room noise was minimal and the temperature was perfect. The staff went above the call of duty to meet our requests and needs. We felt the the price was reasonable and were pleased with the quality that we received! We will plan to stay here again on our next trip, we really can't recommend it enough!	
Jun 9 2009 	Great Hotel in great location	Came to London for the first time with my wife for two nights. The hotel is two blocs from Earl's Court Station and we chose the hotel based on great reviews and were not disappointed. The room was in excellent condition as you can see in the pictures I've attached. You also have a small kitchen you can use. My wife and I preferred to go to a café near the hotel.At the front desk you can get coupons for restaurants in the area and recommendations for tours and places to visit. The front desk was really helpful.I highly recommend this places to stay.	
Jun 8 2009 	recommend base2stay hotel	Very clean, quite and good staffs. Value for money.	
Jun 7 2009 	Comfortable hotel with very friendly staff	We stayed at this hotel for three days in May and 3 more in June traveling else where in the middle. We had a delux room to fit all four of us. The location was perfect. We were very close to the tube and many restaurants and a few pubs. Our kids (21 and 18) got to go to nearby pubs alone. Anything we needed to do was a tube ride away. It was also convenient to the airport. The room was very comfortable and free wifi a plus. The staff gave us any info or comfort we could ask for. I'd recomend this place to anyone.	
Jun 7 2009 	Perfect base for a visit in London - definitly recomanded!	Went to London with 3 friends for the weekend and stayed at the Base2Stay. The hotel is located in a quiet side street and within 3min walking distance of Earls Court tube station. Shared the room with 3 of my friends. The room was small but had everything we needed - small kitchenette, big bathroom etc. Every staff member we met was friendly and helpful. I'll definitely stay again next time I'm in London.	
Jun 7 2009 	Excellent base in London	We have stayed here 6 or 7 times over the past 3 years. Without fail each visit has been positive. The rooms are decent, clean and the hotel is in a good quiet location. The underground connections are good and there are plenty of places nearby for a decent breakfast (which the hotel does not do). The staff are very friendly and prepared to help.	
Jun 3 2009 	Clean comfortable 	Base2Stay is within walking distance of several attractions, including Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. It's also just a few minutes' walk from the Earl's Court station and access to most of London's tube lines. I liked having in-room internet access, a heated towel rack, a kitchenette, and plenty of restaurants nearby (some of which offer discounts to Base2Stay guests.) Every staff member I met was friendly and helpful. I'll definitely stay again next time I'm in London.	
Jun 3 2009 	The perfect place to stay!	I stayed a full week at base2stay in April and I couldn't have wished for better accommodation. Stylish, comfortable, clean, safe, with a well-equipped kitchenette in the room, base2stay was the perfect place to stay. In close proximity to the tube and easy access to central London, with restaurants and shops close by, and with wi fi access, base2stay is well located and gives great value for money. The friendly, helpful staff are fantastic and provide exceptional and timely service. Nothing is too much trouble. I am lucky enough to be returning to base2stay for a further two weeks and look forward to once again experiencing the wonderful hospitality of the dedicated staff and the comfort of this great hotel.	
Jun 2 2009 	The Place2Stay	I found Base2stay during my last stay in London and after reading the TripAdvisor reviews, I decided to give a try. I was not disapointedThe hotel is not located in the Center of London. However, due to its great location on the Picadilly tub line ( Earls Court Station), your are 20 minutes from Westminster Abbey, 35 minutes from King Cross St Pancras Railway station ( Eurostar) and 45 minutes from Heathrow Airport.The people are the reception are great, very welcoming, even fluent in FrenchI had the single room. For North American standard, it is small but so well design and cute, that it is not a problem. It is spotlessYou have a small kitchen. You will find food on Earl Court Road ( M and S).The bathroom is also very clean, nice hot shower ( you push a button )Nice toiletry ( same than in the Concierge suites in Club Med Cancun !)The bed was one of the most comfy I ever slept in ( 5 hours jet lag helped)The room was very quiet.Plasma TV and Wi fi completed the nice hi tech notes.I passed next to a few hotels on Gloucester Road and Barkstons Gardens and they were not as nice.I would go back in a heartbeat	
Jun 2 2009 	Just as the name says	Base2Stay is a clean, comfortable place to stay in London with kitchettes in every room. The ability to eat in and avoid going out for meals three times a day makes travel more relaxing and enjoyable. The staff are polite, helpful and accommodating and the overall value for money is probably the best in the city.	
May 31 2009 	A great spot to base your self for a london holiday	We had a great time at this hotel the staff was friendly . It is two blocks from the Earls Court tube station . This is not in a touristy area . We like that some might not. It is a short walk to Hyde Park &amp; Harrods We would definitely stay here again .	
May 31 2009 	SUPERB STAFF Hotel - functional affordable and conveniently located!	Base2 Stay is conveniently located near a major tub station (Earl's Court) and also within walking distance of many attractions. We were able to walk to parks on some days and hop on the tube for sightseeing on other days.The room was small but very functional. We were not missing anything. The decor is very smart and clean and the room makes excellent use of space. The WiFi connection came in very handy too. Besides exploring London for the first time, what made our stay excellent is the wonderful, helpful, friendly and experienced staff at Base2Stay. You are welcomed immediately and will feel very comfortable to pop your head into the office to say good morning and good night. If you go, make sure to ask for Tony P. Not only was he friendly and knowledgeable, but it was important to him for us to enjoy our stay and for us to experience the best of London. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to a friend.	
May 30 2009 	Best cost benefit in London	London is not a cheap city, more when you looking for a good hotel andn good location. Usually the prices get higher and service lower. This hotel was an amazing surprise. A friend of mine recommend me and I was trully impress, not only for the service and location (outstanding) but for the size of the room and really afordable price.The hotel stays in south Kensignton, a block away from Earls Court subway. From there you can reach almost any place at center London. Around the hotel you find all sort of food stores and pubs. Therefore, the unecessary room service and restaurant that hotel has eliminated does not make any difference. Indeed, could be better (for the flexibility) and also cost.Regarding the service, outstanding. Not a word to mention about it. I have travelled a lot on business purpose and stayed in even luxury hotels than this with a pretty worst service.The room are recently refurbished spacious (at least the twin that I asked). all of them has kitchens and free internet available and are quiet (in large hotels you often listen doors closings, elevators, etc).This was not the case here.Definetelly I will be back to this hotel when I am in London.	
May 28 2009 	Excellent Service and Low Price!	I stayed at this hotel for an entire month on a recent work-related trip to London and found it to be excellent! The quality of service, the cleaniness of the room, the Kensington/Earl's Court location, and the low price are the reasons I rate this as the NUMBER ONE hotel in London. I loved having my own little &quot;kitchen in a closet&quot; with a microwave, electric kettle, sink, and ice box. The new flat screen tv and the wifi were additional benefits. Again, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to London. Personally, I have been recommending it to anyone and everyone that I have been meeting on this trip which is work-related but includes leisure activities.	
May 27 2009 	base2stay was comfortable 	My wife and I checked in at base2stay on a week-day afternoon in late April. We had made the tube trip from Heathrow and the very easy walk from Earl's Court station to the hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly at the reception desk and were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to a larger room. When asked for my credit card, I realized that it had gone missing. Calming my fatigued panic (we had other cards), I thought it probable that the card had been left at the Heathrow Express desk. A call was placed immediately by the young gentleman (Mr. A. P.) at reception and it was there..... secure. Normally, that would be the end of the story..... nice, concerned service, and I would trek back to Terminal 5 to retrieve my card. But the attention, at this point, rose above and beyond the call of duty. Mr. A. P. informed me that he needed, for personal reasons, to go later that day to Heathrow and would be happy to retrieve my card for me - I needed only to supply him with an authorization note and a bit of card information for security purposes. The next morning my credit card was slipped under our door...... and it was his day off!! That is service!This wonderful boutique hotel, so convenient, and so quiet, is a perfect location for a London stay...... and everything is modern and new. Finally, and this is major...... the bed we had was unbelievably comfortable. We don't get to London often, but when we do come it will be base2stay for our stay.Francis Reed Cutting, Marblehead, Massachusetts	
May 27 2009	I will stay here again.	Without exception, the staff members are unfailingly pleasant and helpful. Proximity to Earl's Court tube makes it easy to get where you want to go, and the local neighbourhood has decent shops and restaurants. You can also get to and from Heathrow by tube, which is quite a saving in cab fares.True, the rooms are small by American standards. My daughter and I managed quite well, and were comfortable.Give it a try.	
May 24 2009 	Hidden gem	We stayed there for a week end of April 2009 and we were very pleased to have found this lovely hotel. As opposed to many 3 star London hotels, this one is very clean, on the modern side, no old-fashioned stuffy-dusty feeling about it.We appreciated very much the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Congratulations to the owner(s) for making sure the employees do not say ''no'', '' it is not possible'', ''we don't know'' but always try to be of assistance and help. Furthermore, we appreciated the way the room was spotlessly cleaned every day, including the kitchenette and the dirty dishes.The hotel has a very good location, within walking distance to the underground station, small shops, supermarkets and an assortment of different restaurants and cafes. Hotel staff happily provides extra info about restaurants and even discount coupons for some of them.We also liked and found useful the thick info folder in the room.We stayed on the fifth floor in a standard double room. It was medium to small (which is not unusual for London), very efficiently put together and furbished though. We were not so impressed with the shower head - the holes were covered in lime - and with the water pressure at times. These are small little things that could be improved.We will definitely return to this hotel for our future trips to London and we warmly recommend it to all those who need a clean, modern and comfortable 3 star hotel during their stay in London.	
May 24 2009 	An overbooking that destoyed our first day in London...	We (me and my wife) stayed at base2stay in May 2009 (2th to 7th). After 12 hours in a plane, we arrived at 25 Courtifield Gardens. A shower, a pinch and a fish and cheeps? No, the crew of base2stay informed us that our room (booked since february 2009) had a problem and that we should stay our first night in Premier Inn, a 3 stars´s hotel nearby (we discovered, later, that Premier Inn was a bad hotel, and we have paid 113 pounds for just one night there!!!). I thought, sincerely, that it was a simple case of overbooking: the crew priorized other guests, not the young couple that came from a very exotic country... I hope that do not become a policy of base2stay...After that problem, our stay was perfect: excellent location, perfect room and service.	
May 20 2009 	very comfortable stay highly recommended !	We stayed at Base2stay for 5 nights in mid May 2009 with our 3 yr old daughter. Knowing how small London hotel rooms usually are, I had concerns before I saw our room. We stayed at Room #111 which was big enough to accommodate the 3 of us, the push chair and lots of suitcases. Uncomplicated simple design in the room &amp; bathroom with new furniture &amp; fixtures. The room was properly cleaned everyday, dishes washed and even we found toys, that were scattered around when we left, neatly organised and stacked in the cot! Team at the reception were extremely helpful with everything. Locationwise it is 5 min walk to Earl's Court tube (which is pram accessible :)) and from there you can go anywhere in the city. I sincerely believe this is a great hotel to stay if you are visiting London &amp; are interested in museums as it takes 15 mins tops to walk to the Natural History/Science/V&amp;A museums. Also it's close to Waterloo station if you prefer southwest countryside. Lastly, it is a child friendly hotel -- no open plugs around in the room, high banisters in stairs, nice lift for kids .. very safe.	
May 17 2009 	Excellent !	We went down to London to celebrate my husbands birthday with friends, and I wanted to stay at this hotel as I have been booking lots of my customers into it. I wanted to see it for myself and make up my own mind on how I rated it. Everything you see on this hotel's web-pages is refreshingly exactly how you will find it when you get there...It was easy enough to find...we took a taxi from Euston Station as with our bags we couldnt be bothered to catch the tube. The rest of our stay we used the tube - its not far to the nearest station - probably 5 mins or so walk.On arrival we were warmly met. The small reception area is modern and minimal with a window seat - they are happy to look after your bags if your room isnt ready when you get there. One of our two rooms was ready, so we went straight up to have a look. We were in a double on the 5th floor - but no problem as there is a lift to all floors.Corrridors and communal areas were clean and looked newly decorated,The room was bright and airy. Had double bed, wardrobe with hangers, desk &amp; chair, flat screen TV - internet connection - &amp; kitchenette in a tidy cupboard. Kitchenette had sink, kettle, cups etc. Even a black binbag had been left out incase of any rubbish whilst catering for yoursleves.The bathroom was lovely, shower (no bath) was lovely and very powerful - quite large shower cubicle too.Some tolietrees were provided,Lovely white fluffy towels.All extremely clean.The room also had a really good powerful hairdryer, and a plug located near the mirror. Also a plus, but it is amazing how many hotels seem to overlook this!Had a very comfy night's sleep. Good pillows and comfy mattress. Hotel was quiet too.Absolutely no complaints at all. Very clean, and all the decor looks fresh.Lovely calm decor colours (neutrals and browns)The staff were helpful, and even though you dont have any breakfast included as there's no restaurant its only a couple of mins walk to get some breakfast. Theres a high street close by with several places to choose from to eat at. Recommend to you &quot;&quot;Bryons&quot;&quot; which has really friendly staff and tasty food. (also licienced if you fancy lunch there)http://www.byronhamburgers.com/story/Overall a great hotel that I will 100% continue to recommend to my customers - in a great and grand part of London! Makes you wish you had been a Victorian !!	
May 15 2009 	The best in London!	We recently returned from a six-night stay at base2stay Kensington with our three children. The service and facilities were so great that we would not consider staying anywhere else next time we go to London. The staff were not only professional and polite, they went out of their way to assist us - and always with such a friendly attitude. The rooms are on the small side, but it's the centre of London so we expected that. My parents spent three nights at London's Waldorf before joining us, and they definitely preferred base2stay. The rooms are so clean and the power shower was wonderful. We honestly could not fault this hotel. It's such a great concept, I wish there was one in every city!	
May 15 2009 	40th Birthday Celebrations	Three girlfriends and I met in London to celebrate our 40th Birthdays. Its the first time we have got together without husbands and children in years ! The hotel we found on the internet was superb. We all shared one elegant and well equipped room. Excellent facilties and very attentive staff. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. Central location, lovely rooms and reasonable prices.	
May 13 2009 	Excellent stay	This is my second time at base2stay and this stay was as good as the first. It is a very comfortable hotel, with excellent service, exceptional value (for London) and a great location walking distance high street kensington and on the District line. I highly recommend it.	
May 11 2009 	Friendly design new (so clean) practical well located	Really friendly receptionist. Modern &amp; Zen attitude design!Really good priceWell located: Earls Court on Picadilly lineNo food provided as each room has its small kitchen: quite easy &amp; cheap!!!! Practical: kitchen, wi fi, TV, air conditionning, Laundry less than 8 hrsQuiet and safe areaMissing: a mirror for shaving or make up!	
May 8 2009 	a real base	I really enjoyed this hotel.I did have a slight problem locating the hotel, although it literally is just down the street from the Metro.The only room left when I booked last minute was a bunk bed, which was not necessary as a solo traveller, but the kitchen and microwave in the hotel room is a major plus. I felt really comfortable being able to bring back and store food, and or heat it with the microwave. Maybe a bit too comfortable as I looked forward to being in the hotel!The shower was really amazing after staying in several european hotels this one ta kes the prize. Free wifi was a great benefit as well. Only downside was no in house food, although the hotel goes out of their way to get you discounts and provide you other options. You feel like home in this hotel, and I would have really liked to have stayed in one of the non bunk bed rooms.	
May 6 2009 	Great Hotel	I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in February with work. Its very close to Earls Court tube station. The rooms are spotlessly clean. I stayed in a double room which was fairly small but the ambience and decoration made up for this. The shower room was a good size.Be aware that they dont accept Maestro.	
May 6 2009 	Excellent in all ways	Just came back from a 4-night stay with my husband and 4 year old daughter at Base2stay. It was all that it promises to be on the site, every positive review is true. The reception people are lovely, check-in and check-out flawless, the area beautiful for first impressions of London.The rooms are clean, look brand new with excellent bath facilities and huge fluffy bathtowels, the bed had great linen but the matress was rather on the soft side. Only thing I didn't like : We stayed in room I17 which was about 1,5 meters below street level ( front street ) which meant that we had windows in level with the front sidewalk ( not to worry, one way glass, one could't look inside from the street). It was kind of fun watching the passers-by from your bed in the morning, but, being from a warm country like Greece, it was quite unpleasant that I couldn't open the window in the morning to air the room (felt I would suffocate). Of course the windows were not air-tight ( some fresh air did enter the room) but still... So, to conclude, I absolutely recommend this hotel, just ask which floor the room is on before you book in case you feel like opening a window now and then !	
Apr 27 2009 	Great location price and amenities	Clean, efficient, great neighborhood and great price for London, well-kept - spent six nights - had three rooms - for my wife, two daughters and their husbands - Staff were extremely helpful at every turn. Toilet facilities superb, great showers - tube stop (Earl's Court) on the line that goes directly to Heathrow. Highly recommend!	
Apr 27 2009 	Great medium priced hotel	I stayed in a bunk room which was all that was available. By London standards not badly priced at £119 but this would have been really cheap if there were 2 in tbhe room.Despite being bunk beds they are very comfortable. More like single beds on top of each other than than kid's bunks.Room is simply but tastefully appointed. Bathroom is great with quality fittings, nice soap and shampoo and plenty of hot water.Room has a 'cupboard kitchen which would be a cost saver if you could be bothered.Earls Court is a great place to find a reasonably priced meal and only a stones throw from South Kensington where there are also laods of restaurants. It is also well situated for the V £ vA and Natural History Museum.Only possible downside is that the hotel does nothing other than accomodation. No bar, no dining room, no breakfast etc.Book well in advance - it is often full, especially if there is an exhibition at Earls Court or Olympia.	
Apr 25 2009	Honestly the best staff I've ever encountered and a wonderful experience	My mother and I stayed at this hotel for 10 days and every single day I had a great conversation with someone on staff and I am still amazed at the experience. I can honestly say I've never encountered such sincere, dedicated, enthusiastic staff in a hotel. Never.This hotel honestly deserves a very extensive review and after writing only a little of what I have experienced I've realized that it needs so much more, therefore I have published a very extensive review of the hotel on my blog (http://artisus.wordpress.com) and have condensed my review below.The Pros:-Absolutely AMAZING staff (Vinny, one of the supervisors, and Anthony, one of the evening/morning clerks were always particularly accommodating)-Staff was open to negotiation (I was able to negotiate a slightly lesser price because of the length of my stay; and Vinny was able to negotiate my mother and I a discount on massages which he booked for us- the discount was small but worth it)-Bed was EXTREMELY comfortable (We had a king size bed because any doubles had been previously booked and our second day in London we stayed in bed until 3 or 4 because it really was that wonderful)-Shower absolutely DIVINE (though if you panic and are turning the right hand knob and wondering why nothing is coming about don't fret and call for the handyman, which is what we did, it's apparently a &quot;mixer&quot; so all the water is controlled only through the left knob... it was unexpectedly 'high tech') and they provided shampoo/shower gel (an interesting combo in my opinion) smelled really good!- In a really great, quiet location but very close to anything &quot;happening&quot; (Kensington High Street is about a 7-10 minute walk; Earl's Court Tube is about 1-2 minutes stroll; restaurants are abundant)-(and to prove myself an honest fanatic) The staff, the staff, the staff, the staff! I can't even describe it properly but I've stayed in some very expensive, very luxurious places before and have never encountered staff so honestly enthused at the idea of booking me a tour or massage or theatre experience. I give the staff two thumbs WAY up and would say that their gentility was the best thing about my trip.The Cons (yes, there were a few but all very, VERY minor)-The toilet paper roll, I'm sorry to say, was mildly annoying. It is not covered and therefore when you unroll a sheet the entire thing flies across the bathroom-There wasn't much hanging space except for in the closet (which probably makes me sound silly but if you have a purse or two, or a coat or sweater that needs to be ready for the parting, you might not find it so silly)-The hotel does not provide wash cloths/face cloths unless requested and even then they may only give you one as they don't stock many-To make for a more impressive and attractive entrance the housekeepers short-sheet the side of the bed (at least for a king-size) furthest from the door. And I mean SHORT-SHEET; there was about a forearm's length of duvet wrapped at the foot of the bed and absolutely NOTHING hanging gracefully off the edge furthest from the door. It may look pretty, but it's annoying if you're on the 'wrong side'.Recommendations for Eating:base2stay does have some discounts for nearby restaurants. Our favorites, which we visited several times were Strada (Italian food with a 20% discount), and Balan's. We did, however, greatly prefer the Balan's on Kensington High Street than the one off of Earl's Court Rd. The one on the High Street had friendlier staff, a cleaner atmosphere, and was much quieter. (If you go to Balan's try the &quot;Bakewell Cherry Tart&quot;- I don't know what it was made it so good but it was DELICIOUS)If you're looking for some English &quot;tea and scones&quot;- which I noted during my trip is a fading indulgence- try &quot;The Muffin Man&quot; which is on Walker Street off of Kensington High Street by Marks &amp; Spencer's. The scones are absolutely delicious. Also, EMI records has a building just across the street so you may see some celebrities if not their Hummers (a Hummer in London seems so out of place!).As for chocolate, which is what my mother and I always indulge in, the best place is Thorton's (in our opinion). We prefer it because they had a greater selection of dark chocolates and let me tell you I bought 5 bags of their &quot;Cherry Almond Fudge&quot; to bring back with me because it really is that good. The closest one to the hotel is on Oxford Street, where lots of people go for it's shopping experience. Recommendations for Spa Treatments:My mother, who has fibromyalgia, and I inquired at the front desk when we checked in about massages. They have a 15% discounted partnership with &quot;Simply Fab Company&quot; which sounded very sketchy to me at first. The perk with this company is that they come to you. We both opted for 90 minute Swedish massages and the front desk (Vinny specifically) booked it for us and managed to haggle back 7 pounds for us, which may not seem like a lot but everyone's watching their pennies these days. The masseuse was named Gretchen and she was absolutely AMAZING. I don't like deep-tissue things (terribly ticklish) but that was honestly one of the best, if not the best, massages I've ever had. So I do recommend the peculiarly named Simply Fab Co (www.sfcstyle.com). In conclusion, I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying there again if the chance arises. I hope that you try it if only to encounter the staff and see how really astounding they are. If you would like further information about my experience, please let me know.	
Apr 24 2009 	sleek minimalist central... and affordable !	I have stayed at this modern and ultra clean hotel twice since it opened. It is exactly what I am looking for in a London hotel - a clean, no-nonsense, well-located place which meets my budget. It's perfect for those travelers who dont plan to spend much time lounging in the hotel room for hours on end - but rather are looking for somewhere to leave their suitcases and crash at the end of the day. The beds are very comfortable and all of the facilities still seem brand new. The staff is very friendly and helpful.	
Apr 24 2009 	Comfy and full of amenities!	I stayed at base2stay for five days at the end of a long stay in England. They were wonderful from the moment I arrived. My room was super comfortable, the kitchenette was stylish and well-appointed, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. There were three supermarkets within a two block radius, so I could stock up my fridge and make lovely meals. But there were also tons of pubs and restaurants in the area if I wanted a night out. It's within walking distance to the V&amp;A and the British Museum and the Museum of Natural History, close to a great gym, and a block from the Tube. And did I mention the post office on the corner? I love this place and its staff!	
Apr 23 2009 	BASE TO STAY IS THE PLACE TO STAY	I would truly recommend this stylish hotel to anyone going to London on a budget. My husband, daughter and myself had a very pleasant 6 night stay (April 2009) in this hotel that is exactly as shown in Internet. The elegant décor, comfortable triple room, spacious bathroom for London standards and well designed mini kitchen made our six night stay a most pleasant one. However, the real asset of Base2Stay is a very qualified, efficient and well trained staff always ready to assist us with tourist information, tour bookings and theater tickets among other things; they also did our electronic flight check-in, amazing! On top of this, the location is great, a quiet charming neighborhood but at 3 minute-walk from the tube station and a very convenient commercial area with little restaurants, pubs, places to buy food, pharmacy and anything you may need. In sum, a wonderful choice, I would definitely repeat the experience.Silvana, Montevideo-Uruguay	
Apr 22 2009 	Clean Simple Friendly and Hip	We loved this place. My boyfriend, 15-year-old son, and I (middle-aged babe!) were in a lower-floor room with a king bed and a single. Everything had a kind of cheerful, efficient, fresh white feel about it. The beds were very comfy (well, there was a crack in the middle of our king, but honestly it wasn't uncomfortable) and we had a little kitchenette and a FANTASTIC shower. The location (Earls Court tube station) couldn't have been more convenient and there's a lovely park and neighborhood surrounding the hotel. It's not a chic neighborhood but it feels as if real people live there, diverse, busy, working people. There are no frills to this hotel - no coffee or breakfast in the morning, no tea in the afternoon, no sherry at evening - but it doesn't matter. The most outstanding aspect of the hotel was the staff. The people at the front desk couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, going out of their way to secure us tickets to a Chelsea game, to print out boarding passes, to be genuinely (I think) cheerful if we had a question or need. We really really liked them and all decided we would stay in exactly the same place next time. Although our room was on the lower floor, looking out at an alley, it wasn't unpleasant. I imagine there are wonderful rooms to be had on upper floors. Since you won't trust my review unless I think of a few negatives.....I wish there had been separate overhead reading lights for each bed, so we didn't have to have the entire room ablaze for my son to stay up studying. And, the doors between hallways shut noisily because of the mechanism making the halls fire-safe. But they slam occasionally. But all in all, these were minor infractions that I had to wrack my brain to come up with. Excellent hotel, good rate, I believe, for central London.	
Apr 20 2009 	Shhhh...let's keep it our little secret...this place is AWESOME!	I loved Base2Stay. From the moment I checked in until I picked up my bags to leave I was provided with excellent service from the outstanding staff at this hotel. They are happy to provide helpful information on how to get around London and other tips to make my stay at their hotel more pleasant. I even saw a staff member run a block from the hotel to catch up with two guests because he'd heard from another staff member that they were looking for a church to attend Sunday mass. Talk about going above and beyond! HUGE bonus points to the staff for allowing me to print my boarding pass at the reception desk. It's certainly the little things that make a big difference. The hotel is well-situated about a two minute walk to the Earl's Court tube and a five minute walk to Gloucester Road tube. I was able to easily navigate my way to the places I needed to go from these tube stations. The rooms were exactly as pictured on the website. I was in a single room. It was smallish but so well designed that you don't feel like you're in a small room. My luggage stowed easily under the bed. There was a desk, closet and completely outfitted kitchenette. Housekeeping even does your dishes for you each day. There are many stores nearby where you can get food items to prepare in the kitchen which helps save money in such an expensive city. The room was clean and the beds were comfy. The bathrooms were large for what I would've expected for a single small room. I thought the push-button shower was very cool and really appreciated the towel warmer. Speaking of towels...what a relief to finally stay in a hotel that provides adult-sized towels. The bath sheet sized towels were a nice touch of luxury in what some would call a budget hotel. The hotel provides free wireless internet that was very reliable during my stay. There's a flat screen on the wall where you can also use internet if you didn't bring a laptop and you can get movies for 2p. I would've liked to have been able to adjust the positioning of the TV but, hey, that's my only complaint about the room. I really loved this little hotel. Kudos to the management and staff for providing such excellent service!	
Apr 14 2009 	I'd like to keep it a secret....but....	I would like to keep it a secret, in fear that it may become too popular and create a different hotel (although, if they stick true to their philosophy, it will remain the same)...which is WONDERFUL!!!!The location is perfect for anyone loving the central city of London....and extremely perfect for the first time visitor. The convenience to Earl's Court tube as well as the local pubs, cafes, shops, and wonderful &quot;community feeling&quot; of the area could not be beat.The hotel will NOT disappoint you...the rooms are true to the web site...the mini kitchen is perfect and very handy....the beds very comfortable...the bathrooms modern and the showers are like a massage.We took out three different rooms for the group who traveled with us. ....Standand double, a Double/King, and a Deluxe (a dream come true for four people).The staff was helpful and fun...we hope to return to London in the near future and will stay no place else but base2stay!	
Apr 13 2009	Great place to stay	My oldest daughter and I used base2stay as our base while visiting my youngest daughter who is studying abroad in London for the semester. We stayed in one of the hotel's bunk bed rooms and found it to be very comfortable. It was so nice to have a refrigerator in our room and there are plenty of places close buy to buy things to stock it with. The location is so convenient to walking to many nearby attractions and restaurants and there are many tube stops close by too. The reception staff was very helpful and allowed us to store our luggage after we checked out so we could do some more sightseeing before catching the tube to the airport. All in all a very nice place to stay.	
Apr 13 2009 	Not in my 20s anymore but still want to see the world.	Place was perfect for my needs. Pictures posted here by other travels portray the rooms accurately. I had no surprises. I could've stayed in a hostel or lower end B&amp;B and dealt with the small inconveniences for a lower price -- but I didn't have to. I'm a bit older now with some money and willing to spend it for the guarantee of privacy, my own toilet, hot water. Small single room. Clean, modern and tasteful. Stocked the fridge with fruit cups and yogurt from the nearby Marks &amp; Spencer for breakfast. Drank the provided tea and coffee in the neat little kitchenette. Then left for the whole day to sightsee and have fun. Came back at night. Watched the tele. Showered. Slept. I did miss after a few days encountering new people at breakfast like you would at other places.	
Apr 13 2009 	Great "Base Camp" for seeing London on a budget!	We stopped in to Portsmouth for a liberty port with the US Navy and wanted to see London on a short schedule and tight budget. Base2Stay proved to fit the bill quite well. We were able to get a room for three of us for a little over $100 USD each. The location was a little off the beaten path in the middle of a residential area so it was quiet and not overrun by tourists. The good news was that it was within a couple of blocks of a tube station which carried us pretty much anywhere we needed to go with an all day pass.After seeing some of the hotels friends were staying in for twice the price in downtown London, we definitely realized we got a great deal on a relatively well appointed room! We would stay here again.	
Apr 13 2009 	Clean. modern rooms - large for London standards	I stayed in Base2stay for 1 night with friends for a night out &amp; was impressed. Clean spacious rooms &amp; friendly, helpful staff. The rooms are self contained with fridge, microwave, sink &amp; crockery &amp; there is no retaurant or bar, but usually hotel restuarants in London are overpriced &amp; poor quality, so you're better off venturing down the street to one of many restaurants. Within about 3 mins walk from Earls Court Tube station, off the main street so nice &amp; quiet area. Highly recommended &amp; well definitely go back	
Apr 12 2009 	Very Pleased with Everything	I was not familiar with the name, so I based my decision on the website and tripadvisor recommendations alone. I am happy to report that the decision was a great one! My whole family, husband and two children, enjoyed the accomodations and would return in a moment. The location was perfect, just close enough to restaurants, the Tube, etc.. but not too close. Our room was spacious and very clean. The staff was very friendly. Our family had the room at the front of the hotel, which was a little noisy because of the street traffic in the morning, but we weren't lounging about anyway. Things to do, places to see! There were many good restaurants right down the street, but after one delicious dinner out, we spent the remainder of the evenings dining on our own creations purchasd at Simply Foods, down from the Tube. It was much more economical and relaxing for the kids. Overall, the hotel was great and I would highly recommend it to any of our friends.	
Apr 7 2009 	GREAT BASE IN LONDON	We booked B2Stay for 5 nights and had room 504 - top floor with brick wall view. Whilst the view was not ideal we did enjoy our stay. We found the service to be mostly excellent. Location, as everyone says, is good - we even walked to the V&amp;A Museum and also to Harrods (yes, took about 45 minutes so not that close).We also stayed during the power outage and could not fault how they handled this difficult situation. We left to sightsee early in the morning just after the power went off. Unfortunately when we got back at 5.30 pm the power was still not on and at that stage it was not expected to come back on before 9.30 pm. As my husband was leaving very early the next morning and I was going to be on my own we elected to change hotels (to a more expensive awful hotel in very ordinary location). The staff at Base tried to get us to stay but it was just too risky - however they happily ordered a cab to take us to our new hotel and even picked up the driver's tab. A few minor points: Someone commented on the mini milk containers - yes, I noticed the brown on the top and they were also past their &quot;use by&quot; date. London water is always a bit &quot;scummy&quot; - if that is a word! My tea looked positively cloudy.On the second day we arrived back at the hotel around 4.30 to find the room had not been cleaned. About 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was housekeeping - checking to see if the room had been cleaned. She looked a bit shocked that it hadn't and asked if we would like it done - by that stage we wanted to rest before going out again so declined. They did however bring clean towells up to our room. I asked one of the housekeepers if we could get facewashers and whilst she said our room was not on her list she passed the message on and they were in our room on our return.Heated towell racks are brilliant.We were expecting a fax and asked twice at reception if it had arrived. It finally turned up under the door and we noticed it had been sent 2 days before!!!!The decor is very pleasant, the room extremely clean and this must be the best value hotel in London, by far.	
Apr 6 2009 	A great base for a London stay	I stayed at base2stay for two days for a business trip to London. Overall I'm extremely impressed.The hotel is located literally a few minutes' walk from Earl's Court station, which makes it very accessible from Heathrow Airport and Kings' Cross/St. Pancras station via the Piccadilly line of the London Underground. The vicinity of Earl's Court station has a number of shops and places to eat. While transport links are good, the hotel is located in a very quiet street.I stayed in a single room on the lower ground floor. At first I was worried that I'll be below the ground level, but it turned out that this room is at the ground level at the other side of the hotel. The single room is very small, but exceptionally well laid out. It has a very comfortable single bed, a small desk, a wall-mounted flat screen TV, a wardrobe, a kitchenette and a bathroom with a huge shower cabin. The design of the room is very elegant and modern, something that I really liked.I was particularly impressed by the kitchenette which is hidden next to the wardrobe. It has a full set of plates, cups, glasses and cutlery for two people, a sink, a small fridge and a microwave. All of this make the hotel room seem more like an apartment. There are Sainsbury's and Waitrose supermarkets nearby, so it is extremely convenient to buy food there, heat it up in the microwave and eat in the room.There are also a number of options for internet access. If you don't have a laptop with you, it is possible to access the internet via the TV. It's a bit cumbersome to use sometimes, but great to check e-mails. With a laptop there are even more options. On arrival you get a code for Wi-Fi access, which gives you a limited amount of time. The next day you get another code. Wi-Fi access can sometimes be a bit slow, so for heavy duty internet access it is possible to buy access to a wired high speed internet connection, which is indeed fast enough for most purposes.The room was exceptionally clean and well-maintained, as is the hotel in general. The staff were always very friendly and helpful.Overall I had a very enjoyable stay, and will definitely visit again, and would recommend this hotel to anyone. I'm giving 4 stars mainly because this is not a luxury hotel, and the rooms are indeed very small.Something else that they could improve are the windows. The hotel strives to be environmentally friendly, but insulating windows a bit better would surely greatly improve their energy efficiency. Otherwise a light draught could be felt through the window. Also since the window is single-glazed, when there some people walking outside, everything could be heard clearly from inside the room.	
Apr 5 2009 	Will definitely stay there again. Great value!	Will definitely stay there again. Great value! I only wish they had shower curtains!	
Apr 4 2009 	pleased2stay!	My husband and I had two four-night stays here in March while traveling in England and Scotland. From start to finish our experience was positive. Reservations were easy to make on their website. We arrived at Heathrow, followed the signs to the Underground, bought an Oyster card and made our way without a hitch to Earls Court station (where there is a ramp to the street for folks with luggage). From there, it was just a block and a half walk to the hotel.We were assigned to room L-3, which is at street level (two windows face the mews  a quiet, gated block-long street). The queen bed was very comfortable; there were two bedside tables, a good-sized closet with shelves, hangers, and safe; a kitchenette with sink, microwave, dishes and glassware, and a mini-fridge (move the shelf and you have room for a ½ gallon of milk, juice, bottle of wine, leftovers, etc). We took advantage of the kettle and ate breakfast in each morning, using the coffee/tea they provided, making instant oatmeal or purchasing breakfast goodies from one of the excellent food shops nearby (Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury, etc.). There is suitcase storage under the bed, but not if you have two 24 suitcases, as we did. However, this room has lots of nooks and crannies which worked just fine. Air conditioning/heat responded promptly and the windows open a little to let in fresh air.The wide-screen TV with several channels (inc. BBC and Sky News) also offered internet access using a simple-to-master system with the TV remote and a keyboard  this was a great time-saver unless you really needed to listen to voicemail or do a lot of printing. The bathroom in this room was well thought out  a towel warming rack, lots of counter space to spread out toiletries, a shower head that delivers, large towels, and some nice shampoo and soap.Our second visit started in room G-12, which is a little smaller (the closet is narrower, the desk is a little smaller, and you have to walk past the TV screen at the foot of the bed). Also, the bathroom has a large window, so it seemed colder and you couldnt have the shade up. When L-3 became available, we moved back there. Both rooms are excellent value for the price, and we wouldnt hesitate to recommend base2stay or stay there again ourselves.Staff at this hotel are first-rate, reflecting managements philosophy (see their website). We are grateful to General Manager Nassar Khalil and those we met (including Amie, Ann, Adam, Vinny, Lucy, Jack and Ahlam, as well as the fine housekeeping crew) for helping make our visit to London memorable.	
Apr 3 2009 	You get the impossible with base2stay!	We loved this hotel! I must say when we travel we look for the impossible, or should I say almost the impossible. We wanted an affordable hotel without compromising luxury. It needed to accommodate a family of 4 to one room and hopefully in local area with great access to all of London. We found this in base2stay! The rooms are modern with a luxury feel. They have tall ceilings, flat screen tv with free internet use and wifi. They even come with a very small mini-kitchen that proved to be well appointed and efficient. The bathroom was great, the heated towel bar a nice touch. The kids slept in single beds converted out of chairs, a bit small but heck teenagers can sleep anywhere! We stayed in L-1 that had two doors that led out to a patio, an added bonus. The Kensington location was perfect with very easy access to all of London by way of the tube. It is a upscale residential area filled with great people and local restaurants. Nice to come back to after sight seeing the tourist areas all day! The hotel staff was superb from any guidance we needed to requests that were asked. We like to seek out local restaurants with really good food, the staff recommendations never let us down! During our stay we did experience a power outage that impacted the water system. This was out of the hotels control, but they were very responsive in obtaining a generator and even gave a credit on 1/2 the room rate for the day. With the given circumstances, I actually felt bad for the staff. If you want a hotel with pools, restaurants and a fitness center this is not the hotel for you. But, if you want affordable luxury in a great local location with easy access, you will not be disappointed!	
Apr 2 2009 	My new place to stay in London	I booked this place on account of all the positive feedback here. The only problem we had was they canceled the reservation. Upon arrival, they said they canceled it because the card I had used to make the original reservation would not work. Thanks to Visa fraud protection, this was true. They said they attempted to contact me, however I never received a phone call or email. Thankfully there was room, and we were upgraded to a bigger room. The room was nice, the bed was very comfy and the duvet was nice. Our room had a sink, microwave, and fridge which came in handy. The bathroom was large, bright, and clean. The staff was awesome, very helpful and friendly. The entertainment system in the room was great as well with all the music and movies. They have arrangements made with local restaurants to give discounts which was nice. The hotel is about a four minute walk from the Tube and a 10 minute walk from a few different grocery stores. Other than the issue at check-in, this place absolutely rocked and I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!!	
Mar 30 2009 	Perfect	Very clean and beautiful hotel in a nice neighbourhood.Only a few steps away from the tubeof Earl's Court. Friendly and helpful staff.Free internet in every room is extremely handy.Excellent value for money.	
Mar 30 2009 	great weekend	The hotel upgraded our room to a superior one for free! The room was nice, elegant and spacious. Very silent and great location. Plenty of good restaurant within 500 m. We will come back	
Mar 25 2009 	I always stay here in London	This place is a gem. Very modern, chic,clean, quiet, well-equipped, and moderately priced. Kind of a zen feeling to the rooms. And close to Gloucester and Earl's Court underground stations. The rooms are small, but extremely well laid out.	
Mar 24 2009 	Stylish little gem near earls court station	This 38 room hotel is stylish, affordable and the perfect base for business or a city break. The interior is done with an eye for detail, unlike the big chain hotels without style. It is just what you need. No breakfast included, but neatly self-catering unit in each room, with fridge and microwave, wine opener, cutlery glasses, water boiler and etc. all at no extra cost. Shops nearby to shop for breakfast at your own time and leisure. Wireless internet and digital guide included. Location: 3 minutes walking distance from earls court tube. In 13 stops you are at heathrow on the picadilly line. Earls court has a lift, so no carrying your luggage up and down stairs or escalator at tube station. Near exhibition centre, Science museum. etc. The staff is always ready to help, just buzz if you need them to help with your luggage up the front stairs.	
Mar 24 2009 	Decent hotel in a good neighborhood close to the tube	We found base2stay from TripAdvisor and decided to stay here for our week vacation based on all the excellent reviews. I think I went in having super high expectations since so many people rated it a 5 so was a bit disappointed at some of the amenities when I entered my room. Having traveled in Europe on several occasions I was expecting a small room, but our twin room was much smaller than I expected, likely b/c they pulled a king bed apart so our beds were only an inch apart; our room was facing a wall which I wasn't expecting since many other people had commented that they had had great views from their room. Also after removing the lid of the water kettle after boiling water, found the top of the water to be covered in some residue, I refrained from using the kettle for the rest of the trip. In addition, the tops of the little half and halfs for the tea seemed to be browned, not sure if this is the standard coloring or if it'd been sitting out somewhere. It was quite noisy outside a few nights even though we were essentially facing a wall. We slept through it though without any problems.My biggest complaint though was that I found a yellowish stain on my bedsheet when I was going to crawl into bed the first night and grey marks all over one of my pillows. As it was late, I put a towel over the stain that night, used the other pillow, and mentioned it to reception the next morning. However, while the pillow sheet was changed, the stain was still there when I got into bed late the next night. It took 3 inquiries over the course of 3 days and me personally leaving a note on the bed before it finally got changed. This should've only taken a day to fix.We also had some key mixups as I checked in before my friend, but they had no record of my check in when he checked in so they deactivated my room key when they activated his and we weren't aware we were only allowed to have one key chip key between the two of us. Since they each gave us one, we assumed that it was fine, eventually they switched out one of the key cards for a regular card with a swipe bar after a day of us going back and forth to the front desk trying to get our key cards to work.Overall the hotel is in an excellent location, 2 minute walk to the tube. Some restaurants nearby (definitely do not recommend the pub across from the station, busy with bad service), if you're in the hotel at dinner time, I was almost never there then, but the bakery across from the tube station has excellent pastys for breakfast. Safe area, no problems walking alone at night as a female. Staff is courteous, though for me they weren't extremely warm and friendly like other reviewers' experiences. The internet usage from the TV is a bit awkward, but was convenient for doing quick look ups. For anyone checking-in for their flights and in depth tourist research, go to the internet cafe across from the tube, super cheap at only 50 pence per 30 minutes.Not a bad stay, but was disappointed at how long it took to get my sheets changed and the state of the water kettle. Like I said a lot of little things went wrong for me for such a highly rated hotel. Not being told to turn on the breaker switches for the sockets, outside noise, etc. The hotel was accomodating though in letting us split the charges in the amounts we wanted. I would probably stay here again in hopes my experience this time around was a fluke. Note: if you tend to use tissues a lot (I had spring allergies), bring your own! as the hotel doesn't have any.	
Mar 23 2009 	Convenient comfortable clean functional	I took the advice of a previous reviewer and requested a courtyard room (i.e. not one of the rooms facing the main road). When I booked the room by phone I was told that I had been booked into a courtyard room but this did not turn out to be the case and and so felt a little disappointed in the service, but overall very good.	
Mar 19 2009 	The perfect hotel in London	A great stylish hotel. Very convenient (walking distance of Earls Court Tube station on both Piccadilly and District lines) and residential location, with many good restaurants nearby. Clean and modern room, immaculate bathroom, convenient mini-kitchen, and very friendly and helpful staff. In addition free internet access and a music box of about 1500 tracks!This was our 2nd stay at base2stay, and we will not search for another hotel when in London.	
Mar 17 2009 	Clean comfortable 	We stayed with our 3 teenagers and had a brief but very comfortable stay. The rooms were brilliantly equipped, comfortable and clean and the staff very friendly. Will definitely book in again.	
Mar 17 2009 	Perfect Location: Great Service	I was staying here for three nights recently with a friend. It was our first stay and we were very impressed. The location of the hotel is perfect, near the Earl's Court tube stop on the Picadilly line, which means you can take the tube directly from Heathrow airport. The rooms are very comfy, with microwave and electric kettle, and bath tub. And they also offered discounts at local restaurants. Highly recommended. The only point was the cost, I found it a little on the high side, although we are talking about South Kensington in London.	
Mar 16 2009 	different from normal hotel stay	stayed here two nights in Jan. Place very clean.place was small, like an ordinary house, sort of, rooms were all over the place, sort of quaint and charming some might think. very quiet the weekend we were there, we arrived one o clock in morning and took us ages to check in with I presume was the night porter. Would have liked to have been able to have breakfast there. Had to walk to Earls Court and places for breakfast which were not great. Far enough when walking with bags to the tube also. What i would wonder about if a noisy crowd were booked in , would you be able to do anything about it? as there was no evidence of many staff around. even though it was clean, good value and comfortable, I think i would like a hotel when in london next, and more central.	
Mar 9 2009 	Highly Recommend	No complaints...Had an enjoyable and comfortable stay at this hotel. It's quiet, clean, new, and modern. The staff was pleasant and helpful with questions. I spent 3 days in London shopping on Oxford Street and Covent Garden, both areas are easy to get to from the hotel using the tube.Getting to the hotel from the airport using the tube was unbelievably easy and cheaper than taking a taxi. The Piccadilly line will take you to the hotel with no transfers. Once you arrive at the Earl's Court tube stop, there is an elevator - a plus with luggage.The hotel is a short walk from the tube stop(make sure to leave through the Earl's Court exit, the Warick Road exit). On the same street as the tube stop there are numerous restaurants, pubs, food shops/markets, pharmacy, post office, internet cafe... anything you need. I stayed in the single room and felt the size was just right for me. Not as small as I expected based on previous reviews. It was very clean and cozy. Loved the mini kitchenette- includes a sink, microwave, fridge, teapot, dishware and utensils. Also loved that I could control the temperature in the room. There is internet access and movies available for 2 pounds. Nice bathroom, was a good size with a towel warmer.I plan on staying here again when I return to London.	
Mar 9 2009 	excellent stay we we'll back	Very nice hotel, conveniently situated in Kensington, close to lots of restaurant, pub, bakery and mini market and in a 5 minute walk from Earl's court tube station. The area is safe, so you can move by foot even in the night. In the room there's e little kitchen where you can prepare coffe, tea, or have a fast meal.I found the room incredibly clean and I think the price is appropriate for the service the hotel provides. I would absolutely come back!	
Mar 4 2009 	Brilliant place to stay	We spent 3 days in London to celebrate my husband's birthday so we were out a lot of the time. However this is just the most wonderful place to base yourself. Its quiet but 5 mins from tube. Small clean rooms, flat screen TV, little kitchen with microwave, great shower in bathroom- in fact everything you could need in a small space. Rooms were cleaned every day to a very high standard, staff were helpful and pleasant.Can't wait to stay there again and would recommend to anyone who wants a nice place to base themselves but doesn't want to spend too much time in hotel as rooms are rather small.	
Mar 1 2009 	Nice but noisy	Stayed here for one night in a superior room on the Ground floor (not cheap at over 150 quid) for an event at the RAH. Agree with other reviewers that the rooms are quite small though well-equipped with microwave, tiny fridge that didn't get all that cold), sink and crockery and cutlery. Nice bathroom with a really powerful shower. Location is great, 5 mins away from Earls Court tube station and loads of pubs and restaurants in the vicinity. Staff are really helpful and will recommend eateries, give directions etc. I arrived early and they did all they could to let me occupy my room by 12 noon. (NB: the advertised breakfast boxes are no longer available, nor are many of the money-off vouchers they claim to have in the guest directory.Two or three niggles: the bed was very soft and the mattress had seen better days as we could feel the springs through it; we found the place very noisy and could hear the footsteps from the room above late at night and early in the morning, which was a pain; we also found that the room got very hot.	
Feb 28 2009 	A great base to stay in London	We stayed at Base2stay for six nights in February and it was definitely the cleverest and best hotel we've stayed in so far in London (this was visit nr 19).The location was great. It was very easy to get to all central London destinations and there were also great restaurants and supermarkets near by. The street was astonishingly quiet and we couldn't hear the traffic (if there was any on the quiet street) in our room.The room was smallish but very well organized (we never travel light and still had room to our two large suitcases and to move around). The mini-kitchenette was really useful. We made our own breakfast every morning with food from the supermarket. Hotels with breakfast of the same rating were a lot more expensive and still the breakfast isn't usually that spectacular. The contemporary styled furniture was good and clean and the room was comfortable and exceptionally clean. The shower was also very good. Our sink was blocked when we arrived and it was fixed immediately. The staff was friendly and helpful. It almost felt like you were staying in a flat rather that a hotel since you didn't see a lot of people in the hotel corridors, the lobby etc. But you still got the benefits of a good hotel like you could leave your suitcases at the reception if your flight was later etc.One of the best features at Base2stay is that you get internet on the tv in the room and it was very easy to use it. The hotel's website was really informative as regards restaurants, shops etc in the area and the internet is almost a must while travelling.The staff was really helpful with booking seats on flights etc if you needed help. Base2stay is definitely our base when ever we travel to London. Reasonably priced, the rooms include all you need from a fridge to a microwave oven and the internet as well as a comfy bed. What else does a traveller need?	
Feb 27 2009 	Excellent value for London	Base2stay is a modern, clean hotel based in Kensington. We picked the hotel based on price and reviews, we were not disappointed. Check-in was easy and quick, the room was small but most rooms in London are. The room was modern with all the essentials (tv, kettle, fridge...etc). The hotel is only 5 minute walk from the tube station which is fantastic. When staying in London I would not hesitate to book this hotel again.	
Feb 24 2009 	great feeling clever solutions (bed kitchenette)	I joined my partner who was in London for Business, for the weekend. We knew the vicinity from previous visits, and liked it because of its atmosphere, nice strolls, shopping, dining and picadilly line service. So we searched for another hotel in the same area and thanks to tripadvisor we found base2stay. Clean room, small but with clever solutions (high bed with space below, kitchenette including all you need including even microwave, cleaned up by the housekeeping staff every morning), proper desk, TV with radio and movie on demand functions. Everything very clean, modern appeal, state of the art. Only thing I disliked was the window that is 19th century - but with blinds and curtains closed it was ok. Staff booked a table in a greek restaurant nearby for us, great experience and we got 20% discount because being guests of base2stay.	
Feb 15 2009 	Wonderful caring service	I stayed twice at base2stay during January and February, 2009. I found the customer service attitude from everyone I dealt with to be outstanding! The property is clean, well kept, compact, and easy to stay in. I especially liked the maid service that included washing up the dishes and kitchenette utensils. I recommend this to anyone looking for a very luxurious budget hotel.	
Feb 6 2009 	would have been great if the airconditionning/heating worked better (wintertime)	Back from a 4 night stay in Base2stay end january.Great hotel exept the heating: very good first impression... in fact our double room 116 was a small studio appartment, so practical with its kitchenette. Great value. great decoration, sober but chic. People nice at the desk. Very good location.BUT be careful if you are sensitive to air conditioning or if you enjoy &quot;plain&quot; warm rooms like i do: we had a big problem with the 2 heating systems and i caught a sorethroat and bronchitus! To begin with, the room is not heated anymore as soon as you leave it because the keycard has to be in the slot ....when it's 0° outside...it's cold when you come back to your room: not pleasant! i told the frontdesk it was cold, they explained the keycard system to me. ok.but:The heating comes (or should come) in 2 ways:*the air conditioning for the heat in the room, wich kept ventilating(=throwing air on us) all night long, even when put on &quot;Low&quot; fan AND it was noisy. but if you stopped it, it was cold in the room... again, unpleasant! *and you had to heat even more the room because it was so cold in the bathroom , where a lot of (freezing) air was coming in from the window (not insulated) and the only heating system is a &quot;hanging towels radiator&quot; ..which was not hot enough . (and it was &quot;on&quot;, i checked)So i got a sorethroat and finally got ill... i didn't want to look too fussy so i didn't go twice at the desk. But i told them when i left and they told me that in the other rooms the heat was enough in the bathrooms. ? . to be checked.. but ANYWAY THE FACT THAT THE HEATING SYSTEM TURNS OFF WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM IS VERY BAD, because of'course the rooms are gonna be cold at the end of the day in wintertime!! (+check insulation of the bathroom)Did other people have the same problem in another room? or no problem like that at all? in which rooms? thank you.It's really too bad, because once again, except this, i loved the hotel!	
Jan 31 2009 	Very happy with base2stay	My daughter and I stayed at base2stay during Thanksgiving week. We were in London to celebrate her 16th birthday. I could not have been happier with our accomodation. We stayed in a bunk bed room. I was a bit disappointed at check in to be directed downstairs. Oh no, I thought, a dark basement room. Wrong! The room had French doors at the far end that opend to a tiny courtyard, giving the room natural light and a feeling of space. In nice weather, the table and chairs would be perfect for enjoying a drink or even a meal heated in the in-room kitchenette.The room was very small, but also very well-designed, making the most of the space. Everything was very modern and kept clean. The closet was small, with an area to hang clothes and several shelves since there is not a bureau. There is also a desk and an easy chair. Interestingly for such a small room, the bathroom was a very decent size with attractive fixtures and a great shower. Free internet access is available via the wall-mounted flatscreen TV. It was a little difficult to get used to, but it does the trick for checking email or the location of a restaurant, etc. Not as good as one's own laptop, but nice not to have to schlep it along!The kitchenette is very convenient, containing a mini-fridge, a sink, a micro-wave, a wonderful English electric teakettle and a remarkable array of dishes and serving pieces, even including a breadboard and corkscrew. It was great for a light breakfast and snacks. Although everything needed for heating ready made meals is available, there is really no where to eat comfortably unless the weather is pleasant and meals are taken in the courtyard.The location couldn't be better. Just a three minute walk from the Earls Court tube station, all of London is an easy tube or bus ride away. Earls Court Road itself is a very &quot;real people&quot; place, with lots of British chain restaurants, local pubs, a Simply Foods by Marks and Spencer as well as more basic grocery stores, a Boots pharmacy, and so on. Even though the area is full of converted mini-hotels and B&amp;Bs, the atmosphere was not really touristy...more like a lot of visitors hanging out in a regular neighborhood. Base2stay is located just far enough away from the busy street to be quiet. We felt very safe no matter what time of day or night we were out.I paid 95 pounds per night for our room, which given the price of London hotel rooms was more than fair for the quality of the accomodation. I am never sure how many &quot;stars&quot; to give a place like this. On one hand, it's not the Ritz. On the other, it doesn't pretend to be! I gave it four because I don't want to be misleading, but it is five in terms of what it claims to be. I can say that I woud happily stay here again on my next trip to London.	
Jan 31 2009 	great spot great price great hotel	Base to stay is a great concept. Neat, tidy, functional and it looks great. Free internet, little fridge, microwave and kitchinette.. Awesome location. All the staff friendly and helpful. It was everthing we needed, in a great location for subway and restaurants and supermarket. Good rates.	
Jan 26 2009 	Location price and design	Believe the positive reviews. We liked the location (near tube and restaurants), the price and the quiet street. Our modern room (a twin) was tiny, but it didn't make us feel locked up. Well designed. Great power-shower (lovely shower-soap). Smart kitchenette with a microwave, fridge, sink, kettle, tea and coffee. Good Philips flatscreen tv with internet. New films only 2 pounds. Will be back in july.	
Jan 25 2009 	I'd recommend a friend	Very pleasant helpful staff, beautifully clean room, quiet; all very acceptable.	
Jan 24 2009 	Brilliant Service and Value	A series of apartments in a converted Edwardian house. For London the rooms are large and exceptionally well appointed. I have stayed in London hotels for over 500 nights in the last 5 years and this place offers excellent quality and value for money.Everything was fresh, clean and worked perfectly. The air conditioning was excellent.I arrived early and the staff were very helpful ushering me immediately to the room. I didnt use the kitchen facility but it was first class. There are 3 major food stores within 5 mins walk (M&amp;S Sainsbury adn Waitrose) with a range of prepared meals that you could bring back and cook. There are also literally dozens of different restaurants within a 5 minute walk.It has a great AV / TV system, offers free internet avccess and shows Pay as You Go films for £2 compared to £8 in most other hotelsMy room cost £85. That was quite stunning value.	
Jan 20 2009	Time in London	Base2stay is situated in an excellent location for a short break in London. It is within easy walking distance of underground stations and the museums. The staff are friendly and efficient and sorted us out a room even though we arrived at the hotel early. The accomodation was excellent - a large comfortable bed, a super shower and a mini kitchen that had all you would need to make a snack. The room was immaculately clean and very well presented. I would recommend the hotel to anyone needing a central location in the city.	
Jan 12 2009 	place2stay away	We had some problems during check in, nothing major but still inconvenient. Our room had been cancelled because I did not get back in contact with them via email, if it was so important they should of contacted me via telephone as both mobile and home number was provided, but the new girl behind reception was very helpful and understanding. Room:The room is clean but small and the shower is not oversized in the slightest, but the room is cleaned daily (towels replenished once during our 3 night stay).Location:Very close to local shops, restaurants and train station, all within walking distance.Overall a okay stay ideal 4 business people but wouldn't stay again.	
Jan 11 2009	Great value in heart of London	Finding an inexpensive hotel in London is next to impossible. That's why we were so pleased to find Base2Stay. It's near the Earl's Court tube, so the area around it isn't particularly cool, but it has great access to everything in London. The look of the hotel is minimalist chic, which makes the property feel much more upscale than its price tag would indicate. The rooms are very small and might be too confining for longer than a few days, but who spends much time in their room in London anyway?It was comfortable, quiet, and enabled us to get around easily without spending a bundle. I highly recommend it!	
Jan 8 2009 	Don't hesitate to book if you are in London	My wife, son and I arrived in London for the New Year celebrations - the big attraction of Base2Stay was that unlike many London Hotels they keep their prices at normal rates which is excellent value normally, but exceptional at that time of the year. The reception staff were very friendly and the room was perfectly clean and decorated to a really high standard. My son had a settee bed, but this was good quality and very comfortable. The room was even cleaned on new Year's day and the staff waited until we went out just before lunchtime to maintain the room. For location it is a five minute walk from Earls Court tube and the links across London from there were great - even on New Years eve we were back at the hotel in 20 minutes.I have used this hotel previously for business and would not hesitate to recommend it for business or leisure - brilliant.	
Jan 6 2009 	modern hotel in historic building	Great experience at base2stay. It's in a nice location, 5 minute's walk from Earl's Court tube station (convenient access to Heathrow - 45 minutes by tube, direct). But it's quiet!Pluses: excellent decor, furnishings. Very modern interior, and very well-designed. But it's in a historic-looking building in a beautiful neighborhood. The rooms feel bigger than they are since everything is so well laid-out - no wasted space! Bathroom was excellent - one of the best hotel showers I've used. Nice complementary toiletries as well. Internet access via wireless or via TV (big, flat-screen). Comfy beds. Nice elevator, but there are a few stairs as well. Professional, helpful staff. Efficient check-in/check-out process (didn't seem to have an automated checkout though). Minuses: we had a lousy view (air shaft, corner), but on the plus side, it was super quiet. We didn't spend any daylight hours in the room so didn't care. I don't think they have a restaurant, but the room comes with a kitchenette. There are loads of restaurants and pubs around anyway (including a Wagamama 5 minutes away).No significant complaints - mainly, pleasant surprises. And I'm pretty picky!	
Jan 4 2009 	Tiny room various technical faults	Even considering the price I paid (about 100 pounds a night) the room was tiny. Worse than this, I suffered constant technical problems. First of all, the internet connection kept breaking down, caused (as usual in hotels) by problems with the charging mechanism. I also kept having problems with my room-access card, the heating did not seem to respond to the controls and the television broke down. I reported all these matters to the staff and got a letter from the manager, who acknowledged my &quot;issues&quot; and said they were being put right but seemed unable to write the words &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;apologise&quot;. Disappointing.	
Dec 31 2008 	What a BRILLIANT Hotel !!!	27th - 30th December 2008.We found Base to Stay via the internet and was absolutely delighted by the facilities and staff. We wanted a family break during &quot;Twixmas&quot; for 2 adults and a 12 yearold - who was to celebrate his 13th birthday whilst we were away!The room was a Superior room, with a large double bed and unusually for a hotel, a VERY comfortable single bed.We loved the fact that we had loads of space in our room. Unlike cheaper hotels, the wardrobe had doors, so everything was neatly hidden away. The small kitchenette, also hidden behind doors, had a fridge, sink, kettle and microwave, which enabled us to cook breakfast and an evening meal! The bathroom was spotless and the shower hot and powerful.What was quite unique was the interactive TV, with all the free to air digital channels, plus free intenet access, internet radio, its own mini &quot;i-tunes&quot; with all manner of cd's and games pre loaded and free to play. The movies cost just £2 each. I know London has rather a lot of attractions, but it was nice to come back to our room and have plenty of entertainment whilst we relaxed.The other unique feature was the fact that we had 3, totally uninterrupted nights sleep! No slamming of doors, no shouting down the corridors, no heavy footsteps from the room above, despite the hotel being full during our stay. The area felt safe at night. M&amp;S and Waitrose were 2 mins away as was Earls court Station and Harrods was only a 15 min walk along Cromwell Road.We will definitly be returning in the summer for another short break.	
Dec 29 2008 	Small hotel off Earl's Court	3 of us stayed in a triple room in Base2Stay for 3 nights. We paid about GBP 160 per room per night, which worked out to be about GBP 55 per person....which was not a bad bargain for central London.The hotel is not exactly in Kensington as the name suggested. Granted that it is still in the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Base2Stay was off Earl's Court road - cross the road from Earl's Court tube, turn right, walk down Earl's Court Gardens and turn left at the first junction. Base2Stay is a refurbished series of townhouses, with narrow hallways and a ladyrinth of rooms. But the decor is clean, modern and blended well with the white-washed columns and walls on the outside. The room was small and rather cramped for 3 persons. It would have been just nice for a double. It was evident that the room was designed for a double with there being 2 standard single beds with a diven and headboards et al and one, foldable / collapsible single bed squeezed between the work desk and the 2 standard single beds.To save space, the small kitechenette is built into the wall like a cupboard and space saving furniture used, e.g. wall mounted LCD telly, half-size stool in place of a chair or sofa etc.The bathroom, thankfully, is a decent size.Furnishing is of a good quality and overall, the stay was comfortable, albeit a little cramped at times. Base2Stay was very unlike other horror stories of townhouse-converted-into-hotels in other parts of central London where peeling paint, overhanging wires and generally, dingy decor were the order of the day.	
Dec 21 2008 	Brilliant Base2Stay!!!	We stayed one night at Base2Stay whilst visiting the International Horse Show at Olympia (one stop away on the tube from Earls Court).The hotel is about a 3 min walk from Earls Court Tube and a street full of restaurants, take aways, off licences, supermarkets, really handy if you want something to eat and drink. There is a vending machine at the hotel which has chocolate, crisps, cans of drink etc.Check in was the quickest ever, no queues of people, a nice greeting from the receptionist.We had a standard double room on the 3rd floor, which had everything we needed - lovely comfy bed, nice clean modern bathroom, nice flat screen TV positioned perfectly for watching from bed!, mini kitchen with cutlery and plates/cups/glasses/microwave, free internet through the TV, and good storage space.The whole hotel was very clean and modern and tastefully decorated, even the christmas wreath on the front door was classy!I would def recommend this place if visiting/working in places in West London.	
Dec 16 2008 	Good Place . . . but let's keep a level head	This was a good place to stay. Very small room, but very clean. Had a fridge and mini-kitchenette in a closet. Good location 2 minutes from Earl's Court tube station. I agree with others that it's a good place but think it may be a little overhyped. There are other places in London cheaper and also quite adequate. The much-ballyhooed internet service through the TV set was annoying and practically useless. The pay-for internet service worked well.	
Dec 15 2008 	Can't beat it for location price and staff	We stayed here over a beautiful weekend in December. The hotels location is great, about 3 minutes walk from Earls Court station and the tube to most places you'd want to go. Within walking distance of Chelsea, Kensington, Hyde park etc. Hotel itself is clean, tidy and reasonably priced.I did stay here about three years ago and thought the staff were pretty poor and unhelpful. Now the difference couldnt be more marked - very keen to help, friendly and welcoming.Ill stay here every time I go london!	
Dec 11 2008 	Seriously good simplicity !	We were introduced to Base by the owners and really enjoy the simple, yet comfortable surroundings in a great location. The package is rounded off by the team who are friendly, helpful and accommodating! Altogether a unique experience that we'd happily recommend.	
Dec 1 2008 	Great value and location - loved it!	My friend and I stayed at Base2Stay November 6-12 for a girlfriend getaway, and were very pleased with our choice. We were looking for a hotel that was under £150 per night, on the Piccadilly line, a short walk from the nearest tube stop, had two beds, an in-room safe, and a mini-kitchen. Base2Stay ticked every box and then some.We paid £134 per night for a twin room, and it was a decent size - not large, but there was ample room for the two of us. The room had a clean, modern appearance (think Ikea furniture) and was comfortable and pleasant. The mini-kitchen was discretely hidden behind a set of doors, and there was a small desk and flat screen TV with internet. The kitchen was equipped with a microwave, kettle, and mini-fridge, and included plates, silverware, and glasses for two, as well as a decent corkscrew. Limited free internet access was provided, but I found the setup to be too slow and cumbersome. My friend has more patience, and used it to send emails on most evenings.The room and bathroom were very clean, and the carpet and furniture were all in good condition. The room does not come with an iron, but I requested one and it was delivered promptly along with an ironing board. My only complaint is that the sheets were not changed at all during our six night stay.One of the selling points for us was the arrival base - you can rent a room for £15 an hour upon arrival, which would allow you to freshen up. We didn't need to use it though, since we had only a short wait until our room was ready, despite arriving at 9:30 am. Still, I think this is a great option for early morning arrivals.We found the staff to be very accommodating and friendly, and they were happy to put half of the bill onto each of our credit cards. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood, and I didn't hear any street noise or anything from the surrounding rooms.I liked the Earls Court area because of the variety of shops and restaurants. It caters to both residents and tourists, and the streets weren't filled with tacky souvenir shops. We had a great meal at It's Greek to Me, and a very overpriced and &quot;just OK&quot; meal at Mr. Wing's (they could at least serve Chinese mustard with the spring rolls instead of plain old yellow). There were some nice bakeries, a post office, and cheap internet café across from the tube stop. The Earls Court Exhibition Center and the Brompton Cemetery are both just about a ten minute walk from the hotel.I was really pleased with the accommodations and location, and would highly recommend Base2Stay.	
Nov 24 2008 	Great Base 2 Stay	Absolutely Loved It! Fantastic location just a short stroll to Earls Court Station. On Picadilly Line with lifts and ramp to road so easy to arrive directly from Heathrow with luggage. Fab resteraunts, Pubs, M &amp; S food supermarket, post office, ATMs and Laundromat all within a very easy walk.Queen Bed room and Kitchenette facilities whilst compact were exceptionally well designed and easy to live in. Simple things like space under the bed for suitcases all made. Internet via the TV was useful even though slightly cumbersome. Decor of the rooms and entire property was very calming, just a fab find. Would highly recomend and definately return.	
Nov 23 2008 	An ABSOLUTE must!!!	base2stay Kensington, was the BEST hotel/apparment i have ever stayed in. it was clean, spacious, nice bathroom, comfortable bed, great kitchenette. what else could you ask for???LOCATION?? the location was outstanding, it was close to the supermarket, heaps of restaurants/cafes, the underground and the gardens. we shared the biggest room of the whole building with a suite and a big bathroom and a king size bed + a balcony. the t.v was awsome too!! it was absolutley freezing when we got to london, but when you got into the hotel + our room it was lovely and warm. I RECOMEND IT TO EVERYONE! i was sensational.	
Nov 17 2008 	Recommend this one	My wife and I used base2stay for 2 nights while we were attending a seminar at the Ibis hotel Earls Court (not a hotel I would recommend) friends also attended and we were able to get 2 adjoining rooms on the ground floor with a joint terrace with tables and chairs. The seminar finished quite late, and, although there are restaurants around the hotel, they seemed to be mainly the fast food type, so it was great to have a kitchenette in a cupboard in the room with crockery, cutlery and glasses. Marks and Spencers food shop is only a few paces away (it stays open quite late) and we were able to buy micowaveable meals of a reasonable quality and cook and eat the meals on the terrace (it was quite sheltered and the weather was not too cold, wouldn't recommend the outdoor meals when it's raining) They do offer a &quot;breakfast box&quot;, but it's full of Kellog's products and long life milk and juice. Buy some stuff at Marks and Spencer and use the micowave for food.Good bathroom and power shower. TV with internet capability (not tested) Air conditioning and heating worked well. All in all a change from the usual multinational high rise hotels aroud the area. Highly recommended if you a attending anything in and around Earls Court. The reception/concierege staff were great, and security is good - the hotel door locks down at 11p.m. and you need to prove guest I.D. to get in.	
Nov 15 2008 	Great Hotel!	Love the hotel and location! I've ordered a stay of 7 night, single room. The stuff is nice and helps were needed. The room was a bit too small but very clean and cozy. The small kitchen is not to useful - there is no really a place to eat in the room - but I did use the fridge. My disappointment was the lack of wi-fi for my cell phone, and surfing the web through the TV option is very uncomfortable. Location is gr8 - very close to Earl's Court tube station, right on the district' circle and Piccadilly lines (all the way to Heathrow!) Would love to come back again!	
Nov 9 2008 	Great stay	My 9-year old son and I booked a &quot;bunk&quot; bed room on the main floor.It was very nice, but extremely small by western standards. Perhaps next time, we'll book a twin room.The bathroom facilities were excellent.We paid 97 GBP including VAT.My only complaint was that you could hear some noise and banging from the room above us.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for style and cleanliness.	
Nov 3 2008	base2stay Continues to Impress!	We saw all the positive reviews on this hotel and decided to spend a little more than we normally would for a night in beautiful Kensington. We are so impressed that we'll probably stay here again when we come back to London.It is conveniently located (1 block walk) by Earl's Court Underground (Tube) station, such that making it to and from Heathrow is a 3 pound one-way fare per adult. If you have lot's of luggage, train/taxi might be better.We booked a double plus a single sleeper for 157 pounds ($256) per night. We were so happy with the room and friendly service. This hotel definitely has the priorities right for us. Central, quiet location combined with stylish design made us easily forget about room service and workout room.The only tiny gripe is that you can hear people walking around above you. Get a top floor if possible so you can be the one disturbing those below! ;)This place is definitely worth the extra, if you're trying to watch your spending.	
Oct 31 2008 	We'll be back to base2stay!	How lucky we were to find base2stay! Our reservation for a room with bunk beds was received and confirmed efficiently via email and our inquiries as to transportation from Heathrow was also handled well.When we arrived, we found a clean, well-kept building just two minutes from the Earl's Court tube station! The room was clean and exactly what the website promised! A wonderful &quot;base&quot; location for trips all over London, helpful, efficient staff (thanks Vinny!), free internet access, a dreamy shower, and efficient use of a small room - perfect for two adults who don't necessarily want to share a bed. We will definitely stay here again!	
Oct 25 2008 	Loved it!	Just returned from a three night stay at Base2stay in London. The location was a three minute walk to Earl's Court tube and the walk to the hotel was safe. As a single person one could feel comfortable walking there alone in the evening. The room was super clean, great bathroom with shower, the kitchenette was great to have. Easy to pick up breakfast or other foods at Marks and Spencers almost right beside the tube station. There a pubs very close, also an Italian a Greek and an Indian resturants within a 10 minute walk. Great value and trendy type of place.	
Oct 21 2008 	Just what we were looking for	I booked for the first time Base2Stay based on TripAdvisor reviews and I was not disappointed. Small (which I expected of course) but &lt;very&gt; efficiently laid out room. Great shower. Little kitchenette wonderful. Ability to search web on TV which I wasn't looking for actually turned out to be very useful for checking the status of the Tube in the mornings, booking a show, checking the weather. Very quiet and &lt;extremely&gt; clean. Pleasant staff at front desk. The key cards had to be recharged at one point, they slowly sort of lost their ability to open the doors, but recharging was no problem. We could feel the springs in the bed somewhat (room 502 I think), but it really didn't affect our sleep. The location is fantastic - plenty of restaurants nearby, Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Food store for groceries. ATMs, bakeries, Earls Court tube. All within 1-3 blocks. And trees in the parks. Next time I visit London I don't have to find a place, this is it! One thing that would be good - a little map on the web site to show the actual ocation. The way the streets are labeled in that area is a little confusing. There are 2 segments of Courtfield Gardens...	
Oct 11 2008 	amazing staff	Having arrived at 8am after a 24 hour flight from Australia we were thrilled to be able to have use of our room. As mentioned by previous writers the room was very small and we had nowhere to store our luggage so consequently it sat on the floor and we jumped over it! My only complaint was the mattress which was very tired to say the least ( we stayed on the fourth floor).The location, cleanliness and helpfulness of the staff made up for the bed and we would definately recommend it.	
Oct 9 2008 	Great Base	I stayed with my 8 year old son during Thanksgiving of last year. We stayed in a room with a bunk bed; he loved every minute of sleeping on the top bunk. The kitchenette was great to heat his cereal in the mornings. Nice walk to the Museums and restaurants. My favorite was Nandos great chicken dishes for a good price. Short walk to the tube was fantastic we took the train from Heathrow only glitch was when we got off the train at Earls Court we head in the wrong direction. The shower was fantastic nice TV wish there was cable. Next trip to London I will definitely stay again.	
Oct 6 2008 	Base2Stay a great place2stay!	Was very pleased with base2stay. The room, though very small, was comfortable. Stayed in 3 different rooms there (on different legs of the same trip.)--two of the rooms were very clean and the third (maybe in an older part of the hotel) had had some water damage, but was acceptable.The bathrooms, with power showers, were wonderful. And the toiletries provided were very nice. The kitchenettes were helpful and most useful for the budget traveler, like me! Also very much appreciated free web access in the rooms.The location, near Earl's Court Tube station-(and a Marks &amp; Spencer, OddBins, Boots, A couple of good bakeshops and pubs)--was great. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay there again!	
Oct 5 2008 	Modern and comfortable in good location	Base2stay is in a handy location, close to the tube and is very modern and comfortable. Our room (standard) was really a little too small for us, next time would upgrade to a superior. The kitchenette was great and storage adequate. Although little things like shower cap, tissues and face washers would have been appreciated. Staff kindly &quot;hunted down&quot; our lost expensive spectacles and posted them to us. Our only gripe is they double charged our debit card with a so called &quot;blind&quot; transaction which took lots of our time and money to sort out, as when we discovered it we were already in Paris. The Manager did apologise but be wary. We use the &quot;dot to dot&quot; shuttle service from the airport and were very impressed with this.	
Sep 26 2008 	Even better than expected!	We just returned from a 2 week trip that included stays in several European cities. Although we paid CONSIDERABLY more for supposedly superior 4 star hotels in at least two of our other destinations, we felt the Base2Stay clearly outshone the competition in price , location , room cleanliness and bathroom quality. The kitchenette was an added bonus. If only Base2Stay could expand into some other European countries, I'd never have to research where to stay in Europe again! Keep up the great work B2S!	
Sep 26 2008 	Great Place	Decided to stay here at the last minute (GBP 147 for twin/double) - we were not disappointed - while the room was small (which rooms in London aren't) it meet our needs with faclities to have food in the room to save a few bucks. The service received from the front desk was the best I've ever had - every question was answered with a smile and when they didn't know it - they looked it up and called back - that's service. It had a great big screen TV which included free access to the internet (provided you used the remote or the keyboard (no mouse) in the room) - that was a bonus once one learned how to nagigate without a mouse (you can use your laptop too but there was a charge for that) -they said they only charged a small fee for local calls but I don't remember any fees and we used it alot. The area of Earls Court is nice - stayed there on other occasions and have always felt safe and there are lots of people around the main street - this hotel is 5 minute walk from the tube and trust me - 2 women with 3 weeks of France/London under our belt - it was nice that it was only the 1 block!!!! There is a lift in the event one needs it (it was a bonus with the luggage) I have pictures which I will post as soon as I get them uploaded. While there are less expensive hotels nearby - but if your looking for a more modern, updated, clean, well taken care of, fridge, mirowave, sink, dishes etc and great service - then stay here - you won't be disappointed.	
Sep 24 2008	fabulous base2stay	Base2Stay was a great place for my son and myself to say while I was working nearby for a week. it was well-equipped, clean and nicely furnished. plus it is easily accessible to the city and staff were friendly. We loved the shower - it was by far the best we had in over a month of travelling!	
Sep 24 2008 	perfect base to stay	I stayed here with a colleague for a week while on a business trip. The location was perfect (only a 2 minute walk to Earls Court tube) and really safe and quiet but with plenty of amenities near by. The room was small but reasonable for london. The furnishings were modern and the hotel was well presented. The free internet available on the tv took a while to get used to but was great for checking internet banking and other simple tasks. The plug in internet was faster but more expensive. Wireless is not available but would be a great addition. The kitchenette was great for our usually rushed DIY breakfasts. Cleaning was immaculate. Staff were fantastic and very helpful even with unusual requests such as for bandaids and stamps! Overall, this was a perfect base and I will definately stay again as it was great value for money.	
Sep 23 2008 	Great small hotel but room for improvement	This is my personal choice when staying in London. Small, but efficient rooms with small kitchenette, great location, close to the Tube, quite location, not too expensive, what more could you desire. I stayed here before, just after the grand opening, and noticed two minor glitches. First, the mattress in my room could use replacement (I stayed in room 201), as I informed the management after the first night. Got no response though. Second, maintenance could do better in bathrooms, as 20 seconds after you turn on the shower, you find yourself standing in 5 cm of water. Otherwise, great choice.	
Sep 22 2008 	Best Kept Secret !!!	Great modern &amp; chic hotel with excellent location (2 mins from Earl's Court Tube, with lots of restaurants around). Super friendly staff. Staff went out of their way to make sure they answer your questions. The room was very very clean. Great facility inside the room....flat screen TV, high-tech bathroom, and also include a very equiped kitchen. The hotel is very energy-saving friendly, which is a total plus+++The only suggestion I have is that it will be EVEN better if there is free wireless Internet.	
Sep 19 2008	Fantastic	I was actually booked in the BW shaftesbury kensington who were shambolic. However they sent me here. Thankyou!!! Staff were great, the place was immaculate and quiet. Really handy for the tube and seemed quite safe.The room was small but functional and big enough for a short visit. Inside the wardrobe was a surprise as I found a microwave, sink and a fridge. It would be quite handy if you were staying here whilst working for the week.I would absolutely stay here again.	
Sep 14 2008 	Modern hotel convenient location good value	I stayed here for 4 nights from Sunday to Thursday. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again.Accessibility: Earl's Court tube stop is the nearest one to the hotel. If you are flying in and out of Heathrow, this is ideal as it is on the same line (Piccadilly) and no transfer is needed. Once at Earl's Court, there is an elevator and ramps so very easy with luggage. From there the hotel is about 2 blocks away. The hotel itself has an elevator as well.Facilities: As other reviewers have commented, the hotel and rooms are done up to modern and minimalist standards, and although the room I was in (single room - 114) was small, the space was used efficiently and the layout worked very well. The bathroom was full-sized, which I am sure is appreciated by all travelers. The kitchenette came in useful and I saved some money by food shopping and storing breakfast items in the fridge.Area: Earl's Court Road (which is the tube stop exit) is full of shops, cafes and restaurants: Somerfield supermarket, Marks and Spencer Simply Food, Boots, Starbucks, Coffee Republic, Wagamama (to name a few).The only comments I would make - and this is more so for management than travelers - is to consider changing the mattresses as the one I had felt very worn and is probably due for a replacement. I also noticed that the housekeeping staff replaced my towels everyday even when I hung them (as instructed in order to save on water/energy).	
Sep 4 2008 	Pretty darn good!	The hotel was very clean and the staff very nice. Accomdations were small compared to most American hotels I've stayed in, but we had the right amount of space. The only complaint I have is that there were crumbs on the plates in the cupboard. Other than that one little item, our stay was superb, staff were helpful and location was great! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.	
Sep 1 2008 	Great Hotel Great Area of London	This is a wonderful hotel. We stayed for 6 days (two adults, one child) It is clean, ultra-modern and comfortable. We had a double with a pull out chair for our daughter. The beds are very comfortable and the airconditioning was used every day during our stay. It was nice to have the option to open the windows during the day and have the air on at night for sleeping. The kitchenette was adqueate, however our rails were missing so we couldn't fill it like we wanted to and there is no toaster or coffee maker. The lift is small but excellent and much appreciated when you have children. Check-in and Check-out were efficient and fast. The hotel accommodated us for an early check in and tried to accommodate us for one night when the double room was not available by providing two singles (which we should have agreed to instead of moving to another apartment complex for one night!). The Hotel staff were very professional and efficient. There was only a slight blip when we went to check in again for the balance of our stay and the room was not available for us as we were told it would be before we left. The staff who were on that day realized we were unhappy and rallied together to get us into a room so we could get over to the theatre district in time for our play.The rooms are small but comfortable and the bathroom is larger than you would see in most London hotels. The half shower door is a little perplexing and water will be squirting out the side all over the floor if you aren't careful with the shower head. The heated towel holder is a luxury I wouldn't expect in a small hotel and would have traded it in for a toaster or coffee maker. The maids are excellent and quickly brought items that we needed (iron board, iron) The staff is very attentive and were helpful in picking restaurants, finding transportation, booking venues). The internet is difficult to figure out so if you really want access to all your mail addys - there are lots of little internet cafes close by where you can book venues online - check your mail etc... We used the internet mainly to read mail, check the weather etc. The free TV internet freezes occasionally and is very cumbersome to use as all the mouse features are on the keyboard. The staff did try to help out to show how to use it but it was slow and cumbersome. Keep in mind that you cannot compose on yahoo mail as it uses flash and you cannot open pdf files if you are looking on tourist sites. You can compose mail on facebook so this worked out fine. If you bring a laptop..this would be ideal but keep in mind they charge for that....You are a close proximity to Earls Court Tube (5 minute walk) and to two really great grocery stores (TESCO and Sainsbury's) The restaurant recommendations are excellent and getting the discount really was appreciated) Go to the Greek restaurant they recommend - it's the best Greek food I have ever eaten anywhere! Wagamama's is fun too....great for kids...and the Italian restaurant was superb~You will be pleased with your stay at Base2stay...it's a lovely residential area and it's easy to get around using the tube and bus system.If we go back to London - we will stay at Base2stay....but if the hotel could just bring in a toaster.....I can certainly drink tea instead of coffee for my caffeine fix but I really missed having toast or crumpets for breakfast as did my daughter who is used to this as a part of her morning meal.I hope this hotel keeps their pricing moderate....it is really on the edge of affordable with the exchange rate to pounds.	
Aug 28 2008 	Great place to stay	My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel with our three children. We loved this hotel. The location was great and very close to the tube. There were several restaurants in the area and grocery stores. The hotel offers 20% off coupons for many of the restaurants. The kitchenette was extremely handy. We booked two rooms, one superior for our three children and a king/double for my husband and myself. The rooms, although small were very well appointed. The bathroom and shower were great. The beds and linen were also very nice quality. The two rooms were connected by a large patio outside with two tables and plenty of chairs. The weather was great in London, so we took advantage of eating our breakfasts outside. The staff were very friendly, pleasant and helpful. The free internet was also handy. The only problem was that my husband could not connect with his personal e-mail account.The hotel is very clean and well maintained.I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again when I return to London.	
Aug 27 2008 	Wonderful Place to Stay!	My husband and I stayed at Base2stay twice during July. Everything was exactly as described on their website. The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood -- just minutes away from the Earls Court tube station. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. During one stay, we had a little patio outside our room. The staff were very friendly and helpful. In our opinion, base2stay rates a &quot;perfect 10.&quot;	
Aug 24 2008 	Would come back here.	Small clean rooms in a perfect location. Located near the Earls Court tube stop , so its easy access anywhere. The very small room had everything you needed, a fridge, tea, microwave, and internet access in the room via a flat screen TV. Very deco in decor. Lots of great restaurants within walking distance and a very safe suburban neighborhood. We would come back here. London was so expensive for American's that this was a nice break for us.	
Aug 12 2008 	Great Hotel Definitely coming back!	I stayed at Base2Stay for four nights last month with my girlfriend while visiting London. The hotel is located right near a major transportation hub that gives you easy access to London's amazing bus and subway systems, so it was incredibly easy for us to get around the city. The hotel was immaculately clean and, although the rooms aren't huge, everything is laid out in a thoughtful manner so the space is far more 'functional' than your ordinary hotel room. I loved the modern design and generally appreciated the attention to detail  nice flat screen TV's; outlets for cell phones, computers, etc; a little kitchenette to save money on breakfast. We did a lot of research before choosing this place, and I can't imagine finding a better value for your money. London is getting SO expensive and Base2Stay just gives you far more 'bang for the buck' than any other hotel. I highly recommend this place and will definitely stay there again when I come back to London.	
Aug 8 2008 	More than just a base to stay..	I chose to book here for my stay in July 08 on a recommendation from another trip advisor member. After reviewing all of the positive comments, I really wasn't worried at all and neither should you be. This hotel is everything it says it is and more. I did have one issue and will only point it out since it underscores the helpfulness of the staff. I was under the impression that I could use my own hairdryer and straigtener if i had an adaptor/converter since it had worked in Spain, France and Italy. Turns out that with London that isn't the case as I suspect it didn't really have to do with the hotel since I've heard similar stories from people visiting London from North America. Anyway, my straigtener broke and I blew the fuse in the room. The staff were very attentive to fix the problem and to even direct me to another room that was empty so that I could dry my hair. This time I would use the hairdryer that they supply and its no dinky hairdryer.. its quite good for a hotel to provide - it even had a nozzle which makes blowdrying easier!I only have a few recommendations for the manager...I notice that the sink in the washroom didn't seem to drain very well so perhaps he might want to check on that. I also noticed that the shower would turn off after a while of using it as would the internet/tv. I assume its a conservation mechanism and Im all for that except that when you are in the middle of an email it can be quite annoying especially since the keyboard is quite difficult to use to begin with. I was really just thankful to have free internet so its not a big issue but I figure constructive criticism is good!?In sum, if you go to London and want a reasonable place to stay, look no further because I don't believe you will get better value for your money anywhere else.	
Aug 6 2008 	Perfect Place to Stay in London!	Just returned from a 5-day stay at Base2Stay with my teen daughter and totally agree with the other reviews that I've been reading over the last 6 months! So easy to get to - we got our Oyster Passes (easy/cheap way to ride the Underground) at Heathrow, took the tube right to Earls Court, and walked the short block to the hotel. Even though we were early, we immediately got our room, and were very impressed: spotless, nicely furnished, great bathroom facilities, wonderful little 'kitchen', and as we found out that night, superb bedding. Staff was wonderful, room was wonderful, neighborhood was convenient, with many interesting places to eat, close to busses and underground.. We were extremely pleased!	
Jul 30 2008 	Very nice!	We stayed at this hotel for four nights, two adults and a small child. We loved it. The hotel is nice, modern, pleasant staff and very convenient. The rooms are small, but that was expected in London. Easy walking distance to the tube and grocery stores/coffee shops. We walked to the museums nearby and thought the neighborhood was very pretty and quiet. We had a family room on the ground level and were pleased that it also had a private patio- a nice plus! Would highly recommend this hotel. London was unseasonably hot the week we were in town and I was very happy that I booked a hotel with air conditioning!	
Jul 26 2008 	Great Place for a Great Price	This is our second stay within 6 months. The first time, we stayed for 5 nights in a &quot;standard double&quot;. The room was just the right size for two people. Although, you definitely need the space under the bed for your luggage to have any room to move. During our second stay, we stayed for 3 nights in a &quot;double/twin&quot; room. The room was almost twice the size of the &quot;standard double&quot;. Place was always immaculately clean. The in-room internet access was handy, but it did take some getting used to and you can't view PDF files with it. Location was great as it was a short 3 min walk to the nearest Tube stop (Earl's Court) and a ton of restaurants. There are also two handy self-serve laundry facilities nearby (on the same street as the tube stop).As long as the quality is kept, we don't think we'll be using any other place whenever we visit London.One quirky observation: during our first stay we saw the same faces in the front desk and even saw them training a new person upon check-in. Six months later, we didn't see any of the same people and this time they were training another new person upon check-in. What's with the complete turnover of staff within 6 months?	
Jul 25 2008 	Good place for exploring London	I stayed at this hotel for nearly 2 weeks at the end of May. It seems the hotel is run by French speaking people, but they do try to be friendly and helpful. Every thing is clean and not too much the worse for wear. The hotel is very conveniently located to the Earl's Court tube station and there are several supermarkets within a few blocks.My room was in the basement, which seems to be the case everywhere for singles, but there was little noise from any of the other rooms or floors. The kitchenette was good for its purpose, although don't count on making any ice in the frige. It would take several days for the water to freeze and they claim to clean out the ice tray after every guest, but the one in my frige looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a very long while. The free internet is on the TV and a little cumbersome to use, but for a small fee there is a direct hook-up for laptops. The desk was a little small for its multipurpose intention (desk, nightstand, table). The bathroom was very spacious, but the lighting was a little weird and the layout makes it very difficult to get within more than 2 feet from the mirror. The shower was great - good pressure and plenty of hot water. The power in the room won't work without the key card in its little slot, but at least it keeps you from losing the card. Infact, the only problem I had was that my key card was consistently inconsistent. I had to have it re-keyed about every other day. I know that they reuse these cards, but I do think that there is a limit on how many times a card can be reused. My purpose wasn't to spend a lot of time in my room, and everything worked well while I was there. Overall, a good experience and a good location.	
Jul 23 2008 	Excellent London base	Excellent value for price. Beautifully modern, small but so compact and well organized - barely knew there was a good kitchen in that space! central to tubes, close to V and A etc. Will definitely use again - very friendly and helpful personnel, very clean, good ac, not a thing to be negative about.	
Jul 22 2008 	no regrets.....	My son and I stayed here in July of this year. We tried 2 different rooms. One with twin beds and the other being the bunk beds. Both rooms had the same amenities. Given the chance to return to this hotel I would chose to stay my whole time in the bunk bed room. The beds were just as comfortable as the other but the cost would have been less. My son is 16 and had no problem sleeping or climbing to the top bunk. Other than that I would just like to repeat what others have said in relation to the hotel itself. The staff was helpful, hotel was clean and well care for, location was close to the tube and many nice restaurants nearby. Our favorite was Zizi's just by the Earls Court tube and a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Best Italian restaurant I've been to and would definitely return. One suggestion would be that a person should take in the wonderful museums close by and within walking distance. We really enjoyed London and all its charms.	
Jul 21 2008	Nice Amenities - Location is Not Teriffic	Ater reading all the raves about Base2Stay, we decided to book a few night's stay for part of our month-long visit to England this year. As previous guests have stated, the rooms are equipped with modern, clean decor and amenities, such as air-conditioning, a kitchenette, and luxurious towels and bed-sheets. Our double room was indeed tiny, and after a few nights, we were glad to be departing for larger digs, as we found the room to be too small to stay in for any duration while awake. There's just one chair, so if two people do want to eat in the room (with the microwave, fridge, etc., it seems guests are encouraged to do so..), then one person must sit on the bed and squeeze into a tiny space by the desk/table.The location of the hotel is the factor that will keep us from returning. Yes, it's close to the Earl's Court tube station, and a Marks &amp; Spencer mini grocery and a Starbucks, etc., but it isn't really within walking distance of anything besides the retailers on Earls Court Rd. If you enjoy parks, museums, walks with LondonWalks, etc., then you must rely on public transport to get where you want to go. The immediate area around the hotel is residential, so there's nowhere for a hotel guest to be except in their tiny room or in a restaurant/Starbucks on Earl's Court Road! As for the Earls Court tube - it's fine as long as it's up and running. We met with delays and suspension of service more than once at this station, which, by the way, requires users to be really clear about the directions they're heading if wanting to travel on the Circle line. We observed perplexed visitors as well as locals at this station, due to unclear directions. Gloucester Road and South Kensington tube stops became our preferred means of transport on the Circle or District lines.	
Jul 16 2008 	Best nights sleep EVER in a London Hotel	We went to a concert at the O2 and were concerned at the suitability of the hotel as regards transport accessibility.We needed have no concerns as it is 5 mins walk from Earls Court tube.The room we had was quiet and good, facilities which included fridge,microwave etc were excellent.Bathroom with powerful shower -great.Staff welcoming and profferred advice,such nice a change.I have stayed in many London hotels with mixed experiences but I can say that THIS was probably the BEST.On top of that the concert ,Neil Diamond, was fantastic	
Jul 13 2008 	Excellent hotel	I have stayed at this hotel twice, and each stay has been faultless. The rooms are clean and modern, and the bathrooms have a real luxurious feel to them. Upon arrival the staff were really efficient and helpful, and I had checked in within 5 minutes. The air conditioning in the rooms is good, and everything was very clean. The rooms also have microwaves, small kitchenettes, cutlery and sinks. The hotel is well designed, and feels like a 4* or 5* place.In terms of facilities, the hotel offers free internet through the TVs, which also have 18 digital channels, music, radio and pay films (£2 each). All in all, everything feels like value for money. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but guests can have a decent 'breakfast box' delivered to their room in the morning for just under £4. It was fine, with cereal, fruit, muesli bar and fruit juice. I actually quite liked not having to get dressed before eating!The hotel is very close to Earls Court tube, so if you are in town for anything on the Piccadilly or District Lines its well placed.Overall, recommended without hesitation.	
Jul 11 2008 	A gem of a hotel!	I have stayed at this hotel four times on business trips to London and it is consistently excellent. The concept is one of &quot;limited luxury&quot; which basically means that unnecessary/expensive extras are dispensed with in favour of excellent core facilities such as clean and stylish rooms and bathrooms etc. The location is excellent for exploring central London since the Piccadilly Line is only minutes away at either Gloucester Road or Earls Court Tube stations. The surrounding area is packed full of bars and restaurants and the rooms even have galley kitchen facilities if you prefer to cook. I've stayed in many different London hotels over the years and this is the best by a long way. It would always be my first choice for business or leisure trips due to its unique combination of value for money and comfort.	
Jul 8 2008 	Great Choice	Our group of 6 stayed at Base2Stay in late June for 5 nights as part of our European vacation. We had 2 rooms (triples). One room was on the lower ground and the other on the first floor. The rooms were modern, clean, quiet, and very pleasant. The kitchenette was very convenient. The presence of a small fridge, microwave, kettle, plates, and utensils made our visit to London much easier, since we were able to have breakfast in our rooms. This saved a lot of time in the mornings so we could head out earlier to enjoy London. It also made things easier for evening snacks etc.The location of the hotel is very good. It is on the Piccadilly line (direct from Heathrow), so taking the Underground Tube from the airport to the hotel was very easy and economical. The Tube station &quot;Earl's Court&quot; is a 3 minute walk. The area felt safe. The hotel is in a mostly residential area with some other hotels and shops mixed in.Earl's Court Rd (were you exit from the tube) has many little stores and places to eat (including Subway sandwiches, Baker's oven, and other fast food). Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Food was an especially convenient little grocery store. You can purchase items for breakfast the night before. It also has a wide selection of ready to eat meals (not frozen) that can be microwaved in your room is you choose. Barclay's bank ATM machines and a post office are directly across the street from the Earl's Court Tube station. There is coin laundry on a nearby street. This was useful for us as we needed to do laundry before continuing our vacation in Paris.The location was great for taking the tube to most of London's biggest attraction sites. This is very important because you can totally eliminate the need for taking expensive taxis. Earl's Court tube station has 2 key lines (Picadilly and District) and the underground system is extremely easy to use.We had 2 minor incoveniences at this hotel which were corrected during our first evening there. The bathtub/shower drains extremely slowly (this was the case in both of our rooms). The staff used a liquid product in the drain to improve this and it was better by the next day. The fridge was unplugged in both rooms, and it took a long time to cool it down. We realized this only after doing our groceries, so check to make sure your fridge is plugged in when you first check in. The plug is behind the garbage can inside the kitchinette closet.Overall we were very happy with Base2Stay.I hope this review is useful. Enjoy your trip.	
Jul 6 2008 	Great comfort superb value	I recently stayed at Base2stay in London for a week and I loved it! I have stayed in many hotels but I have never experienced such a welcoming, accommodating and charming staff. The hotel is also beautiful, very Zen-like. My room offered every amenity I needed including a/c, a mini kitchen, which is a real bonus in an expensive city like London, a large flat-screen TV and easy to connect internet for my notebook; the bed was so comfortable that despite a 5 hour time difference with the US, I did not feel as jetlagged as I usually do. I travel to London quite often and this was the first time I stayed at Base2stay, however, it wont be the last. I truly enjoyed my time there and will, without hesitation, make it my hotel of choice each time I visit this beautiful city.	
Jun 26 2008 	What a gem!	Spent 2 nights here in May 2008. Took the Tube from Heathrow after a long flight from Australia. Just a short walk up the road to Base2Stay. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room on the second floor was smallish but beautifully modern and very smart. The bathroom was superb with modern appliances and all the amenities of a five star hotel. The small kitchen is a huge bonus. If you don't want to eat out in London (and who would) you can buy whatever from the nearby supermarket and do your own in-room catering. This place is a gem! I have already recommened it to two other people who have made bookings.	
Jun 24 2008 	Excellent modern hotel	Stayed at Base2Stay for 4 nights in May 2008.Room was warm and cosy with nice modern decor. Loved having a mini kitchen, esp the microwave and it was great that this was cleaned daily. Bathroom was good too - loved the shower.Easy to get to from Earl's Court tube stop. Heaps of places to eat nearby plus supermarkets etc.A nice stay in a pleasant, clean hotel in a good location.	
Jun 22 2008 	I can't wait to stay here again!	A previous reviewer wrote that, while they enjoyed the hotel, they felt that it was too far. My husband and I chose base2stay for our week long stay in March and felt that the location was superb. For one, the hotel was down the street from the underground station. Since we flew in/out of Gatwick, we had a bit of a trip to make. However, we chose to use the tube to Victoria and catch the Gatwick Express to/from the airport. This could not have been any quicker or easier, even with suitcases and classic London weather.The Kensington area is full of food options. We had no problem with finding breakfast/lunch/dinner each day of our stay. In addition, because we were so close to the tube (Earls Court), the ride into the city center was quick and painless. Of course, if one is looking for touristy things to do, Kensington might not be the first choice. It's a neighborhood with a quiet and chill vibe. However, my husband and I were specifically looking for a hotel that would be away from the tourist areas and in a quiet, livable area. We certainly were not disappointed.The hotel itself was wonderful. Besides the fact that the front desk was really warm and friendly upon our arrival, they always greeted us as we were entering and leaving the building. Additionally, the housekeeping staff was very attentive and nice throughout our stay. I also appreciated the fact that there was a vending machine that was reasonably priced.Without a doubt, I will be staying at base2stay on my next trip to London. I wish that I could find a few of these over in the States! :)	
Jun 21 2008 	quite happy	Based on the hotel's website, and the reviews on TripAdvisor, I chose base2stay for my recent visit to London. I was not disappointed. The room was very clean, and while my single was quite snug, it had everything I needed.  I especially enjoyed the kitchenette feature, as I could sleep in a bit, and have a late breakfast on my own schedule. The maid would do the washing up every day. I also appreciated the beautiful shower, and the high ceilings. The curtain rods made an excellent place to dry laundry.The room comes with a booklet filled with information on how the &quot;mod cons&quot; work, and also, information on local resources, such as supermarkets. I especially liked the new Sainsbury's--it's huge.The hotel is only a block from Earls Court tube stop, and I discovered that there are no stairs walking to the Picadilly platform, which is great if you're toting luggage on your way to Heathrow.The keyboard you use to access the internet is a little tricky, but I eventually got the hang of it. I was emailing friends and family almost every day, simply because it was convenient. I also liked listening to the BBC Radio on the telly.My room overlooked a mews, and I enjoyed watching the locals come and go from their homes there.When I checked into the room, I discovered a window that wouldn't close, and the maintenance man came in quite quickly to fix it. He may have nailed it shut permanently. I just knew I felt safer. I also had some trouble with the card key, and a few times, I had to have it zapped again at the front desk before I could get into the room.The hotel was quiet. I could hear people moving and talking sometimes, but nothing loud. There are several restaurants in the neighborhood, and there's another tube stop (Gloucester Road) a few blocks away. I will definitely consider base2stay for my next visit to London! :)	
Jun 20 2008 	Perfect price 	I stayed at base2stay three times in May/June and found it to be the perfect London accommodation for many reasons. It's only a a block to the Earl's Court underground station, which is linked directly to Heathrow airport via the Picadilly line [much cheaper than Heathrow Express or a taxi, and there's an elevator at the station so no carrying suitcases up/down stairs]. There's a Marks &amp; Spencer food store, drugstore, laundromat, pubs, restaurants and other stores by the station. Best of all is the hotel itself - the clean rooms and helpful staff. The rooms are small [this is Europe, after all), but everything is pristine white and the windows are huge so there's lots of light (the windows open and they have both heavyweight blinds and curtains). The bathrooms (with large showers) have lots of room for toiletries and the towels are big and thick. There's a compact kitchen in every room with microwave, fridge, sink, dishes, plus a kettle and instant coffee and real milk. The flat screen TV comes with a keyboard and free internet access (my fave!). There's a safe, hairdryer, phone and alarm clock. The reception and cleaning staff are friendly, very professional and always ready to help. What's the downside? The rooms are tight for 2 people with lots of stuff (the closets are small, but there's space under the beds for suitcases). There's no food service (no restaurant or breakfast room). They could use a separate room to hold luggage before/after check in/out (they do hold it though, in the reception area).I ran into the Manager (a very pleasant, talkative man) and told him how much I liked the hotel. He said it was a new concept and the low prices depended on giving clients the best essentials and cutting out high-cost items like food service. It works for me and friends of mine who recommended the hotel to me. We plan on making it our regular 'base 2 stay' in London!	
Jun 17 2008 	clean but far far from everything	We stayed at the base2stay just for 2 nights in April.We lost a lot of time being stuck in traffic because the hotel is off the spot. Theathers and attractions are all at the other end of town. The rooms were clean, nice and quiet. There is a supermarket and Starbucks 2 min. walking distance from the hotel which is great for breakfast.Another thing was that we asked the front desk to call us a cab to go to town before checking out, since we had to carry our luggage with us as the hotel is on the other side of town if you want to go to the airport but instead of a cab they called a private car for us which costed 3 times more than what a regular cab charges. That was not nice, so beware.	
Jun 13 2008 	Highly Recommended!!!	Staying in London has never been so great. The rooms at BASE2STAY are wonderfull, stylish furniture, comfortable beds and everything is so clean and tidy. It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel. The POWER-SHOWER in my room was excellent after a busy day. I really slept well in my comfortable, quiet room. The staff was very very friendly, too! This hotel is my first choice in London!!! I can highly recommend this place! FELIX	
Jun 2 2008 	Great hotel	Me and my daughter just came back from London and our stay at Base2Stay. I have been in London many a time and lived in everything from Hostels to 5 star hotels, this is the best so far!It was my first trip with my daughter and her first abroad which made the choice of hotel more important than ever. I wanted to be on the Piccadilly line with access to other Underground lines to make the whole travelling around thing as easy as possible. I wanted a safe neighbourhood, grocery shops close by, great beds, nice and clean room and most importantly a really good shower (this is harder than expected to find in London). And, we got it all and then some!We got a room on the lower ground floor with disappointed us at first but it was nice enough. Very small but then we're talking London here :) Also, the space was used in a perfect way and had a bunk bed (daughters choice), one closet, mini kitchen, desk, two chairs and then that fantastic shower. A good thing was that there was enough space under the bed to put the suitcase.The staff was friendly professional and helpful!The only thing we did not like was the air conditioning. It was either ice cold so we had to turn it off and then it became very hot. So, I had to get out of bed a few times a night to either switch on or off (I was having a horrible cold at the time and sleep was crucial). The folder about how it worked said it had automatic control as to stop when reaching a certain temperature but it did not. I also told the staff about this but they could not help (at least not that day and we were leaving the next day).Anyway, I will go back to London in the autumn with my son and we will stay in the hotel again.Oh and another thing..my daughter happened to spill out Coke on the bed linen and the cleaner had just changed side instead of changing the bedding. Not a biggie but still.	
May 30 2008 	Loved it!	We stayed at Base 2 Stay from May 18th to 23rd in one of the bunk rooms. The room was on the smaller side, but just perfect. Bathroom was large and spotless with modern amenities. The hotel staff was very polite and helpful and it was one of the first times I have stayed somewhere and actually looked forward to going back to the hotel at night. I would recommend this hotel for anyone no matter their age and look forward to my next stay!	
May 30 2008 	Expectations Exceeded!	I monitored the reviews for base2stay on TripAdvisor for two months. I give the hotel and staff all the high marks that previous guests provided. Comfort, value, amenities and location ---- we looked for a quiet property with a lift that had comfortable beds. base2stay was our choice. We stayed at the hotel for a total of eight days this month and were very satisfied with the room and the hotel staff. Vinny helped us with our restaurant plans and etc and his follow up to make sure our visit was enjoyable. The other staff were also very professional and responsive. As one who travels alot, I highly recommend base2stay to anyone thinking of making their plans to stay in the Kensington area..............	
May 27 2008 	A fantastic hotel	My husband and I really enjoyed our time at base2stay. We stayed for five nights in a standard double room at the beginning of May. Our room was well designed and beautifully decorated in a clean simple way. The size of the room didn't bother us as we expected rooms in London to be small. Our favourite feature was the mini-kitchen and the fact that it was cleaned daily. The hotel is in a very convenient area with many restaurants and the Earl's Court tube station down the street. We also found the nearby Marks&amp;Spencer Simply Food and the Boots pharmacy to be really handy.The members of the staff were polite, friendly, and helpful. They helped us with understanding train information and how to dial a number in the UK.	
May 24 2008 	Perfect Stay	We had a wonderful stay for 4 nights at this fantastic hotel. The room was spacious and immaculate. The location was great as it is a short distance to the Earl's Court underground station and many great pubs and restaurants in the area. Also many grocery stores in the area to take advantage of the mini-kitchen in the hotel rooms. Best of all, the staff was friendly, courteous, and professional. You don't appreciate the difference this can make until you experience the opposite. We arrived late morning expecting to leave our bags and walk around the area until our room was ready. Our room was not ready, but Manuel found a comparable room that was available to check-in immediately. Another gentlemen volunteered information on where the 24 hour grocery store was located without asking. Can't say enough good things about our stay at Base2stay and will definitely stay there on any future visits to London.
