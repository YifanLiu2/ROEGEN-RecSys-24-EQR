	love this place	Great hotel, staff lovely, great gym and food is cool. Not cheap.	
Nov 22 2009 	Miserly grasping hotel with no concept of service. Avoid.	EVERYTHING costs extra. Staff are not empowered to help and most (&quot;Max&quot; is the exception) are casual beyond belief. The duty manager laughs if you complain. The breakfast chef can't poach an egg without making it rock hard. You can't get a wake up call within 20 minutes of the time you asked for it. So many guests complaining (it seemed like every time I went past the front desk someone was agitatedly complaining, usually about being ripped off or being charged for something they hadn't expected to be charged for), so much stonewalling. People running around the hotel at 4am shouting loudly, no effort by staff to quieten things down. Room keys don't work, we and loads of other people kept having to get the re-programmed. In-room internet stopped working after 20 minutes. Fitness centre hours don't suit working people and are more restrictive than other London hotels I have stayed at. This place pretends to be hip and chic but it is actually dowdy and pretentious. A rip off. Probably the only hotel I have ever stayed at (from backpacking to 5 star) that I would never stay at again, either business or leisure. You have to really stand your ground not to get taken advantage of. I have never written a negative review of a hotel before but this place really is a greedy disgrace.	
Nov 9 2009 	No way it´s 4 star hotel!	We stayed there for 3 nights and I would NEVER go back. Our double room was so small that one had to stay in bathroom, so other could move around. No lights, exept night table lights. In breakfast room/entrance lobby you actually have to point to food and order that piece by piece over the counter, no access to food etc.	
Nov 9 2009 	Not very impressed trying to be trendy but missing the mark	Not a very good location by Shepards Bush station, weird people handing around the hotel at night. Room was dark and tired looking, in room internet did not work and they never tried to fix it in the 3 days I stayed. Most of the staff could hardly speak english so it didnt help much. They forgot to clean my room on the second night, breakfast is small &amp; limited to brown bread or brown bread. One nice aspect is the bar area open till very late and got to meet some friends to lived near by as most of the bars close by 11 during the week. Short walk to the tube stop and has a big shopping centre close by and some nice pubs if you seek them out.	
Nov 2 2009 	Very nice!	We booked our 3 night stay at very short notice and were given a great rate through the hotel. The room was very nice with a very comfortable king size bed. Bathroom was great though the extractor fan didn't work very well so the bathroom was constantly fogged up. We had an issue with the TV and it was fixed immediately. Sent something out to be dry cleaned and received back same day. Very nice, friendly service. Close proximity to Westfield, great restaurants and tube station. Hotel located in quiet residential street. The hotel's bar in the lobby was filled with people every night, though we didn't hear any noise at all.The spa was being refurbished so unfortunately the jacuzzi and sauna were closed. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, however there were many options close by including the Westfield restaurant strip.Great stay overall and would happily return next time we're in town.	
Oct 30 2009 	Surprising	Stayed at K West with friends for a shopping weekend. Ideally placed for the fabulous Westfield centre with shops and restaurants galore. Only 5 stops on underground to Oxford Street if Westfield isn't enough or if you want to do tourist type things.The hotel has nice rooms but I found the decor in the corridors dark and gloomy and littered with room service pots. Continental breakfast is served in the bar area on the same level as reception and this only has low tables and chairs so you need to have your breakfast on your knee. Bananas seem to be on ration too as only managed one on one morning out of three! The area where breakfast was also became messy very quickly with crumbs from muffins and croissants on furniture and the floor from earlier customers.In the evening the bar area is busy but some strange behaviour tolerated by staff, people lying on sofas with their feet on the furniture and my friends and I were accosted by a &quot;lady&quot; who appeared to be a local resident who comes in there because it's the only place open and tells anyone who'll listen her life story while she waits for someone to buy her a drink!Surprised too when going to use the gym to be told there was a £10 charge as this is not mentioned either on the website or in the in-room information. Needless to say a brisk walk was taken instead!	
Oct 13 2009 	Fantastic staff and generally a great hang out	I stayed at the k west hotel and spa for 5 nights last week for my five year wedding anniversary. I booked the room though a third party, so the rates were more than reasonable. The room we stayed in was a regular double, and it was a nice size with a bath tub and lots of natural light. The reception staff decorated our room with balloons and wrote a lovely card congratulatiing us on our anniversary. All staff reception, bar, restaurant, house keeping - were SO hepful and friendly. We will definately be staying here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone young/old, staying for business or for pleasure.	
Oct 12 2009 	This is a great London Hotel - highly recommended	Could not believe the size and overall comfort of the room. Has everything one needs, wi-fi, big flat screen, iron, tea &amp; coffee making, huge bathroom - list goes on. Needed to be in the area to meet family and had a added bonus of the new Westfield Centre across the road. Am not shopper but the area offers quality dining and bars. Great tube access on the central line.The rooms and service offered here is far superior to the poor value for money closer into town, so the little extra travel time into central London is a small price to pay. Am very pleased to have accidently stumbled across K West.	
Oct 10 2009 	Spacious Rooms and Good Service	We recently stayed here for a week visit to London. It was difficult finding the hotel the first time, as it is on a quiet residential street, but it is very close to the Shephard's Bush tube station--which made it a breeze to get into the city. We arrived early and they were happy to store our bags for us until we returned (a service that many 4-star hotels in the states charge for). The room itself was quite spacious, particularly for London, and the maids kept it nice and clean. The only odd thing about the room was the shower stall in the bathroom, which was about 4 feet off the ground with a half-door that tended to drip water on the floor. It wasn't terrible, just a bit strange and slightly inconvenient.The staff were all quite helpful whenever we needed anything, and quite accommodating. The continental breakfasts were adequate and a nice perk for saving your travel money for other things (but yes, it's a continental breakfast so it's not huge--but still filling). The drinks at the bar are overpriced, but as others have mentioned there are plenty of off-license shops around where you can buy your own wine or liquor. Finally, the room-service and restaurant food was very good and exceeded our expectations for hotel food. We would definitely stay here again.	
Oct 6 2009 	Average Hotel for a city break	The hotel map that was given was not very helpful at all. It took asking a few people to get to know where we were going. The hotel is nothing special. We were early for check in, but they took our bags off us, while we went to olympia conference hall for the day. The room was clean and tidy. The only gripe i would make, is that for breakfast you have to eat in the lobby not my ideal of eating a Continental Breakfast, scrunched over a little table. The drinks are expensive, but plenty of shops near by to buy it in.	
Sep 25 2009 	What a lovely  camp stay	Having recently split from Tony, Gary and i decided to spend some time in London with our new Chums , John and Will. What a great time we had cavorting in the spa and having many sensuous experinces. The hotel catered for our needs and provided as many towels as requested. We did have one complaint against the noise from our room, But as explained if a group of men cant enjoy a game of yatzi whats the world coming too.Great Hotel AAAAA+++++Thanks D &amp; G	
Sep 23 2009 	Fantastic Funky 5 Star	The hotel is a wonderful place to feel pampered and relaxed.. We stayed in an incredibly spacious double room (very spacious for London) with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Attentive and reliable staff who ensured our early morning trip to Heathrow was taken care of perfectly.I stay regularly in 5 star hotels in both London and New York and rate this as one of the finest for a funky atmosphere without losing the attentiveness and luxury you expect of a 5 star. I will certainly be staying again,	
Sep 22 2009 	Good stay - too hip for the country girl?	I booked this hotel through Hotwire and was very pleased on arrival. The hotel was a short walk from Sherpherds Bush tube and located in a quiet residential street. Our room was located near the back of the hotel and when i say back, i mean a walk of at least 200 yards from reception (it certainly felt like it when carrying shopping bags). The room was very clean and spacious and had every ammenity we could need. At night the hotel seemed to turn into a trendy night club - which was a bit of a shock when we trudged back into the hotel wearing jogging bottoms and trainers after a hard day's sightseeing. However, the bouncers did let us in and we skulked through the bar area getting some odd looks.The staff were very nice and helpful and this was a great stay.	
Sep 20 2009 	Fantastic rooms and a lovely spa	The room was very spacious, with a very comfortable bed - chocolates were delicious. The spa treatrments were amazing,and very relaxing. The meal we had in the Kanteen and the room service were also delicious.Location is also excellent - right by Westfield and the tube station, and also good for the restuarants in Shepherds Bush.Aside from the bar, which was very lively the rest of the hotel was very quiet and peaceful -we has a great weekend and will definitely be back.	
Sep 17 2009 	NOT worth it!!	On booking this hotel i was looking for a luxury break with my partner and as it was described as the 'couture hotel of west london we thought it was going to be good,, how wrong could we be!! I have stayed in other hotels half the price of this and they were 10 times better,, checking is was fine no problem, the room very basic as it was explained as having a super king sized bed, yes it was big but basic duvets did nothing for it and lots of hairs in the bed, were the sheets even changed? the fixtures and fittings were warn in the room, there were finger prints and smears all over the dark wooded furniture, not cleaned! the bath had patches that needed fixing and there were clumps of long black hair all over the shower wall, not nice at all!! there were no bathrobes or slippers as stated, everything just seemed not bothere with, we payed 365.00 for 2 nights, plus £200 for a treatment each in the spa so this wasnt a cheap break, we expected so much more from this hotel,, everything is so OVER PRICED!! if i was you i wouldnt bother, dont waste your money!!	
Sep 2 2009	My favourite retreat in London	We spent 5 nights at the K West Hotel &amp; Spa in RIchmond Way recently. The Hotel was excellent in that is is very clean, friendly staff and excellent food. It is also in a great location for the Underground, The Westfield Shopping Centre, Pubs, Cinema all of which are only a three minute walk away.	
Sep 1 2009 	Didnt want to leave...	We had a great time, we have stayed once in the past and found it just as delightful but with &quot;Westfield&quot; shopping centre just across the road the stay was even better as all the Restaurants were on the doorstep, which was nice as after a day in the SPA we went for a lovely walk and a late dinner. The room was clean and spacious and the TV was all interactive and we could plug our ipods in and listen to our own music in the room. We had body treatments in the SPA which was divine a total pampering for me and my husband without the kids it was just what we needed....	
Aug 25 2009 	Lovely weekend at the K West!	Swift check in, and such polite assistance. Loved the lay out of the hotel, so clean and tidy. Key didn't work the first time I tried, and had to go down stairs to get a new one. Upon entrance to the room, finally, I loved the amount of space *Executive Double room*! Couldn't believe I'd got it for £90.00! Everything was spotless! Down side was when I left the room to go to the vending machine my key for it didn't work again, but then seeing the prices of your typical can of Coke going for £3.00 put me off anyway, went back to the room only to see the key didn't work. So had to go down to reception yet again for them to validate it. But apart from all of the key mess, the stay was enjoyable and very comfortable. We got a great deal with the movies which were all free for us and they were great blockbuster hits, all recent releases. Excellent location with Westfields just across the way, and the shopping centre with restaurants and a supermarket was just across the road. Perfect!	
Aug 17 2009	Rather disappointingly average	The staff were very lovely and clearly worked very hard here. I fee it's the hotel owners/management that have cut corners here. Firstly when my mum checked into her room, they had given her an unclean room, where the bed sheet were full of hair. The staff were great and changed her room quickly, however this shouldn't have happened. The second room she was given was lovely and much bigger, so that was good. My partner and booked me and him an executive double, which was big, but no frills I would say. There was only one set of products and very few products at that. Again the reception staff were excellent and got us more straight away. The tea caddy had a poor selection, especially for the price paid. I just feel the value for money was very very low. I am glad we didn't eat there, as there are superb restaurants around the corner. Including fab Moroccan bakeries on Shepherd's Bush Road. Great location and I would suggest getting the cheapest room here, as it really isn't work splashing out.	
Aug 16 2009 	Nice clean hotel in great location	I read about this hotel ages ago and never got round to staying there. I found a great deal online, so finally booked a night there for my Aunt and myself to stay after seeing U2 at Wembley.The hotel was a four or five minute walk from the tube, which was great. Westfield is a stones throw away, and there are plenty of nearby bars and restaurants. We didnt use the hotel bar etc as the price was very steep ( £12 for a miniature Jack Daniels and then £3 for a can of coke from the vending machine )For £129 for a night in a London hotel, I cant complain. The room was large and clean, the bathroom was lovely and the TV had a mix of channels ( which was great to relax to when we got back from the gig ). The staff were very friendly and even looked after our luggage after we had checked out so that we could go sightseeing in London. Would definitely stay there again.	
Aug 16 2009 	WE WERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE FRIENDLY 	* Wonderful location close to the tube, yet so quiet.* Easy access to west end theatres.* Extremely large &amp; comfortable beds in well designed rooms.* Rapid room service delivering delicious food quickly.* Informal lobby breakfast was popular.* Fascinating selection of guests speaking several languages.* Workout facilities are excellent.	
Aug 11 2009 	Happy to say actually quite good	I am a very fussy bloke and was nervous about staying here after bad reviews. Got two doubles for £85 a night each on net. Rooms were lovely - beds very comfy, magazines up to date, Aveda toiletries, great shower, nice towels, perfect. Not noisy either. Was in 221. Had friends in 123 and they said the same. Staff said hello as they walked past and friendly. Only criticism would be the surly desk staff and concierge - very stuck up and quite rude. They had no umbrellas when it was pouring down outside. They should have some to borrow given its London. Breakfast was great - continental but fresh fruit, muffins lovely, good selection of drinks and snacks. Yes its not help yourself but it actually makes it easier i reckon. Would deffo stay here again if could get a good rate. I'd say it was definately a good 4 star hotel. Can't work out where all the criticism is coming from. Maybe I just was lucky. Also great internet and free which was a real plus. Of course, bar and room service is horrifically expensive but its the same everywhere. Didn't use spa or gym but looked clean and nice and good spa menu. Maybe next time.	
Aug 8 2009 	Never again	I stayed two nights with my husband for his special birthday. We were staying in three different location hotels while this was our third one. We sure were not impressed with the service and the location area at all compared with the last two. There is nothing special about it with its SPA name. The hotel is located at very rundown neighbourhood when you walked out the underground station to it. The first impression to the lobby was &quot;It was not clean&quot;. The room itself was OK since we had booked the executive suit. The odd thing is you have to go one floor down with the lift instead of going UP. We were shocked with their contniental breakfast service the first morning since it was even like this busy filthy street &quot;to go&quot; style. No room clean up service for the first day until 4:30pm. We then had to skip it to get the clean towels by myself. Sorry, hubby.... I will not do it again.	
Aug 5 2009 	BEWARE ! DOUBLE DOESN'T MEAN DOUBLE.	We had booked a Junior Double Room for 3 nights.This, we had done by phone,so spoke to reservations. On checking in,we were informed that a junior double room room is not a double room for 2 people, but for single occupancy. They could find us a room for 2 people,but would be at much greater cost per night. As we were in London for business and had to start work immediatly, we had no choice but to pay extra. We were furious. No hotel anywhere else advertises doubles that mean single. WHAT A RIP-OFF.p.s. If you open the bottle of water in your bedroom, it will cost you £4.50.	
Aug 3 2009 	Very Trendy	This is a great hotel - I booked it with last.minute.com with theatre tickets so it worked out good value for money. I probably wouldn't stay in Sheperds Bush again - it's just a little too far out. I have no complaints other than we were very disappointed that the price didn't include use of the spa and we thought it did.	
Aug 1 2009 	Wonderful K-West!	We've stayed here twice, once on a shopping weekend and once with teenage children, for a theatre break. The staff are so friendly and helpful, and the rooms are large, very clean and beautiful. (The bathrooms are amazing!) There is even a dvd player in the room, as well as tea/coffee making facilities. Westfield is about a 5 minute walk away, and the tube station about half that, so very convenient for the Central line (and easy access to the West End). The spa is also excellent. I would definitely stay here again.	
Jul 31 2009 	fantastic	great service, amazing room, lively night bar, but quiet rooms.great experience!!!	
Jul 29 2009 	Fantastic Hotel Great Location!	We stayed here for a weekend away, arrived at the Hotel that looks great from the outside and was just as good inside, really good sized rooms and lovely bathroom, all mod cons in the room really liked how you could plug in your own Ipod so listen to your own music. Staff Very helpfull, A very good hotel, would recomend it and stay again!	
Jul 14 2009 	If you want to meet Rock Stars and like a lively bar this is your place	Went last year with my sister/ We picked this hotel after reading reviews of partying happening till 3 am. This had turned some of the reviewers off but it was just what we were looking for. The hotel looks live a worn down W hotel. Nice but definitely shabby. The staff is not the best either. Nor is breakfast, HOWEVER..The tube is a 5 min walk, and a lively interesting bunch stays and meets here. Definitely hip in it's own weird way. If you are into music, there are plenty of famous bands staying here. I would definitely go back if I wanted a spontaneous and lively trip. Love the snack machines in the halls which have things like : small bottle of vodka and crackers, or small bottle of champagne and biscuits as choices. Hilarious! All of this is expensive and we were glad we had brought some liquor with us :)	
Jul 13 2009 	service poor Even General manager is only Mon-fri 9-5 person	Stayed for 3 nights, stayed here years ago when this hotel first opened and service was no good then and not got any better. they only have valet parking at best part of £40 per 24hrs which is Ok but no one present and at to park my own car but still pay for valet parking, then had to carry all our luggage no trolleys at hotel and no luggage assistance, although he does watch you struggle, checked in at 3.10pm though checkin time was from 2pm room not ready when to restaurant to pass some time but this closes at 3pm so was told no food, once got room was OK, but on our floor peoples room service trays were outside room when we arrived on friday and still same trays outside same rooms with left over food on the monday morning which is disgusting. Bar area is no better ordered bottle of Laurent Perrier rose Champagne and after 3 efforts still did not get even though on there wine list, bar tender or her manager did not know what it was!ask to see the general manager 3 times over the weekend but seems she finished early on friday and was still not back in at 9am on Monday, only part time General Manager I know, all the staff are frightened to even contact her! must think the hotel is being run smoothly but beleive me this is not the case, in fact would probably say you would be better staying at a 3 star in town, you would certainly get better service and feel like the staff do care about there guest which is not the case at this hotel, we attended looking to use this hotel for our staff for 3 nights per week for 1 year but I would not even use it for that even though the position suited, would not be worth the hassle I would get from my staff! hope this gives you insight into our poor in our opinion this hotel is.	
Jul 8 2009 	Just Great!	This was just a superb place!!!! Very trendy, with rooms that were both spacious and luxurious. The bed was very comfortable and the rooms had all the necessary amenities. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower which is always a nice option. Was there for a short stay, so could not check the spa. However we ate at the restaurant for breakfast, and it was nice: funky stylish decor, friendly staff.Staff is international, well trained and efficient.The hotel location is superb too.The guests tend to be young and hip (with some celebrities while we were there), but nobody looked at us funny because we had 2 young ones.The price was right for the level of service offered, the amenities and the location.Highly recommend the place!!! We will definitely go back... So should you!!	
Jul 6 2009 	Good but not as good as it used to be	Revisited the KWest after fabulous stay in 2007 with a spa treatment package. The decor is beginning to look a little tired, departure queue far too long, room service prices have rocketed and not good value for money. Got woken up by noisy guests in early hours of the morning - not good. Although the Westfield shopping centre is nearby, not sure if it is longer worth that extra travelling time on the tube if you are spending time in the centre of London. Great for a spa break but perhaps not as a base.	
Jun 28 2009 	Highly Recommended!	This is a great hotel. The rooms are clean and very large. We got a room upgrade on check in, staff were really nice, and the free breakfast was great (and definitely worth it given the pound/dollar exchange rate). We didn't see too many other tourists staying there because of its location. It's not that far from Notting Hill and other nightlife spots so it wasn't a problem. Also, after stumbling through seas of tourists at other spots in the city it was refreshing to come back to a low key, laid back, and decidedly non-touristy hotel. It took about 45 minutes to an hour to get there on the tube from Heathrow but only cost around 2 pounds. Don't take the Heathrow Express to Paddington if you're staying here---it would be inconvenient and a waste of money.	
Jun 15 2009 	Kin Tired After K West	I used to stay at the K West fairly regulary and have stayed in the K West suites and all other standard exec rooms etc so know the hotel a little by now. I now favour the Zetter/Hoxton when in London as the K West is looking a little shabby in areas and not what it used to be like a few years ago. Bed in the exec superior room i had was very uncomfortable - oh how i yearned for the Sheraton sweetsleeper last night!Room starting to age now - when a hotel is advertised as luxury it has to stand up to intense scrutiny but it has to be said K West lets itself down now.In the shower there was no shelf to house soap or shampoo/conditioner which either had to be placed on shower floor or thrown back in sink? A little frustrating! Also no mini bar but a conveniently placed £4.50 bottle of mineral water!! The vending drink machine didnt work on my floor so not much choice really.Staff are great still and helpful but K West is let down overall by high prices and tatty rooms - there are better hotels and K West cannot trade on its position or funky DJ alone as this has no interest to me as a business traveller. Back to the Hoxton then for me - has free water and breakfast in price!!!	
Jun 10 2009 	Fantastic service great rooms friendly staff and central location	The room was spacious, clean and had everything we needed. The staff were really friendly and attentive.Breakfast was delicious, again with good choice and friendly staff. We were close to the largest shopping centre in Europe and really close to centre of London, so great week-end out.The spa was a great way to relax after a dayys shopping with fantastic massage and relaxation room, followed by a spa and jacuzzi.Highly recommend to anyone wanting a relaxing time in London.	
Jun 9 2009 	A hidden gem	I recenty stayed at KWest with my friend for a night away from it all. The location is great, close to Shepherds Bush and Olympia. It is still tucked away off the main roads which is great. From here you can choose Westfield Shopping Mall, Notting Hill Gate, High St Ken all within 20mins from the hotel.The hotel is very funky, clean . From the staff uniforms to the flower displays it is all quiet contemporary. There is a lot of young , viabriant clientelle and a fun bar to people watch. In the evening it transforms to a very hip and trendy bar with a live dj.The beds were so comfortable and the decor fits the mood of the hotel.Breakfast was great and an added bonus to have Starbucks coffee served in the lounge.We had one great experience and felt we had been away for longer . There is plenty to do in the area and if you want to chill out in the hotel, with the spa and other facilities that is no problem either.	
Jun 8 2009 	Boutique luxury and funky music	I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The hotel is just over the road from Shepherd's Bush station, but hidden away enough on a tree-lined avenue to feel quiet and secluded. The exterior is smart, white and lit up at night. The decor inside is funky and colourful.The room itself makes you go 'aaaah' when you walk in. It's very stylish but is equipped with a large flat screen tv, playstation, dvd player and sky. There were chocolates and Aveda goodies waiting for us, and a MASSIVE bed. The room was fairly spacious (more so than the Waldorf) and has a 'living area' with a sofa and coffee table. The view is out onto some trees and a row of Victorian houses. I slept extremely well.The service was great and they brought us an ice bucket and champagne glasses, and plates and knives for the birthday cake at no extra cost. We went out for dinner but when we got back the bar was lively, with music playing.The next day we made use of the free spa facilites and spent an hour in the jacuzzi followed by steam room, sauna and a shower - the changing rooms have complimentary toiletries and even straighteners! It was all very well designed. We also made use of the free internet facilities. What a great birthday.The only drawback I would say is that, though the rooms themselves are good value, the breakfast is £17pp and drinks are also very expensive.In summary, a funky, stylish experience as befits a hotel often frequented by stars of the music scene, which we didn't want to leave!	
May 18 2009 	Very trendy hotel a really great place to stay will definitely be back	Hotel is in excellent location, only a 5 minute walk from Shepherds Bush (central Line), and the New Westfield Shopping centre, arrived late evening and received a very warm welcome. Our room was great very trendy, we had a room with a sofa bed for our 2 children which was more than adequate, after all we were only going to be sleeping there.Did not eat dinner in restaurant, but we had breakfast which was lovely, staff were very friendly.Will definitely be back, maybe with friends this time experience some shopping and the busy bar in the evening. BRISTOL	
May 18 2009 	Nice hotel but terrible service and charged me twice for one room	Shame, my friend recommended this hotel to me.Was expecting a lot more to be honest. Yes, it's contempary, and yes it's modern, but the room was nothing like the website picture made it look. Room was trendy, but very small, I felt a bit claustrophic. We did not pick the cheapest rooms, so they must be even smaller. We asked for a quiet room, it was silent, but 3 corridors away from the lifts, which wouldn't suit some people.They wanted £130 for parking in their car park for the weekend and were very rude when my husband said no way was he paying that. It took the general manager to come and say there is a NCP over the road for £30 for the weekend. It's about the principle of not being ripped off. The vending machine prices were scandelous. Bar prices average for London, a Bellini Luxe and a diet coke for £13. Very nice bar area.One lovely girl at reception, and other rude staff who barely spoke English.One major problem, they have charged me for the room twice. I have been on the phone sorting this out with my credit card company. We paid cash yet they have charged the card that we gave for security reasons. You have to have a credit card for them to open your tab, whether you want one or not. Very very annoying as we always pay cash, and very annoying that I have been charged twice and I now need to sort this out myself.Looks very scruffy from the outside, not luxury at all, and in a rough area. A real mixed bag. Trendy clean hotel, with terrible service, no atmosphere, in a rough area miles from where you probably want to be. For same price you can get much better.	
May 16 2009 	Cool hip modern hotel - fantastic stay!	We stayed at the K west for one night with our 2 young children. The suite we stayed in was amazing - smart, spotless with lots of space and a bathroom with a gorgeous free-standing bath and huge shower. The kids loved it too! It was nice to stay somewhere that wasn't stuffy or old-fashioned and we will definitely be back again. Perfect location for shopping at Westfield and a short drive from the Natural History Museum for the kids. We loved the bar and restaurant too and just wished we could have stayed longer.	
May 15 2009 	Lovely stay Lovely staff Liked Location	My husband &amp; I won a 3 day trip to London to see Bob Dylan in concert (lucky us!) The hotel was the K West and we enjoyed our stay very much. We only had a week to prepare for the trip, and I sent (many) emails to K West with questions and concerns, They met them all with good grace and helpful answers. We were arriving very late and leaving very early 3 days later and the hotel arranged a cab both ways, at less than the very high prices London cabs are known for. It was wonderful to step off the plane and have our driver waiting for us.I had asked our room to be changed to a smoking room which was done- I had expected a not-quite-as-nice room, as sometimes happens with smoking rooms but we had a beautiful junior suite. I noticed instantly when we got in that it had no smoke odor, which also sometimes happens (its expected) with smoking rooms.Our room was elegant, modern and spotlessly clean. The bed was very firm, with lovely fluffy down comforters. We slept very well. The bathroom was sparkling, and the water hot &amp; plentiful- I enjoyed the long length of the tub, I'm usually cramped (long legs!) There was plenty of storage space, not too many hangers, but we called for more which were promptly brought to us. The room safe and fridge worked fine for us- no problems. This may be a small thing, but the rug in our room was a nubbly weave and it felt great on bare feet after walking around London all day! ;) We didn't have the best view but did wake each morning to the sounds of birds singing in the trees outside- surely better than traffic!Since we were only in London for two full days, we spent most of our trip away from the hotel. We did not have a chance to eat in the restaurant, but we did order some appetizers from room service. they were good, and brought very quickly. We also did not try the bar, but it was usually hopping when we came in late at night, with lots of interesting looking people hanging out- its located right across from the lobby so there's no noise to bother you in your room. In fact, we heard only the occasional door close from our room, we were never disturbed by other guests.Unfortunately, we never got a chance to try the spa either, but the spa 'menu' looked wonderful. There was also a selection of magazines in our room, which I thought was a nice touch.The Location was great- very near the Shepherd's Bush Tube Station, down a couple of short, quaint streets &amp; up a short flight of stairs. We went ALL over London, using both the buses and tube, and this was a convenient area to be in- I liked not being too near to London City center- this felt removed, and more relaxed. There's a 24 hour Londi's right across from the station- great for cheap drinks, snacks &amp; other fun, British foodstuffs- try Twiglets &amp; Sugar Skulls!There was a small problem when we checked out (NOT the Hotel's fault, the co that gave us the trip) and even tho it was 4:30 AM on Monday morning ( I told you we were leaving early!) the night Clerk, Sadiki, was kind &amp; as helpful as he could be, in trying to solve our problem. Along with Gisele, in Customer relations, who answered so many of those emails, every staff member we came across was polite, and friendly. The young man who came to our room to fix a 'problem' with our coffee maker did not even make fun of me when the 'problem' turned out to be ME, not flipping the switch!We really enjoyed our stay at K west and felt quite pampered. London was amazing and if we are lucky enough to return, we'll be making K West our 'home'!	
May 14 2009 	Chic stylish and very comfortable.	I stay in London regularly and the K West is my favourite. It is certainly way better than anything else in West London. Spotlessly clean. Ultra chic decor. Spacious rooms with terrific showers. Large flat screen T.V.s with internet access. Staff very friendly and helpful. lively bar at night attracting a cool clientele. Five minute walk from Shepherd's Bush underground and the new Westfield Shopping centre. Overnight parking can be expensive but I suppose prices are in line with others- and at least there is a car park.!	
May 12 2009 	It's modern clean comfortable with friendly helpful staff.	The location was ideal for visiting family in the area and for shopping at the superb Westfield Centre! The room was large, airy and comfortable with everything we could possibly have needed for two nights' stay.The staff were very welcoming and helpful.We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on food and service.	
May 9 2009	Lovely hotel with very friendly staff.	We stayed here on Thursaday 7th May as we were going to see Taylor Swift at the Empire.After reading some of the reviews on here I was very dubious about this hotel, but as it was the closest to the venue and we would be walking back I decided to book.We chose the Spring offer and got a deluxe room with a full breakfast and use of the Spa for £125.When we arrived we were greeted by a lovely receptionist who checked us in quickly and efficently, the room was beautiful, clean bathroom with a powerful shower, on the top floor and facing away from the road. The TV remotes wouldn't work but a quick call to reception and it was sorted within minutes.On leaving to go to the concert, again the receptionists were very pleasent and wished us good evening.As it was just me and my 13 year old daughter, we didn't use the bar but were not disturbed in any way by noise from there.Breakfast in the morning was lovely, freshly cooked and again very friendly staff who really couldn't do enough.Checking out, again quickly and efficently done by a lovely receptionist called Anna, who gave us a short cut to the Westfield shopping center.All in all a lovely hotel, clean with friendly staff, somewhere I would definately book again.	
May 6 2009 	Nice hotel - nothing special	From the hotel website, I was expecting something a little more swish, so was a little dissapointed when I opened my hotel room door - just average really.Clean, near to Shepherds Bush underground, expensive parking.Did not eat in the restaurant - so did not sample food and cannot comment.Did not try out any of the spa either.If your looking for somewhere relatively cheap to stay - just to park your head - then it's ok.	
Apr 30 2009 	Plenty of better hotels in London	Problem with booking took 10 minutes to check in. Front desk staff were not bothered (noticed another guest ask if there was a roman catholic church nearby to which the front desk staffer said he didn't really know?)Reception is fairly nicely designed.Room was at the very very end of a massive corridor - booooo. Got to room, stank of smoke, how come no body mentioned this? or asked if i'd like a no smoking room?Decor-wise it's fairly decent i suppose.Small bed. Tiny room.Bottle of water beside the bet - that costs £4.95 to drink. Really naff thing to do. Went down to spa which costs £10 for hotel guests to use. No movable shower head in bathroom (pet hate / requirement) TV in room didn't work.Upon checkout I realise VAT was not included in the price. huh is that legal?Also although my travel agent had supposedly paid for the room, i also had to pay. Plenty of decent hotels in London, give this one a wide berth.	
Apr 19 2009	Stay away from K West Hotel 	We booked on a shop till you drop package (myself and my 23 year old daughter) so we could shop at the new Westfields Shopping Mall. What a disaster. There was no complimentry non alcoholic cocktail on arrival. The in room safe did not work. The magazines were all dated March when we are well into April. The room smelt musty. The bath was dirty. Room service came and cleaned it but this should not be the case for a Twin Executive room. The toilet did not flush properly. We had to request bath robes and slippers. Clearly no one had been in that room since March. The following morning my daughter could not wash her hair as we were one hair towel short and just wanted to go home by that time. No one told us how the booking system went for our treatments a pedicure and manicure. (We had pre-booked on the internet) We were booked in for 10.15 am on the day we had to check out at 11.00am. We were advised our check out would be delayed by one hour but this was not the case. The result we left and our nail polish was smudged. Your bill is shoved under your door at 6 am on the day of your departure and you are blocked from using any other services as that bill is final. I called to complain at 6.30am about everything - that being the last straw and asked for the manager to call me back. We and were called back at 7am - we had fallen back to sleep. This was supposed to be a spa break with shopping so of course I did not answer the phone at 7.am - we had gone back to sleep. We noticed other bills had been partially shoved under peoples door (on the way to breakfast) so your name and address was not kept confidential. The bill as I say is final. For example you can not watch any more films but can watch the one you paid £9.50 for but fell asleep watching the night before. What a price for a film. May as well be at the cinema. There is no mini bar. You use your door card to swipe a vending machine. These machines only contain pre packed snack kits all of which include alcohol so if your muslim forget trying to get a Twix as that comes with a shot of vodka. Information is in English only - no French or Spanish. On a more positive note the restaurant staff were very good. They really earned that service charge that is added to the bill which was why we did not dispute it. Breakfast was good but spoilt by larger louts drinking Sol and Budwiser at breakfast then demanding the restaurant staff direct them to the tv room? Out of place in what was supposed to be a tranquil spa. There wasnt one. When we went to check out I was livid. My lovely pedicure was ruined despite walking back from the spa bare feeted. Not enough time for my nail polish to dry. When I complained to the receptionist I was advised we could have lodged our luggage and spent the rest of the day in the spa. Again mis informed. It was all too much after a dreadful nights sleep being woken up by that damp stench. In terms of location this 'spa' is in Shepherds Bush not Kensington. The website is misleading. There is a pub down the road on the way to the Shopping Mall with some very hostile looking locals which for overseas visitors would just be too much. Maybe there was a shuttle service to the Mall that again we were not told about. In the neighbourhood there are many youths who are clearly smoking something that smelt funny so not the sort of place you would want to go outside after the pub closes or after dark.I just do not want anyone to have to go through what we went through. There is a complete lack of information. What information there is does not come in any language save English. I would not recommend this hotel spa to anyone based on presentation, service or location. It is totally awful. I will be printing this off and sending it to the hotel as I never did get to speak to the manager and our weekends was ruined. This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel but has no mini bar so should be graded as a 3 star but scraped up to 4 star because of the hair dryer, room safe and iron press. Anyone who has travelled the middle east staying in countless 5 star hotels knows the grading system and this is a 3 star hotel. If that was an executive twin room I would hate to see what a standard room looked like.Ms S Hart &amp; Miss V Hart - 19th April 2009	
Mar 27 2009 	Great location hip hotel	Stayed at K West for a weekend break. Location is excellent as it's 3 mins walk from Shepherd's Bush tube station and the new Westfield shopping centre. We tried to check in an hour early and the room wasn't quite ready so they sat us down in the bar and gave us both free cocktails, considering we were trying to check in early, this was a nice touch and we only had to wait 5 minutes. Staff were all very friendly and polite. We got a very good rate booking through the hotel website at £81 a night for an executive room. Room was very spacious with a huge and extremely comfortable bed. Bathroom was clean and modern with nice Aveda toiletries (no conditioner though). For entertainment, there are great restaurants and bars in the Westfield shopping centre, the Meat and Wine company is excellent. One tip though, on Saturdays, there's a DJ playing in the bar area, ask for a room that's not close to this as you will hear some of the music. I would stay here again.	
Mar 17 2009 	The jewel in west london	This is simply the best hotel in London at the less than looney end of the price range. Great bar, fantastic rooms and the rates are not mad. I stay there whenever I have to stay in West London and although it is not a budget hotel and the spa and restaurant/bar are expensive I thoroughly recommend the place.	
Mar 3 2009 	I keep going back	Best value hotel in london. All other hotels which profess to be 4-star take note! Rooms are stylish, clean, quiet and comfortable. Suites are fab. Pricing is just right at £99 with everything else extra. Best things are the bar, rock n roll clientele, (quiet) location. Also parking in the street over the weekends is free (for now). They need to sort out the restaurant though. It's always empty.	
Mar 2 2009 	used to be good 3 years ago don't waste your money now...	We stayed at K West for one night on a Saturday, we've stayed there before and it's always been good. We stayed in a deluxe room and everything is starting to look quite scruffy. The trouser press didn't work, the iron had exposed wires, some of the tiles in the bathroom were broken. Breakfast is advertised in the in room brochure as until 12 noon on weekends, we also rang reception at 9:30 on Sunday morning to check and they confirmed it was until 12. At 10:55am we arrived in the breakfast room to be told that breakfast finished at 11am and the staff member seemed to find this very funny. We said that reception had confirmed it as 12 noon that morning. He went and got the Manager who said it couldn't possibly be 12 and that all rooms had received a letter on the Saturday. We explained we hadn't received anything and that we had checked earlier and been told it was 12. He became quite argumentative and begrudgingly agreed we could have breakfast in the bar. Breakfast was poor, the omelette was like rubber, juice was cheap and coffee horrible. The attitude of all the staff there was that guests were an inconvenience whether it was checking in/out, bar staff or at breakfast.This hotel used to be good with a great atmosphere and breakfast. I wouldn't go back now or recomend it to anyone.	
Feb 28 2009 	So much potential........ but unrealised.	During January 2009, the KWest was offering special package prices which included executive room, breakfast and use of spa facilities for around the same price of a standard room in similar London hotels. The value was pretty good and the location excellent. The place looks the goods and &quot;pretends&quot; to be a top class hotel but in so many subtle ways it just doesn't deliver. There are many hotels in great locations that offer good value, luxury and excellent service that KWest should have a look at to see what the others offer before boasting the same.The rooms are a little small and the bathrooms not well maintained. Ours just filled up with water when we showered - some leaks somewhere!Our room was comfy though but a lounge and coffee table squeezed into the room made it all seem even smaller.Down in the lobby, the barman had this bad habit of serving beer by holding the top of the bottle - not very hygienic! also he opened the beer and then spoke to his colleague for a few minutes before serving it - strange. The spa is OK and we had &quot;the run of it&quot; while we were there which was nice and made for a nice break especially from the cold January London weather.Breakfast was very good, not excellent, but very good with some good choices on the menu and the service was OK too. We stayed two nights and ate in the restaurant on the first night - the meals were good value but not brilliant.Parking is difficult in this part of London and the parking inspectors are &quot;aggressive&quot; - you WILL get a ticket if you park illegally for even a few minutes. Thankfully I didn't and the KWest parking, whilst expensive, is the best and only option - and they know it!Overall, KWest is comfortable, somewhat stylish and a cool location - yes there is &quot;starspotting&quot; potential (B grade of course) in the bar but the service is slow and not very personal and the staff really lived up the trainee badges which most of them were wearing.Finally, while waiting to check out and for our transport to arrive we were lounging around in the computer room while friends checked their emails on the slooooow complimentary internet. A staff member marched in and told us in no uncertain terms that were not permitted to &quot;lounge&quot; in this room (even though lounges were provided) and that we should sit up straight! This was really strange.The staff have really got to smarten up - when we asked for slippers and gowns for use in the spa (as advertised in the package) we almost got an argument! So unnecessary. I'd go back if they were friendlier and for about 75% of the price that I paid.	
Feb 8 2009 	poor service	My friend and I booked a spa package at lastminute and it looks nice on the website so we thought it will be nice for us for a spa treat! We booked the treatment at 12 noon but we are bit late because the transport. We did phone up and told them we will be late however when we arrived we were informed that because we are late instead of 2 treatments we are only getting one!!!!!!!! Can you believe this!!!!!! We paid around 130 pounds for the whole package for two and we were told we can not get it!!!! When we ask whether we can wait to see whether they have slot for us for full treatment later on the day they just simply says they are fully booked! and we asking reschedule the booking it is still no!!! The reception girl was a blonde girl and her attitude is really not helpful and it feels that because we booked our package on the lastminute as it is a special promotion we have been looked down upon!!! This is a terrible experience and I would not recommend any one to this hotel at all!!!! I understand we are late however they are just not very helpful and it really annoys me!!! I have been stay at quite a lot nice hotel and they are always try their best to help the guest, but this one is just terrible and it feels like they don't give a [-] about you!!!!	
Jan 30 2009 	Cold staff rubbish menu!	We stayed in the K-West for two nights for my girlfriends birthday.Location:The location is excellent with good access to theatres etc. It's tucked away from a busy road so fairly quiet.Bad experiences:Before arriving I'd arranged for some flowers to be ready on arrival - this was handled very well by reception (simply asked my budget and the colours/flowers desired), and shortly after dropping our bags off a knock at the door and the flowers were given to my girlfriend - however, no vase in the room and no vase offered.I called reception and asked for one - eventually they turned up with a tiny ornamental vase which was only just big enough to stand the flowers in. I wouldn't mind, but assumed that it would be obvious that if I'd spent £50 on some flowers, I'd prefer them not to dry out within one day!Another issue, at 5am on our first night the fire alarms sounded for 30 seconds or so. There was no explaination for this (although no fire) and no apology or free drink which other places have done for us.Good experiences:The flowers at least turned up!Restaurant:We didn't eat in the restaurant because the menu was rubbish - £15 would get you a gourmet burger!? From other reviews I can see it's not worth eating there.Bar:The bar was ok, although quite expensive (London prices I guess?) - the only problem was that it was situated in the reception area, so every time a door opened a gust of cold, February air came in. So, it wasn't cosy as the website described.Rooms:We stayed in an &quot;executive&quot; room. We quite liked our room - clean, modern and a decent size. There was a large plasma tv and a sofa, coffee table etc. We paid around £10 per night extra for this upgrade upon arrival, which was good.Spa:I cannot remember if we paid for the spa or not. It was ok although very (too) dark inside. There was a small spa bath, a sauna and a steam room. It was clean though which is always good!Other comments:I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you like to be ignored by staff and looked down upon by other guests. If you do order flowers, be sure to ask for a vase!	
Jan 28 2009 	Shabby 	We stayed for one night in this hotel as a Romantic getaway after Christmas. On the face of it, the hotel was acceptable, however if you were expecting a little more 'swish' for your money then forget it! our room was tired, decorated in the ubiquitous style of large group hotels, nice crisp linen, beige room, thick carpets, but there were a few little issues which weren't dealbreakers but were niggling. For example, the coffee cups in the room were not clean, the door surround in the bathroom had been painted in black and the paint was all over the tiles surrounding the door, a couple of the floor tiles had cracked and they had been really badly repaired, in fact the general maintenance throughout was of a poor quality. We ate in the restaurant in the evening, the food was nice but nothing special, and my other half ordered the toffee pudding for afters and the toffee had obviously 'caught' and burned on the bottom of the pan leaving a burned taste to the sauce. To be fair when we complained we got complimentary coffee's and a bowl of strawberries.The breakfast in the morning was a very sorry affair. The pastries etc were behind the bar and you had to be served them by a member of staff. The selection was particularly poor.We had a spa treatment booked and the treatment rooms and reception area were lovely. Although the spa area with the sauna and jacuzzi was a little sad on not so nice.If I had to pay to stay in London again I would choose St Martins Hotel.	
Jan 24 2009 	Ok by London Standards	The property is very well located. Rooms are decent, but the management are cheapskates. No free bottled water in the room. Only Fiji at 4.50 quid per bottle. Gym not included in room rate - 10 quid for a day. Who does that these days? Service massively variable.	
Jan 6 2009 	oasis from the hussle and bussle of London	booked though their web site for New years.The room was excellent ( I had booked a superior room), big and very light. nice LCD with internet. Internet was free in the cyber zone area. The hotel is located in Shepard's Bush.. DON'T PANIC!!!!!, its on the Holland park side, near the new huge shopping centre. The new tube and train stations are outstanding and safe which are 400m away but you have to walk down an ally from the hotel or walk around the corner to get there. The hotel was excellent, the reception staff poor: I didn't even get a good bye and Happy New year when I booked out!!!. The rooms were very clean and very smart. will defiantly stay there again next time im in London the breakfast was too over priced and was restricted in quantity.	
Dec 22 2008 	A birthday and a half!	I'll keep this review short and sweet. I had the time of my life staying here after going to a gig at the Shepherd's Bush Empire. The bar was really quiet, then came alive at about midnight when floods of people descended on the K West.We had great cocktails, met some great people and the icing on the cake was when a certain Paul Weller entered the bar and hung out there for the evening. We saw several actors too - if celeb spotting is your thing. It was quite evidently the place to be!Spa, hotel rooms, breakfast, service - all very pleasant.	
Dec 6 2008 	Loved the K West	After looking for something to do over new years eve I seen a advert for the K West Hotel. We booked direct with them for Executive Room on a New Year package for 2 nights.The hotel itself is very clean and up to date. The check in was very quick and easy.The room itself was large with a DVD player and CD player in the room with a large bathroom with shower and bath, you can also request a PS2 if you fancy a few games! Everything in the room was very clean and looked very new, everything worked and the bed was on the large side and was very comfy as was the sofa which is also in the room.I understand the hotel has a spa but we didnt use it so cant say if its any good :-(The staff are very friendly and helpful. We did have breakfast and a evening meal here, yes its expensive but very good. Location wise its about 10 min walk to the nearest tube, and its on a normal street.I would stay here again if the price is right but I am sure there are better hotels in London for less money, having said that I did like it here.	
Nov 24 2008 	Over rated not true to a four star Service brutal	Our Trip was a treat, 3 nights is a really nice hotel in london. When we arrived the room we had booked was given to someone else. We had booked a superior exec room (smoking). we were sent... to a small twin room that had not been cleaned. Even the bed was unmade. we returned to reception and following another wait we were sent to a non smoking suite but that I could smoke (Strange) Anyone paying for this room is being hugely overcharged... we were told not to unpack as we would have to move to our room the next day. on arrival at the reception the next morning noone knew anything but eventually they told us they would store our luggage. Returned at lunchtime and eventually got our room. Restaurant food was okay overpriced with lovely dead flies in the lamshades. Bar is tiny and more like a lobby and there appears to be no manager that we saw. This hotel takes every opportunity to charge extensive amounts for a semi poor service and although the room we eventually got was nice it was not worth it.... Never AGAIN	
Nov 9 2008 	poor spa!!	Me and my friend booked this hotel for a spa break for our 40th birthdays. The K West website encourages their spa break, when we got there we were given the room key with no info on the spa facilities so we took our bags to the room and looked round ourselves. We were very disappointed there was no pool. The spa facilities were a steam room, sauna room and jacuzzi, nothing else except overpriced treatments menu.Thank god the Westfields shopping centre had opened on this same weekend as we would have been bored to death here.At the spa reception there still were no clear instructions on how to use the facilities and when we did use them she did't give us any towels so i had to come back out WET to collect them. And the jacuzzi was cold.How appalling!!	
Oct 22 2008	Little small	loved the bathrooms but the room i staty in was very small.Not too sure abouty the jacuzzi, I smelt of chlorine for 3 days after.To top it off, i than got stuck in the lift	
Oct 22 2008 	Great Hotel	My daughter and I booked a room here (using my airmiles) because it was the closest they offered to the BBC TV Centre. We had tickets for Strictly Come Dancing. We flew to Heathrow, took the underground to Hammersmith and then walked from the tube station to the hotel. A fair distance, but we only had hand luggage. When we arrived our room was not ready because it was only 12 noon, so we went into the bar and, much to our delight, two of the stars of Strictly were sitting there, and they were joined by a third. Lunch was very good in the bar and not too expensive considering we were in a 4* hotel in London. Our room was very good although we could have done with some more hooks and a towel rail in the bathroom, as well as some more toiletries although we could have asked for them.Did not have dinner as we were at the Studio, but the continental breakfast was excellent although a little strange eating it in the bar with low tables.Location was excellent for BBC Television Centre and also for Madame Tussauds the next day. Also went to Harrods and this was not difficult with Shepherd's Bush underground being so close.I think it was possibly noisy at night if you were unlucky enough to have a room close to the bar, and there was a fair bit of noise in the corridor outside our room in the early hours, but that is common with all hotels. Good earplugs is the answer.	
Sep 30 2008 	Fantastic Time	Stayed here for a Saturday evening last weekend, was a little nervous at the reviews but have to say we had a fantastic time.The food was excellent, service excellent, room excellent, spa excellent (getting the picture!?)There was a 12.5% surcharge on food and drink but what no one has said is that it is discretionary so you DONT have to pay it!i am planning a trip back in november and would not hesitate to reccomend this to anyone else.	
Sep 22 2008 	BEWARE OF THE BAR SERVICE CHARGES! It's a complete rip off!	I've previously written a review of this hotel on here a while ago, but I was back there last month and things still haven't got any better or improved in service. The rooms are okay, I've never experienced any problems with the staff being rude or bad customer service like some people on here have said. It's the unnecessary 12.5% bar service charge per drink (yes PER DRINK!) that is putting guests off returning to this hotel. It's been annoying me for ages and I've lost count of the amount of times I've complained that they need to stop being so greedy and put the price down on the bar drinks and scrap this service charge. Be warned that from 11.00pm, bar drinks are all double shots only and they still charge a service charge each time you order a drink. For example, if you order several vodkas, you will find yourself being charged an extra £4 or close to that just in service charges, as well as the expensive drink prices.The K West has always been popular with the fashion crowd, record labels and rock bands, who often stay here for the discreet location and the fact that the bar is willing to stay open until the last guests leave! However, speaking as somebody who works in the music business, I have heard of a lot of bands who used to stay here now refusing to come back, as so many people have had rows with staff over mistakes on drinks bills and service charges for each drink ordered, which is insane and totally ridiculous. I stayed in the hotel for two days for the annual Kerrang! magazine rock music awards and several bands were staying. While I was in the bar, I couldn't help overhearing a lot of complaints about the drinks and food prices.The extra £10 charge to use the spa facilities still annoys me, too. I have used the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi before, but not for about two years. I've been patiently waiting to see if they actually paid any attention to my complaints. My favourite thing about the hotel is still the Aveda products in the rooms and meeting a lot of rock stars in the bar!This may be a 4 star hotel, but it's more like in the 3 star catagory and charging 5 star prices. K West get your act together!	
Sep 21 2008 	Worst Hotel Ever!!!!!!	This is the worst hotel ever!!I could not wait to get access to a computer to write this review.I travel alot and have made it a hobby to stay in interesting hotels.This by far is the worst hotel I have stayed in since the Holiday Inn era.What makes it soooo bad is the staff.Not one person there should be in customer service.They are cold and incompetent.Our room was so so and not clean feeling.They kept putting this filthy bed blanket on our bed even after telling reception to take it away. It was covered in mystery stains.The housekeeping was beyond terrible. They would take away your pillow, face cloths and toiletries and never return them, which was very strange. No minibar but a vending machine in the hall that is stocked maybe once a week.They charge an extra $20 a day for use of the gym.Continental breakfast is placed behind the bar so you have to ask someone for a croissant or what kind of cheese is on the far far away plates. Of which she responded &quot;I don't know&quot;Bar service is non existent. Restaurant service is ...........THE WORST of all time. You will pay around $25.00 for a burger and don't bother ot request well done as they only know how to serve raw. Oh an $30 for a microwave style pizza.I don't mind hiked up hotel prices for the convienance to eat in the hotel, but this was just the worst. I cannot express enough how awful it is.I don't even have the energy to list the numerous things that went wrong at this hotel.At what tops it off, they just don't care.And I hate that 12.5% is charged for service on bar and restaurant charges!!! What a joke.I also love that in the bok in the room they have 3 pages about how eco friendly they are by having employees bus to work etc etc but then leave all the lights on after cleaning your room.Stay there, Beware.....And don't say you were not warned.PS....The lounge which is 10ft away from front desk likes to close for &quot;private parties&quot; and turn into a night club.So if you wish a nightcap,sleep or to communicate with front desk, forget it.This is a 1 star hotel only and 2 at best.	
Sep 15 2008 	Spa hotel that doesn't make you feel good.	My friend and I stayed there for one night as a last minute change of plan - we were due to travel to Paris but couldn't because the Channel Tunnel fire. We decided to book a hotel with a spa in a good location of London, hoping that some luxury will compensate somewhat for disappointment. We booked a package which included one night in a double room, full breakfast (which by the way was really rather good) and two half hour treatments + use of their spa, total cost £144 per person. Due to refurbishment of the nearest underground station, Shepherds Bush, we had to walk from Holland Park station which takes longer than 10 minutes mentioned on their website. Initial impression on arrival was not great, the building is not the nicest in the area by far, and the design of its interior maybe meant to look modern but instead looked just basic. Our room was well equipped and clean, so we decided to reserve our judgments. At the time of booking our package over the phone the spa manager told us that our treatments will be after 11 oclock. It wasnt very specific, so on arrival we expected the receptionist to be able to confirm our spa arrangements, given that we booked the package, not just the room - she had no idea and didnt try to find out. The next morning at 11 oclock we went to Reception to check out, that didnt go smoothly either, and we got delayed. When we eventually got to the spa at 11:15, they told us that we were late and instead of two treatments can only have one. We tried to tell them that it was a misunderstanding, at no time were we told to get there before 11 in order to get ready and to complete a necessary form, but they were adamant: you missed your time, 11 oclock was confirmed with you over the phone, you cant have it later. We were refused any refund, werent offered any alternative solution, not even a voucher for another time or simply a bottle of one of their spa products  we didnt need them but it would have made us feel better. We did have time for a massage which was nice apart from the time when the music stopped and a loud hammering noise could be clearly heard in treatment rooms.The spa facilities were nice but rather small, and more people were trying to use them than space allowed. No swimming pool at all.On the whole I have to agree with Kiran76  it is not so much the hotel but the attitude of the staff (did I mention a fed up with stupid customers expression on the receptionists face when there was yet another misunderstanding during the check out? ) that will stop us from using it again or recommending it to others. Ok for staying the night and leaving after breakfast, but if you are looking for a hotel with spa facilities to make you feel good, there must be better choices in London.	
Sep 8 2008 	Solid but not special	What is all the fuss about ? This hotel has all the right words connected with it - boutique, niche, spa, West London...but this comfortable, clean and well equipped hotel just doesn't feel special.I booked on a whoppingly discounted corporate rate and stayed in a double deluxe room with a rack rate of £319 per night. The room was beautifully designed, nice modern layout, plenty of space and some nice touches like the full length mirror and the lockable fridge. Very nice bathroom facilities and only Aveda toiletries dahling. Very comfortable and practical with style.The disappointment comes from the rest of the experience at K West. Everything seems to be a little bit extra. There is a free internet cafe but if you want it in your room, or wireless, then thats extra. Spa access ? Stump up £10 a day for &quot;environmental&quot; reasons. All perfectly reasonable but when you're paying over £300 a night one might expect these little touches to come for free.The most bizarre aspect of the stay is breakfast. This is held behind the bar and then served to you by waitresses, causing needless confusion compared to a simple buffet. At £11 for a continental or £17 to dine in the odd mezzanine restaurant its also another little extra that will add up.My safe didn't work and nobody could fix it otherwise service was friendly and fast.There are touches of cool - the little LCD screens in the corridors showing wavy coloury video abstracts, the vending machine room service, but overall it doesn't feel like luxury it feels like a Novotel or Holiday Inn with slightly better decor. The hotel needs to add in more service to really be a luxury bolthole.Finally, its in Shepherds Bush. Its not near Shepherds Bush, its not in Brook Green in the Shepherds Bush area, its in Shepherds Bush. Lets be clear.	
Aug 5 2008 	K West really cra*	I was deeply disappointed by the entire experience which we were really looking forward to, as part of our anniversary weekendThe initial impression was not impressive, the front of the hotel was covered in scaffolding  refurbishment work that I feel I should have been warned about when I ran reception to confirm our room, or even when I booked the room in the first place. The room itself was entirely characterless and whilst I couldnt argue with the spaciousness claimed for it, it wasnt particularly soothing or inspiring. And the courtesy Aveda toiletries were so scant to hardly merit mention. And when I phoned to ask the reception if I could have a feather pillow my request was met with an abrupt and unaccommodating no. I feel that £150 is rather a lot to pay for a single night in what felt like little more than Travelodge-style accommodation. Im not sure whether all rooms are like this or whether we were unlucky in the room we were put in. I regularly travel with work and am used to much higher standards. The rate didnt include breakfast, or a welcome drink Or even a welcome smile from reception!	
Jul 31 2008 	Nice clean hotel trying too hard to be trendy	I stayed in K-West while travelling on business, the hotel is trying too hard to be trendy, the corridors are dark and have a futuristic colour theme with random screens on the way playing BBC24.The room itself was decent size single room, the bed was slightly larger than single (Probably queen size), the bed is very comfortable, except for the silly oversized display pillow, I only ended up using one of the two pillows provided.I was surprised to read that some reviews mention that there wasn't any toiletries, I was glad to find the usual shampoo/body wash.The rate quoted to me by the hotel was £150 + VAT per night, when I checked laterooms.com I found the rate offered was £115 inc. VAT but they do know how to trim the service to get to that rate, at that rate the breakfast was optional £15 for Continental and £20 for full English (No big loss, there are plenty of cafes on shepherds bush green) no Gym access (£10 charge per day) mini-bar was not stocked, although they did take £200 deposit for &quot;incidentals&quot; Internet access is expensive so I didn't bother using it, although there is free access in the &quot;lounge&quot; but I have never tried that.Going by the name my expectations was high, the standards achieved were on par with my expectations but the trimming of the service was disappointing.I would stay there again, it was clean, quiet and air conditioned.	
Jul 22 2008 	Basil Fawlty customer service	This is quite a trendy hotel with nice decor and lovely rooms, all ruined by inexperienced staff.i've stayed here four times with work and each time have left so frustrated by mistakes by staff and their complete incompetence. Its like they all landed here for the day from a planet with no hotels, they quite literally haven't a clue what they're doing. First time they insisted on taking my credit card when I checked in even though my work was paying, they said it was for security and they wouldn't take any money off, stupidly I gave it to them and over £1000 was taken off, all my colleagues rooms were charged to my card. Another time we were having a meeting in our suite and a bellboy knocked on the door (even though the Do no disturb sign was on) looking for a trolley we had borrowed and when I told him I would bring it up when we were finished as we were in the middle of a meeting, he insisted he come in and get it now and I had an argument with him at the door but still he demanded to come in and get it. Unbelievably rude and I've never encountered anything like it.This could be a good hotel if they could find good staff, I'm sure they're not all bad, maybe I've been unlucky and only encountered the ones they hired from Faulty Towers. Its almost funny how bad they are.....	
Jul 15 2008 	Rock 	I stayed at this hotel for 6 days on a business trip to London and I was mildly surprised at my stay there. The hip decor, sleek lobby and happening bar overshadowed the fact that it's in Shepherds Bush... an area that isn't all that exciting. It's mainly residential but the nearby park (Shepherds Bush Green) was nice for a relaxing stroll. Unfortunately, the hotel is covered with scaffolding and the Shepherds Bush tube station is under construction also. Which meant that you had to walk 15 minutes to one of the various other tube stations around. However, the service was solid, the food was serviceable and the room was a good value. I think that the best aspect of the stay is the bar scene. You will find that many rock bands tend to stay at this hotel and it brings a (one might say) lively crowd to the bar... which is open 24 hours. It's not lux but if you want to stay at a relatively inexpensive room in London and feel like a rock star, this is your place!	
Jun 30 2008 	Nice room shame about the noise and the service charge	On arrival, the friendly receptionist informed me that I'd been upgraded to a superior room. I am very glad I didn't get put in an ordinary room, but was right at the far end of a corridor. The bathroom was very nice with a powerful shower and lovely toiletries.When I purchased two beers in the bar, actually walking up and ordering them myself, I was charged 12% service, for the privilege of the barman bending down and handing me two bottles. I felt this was rather a rip off.The noise through the night was terrible, there was little sound proofing, or effort by other guests to keep quiet. Doors slammed in the corridor every few minutes throughout the entire night, and even though I was at the far end of the corridor I was kept awake. It must have been much worse for those situated in the central area. At 4.30 a.m. the person in the room next door started a phone conversation with America and woke me up. I am not a light sleeper and usually it takes an awful lot to wake me up, so you can imagine how noisy this man was. At first I thought he was speaking loudly in the corridor but realised he was actually next door. There is no way that anyone can have any real privacy when the walls are that thin.Room service was fast, though the food was a little tasteless. The chips were the best thing.Be warned if looking at the map on the hotel website showing the route from the tube station to the hotel. Holland Park tube station is about a 25 minute walk or five pound taxi journey. Until Shepherd's Bush tube station reopens, travelling to this hotel via tube is not an easy option.	
Jun 23 2008 	Nice hotel shame about the service	You spend all that money making a place look great and then waste it on the customer service!We stayed here for one night, largely as we could get a spa plus room deal. The room was the highlight of the stay. While not well thought out in design (not a lot of hotels work this out though) it was well equipped (except a vending machine in the corridor instead of a mini bar).However that's where it stopped. Customer service was appalling. They lost the spa booking (although the manager worked hard to save us asking for a full refund), bar service was unfriendly and we appeared to be doing the breakfast staff a favour by actually eating there.The photos on the site make it look larger than it is which is credit to their photographers skill but makes you disappointed when you do walk in. If only the manager took the time to invest in the staff then this place would be fantastic. What a shame!	
Jun 16 2008 	kwest - tops	Our experience in this hotel was fantastic. My husband and I stopped for 4 nights. We were upgraded on arrival at no extra charge and without us askin. We were not expecting much and we were amazed at what we got for our money. Breakfast was even included. Reception staff, often the first line of defence with alot of moaning guests were excellent, especially Sumaya (sorry if we have spelt that wrong) she was very helpful and made are stay extra special and the band (the Mission) that we came to see topped it off a treat	
Jun 13 2008 	Wouldn't stay here again	Far too many inconsistencies at this hotel. Bathrooms look lovely in the photos but need work as the tubs had mould. I was told only some rooms had bathrobes. For room service not all items were available (during dinner hour) front staff each had a different story.Housekeeping did a great job as the room and main areas were always clean.The only reason I noticed inconsistencies was due to the fact that I stayed here with a colleague and despite the same booking (room type/rate etc) we had different services and when asking the same questions had totally different answers.	
Jun 12 2008 	The Best	Just literally came back last night and in all honestly, the hotel is better than I remembered. Stayed here last in 2002, and a major refurbishment has taken place. Was a little learly when I read the recent reviews, but the negative reviews are unfounded. We upgraded to a Executive Super-king, garden side, quiet, non-smoking room, and it was roomy and clean. Everything in the room worked, and the bed was changed every two days, as well as the towels. Keep in mind that when you are at home, you don't change your linen everyday, so why do you need this when you're on vacation. The promo of 30 pounds upgrade per night was great. Renee Piggott, the Reservations Manager went above and beyond the call of duty. She worked with me regarding the upgrade, and no hidden fees were added. We need a cab twice during our stay, and we asked for a metered black cab with no problems. The desk staff was very professional and very friendly as well. No complaints whatsoever. Would stay again in a heartbeat. I'm very picky when it comes to hotels, and the K west has met my needs again.	
May 15 2008 	Top Class!!	Every part of my stay in this hotel was incredible! Every single member of staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were spotlessly clean, and the facilities were second to none!The gym caters for all with top of the range machines, and the jacuzzi, steam rooms, and sauna were all superb.K-West has it all, and is an ideal place for a night's getaway!	
May 1 2008 	Just don't!!	I don't even know where to start. This hotel was a massive diappointment. I'm not one of life's complainers but this hotel has really set me off on one!We were down in London for one night visiting friends, and this seemed like the prefereable option to kipping in our mate's lounge. We should have just taken the sofa and saved ourselves a lot of bother and money.The room was in the basement and it would seem they need sturdy water pumps to drain away water from sinks, loos etc.. After being asleep for only 2 hours we were woken by the pumps and every time someone on the same floor flushed the loo or ran the tap it went off again - sufficed to say we only managed 4 hours sleep tops.The irony was that come the morning, when we wanted showers to refresh ourselves after the worst nights sleep ever, the pump didn't seem to work too well at actually draining water. I had to stop the shower 4 times to allow the tray to drain or it was going to flood the bathroom. A 5 minute shower became a 25 minute shower.There were several plug sockets in the room, but only one worked, and obviously it was the one nowhere near a mirror!!The room was tiny and the bed was hard. The bathroom was clean but in tatty condition. The real icing on the cake was how little the receptionist cared when we presented her with our list of complaints. She basically accused us of making stuff up and then calmly asked for a credit card - a well rehearsed routine I fear. This place clearly gets by on location alone. Oh, and a very &quot;creative&quot; website which gives away nothing of the horrors that await you.	
Apr 19 2008 	Good. If You Need to Be in That Part of London	I chose the K-West because I was seeing a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. It's only an 8-10 minute walk from the venue to the hotel, which is quite convenient post-concert. I would stay there again for the same reason.CommentsBed was comfortableRoom was cleanService was pleasant and responsiveExpensive non-metered taxi called by the hotelGarbage pick-up noise early in the morningNo shower cap or other standard toiletries. A disposable razor from the front-desk cost me £3. I will treasure it forever.Internet service in the room was £20/24 hours.Chicken dumplings with teriyaki sauce at the bar are incredibly salty. Don't bother.The continental breakfast for £10.50 looked paltry. There are nice bakeries and coffee shops on Shepherd's Bush Common. I went there instead.	
Apr 18 2008 	Agree overrated and overpriced	Agree fully with some of the previous who stayed here. I stayed there recently after recommendation and the web site does not tell half the truth. Here's my shortlist to make it easy for y'all:Pro's:+ nice bar+ the open area with internet access+ the small semi-dodgy Shepherd's Bush shopping mall is close, so you could eat/drink there if on a budget.Con's:- rooms outdated, refurb needed soon- rooms could be cleaner, carpet did not feel clean- a lot of rooms still have old TV-sets, no flat screens- staff does not speak English very well (it's a London thing, indeed), you'd get by a lot better speaking Russian or Polish- internet access in rooms is overpriced- too expensive (yes, they work of 'Rate Of the Day'-principle, but in general they are too expensive for what you get)- location not really good. trains pass by near the hotel (noise) and you are as far as you can be from three different tube stations, so either a bit of a walk or taxi all the time.	
Mar 25 2008 	Average	Nice comfortable rooms but nothing which really stood out. Friendly staff and a lively bar. Very noisy at night and no apology offered at check out. Lovely big bed, PS2 and nice flat screen TV. We were given an incorrect bill for check out but this was quickly rectified. VERY expensive breakfast if you wanted room service and rates in the directory seemed to be different to what we were told on reception. We didn't have breakfast in the end. Mini bars in corridors very strange as you have to leave your room to use them and then they only have a very small selection of food available in strange combinations so that you cannot just have a drink! It was nice but I found it slightly disappointing and the website misleading.	
Mar 25 2008 	Loved the KWEST!	The K WEST has changed or some old reviews are off the mark.I found the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The manager Renee went above and beyond my expectations. My executive room was huge, spotless and had a comfortable king bed. The cleaning staff was excellent. Even room service food is good. Location was great for me and less than 5 minute walk to the tube. I have booked the KWEST for my next London trip! This is a young and hip hotel. If you are old and hate fun, stay somewhere else!	
Mar 14 2008 	Not as amazing as you would expect	Have stayed here a couple of times in the past month and have found it to be a bit of a disappointment. Staff can be great but also surly and difficult at times. Beds are comfortable and rooms are a decent size but those by the train line or main road are often noisy. Bathrooms are nice enough but a few essentials that you would expect for this amount of money are missing (such as shower cap, vanity set and moisturiser)I find I stay here more out of convenience than choice...	
Mar 12 2008 	Nice stay at K-west	K-West Boutique Hotel in London / UKVery trendy and nice hotel with a spa wich is not a bad thing in poluted London! Good hotel and very modern desing of the loby and the room. It is a good value for the money but I think that they have stil a lot to improve about the service ! we've got some friends calling us and theirs mesg. where lost- can not understand how &amp; why ? Good location when the tube station is working- we have staied end of February for 8 nights and found out that the Tube station -Shephardbush- entered in works so was closed up to June !- otherwise is a litlle off but taking in consideration that Holland Park is so close 7minutes walk, was not so bad ! Notting Hill is close so is adding value.If you are looking for an area quite and not bustlling there it is !Carol from Jerusalem	
Mar 2 2008 	Noisy Noisy	We would not normally stay here in London but it was convenient for a family party.We decided to treat ourselves and stayed in one of the top of the range suites.First mistake as the two adjacent suites had all night parties that seemed to start at 4 in the morning.In addition the room smelt of stale smoke and when the air conditioning went on a greasey cooking smell came in.The decor may be classed as hip but I like a door to my bathroom and its already showing signs of wear.The staff are very mixed with some good, some rude and some untrained.Not an experience we intend to repeat.	
Feb 27 2008 	Watch the cabs!	I stayed in the K-West with my friend, on February 21st, after booking the Girly Night Package, which included a manicure or pedicure each, a goodie bag full of a girls best friend, CHOCOLATE! complete with some chocolate covered strawberries and a glass of champagne while we received our beauty treatments. Everything great except for cab driver, who my friend says overcharged us, she lives just outside London and has used cabs frequently before. Almost £30 from the Hotel to the near the Prince of Wales. We got a cab back for £18. This cab was called by the hotel, which was a hackney cab, so no meter, not a taxi or black cab as requested, but we didn't have time to argue as we were going to show. I feel we were ripped off especially considering he told us when we handed him £30 he had no change, the fare was £25. My friend said to give whatever change he had so I received the princely sum of £2.50. Normally I tip but I like to do this voluntarily not forcibly. After reading another persons review of the way they were ripped off by a cab from the same hotel at around the same time I think the hotel should review the provider of this service and perhaps employ a new one as this reflects badly on the hotel.One other negative, the spa is tiny and does not have a pool but the staff, especially Charlotte were very friendly. I would recommend the package but do not order a cab from reception, use directory enquires and then call from your mobile!	
Feb 21 2008 	Not Even Close To A 4-Star Hotel	I was booked at the K West through Hotwire after buying a 4-star hotel in the Kensington area of London. This is not a 4-star property. Not even close. The website makes it look hip, which it may be in the lobby, but the rooms are dumpy. Our sink wouldn't drain, and still wasn't fixed after our complaints. The room we had was not particularly clean either. We stay at a lot of hotels and are relatively easy to please, but this place is just not worth the price, even in overpriced London. And I have never written a bad review of a hotel ever.Another caveat, the closest Underground station is closed for renovations. Walking to the next closest, 10 minutes away, is not bad, but be warned that this is the case. Buses are nearby and work well.I think the worst part of the stay was the cab ride out that the hotel arranged. We had two stops, one to the Eurostar train station and the other to Paddington station to transfer to Heathrow. We asked to go to Paddington first, but the cab driver took us to Eurostar first instead. That was not so bad, but I heard later from my boyfriend that the cab driver almost insisted he drive him to Heathrow for 30 extra euro, and that he wasn't going to Paddington. My boyriend threw a fit and should have reported him, but just beware. It would not have been safe for a woman alone, and the hotel should NOT be calling cab drivers like this or their guests.	
Feb 11 2008 	Great location	Regularly stay here on business as it is very close to Olympia, Excellent large rooms, great food, reception staff are very slow though!	
Feb 9 2008 	I had a good experience	I'll give a good summary of what this hotel is about...First, be aware of the excessively bad one-star reviews, as these seem to happen in most hotels on this site and usually are isolated experiences.This hotel offers a very specific product: A true 4-star facility in a very well designed &quot;cool-urban-contemporary-boutique&quot; (you know what I mean) type of place. Most importantly, it is cheaper than the typical 4-star hotel in Central London, because it is just off the edge of a very nice area as opposed to in it.If what you read above suits your taste, I recommend staying at this hotel. The drawback for some is that its precise location is kind of an ethnic working class area, but you are a very short walk away from the Underground and the upscale Notting Hill shopping streets. I actually enjoyed experiencing a bit of the middle-class London scene as I walked to/from Shepherd's Bush Station.	
Jan 31 2008 	The customer is always right but not at the K West!	I arriverd at the hotel and the rrom was not ready on time. The porter stood about then walked off for twenty minutes so we were stuck in the lobby with our suitcases. Later in the evening i arrived back at the hotel and the porter was stood at the door to open it for you. This didn't happen he just looked at my girlfriend and I.They will not change your bed everyday (first hotel i have found with this policy).When i checked in i had to make a payment on top of the fee for the room. This was to cover any additional expensices that may be put on the room bill (£50 per day). I was told by reception that this would be put straight back into my account on checked out. 7 days later i still have the the room charge and additaion charge frozen from my account, evan though the bill was settled when i left. I spoke to the manager of the K West and got a response - &quot;I have nothing to do with your personal finance and its the bank who are holding your money (Not true). The hotel is overpriced and over rated, London has much better to offer.	
Jan 19 2008 	A cool hotel but with some problems	Booked through Hotwire so didn't know where I was staying until I commited payment.Was a little further from central London than i would have preferred but the room was very comfortable and the hotel is obviously a fashionable place for local BBC types who work nearby. (Paul Weller was there in the bar the last night I was there!)However, wi-fi costs £10 a day in your room but is free in the lounge area - why? And the second day I paid for never worked, but hey did refund that.Also there was a problem with hot water, especially in the morning when everyone else is using it. Had to get someone in to fix it eventually.A good hotel but I've stayed in better in London that are cheaper	
Dec 29 2007 	Do not stay here!	Do NOT stay here. My boyfriend and I stayed here because we thought it was a sleek, modern hotel and the rooms looked nice. However, we had some major problems here that pretty much ruined our trip.The customer service is horrible and I can tell you that you will not be satisfied here. If you have the slightest problem or need any sort of accomodation, forget about it here. They will not take care of you. These are the reasons you should NOT stay here:1. They were to call us a cab in the morning and it was never called and we almost missed our plane. We finally got one after standing in the freezing cold at 5 am after 30 minutes. 2. They held $400 USD (200 GBP) for 7 days WITHOUT TELLING US and because the hotel was $250 USD, I went over my daily withdrawal limit and could not access my money when I continued traveling.3. The hotel staff(especially the management) is horrible and very unaccommodating. The management was very rude when we returned to tell her about our stay and the inconvenience and even laughed at us when we felt that we should be accommodated for our travel experience being affected. Trust me. Do NOT stay here.	
Dec 12 2007	Good location next to the Tube station	We were not too impressed when we arrived there having booked a twin non smoking room, and they tried to fob us off with a smoking room, but eventually after we complained they gave us a non smoking room. My parents were both upgraded free of charge, but their room was not as nice as ours. The rooms were quiet, but were very small and not very cosy. The hallways in the hotel were very dark and not very welcoming.I went to this hotel with my parents and sister for a night in London. We found that the hotel was in a good location for transport to the rest of the city, it was right next to the Shepherds Bush Tube Station.We found that the breakfast was excellent with a good choice, but we didnt stop for the evening meal there as we were going to the theatre to see the Sound Of Music. Overall, we would say that this place was great for music fans, and for people like us who wanted somewhere to stay with a carpark, but Im sure there are some much nice hotels that are better value for money. If anyone wants to ask me a question just leave me a message and Ill get back to you :)	
Nov 18 2007 	Lousy stay	Firstly, my room was a shoebox, but that is to be expected sometimes in this expensive city. Checking in was not a problem, but everything after that was. Where do I start? Out of the 3 lamps in the room, 2 had burnt out bulbs. Just call the Front Desk you say? Well, they never seem to answer the phone here. I decided to shower- I turned on the water and immediately scalding hot water was spraying out and it was nearly impossible to turn it off. Seems that there was no cold water pressure. Once I finally got it to a less-than-boiling temperature, I showered; however, between the half shower door (why do they do this over here?) and the bad seal at the bottom, my bathroom was flooded. The heat doesn't work, either (again, good luck reaching the Front Desk; fortunately, being a small room, the hair dryer helps). Between all that, the noisy slamming hallway doors, no furniture in the room (besides the bed and a desk chair) and the inability to get service will make me stay elsewhere when I am back in London.	
Nov 11 2007 	K Worst	My husband stays at K West often and while he's had problems before, this was the worst experience yet. First, he checked in on Oct. 31 and there was a problem with check in for one of the rooms which was embarrasing as my husband is a Tour Manager an this made him look bad in front of his client. Secondly, while there in person checking out on Nov. 1 he arranged for my early check in on November 3rd and had specific instructions regarding parking etc. that had been pre arranged by our travel agent and confirmed in person by him on Nov 1. I arrived the morning on Nov 3 tired from my overnight flight from the U.S. and had one of the worst hotel experiences ever..my room wasn't ready, they had no indication that the six rooms we had reserved (my husband and his party would be arriving later that evening) were together so they had trouble routing the billing and seemed annoyed at my request. I asked about the parking to re-confirm the arrangements he had made before, they knew nothing of it and indicated that it would be a problem. This really got me upset has he would be coming in late at night in a van full of expensive music equipment and we were assurred that there was secure parking. Finally the check in agent, Sveltana, got a manager Mina, who introduced herself as the Deputy duty manager. Mina was very nice and apologised for the agent who she said was new, etc. She assured me the parking was okay and that my room would be ready soon. She took me over to the bar and bought me coffee. She promised to bring me her card and come back to check on me. I never saw her again for the next two days. After I had been there about an hour or so, I decided to go up to the front desk again and check on my room. Marquez, seemed annoyed but checked and said it would be 10 minutes and he would get me. After about 30 minutes, I went back up and he said my room was ready, cleary I had been forgotten about. I then wanted to ensure that the rooms for the rest of my party checking in later where as we requested. Every question was met with annoyance. The room was okay but not what you'd expect for the money.The next morning at breakfast, they literally treated me like a child. I went upstairs and asked for a table for one. They asked my room number which I provided and then I said, however, I'd like to settle this bill separately. She then explained that it cost 15 GBP and I said that's fine and she tried to get me to go downstairs to the less expensive continental breakfast. I mean, what, did I look like I couldn't afford the 15 pounds?  We ordered room service one night which was fine, but the morning of check out I went downstairs to pay for the room service charge separately and we discovered several incorrect room service charges that add been added to our bill. This took awhile but they finally sorted it out.Things should just not be this difficult, every single thing you ask the staff feels like you are just overburdening them.I would not recommend this hotel unless you have a lot of patience and have the time to go through your bill with a fine tooth comb.	
Nov 7 2007 	Fabulous stay in a cool hotel...	After reading mixed reviews by people on here I wasn't sure what the hotel was going to be like.I'd known about the hotel for a while and thought it looked like a cool place to stay and I have to say I wasn't let down.My housemate and I are teachers, so during our half term break we wanted a relaxing stay with some spa treatments. Now most spa treatments in London (we did some research) cost anything from £50 to £90 and more in some cases.The package we chose was the weekday wind down and we were staying for for 2 days which entitled us to 2 treatments... cool!!! We decided before we got there to upgrade to an executive room which made each night cost us about £125 a night each. Seems a lot but when you think that it includes the treatments it was good value.We thought about going to The Sanctuary, but once you have done with your treatments you have to go out into the city... not relaxing at all...Anyway, the hotel is close the Shepherd's Bush tube station and the hotel is no more than 10 mins walk from there.We arrived about 1hr 30 mins too early to check in, but the staff just moved us into a room which was ready so we could go up :o) All great...I've put some pics of our room on. We thought the room was great and was glad we'd upgraded. We were able to control the temperature of our room which I thought was a great feature!After checking out our room we went to the gym for about 1 hr which is quite small but has plenty of stuff there and all equipment had it's own tv and place to put headphones.We then went to the steam and sauna room which was really relaxing. After this we rounded it off with a jacuzzi soak hmmmm :o)We had our 2 treatments arranged for 4pm, 1hr 30 min massage and dry floatation and mud wrap... The women doing the treatments were lovely and extremely professional with a setting which was exactly what we were looking for. The great thing was we just put on our robes, collected our stuff and went up to our room, ordered room service and watched a movie :o)Next day we had breakfast, a great choice of food which I thought was filling, didn't need to eat for the res of the day!Went shopping on Oxford street and came back, used the free internet access in the lobby area and had another session in the gym and jacuzzi.That evening we went out to a few bars and ended up back at the hotel which was buzzing with people. There had been a Mark Ronson and Chemical Brothers gig and this was a kind of after party. Ater charging a few drinks to the room and feeling that we were the only ones staying there we went to bed at 4am!!! What was great was that there was a bouncer/doorman there and he made sure there was no one causing trouble or falling asleep in the bar. Lots of industry types were there, EMI, BBC etc, but we had a great time chatting to them all.The next day we checked out which was no troubel as my friend and I had to sort out the bill in different amounts.I'd recommend this hotel on many different levels, for it's proximity to London, coollness and relaxation. The rooms were very quiet and there was no trouble at all with anything. Staff were extremely friendly, saying hello as you walked down the corridor ans being extremely accomodating. The treatments were a dream and will definitely stay there again, already planning a second trip this xmas :o)Hope I haven't blathered on and you find this useful :o)	
Nov 6 2007	Bad servicenoisy roompoor breakfast	The room was extremely noisy because of a boiler next to the room.Thw breakfast was very poor ,we had to beck for a little more because there was no buffet.And the worst happened at check out.The receptionist wanted to bill my credit card because they claimed I used the internet.I then complained and did not charge me	
Nov 5 2007	Appalling customer service Harassed by staff member of the spa	Atrocious Customer Service.Harassed by staff member at the spa for treatments that had already been paid for.Made to wait over 30min when checking out whilst they check the room (in case we had stolen anything) and they were aware that we had a cab waiting outside.Spent over £1000 at the hotel and would have expected a better service.Overall we felt we were treated like criminals.NOT RECOMMENDED!!	
Oct 31 2007 	Nice and comfy	We stayed here after seeing a concert at Shepherds Bush and found the hotel to be pretty cool. The area is a bit dodgy and I don't think I would have been too comfortable walking from the main bit of town around the back streets to the hotel on my own.The foyer was nice and we did not have to wait too long to get checked in. They knew we were on honeymoon and so sent up some bubbly for us.The room was ok size, v.comfy bed and bathroom was ok, and the decor seemed quite uber-cool.We didn't use the bar or other amenities so cannot comment.May stay here again if over that way!	
Oct 29 2007 	Good Hotel... Horrible Location	I was there for my honeymoon for 4 nights, the food was great, the room was OK, I was pretty amazed of the size at first, but I would really trade space for another location. The closest underground station was &quot;Sheperd's Bush&quot;... but after that you had to walk though a strange street, well really this walk was not that long but it trully felt like walking from Miami to Seattle it was really creepy. If you are someone who does not mind a bit of insecurity feeling, or if you are a person who does not get up if the fire alarm goes off for nothing... Stay at this hotel. Really its not that bad the location is the only bad thing... overall ok....But what really is outstanding is the Club Sandwich... Service is really good, people are very friendly... but dont arrive there before check in... they will just check you in and leave you hanging @ the bar because there are no chair in the lobby	
Oct 29 2007 	Weird experience	This isn't a terrible hotel, but I honestly did not have the experience I had hoped. Booking and upgrading was fine, but check in was an horrendous ordeal. Tired from the journey and HOT in the hotel lobby, it took the best part of half an hour while the receptionist dealt with the fact that I'd brought a different card to check in with from the one I booked with. While she processed this obviously painful fact, she was left reeling when I told her I'd be paying for two rooms on the offending card (OH THE HORROR). Come on, surely this isn't the first time this has happened? Where's your procedure, K West! I also resented having to pay £100 per room deposit in case I damage their state of the art audio visual systems in the room. That is OUTRAGEOUS. I've stayed in hotels all over the world and not once have I been asked to pay because the hotel has some smart kit! Well, aware of the deposit, I checked that the a/v stuff in the room was working and it wasn't. No instructions in the room and pretty useless info in the hotel guest folder in the room - mainly info relating to their products and services (food and spa). As useful as the proverbial chocolate fireguard. So had to phone down and get the maintenance person to go through the set up procedure on the phone with me. And even then the MP3 connectivity (what's wrong with supplying a proper dock?) failed to work. The room was clean, large and a bit bland. I agree with a previous reviewer, the toiletries although AVEDA were really pathetic (a shampoo and a body wash). No conditioner, no moisturiser and annoyingly, no bloody showercap. But strangely, about a 100 million blooming towels!! Less towels, K West, more toiletries...The bar was so expensive I nearly fell off my bar stool when I was handed a bill for over £15 for two small glasses of (rather bog-standard) Sauvignon Blanc. The restaurant was cheap by comparison. The service was rather less than attentive, something which was evidenced again at breakfast. The overall feeling I was left with was that the place is run for the convenience of the staff rather than the guests. While staff were friendly, they were all without exception peculiarly detached and indifferent. So weird is it that I wondered later if the staff were being drugged through the hotel's airvents!! It's a bit like being catered to by the Borg, from Star Trek. If you've money to burn and need a place to stay in London, go and see for yourself.	
Oct 17 2007 	Funky but comfy and relaxed	When first arriving at the hotel me and my partner were greeted by a doorman who opened the door for us. The reception area was light and airey and had a trendy feel to it. After checking in we arrived at our room. It was immaculate and the bathroom was gorgeous; modern and with complimentary Aveda toilettries. The suite was nice, we had large amount of wardrobe space, a desk and mirror, a sofa, tv, sound system with Ipod connection, iron and board and a superking sized bed. The spa was also amazing, really relaxing, and superb value as we got bed and breakfast and a spa treatment each included in the room package. We were also able to upgrade our room to the superking bed for only £35 per night. Worth the money. We had a great time. For the breakfast each morning there was a good variety to choose from and everything was tasty and well prepared in a short space of time.	
Oct 10 2007 	Not bad but not great	First impressions of K-West are not promising - on a busy side street, fronted by net curtains, it looks more like a motel than a luxury hotel.Check-in was OK; the receptionist appeared a little distracted.I booked an executive room, which was spacious, clean and neutrally decorated. The bathroom was more &quot;standard&quot; than &quot;luxury&quot; and the range of toiletries was pretty basic. I'm also a bit fed up of staying in hotels where bathroom door is glass - what's wrong with a little privacy?I had one drink in the bar, as it was somewhat expensive. The bar staff were pleasant and knowledgable, but I thought it a little cheeky that a service charge was automatically added.On balance, I probably wouldn't stay here again: for the money, you can easily get a hotel that is both nicer and more central.	
Sep 24 2007 	Pretty good stay	I recently spent a short stay at the K West. My main concern in finding a hotel in London was spacious accomidations. I was traveling with a friend of mine so I didnt want to be bumping elbows all of my stay and with room size at a premium in London I was paranoid. Finding the hotel was uneventful, Sheperds Bush is an easy to get around stop on the tube and getting in and out of the city was a breeze.Checkin was pretty good. I had requested a double bed but only got a single, this was an annoyance but i was so tired that i didnt bother to make a stink out of it considering the customer next to me was having to wait for his room to be ready. 8 hr flight and i was ready to lay down. The room itself was pretty big, it had a small seating area, big work desk and large bed. I think it was the executive room that i booked, its only slightly more than the regular room and its well worth it for the space you get. The view was uneventful but it was a good retreat from the bussle that is downtown. One slight annoyance that I had about room service is that they didnt have any power converters for my US appliances, I've been to hotels in London before and usually this is not an issue. So no using my laptop on this trip. Minor annoyance/blessing as it allowed me to relax without having to feel tied to my email.The bar was pretty expensive, i spent one night hanging out there with my friend and the vibe was pretty friendly both the other patrons and the bartender. The minifridge in the room was a nice touch but it didnt get very cold. The tv was kind of old which was disappointing because according to the room description it should have been an lcd. Overall the size of the room and value was good enough for me to come back, i didnt feel like i paid an arm and a leg and i feel like i got a room comfortable enough to feel relaxed and with arm room. On the final morning of my stay (Mon) i did notice that there was construction going on in the morning, and i awoke to it thanks to me leaving the window open.Minor annoyances but i think they might have been unique ones and im willing to give the place another chance by sheer ease of getting around and space for the money.	
Aug 29 2007 	Lovely staff shame about the noise!	All of the staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful (and also all very attractive!), and the room and facilities were great. However, I don't know if it's because of the location or because of poor sound-proofing, but the noise from the corridor through the night was very irritating. Obviously you can't blame the hotel for inconsiderate guests coming in at all hours and shouting down the corridor, but somehow it all sounded a lot noisier than in other hotels in which we've stayed.Having said that, we had a really enjoyable two-night stay, particularly as we were upgraded for free. Free internet access and PCs was a bonus, although not 100% reliable. Continental breakfast was delicious and very relaxed.Finally, don't be put off by the external appearance, which is far from grand. The inside more than compensates!	
Aug 5 2007 	Great rooms!!!	GREAT rooms...for the Americans who like a King bed, well, this hotel has done it...and has bathrooms to match.The lobby is a bit rundown, pretty rough around the edges, but, once you are upstairs in your room...it is great.The location too is good. The Sherperds Bush Tube stop is but steps away, and though it is outside the Congestion Zone, not to worry, it is easy to get To and Fro...HIGHLY recommend.	
Aug 4 2007 	Fun relaxed home away from home	It's true that the entrance is run down and the street pretty ordinary, but when you step inside this delightful little gem you enter a relaxed and lively hotel. The staff are polite, helpful and discreet. The decor is modern and fresh. The room was large and comfortably accomodated my husband and I and our two young kids (on the sofa bed). My only criticism is that we were allocated a &quot;smoking room&quot; which stank and I would recommend specifying a non-smoking room if you don't want to sleep in an ashtray! Otherwise, we loved it. I would definitely stay there again.	
Aug 3 2007	I want to really like K-west	We've stayed before at the K-West and liked it better. The staff is friendly, but pretty clueless and the rooms - at least the one we stayed in this time - have seen better days. In all fairness the hotel was completely full, but what could go wrong - and what could not - did go wrong, and for this price that is just not acceptable.	
Jul 29 2007 	Rock n Roll Slumber	Arranged a trip with friends to got to see a band - Black Rebel Motorcycle Club - in Somerset House London, and stumbled across this little gem of a hotel.Ideal for those who want to stay somewhere trendy but would like to veer away from the usual touristy areas. Located in Shepherd's Bush, the area in which the hotel is located will give guests a sense of what it is like to live in London away from the West End and the usual famous sites. This is London for Londoners.Record companies and concert promoters seem to use this hotel to lodge bands when visiting London. Indeed, the band we came to see were also staying in the hotel. The residents bar resembles an aftershow party with musicians and music industry types partying into the late hours. Whilst lounging in the mac-book populated bar during the afternoon, we overheard a record exec convincing one of his new northern signings to license on of their tunes for use in a tv ad for one of the main supermarket chains.The hotel may be a bit too buzzy and hip for all tastes, but for its niche audience it will serve as an oasis of cool. Rooms are fine, restaurant too - decent value for the prices.Turn left outside the hotel and there is a beautiful strip of tony shops and chichi restaurants, a gem of a place for breakfast or a lazy lunch.Tip: there are 2 tube stations called Shepherd's Bush - one above, and one below ground. They are located about 7 minutes apart and served by different lines. Be clear about which one you intend to use (recommend the subterranian one) to avoid confusion.	
Jul 18 2007 	Cool hotel for a weekend treat	I booked the &quot;Weekender&quot; rate for my boyfriend &amp; I on the hotel's website and upgraded to an executive room for an extra £35. The room was really spacious and the bed was huge, and very comfy (I wanted to take the pillows home)..! The bathroom was spotless and the shower had great water pressure. My boyfriend booked me a massage as a surprise (bliss!) which allowed me to use the jacuzzi and steam rooms, he was able to join me for an extra tenner which apparently let us both use the spa &amp; gym all day - very relaxing!There was a DJ in the bar that night so the atmosphere was quite buzzy for a hotel bar, and we ended up having quite a late one! We therefore got up later than planned so thought we'd have missed breakfast - but were pleased to discover it was served until 12, so we had a really sizeable and tasty feed in the restaurant &quot;Kanteen&quot;. The location wasn't very glamorous but being in a residential area meant no road noise at night, and it was convenient being so close to the Central line. Also a stone's throw away is a multiplex cinema and a whole load of bus stops. We found all the staff to be friendly &amp; helpful  all in all a great stay!	
Jul 17 2007 	very ordinary.. I would seriously look at someplace else for the money.	Me and my wife spent our first year anniversary at the spa. We booked through last minute.com and paid £115 for the day. When we got there, things were not explained very well. We were left to work out where things were and what we were supposed to be doing, very disappointing. We did not feel valued or looked after. Although my wife had massage and manicure and said they were ok but nothing special. The lunch was a choice of salad, salad and yes more salad, but do be fair the lunch was tasty and just the right amount. We did not dare order any drinks as they were way over priced. The staff were well intentioned but had no idea of what was going on. Overall a real disappointment for the money I feel if we had paid £60/£70 for the day I feel this would have been a fair reflection of the price. I guess what I am trying to get across in this post is that from the pictures the place looks fantastic, relaxing and modern. But what it doesnt get across the fact that you dont feel looked after, its overpriced and a disappointment. I would seriously consider the alternatives for the money.	
Jun 9 2007 	2nd Visit to K West	We booked through Tablethotels.com which always makes it safe and easy for me. K West was consistent the second visit. I like the large, contemporary rooms and the great location. The service there is fine. The computers and internet connection are spotty (both times), so for business it can be a bit touch and go.It is not a super quiet hotel, but I quite like the energy and hip vibe.The hotel is in Shepard's Bush, which feels like an up and coming area in London. It is diverse and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from, though none seemed terribly swank (ok by me). The hotel is not inexpensive, but I feel that you do get a great room for the price.	
Jun 6 2007 	K West A Let Down!	The Hotel has an ugly frontage in quite a tatty part of town with bin bags along the street! Check in and lounge area had no atmosphere and we didn't bother using the bar which was right next to the entrance. We were given a room in what felt like the basement along past the spa. The room itself was clean and a good size but bland and unwelcoming. The loo made an awful sound when flushed! No mini bar but vending machines-very naff! Very expensive for what it was and a big letdown!	
Jun 5 2007 	Nothing special	We stayed her when we attended a weekend function down in Hammersmith. I chose the hotel due to its proximity to our do (a 5 minute taxi ride/ 20 minute walk) and although some of the reviewers have said that the area is not very nice, I think it is just plain old London. We walked back from our party very drunk at 3AM in the morning and had no problems. Yes, the area is not as tidy as Mayfair or parts of Kensington/Chelsea but it isn't exactly like a demilitarized zone either.I didn't think that the place was anything special in terms of the rooms or the decor, I have stayed in just as nice 'non hip' Hilton establishments in London. The continental double (i.e. two single matresses) bed was comfy. There were some nice little details such as the corkscrew, ice bucket and chinese teapot in the room, ice &amp; vending machines on each floor, and the free internet access ( 4 screens to the rear of the entrance lobby) but I don't think that justifies a 'designer' premium. The price of the drinks and champagne dispensed from the vending machines on each floor was eye watering - take a five minute walk to shops in Shepherds Bush and stock up instead.If the air conditioning in our room is anything to go by, do not even consider staying in this place if it is hot outside - definitely the most ineffective unit we have ever used, we left it running on high for 6 hours on the saturday afternoon to come back to a room at precisely the same temperature that we left. Couldn't be bothered to complain as we werent in the room that much anyways but it is something that should have worked and didn't.The continental breakfast was a pleasant affair with a good selection of hams, cheeses and yummy pastries and probably the only really welcoming staff in the entire hotel. For an extra 4.50 GBP we upgraded to the cooked option on the Sunday which took an age to arrive but I guess was ok value, if a little dry. It is useful that breakfast is served until midday on Sundays but beware, you are expected out of your room by 11AM otherwise you get a curt phonecall at 1115 and start being charged from midday, so don't bother asking for a late check out.The bar area is suitably designer all in glass and mirrors and so are the prices at 5.75 GBP for two half pint glasses of coke, 9.00 GBP for a cocktail (the going rate in the west end). I noted that an optional 12percent service charge was added to every drinks purchase - what was all that about ? It wasn't as if I was being waited on - I was stood at the bar and carried the drinks to our table myself....I now realise that I must sound like a real skinflint being totally obsessed with London prices and all but that really is the crux of my review....I knew that this was a designer hotel and likely to be a little pricey which is not a problem if:a) I am made to feel welcome and smiled at - I wasn't (not trendy to do this, I guess)b) Everything works as it should - aircon was cack, computers and lifts out of order c) People are honest - don't disguise service charges that are presumably optionalMy conclusion is that this place is trying very hard to be designer but I think that it has put that ethos in front of getting the basics right leaving me thinking that it was overpriced for what we got, which is a converted office building not in the poshest area of London. In future I will stick to special offers from the Hilton people thank you very much, at least you know what you are getting.	
May 31 2007 	Not impressed by the K West	Stayed here when in London for a wedding. Nothing seemed to work - the elevators at our end of the building, the mini bar system, the iron. Rooms are badly stocked with provisions, staff don't seem to have a clue although are very pleasant. ONE bar person on at midnight on Friday night - long waits. Everything just a bit shoddy and not what the hotel markets itself as - boutique and classy. Also not a particulary great area of London to be in - wouldn't recommend it if you are sight seeing. Myhotel in Bloomsbury - so much better!	
May 24 2007 	Best Hotel in London	I stayed a the K-West on a business trip a while back and LOVED the hotel. I've stayed in some &quot;shoeboxes&quot; in London before, so this was a very pleasant surprise. Upon arrival, the front desk clerk asked me if it were my first time to the hotel. I told her it was and she put me in an huge executive suite, at no extra charge. It was comparible to the Ritz Carlton or Westin. I had a DVD player, CD player, mini-bar area and huge bathroom. I loved the bar in the lobby as well. When I return to London, I will definitely stay here again. It was also a very short walk to the Tube station and I felt safe.	
May 11 2007 	Great Place	Stayed a night while working in the neighborhood, and quite liked it. Very clean, great bar and scene- perhaps a little hip and loud for young families but I look forward to returning.	
May 8 2007 	Great stay at K-West	We stayed in November 2006, for a romantic weekend in town. Having shopped on the web, got a great deal I think it was about £130, cheaper than Hilton which messed up our reservations, so this was a last minute jobby.Very friendly, cool decor, we paid for a room upgrade and the room was massive and it was a nice central location to get around.Wine list was excellent, and yeah it's pricey, but that's london, it's no more than any other hotel.We'll be going back.	
Apr 19 2007 	Nice stay	My wife and I stayed here for one night in Aug. of 2005. It was part of a package deal through British Airways. We did not have much contact with the staff though check-in and out was efficient and friendly. The room was exactly as described with a comfortable, huge bed and a small bathroom. Breakfast was nice, not fabulous, but definitely met our expectations. It is close to a tube station and so we parked the car and took the tube into London. Overall it was a very nice hotel and we have no complaints.	
Mar 27 2007 	Great Fun Hotel Wonderful Staff	What a great hotel. My partner and I stayed here in January for five days and we loved it. From the cleanly, contemporary designed rooms, to the free Internet, it was a great experience. The staff and bartenders were friendly and helpful. We even got an upgrade to a suite, which was a nice surprise. We will definitely stay here again!	
Mar 25 2007 	Good value... for London. Great breakfast.	Right on Shepherd's Bush, which the BBC used to dominate, and the hang out of media, film and music types, it has a good range of rooms from good value basic to high end deluxe suites with enormous plasma screens. It's a little out of town, but it's right next to Shepherd's Bush station, and only a few minutes from the city center. It's tucked away in a quiet side street, so makes for a perfect night sleep... if not for the passing trains... and rowdy media stars. Oh well, nothing can be completely quiet in London.The location is also great for restaurants and nightlife, which thrives around Shepherd's Bush and nearby Holland Park. The rooms are good value, and the included breakfast is excellent. Some of the best croissants and fresh bread rolls I've ever eaten. It also has a highly recommended restaurant, called the Kanteen, which serves up food good enough to draw in the locals as well as the hotel guests.The only down side is that you might, like I did, get woken up at 4am by drunken music stars coming home from a night on the town...	
Mar 12 2007 	Great DJ!	I just wanted to let people know that myself and 13 others stayed at the K West Hotel recently to celebrate a friends birthday and had a great time. We booked our Executive Double room through Quickrooms as this was the most reasonable, and included continental breakfast.The room was clean, spacious and modern with Aveda bathroom products (which I love!). We had a very quiet room on the 3rd floor, and the service from staff overall was really good.The best thing about the hotel was its bar and DJ who played a varied set until 2am! (You couldnt hear the DJ though in your hotel room). Great to come back to after a meal out with a large group of people. Yes the drinks are expensive (but no more than most London clubs or hotels), but the service was pretty good and there was an ample seating area for everyone to relax or dance in late into the evening!We also parked our car in the NCP car park (following recommendations from this site) which seemed OK and a lot cheaper than the hotels car park.I recommend the breakfasts served in the Kanteen Restaurant, which cost us an extra £11 each but had a really good selection of food and lots of it (great for a hangover!). All in all we had a great weekend, and I would have no hesitation in staying at the hotel again.	
Jan 24 2007	Bad value for money	Stayed on business for one night as the nearby Hilton was full. Room rate of £211 and extra £22 for cooked breakfast. The hotel was nice, very stylish and contemporary, but overpriced. Bar and lounge area were small and full of locals as opposed to guests. The restaurant had a reasonable menu, food quality and service were good but again expensive. The area is safe but not too central. The tube is 5 minutes walk or a taxi would be £10 to the centre of London, but the hotel is not on a busy route so catching a cab can be difficult.I stayed on the 3rd floor and can't fault the room, looks just like the picture on the web, but no mini bar. Check out was a disaster, very slow and staff seemed confused about how the computers worked. Other staff were pleasant and helpful, but never in a hurry to do anything.Beware hidden service charges of 12.5% minimum for absolutely anything.	
Jan 10 2007 	Pretentious pretentious pretentious and completely without reason.	Pretentious, pretentious, pretentious and completely without reason. Rude, ignorant and unattentive staff. By far the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune of being a guest at. Many other truly chic 4 and 5 star hotels available for the same amount. Menu at restaurant is merely glorified McDonalds.The one bit of service we received was a complete mess;My husband pre-ordered flowers to be in the room upon arrival as a surprise for me. They had not seen to this, so he returned to reception to enquire about them at which point he was told a member of staff would be bringing them to the room shortly. After more time had passed we received a phone call from reception asking whether or not it was convenient to bring them through, which they were and then dumped them on the table. I asked where I could get a vase from (We had asked for one to be provided) and they claimed to have no vases in the entire hotel. What was I supposed to do? Keep them in the sink? Eventually after more phone calls and clear staff irritation a tiny vase was found.Just one example of how something so simple was made into a complete palaver; a simple little surprise could be so much hassle and irritation to them.The room was really nice I thought and decorated well compared with the rest of the hotel, but the mini bar was a problem; it didn't exist! At the hotel bar locals hung around on the few stools they have and stared at the guests. I felt so uncomfortable and would have gladly hidden away in our room if only there were a mini bar!	
Dec 28 2006 	Nightmare	Being an extensive traveller for professionnal reasons, I wonder how I picked such a dreadful place for a holiday.The Executive room displayed on the website is nice, just like the one i got. Apart from that the hotel is awful and not worth its four stars at all. Most of the staff is acting like they are doing a favor when answering simple questions from the guests (like a bottle of water for the room). For an example, I waited ten minutes with five other couples for a table for breakfast... the five tables were dirty and the staff didn t want to clean them as they were obviously bored. No smiles and no sense of service at all.Beware... the small lobby smells like McDonald's, but the staff is much less friendly and professionnal here. Avoid a visit at all costs.	
Dec 4 2006	Avoid this place if you can	The hotel was a real disappointment. I actually wanted to stay here after I read the reviews on this page. But after my stay I really question if the hotel is under new management. Firstly the location is not what they say it is. They advertise it being close to Notting Hill but really it's in deep in Sheperd's Bush behind a mall...not quite what I was looking for on a romantic get away. Secondly, the room was a smoking room which I specifically did not ask for. The furnishing was cheap. It felt like the decorator wanted to make the place look modern and luxurious but at a low cost. In the end it felt cheap. The shower was awful, after we turned it on, we couldn't turn it off again(!)...really low quality material. There is no mini bar. You figure for a 4 star you would at least have a mini bar. Then the service...I asked for a wake up call and did not get it. That was the first time this happened to me in western europe (only other experience was in Africa). I have to say the staff was nice but that's not enough. Overall, I really would not recommend it to anyone.	
Nov 26 2006 	Nice Hotel.......Beware floors 1 	Booked several rooms here for colleagues and myself in Nov 06.Decided to book following reading the reviews on here :-)Arrived early evening and was immediately helped with luggage into reception. Car Parking is ONLY via a valet service adjoining the hotel......alternativly there is an NCP just across the road which isn't advertised but is far cheaper. Having said that the valet svs isn't too bad for London. £5 for first 3 hours and then £1.50 per hour or part thereof.I was assigned a room on floor 1 which is 2 floors below ground and floor 2 is one below ground, thus making ground floor (reception, bar etc. floor 3) The Spa is on floor 1 and is right outside the lifts. There is then the LONGEST trek ever to your room if your unfortunate enough to get a room between120 -135. There are huge air con vents all along the corridor, I suspect this is because quite simply your below basement level. My room was furnished with a 3/4 bed and although there was a window it didn't open as we were below street level but there was a little light available from it. No bath just a huge walk in double shower which was fantastic, very hot &amp; powerful. Concerns regarding the room were that is was sparse, very low level lighting meaning one had to move the mirror just to be able to see, no hairdryer available either. But the WORST aspect was the smell in the whole room which hit me on arrival, it smelt terribly of bad drains, this came and went throughout the day &amp; evening and sometimes was unbearable. I would suggest this is down to the toilet being not on the main drains due to the location below ground and was a maccerator type flush (VERY noisy when flushed) The smell was pretty disgusting and on asking about it at reception I was advised &quot;This is a regular issue on floors 1 &amp; 2 but there's nothing we can do&quot; I was a little disappointed at the attitude of this 4 star hotel !Bar stayed open until 3am and snacks were also available. There are vending machines in several locations which stock alcohol and snacks and these are operated via your room swipe card and the items are then charged to your bill. Beware that the charges are expensive and equivalent to the dreaded &quot;mini bar&quot; in most hotel rooms.We had a Continental breakfast included in our room rate, this was adequate and pleasant. However if you fancy anything cooked i.e. a full english or pancakes etc. this will set you back an astonishing £22 !!!!!!! It's the same price even if you wish to upgrade to this from the Continental.Reception/Checkout staff very slow in processing check ins and departures resulting in huge lines of guests in the foyer.I would stay here again despite the problems it was a comfortable bed, nice vibe and a good bar area &amp; breakfast. BUT in future I would certainly request floors 3 &amp; above only.	
Nov 2 2006 	K-West our base camp!	We booked through Virgin Vacations. Other than a snafu caused by Virgin, the place is great (on-arrival Virgin tried to re-assign us to another hotel but we would not stand for that). The staff at the K-West seemed truly concerned and were cordial throughout our 3 night stay.This hotel is just a couple of blocks from the underground stop at Shepard's Bush and in a lower/middle class neighborhood. We never felt uneasy in the area. A Hilton Hotel is very close.The bed was very comfortable. That is most important, as you will be busy in London unless you are a dud and a good night's rest is imperative.Add to that the fantastic continental breakfast, Starbucks coffee and free use of the internet on 4 PC's and you have a special hotel. The motif is modern but not sterile. Our only real complaints would center on the legacy tv screens and rather low room lighting. I have some nice photos but they are too large for this web site.We would consider the K-West again on a trip to London.	
Oct 28 2006 	Lovely	I stayed in the hotel with couple of friends and it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Great service, excellent bedrooms and great atmosphere in the Bar. I was organizing a Hen party for one of my friends and I came across the K West site and there hen packages. Even though the reviews were quite mixed I thought we give it a shot. I AM GLAD WE DID. When we arrived at the hotel a lovely doorman helped us with our bags. The rooms were not ready as we arrived to the hotel quite early however we relaxed in the K Lounge having nice Starbacks coffee. The receptionist then got all out keys organised within half an hour and we were in our rooms.Beautiful contemporary design with no fuss. It was modern but not completely minimalistic. Very cosy.We had wonderful time in the Spa and my friend loved every moment of it.We will definitely be back.WELL done to all who was involved into making our stay exceptional.	
Sep 25 2006 	REALLY ENJOYED IT	I stayed at the K West for my boyfriend's birthday on Septemebr 16th for 1 night.I booked over the internet well in advance, and had no problems whatsoever, albeit i had to get a credit card just to book.I booked us on the Love is package as a suprise which included a treatment each in the Spa, the room decorated with balloons and champagne and strawberries delivered to the room.When we got there, we realised Shepherds bush is not that nice an area, but it had a cinema and a load of restaurants and lively bars around which would have been good for us had we been staying longer. it is also very close to the tube which was very handy.When we got there the hotel was lovely despite the surroundings. The reception staff were helpful, and i had no problems.When we got to the room , it was decorated as planned with helium balloons, that really started the stay off well. The room was a good size with a massive bed and a huge TV. (i did pay the extra for an executive room!)The bathroom was small but pleasant and the free robe and slippers were everso cosy.The spa was fantastic. We had a full body massage each, and then had full use of the jacuzzi and steam rooms etc. Came out feeling totally relaxed. My boyfriend was in bliss. i would definitely say to try it.When we got back to the room, i called down to reception to get them to bring the champagne up. i was expecting a half bottle of champers and a couple of strawberries,(you know what these expensive hotels are like) but when the knock on the door came we were presented with a full bottle of champagne with ice bucket and a well presented dish of belgium chocolate dipped strawberryies. IT WAS MUCH MORE THAN I EVER EXPECTED AND VERY PROMT.We then did our own thing in the evening wich was made all the more easy with the tube being so close.We also had breakfast included the next mornng. i recommend not to have it sent to the room, as this is quite expensive and the Kanteen where it is served is lovely anyway. The breakfast was HUGE! 3 courses and well worth the money.The free internet access was useful, and the all the staff, (especially Magda at the spa) were really friendly.Despite all the bad reviews we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. it was pricey but worth every penny. We had none of these problems with the credit cards, and overall really enjoyed ourselves. Would we stay there again? YES, but only when my bank balance has recovered from this time.	
Sep 17 2006	Not as Bad as You Would Think	I was really worried about staying here after reading all the bad reviews here. The hotel was very nice for the price, large clean room with everything working fine. We had no problems with the staff or anything at the hotel. The neighborhood is a little more rundown than in the expensive tourist areas. But for a large city, its really pretty good. The location was very convenient to the tube and the major tourist destinations were a short ride away. We bought a week Oyster Card and had no trouble getting anywhere. There were some really good reasonably priced restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk and within a 10-15 minute tube ride and walk. In all of our walking around Shepards Bush, we never felt unsafe. All in all, this hotel is good value for the money and probably a better room than you will get elsewhere in London for the same price. If you want a cleaned-up tourist destination, then dont stay here. If you want a big city experience where people actually live and a convenient location, then this is a decent choice.	
Sep 11 2006	no credit card	I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel as an anniversary treat for my husband and myself. I was booking the room when I discovered that you cannot book without a credit card. I couldn't believe that a debit card would not be acceptable so rang the hotel and spoke to the duty manager who explained that not only do they require a credit card if you book direct with the hotel but even if I booked the room through an operator and paid for it in advance with my debit card I would not actually be able to stay in it as a credit card would be required on arrival. Apparently this is a recent change in policy. But I very disappointed and it seems a bit ridiculous to turn away guests just because they don't have a credit card!	
Sep 11 2006	The KWEST was Okay....	My arrival experience at the KWEST was good. But, the location of the hotel was horrible. No, I didn't think that I was going to die, although, I had to question the neighborhood of the hotel's location ( Shepherd Bush). The KWEST is very far from the tourist attractions, museums and Most of ALL the NIGHT LIFE!! I love to go to restaurants, parties &amp; shopping! And, someone you loves these types of activities and being far away, could be a bit of a problem! Other than the things that I mention, the KWEST is a very modern hotel, unlimited Internet access:) &amp; the Staff was OK.... I wasn't very please with some of the ladies that work @ the bar, but, that wasn't the worst thing, that One, could encounter on their European vacation! I did have a problem with the Front Desk, in regards to a Fed Ex package. I left my IPOD behind, and I ask the Front Desk if they could charge my CC and Fed Ex my package to my new destination in Paris. Well, that was definitely a problem and it took over a Week to get to Paris, which I thought was Absolutely ridiculous. I found out that it was still in London and on the last day in Paris, I was Screaming at the Front Desk Manager and he personally had it sent to Spain. All together it was OKAY, besides the location and the deliverance of my package.	
Sep 5 2006	One night weekend stay	We enjoyed our brief at the K West this summer. The (upgraded) room was large with a lot of natural light, the best feature being the massive bed. Unfortunately the ultra-modern cool look the hotel strives for is undermined slightly by the fact that the rooms are starting to show their age, not tatty, just a little frayed around the edges. The hotel isnt located in the most tourist friendly of locations if you'd like to walk to London attractions, but isnt a problem if you're prepared to take a cab. One of the features of the hotel was that it seemed to attract a more diverse and interesting clientele than the usual tourist/business class. This may also have been related to the busy modern cocktail bar open til late.Due to the location of the hotel, if you're driving in, you'll feel obliged to park in the car park next door - be aware its not cheap and there are no discounts for being a guest. Overall, we enjoyed our brief break from the countryside but there are quite a few 'hip hotels' to choose from London, so next time we'll try somewhere else.	
Aug 25 2006	Awful hotel items stolen from room.	A number of problems with this hotel. Would advise all to stay away.1. Hotel in a run-down area of London, despite outward look of the hotel.2. Safe and fridge both broken.3. Bathroom floor filthy.4. Ridiculously expensive add ons. Spa use is extra, breakfasts are around 20 pounds for an english breakfast! 5. Walls paper thin.6. Key cards not corectly programmed***** 7. Items left in room were taken, hotel informed of this and took no action. If you want your possessions to be safe, do not choose this hotel.On the plus side, the bedroom was clean, the room was sizeable.	
Aug 13 2006 	Decent hotel but bit noisy	Having read all the reviews prior to going to stay here I was really worried. Our experience was that we needed a hotel close to a gig in Shepherds Bush, so location was ideal, no complaints.The hotel was modern and clean, staff friendly although we didn't see them much as we were out a lot.Room was clean, tidy, bed big and comfortable, air con was working fine, bathroom spotless. So no complaints there.Only problem was we were staying at the same time as madonna's tour crew who had the day off, and seemed to be an impromptu party in the room next door to us that went on from 11pm til 4 am, comings and goings, knocks on the door, room service, much merriment. Now this is fine, but we would have liked a bit of sleep (or at least an invite to the party) ... so I have to conclude that perhaps the walls and sound generally in the hotel is not great is you like a bit of peace..... having said that if you do stay make sure its not when Madonna next tours and you should be ok....Can't comment on the food as we ate elsewhere and left before having breakfast...All in all did the job as a convenient hotel close to a venue we had to be at....but there are nicer areas than Shepherds Bush ....	
Jul 31 2006 	The most regrettable hotel experience that I can think of.	The photo's of the hotel are lovely and it looks a very nice clean cut modern and stylish hotel. The website is quite classy in a very low key kind of way.The room was excellent. It was the Embassy Suite and came with a nice widescreen tv, Bose DVD player and PS2. The bed was a kingsize and faced the window which ran the length of the room. There was a dining room table with two chairs. The sofa was positioned against the wall with the longest part of the table opposite. The bathroom was small but well designed. There was a fridge in the room.The hotel states it is near Kensington and Notting Hill and these are in walking distances. This is a stretch if I am honest as it is plainly in Shepherds Bush which is ok but not where I would be paying this kind of money for a hotel.I booked using a credit card. It was in fact the wrong credit card and I made a mistake. The day of our arrival we got a call stating my credit crad had been declined. Quite why they were using my credit card without my presence I do not know. I presumed at the time they were trying to have the money on my credit card allocated. I expected my credit card to be declined as I have a low limit and as stated I used the wrong one. I gave the woman the correct card details and she confirmed that that went through fine.Several hours passed and we turned up at the hotel and gave the Russian receptionist my card. She then ran it through again and it declined. I checked my bank by phone and I had ample credit. I asked a good friend to check online for me and again they confirmed the same. The receptionist then produced a WAD of receipts for VARIOUS amounts all confirming that my card had been declined. SOme of these had been done at my request but the majority had not been done.It was at this moment that TWO GUESTS came up to me and said they have had the same thing happen but despite the card being declined the transaction had gone through. They also stated that the Hotel actually is not charging my card but trying to allocates the money on my card to them so that I can't spend it but the interesting thing is they do it twice. Why I don't know but they do and thats why it hits the credit limit so if you have little credit left or a small limit you will have this problem. The following day I used the SAME credit card to pay the balance with NO problems. This was not a problem with my card but a problem with the way the Hotel book. Unfortunately I didn't take the name of the original person who called me and ran my credit card through successfully and of course no one knew who it was.I stood at the desk for 45 minutes arguing with them and they could do nothing to help me. They would allow me to pay using a debit card. After allowing me to do this, they upgraded our room and gave us free water and fruit (4 apples).The room was lovely but if any of you know of the heat in the UK in July you may remember it was mid 30's and therefore very very hot. The broken fridge and almost non existant air con obviously didn't endear the Hotel to me.We ordered room service which was excellent it must be said and the breakfasts which are over priced are really very good. Despite this, my stay in the hotel is one that I regret.	
Jul 31 2006 	Loved the cool design of this hip hotel	I stayed at K West Hotel &amp; Spa this weekend and absolutely loved it. The design was extremely cool and staff were really friendly and helpful - it's also such an amzing place for people watching. I had an hour massage and also used the PowerPlate in the gym. I thought the spa was one of the best I've ever been to and I can't wait to go back for another visit. The room was much larger than other hotel rooms I've stayed in in London and the bed was huge. Perfect for a romantic break away!	
Jul 7 2006	Spend more Stay Elsewhere	We had assumed that the lower rate relative to comparable hotels (~£130 / night) was indicative of the hotels location. Unfortunately, the quality of the room and common areas left much to be desired. If you're looking for a nice place to stay... take the hit and pay for a better hotel. The location is not horrible, only a few tube stops away from some good restaurants and shopping.Our room (deluxe king) was spacious, and the linens were clean. The bathroom, however, was disgusting. Add to that some worn-down low-end Ikea type furnature.The weather was warm in London... and the AC unit in our room was unable to provide adequate cooling. The common areas offered no refuge- as they appeared to be not air conditioned at all. Overall- we'd give the room a C-. We won't be back.	
Jul 6 2006	Not 4 Star at all	We were very disappointed with our stay at the KWest Hotel in London.My wife and I were on our way back to San Francisco after ourtwo-week honeymoon in Greece. We specifically selected the KWest Hotelbased on its 4star recommendation as we wanted to stay somewhere nice onthe last night of our honeymoon.We arrived at KWest at around 10:30 at night, needing a shower and somerest. When we turned on the water in our room, it made a horrible,vibrating sound -- like someone had turned on a garbage disposal. Afterthe sound did not go away, we called management. They said they would be right up to take a look. After 30 minutes, themanager on duty finally came to our room. Because we still were unableto take a shower, or rest, we asked to be switched to another room whilethey dealt with the problem. They offered us a smoking room with twinbeds. I told them that was unacceptable and that I did not intend to pay morethan $250 for a smoking room with twin beds. Amazingly, they finally&quot;found&quot; an acceptable room -- at about midnight.The sound the water made in our room was horrendous. The fact thathotel management did not try to make amends for this until they wereforced is even worse. I will never stay here again and I wouldn'trecommend it to anyone.	
Jul 3 2006	Overpriced and poor service	Myself and 10 friends recently stayed at the K West hotel as part of their advertised &quot;Hen Package&quot;. Our stay started well, having been greeted by the manager and welcomed to the hotel. One member of our party had booked for day spa, but then decided to stay the night and paid the £35 extra person charge to stay in an occupied room. As the rest of the party had been given a voucher for a glass of champagne, we asked if she too could have one - but this was flatly refused, despite the fact that we were spending £125 on lunch at the time. Eventually the manager agreed (extremely reluctantly) to give an extra glass of champagne. We then headed to the spa for our afternoon experience, to find a very small spa area consisting of a jacuzzi, steam room and sauna, and 5 sun loungers. We were not the only hen party, so the area was extremely small for over 20 people with inadequate space to relax. The chemicals coming off the jacuzzi were also very strong, and so a number of our group had to leave. On a plus point, the treatments on the whole were very good (although the nail polish used for manicures and pedicures seemed to run off easily). Most upsetting however was the fact that at 4am the next morning 2 men were allowed to check into the hotel with a woman, and on going to their room proceeded to shout, argue and make a lot of noise. On hearing screams from the woman, members of our party called reception, but then the men tried to find out which room had complained and stood outside their room for some time, making our party scared &amp; unable to sleep. On raising this with the duty manager the next day, he was completely disinterested and refused to give us any refund until he had spoken to the general manager the next day, and would not guarantee not charging to the credit cards given at the time of check in. It took nearly 2 hours to resolve, when finally he agreed to our original request of a discount off the package price, but still failing to apologise for the poor service and most importantly the upset caused.	
Jun 19 2006 	Not recommended	Arriving at the hotel I didn't receive the urgent message my husband had sent me by email. Never got it until the end of my stay, although asking them to check their email for it. The room was definitely too small for 1 person - note that this was supposed to be a double room ! Additionally the room definitely needed refreshing. Bad smell at times. Air condition didn't cool down enough for summer weather. No minibar in the room. There was a hairdryer but no possibility to plug it in in the bathroom - had to use it in the bedroom where the mirror was placed too high to use it (unless you 're 170 cm or taller).Although breakfast was included in the price, they charge you extra for a Cappuccino. The day I received flowers, I asked for a vase and didn't receive it before the next day -after asking for it again. After having paid way too much for the experience described above (i.e. for the room), they charge you an additional 10 pounds for using the gym (per visit of the gym). One positive remark to finish: Adel, a very helpful employee, helped me out with his private mobile phone charger as mine was not working. Thank you again - this was very much appreciated. !	
Jun 18 2006	Well worth it	My husband and I had wanted to stay in this hotel for a while as had heard good reviews so we booked ourselves in for a Saturday night. We were slightly concerned when arriving as the exterior of the hotel does not make a great first impression. The inside however was very different. There is just something very cool about this hotel. The staff, the atmosphere, the simplicity and the decor all attribute to a true 'hip' hotel..Our room was very spacious and very comfortable. It was simple yet very classy and had everything we needed. A mini-bar would have been good, but the lack of one was not a big problem. There were vending machines, but I think the cheapest option as around £6 for a drink and a snack.We got a weekend deal which meant we payed less then half of the normal room tarrif. It was a really great hotel and we would definitely stay there again, but probably only if we could get the same sort of deal as I'm not totally sure it warrants the normal price tag for a night's stay. If you are someone for whom money is not an issue however then I think you would get a lot more out of this hotel.	
Jun 13 2006	extremely disappointed	I was very disappointed with my stay in the K West hotel this past May. For the price, it simply does not measure up. The room itself was average-sized and well-decorated, though it looked in need of freshening up. The room definitely did not seem new. There was also no mini-bar. Instead, one could use their key in vending machines located in the hallway outside the rooms. These machines were not well-stocked, and many did not work. The air conditioning worked well, but was a bit loud. I had a room facing a back street, which was loud and smelled of cigarette smoke. The cold water in the bathroom ran consistently very hot. The shower arrangement was confusing, and one had to guess what an appropriate temperature setting was, as there were no markings to indicate whether you were making the water hotter or colder, and the temperature varied so much that it was more than a bit anxiety-inducing. I was very worried that I might end up burning myself. The bathtub itself was cracked and peeling, and the showerhead was not a handheld and was instead a very poorly-situated wall-mounted showerhead. The hairdryer was powerful, but hidden in the recesses of one of the closets. Every night when I came back to the hotel, I was greeted with a loud and raucous afterparty at the lobby/bar for various musical acts who had just played at Shepherds Bush. This seems to be a regular occurrence. Much of the desk staff did not speak English very well, and others were quite rude. Getting a cab is difficult. If you do not ask, they will call for an unmarked cab from a minicab company that they have aligned themselves with. These cabs do not take credit card. Requests for a black cab can take up to a half hour.There is complimentary internet down in the lobby, with about 4 fast computers available at all hours. This was much-appreciated.Overall, I would only stay here again if I could get a good deal and if my destination was very close to the hotel. Otherwise, I'll be looking elsewhere.	
May 29 2006	Nice for the price albeit a bit pretentious	My husband and I stayed at the K West while he attended a trade show at the nearby Olympia Grand Hall; I tagged along to do the tourist thing.Location and outside impression: The facade is very modern and glassy, quite distinguished from its surroundings of what I think of as British row-houses -- those red brick, apparently 19th or early 20th century townhouses that are really flats. Not much in the way of restaurants or retail in the immediate vicinity, but the Shepherd's Bush tube station is an easy walk, so no problem. Lobby and reception: We arrived a couple of hours prior to check-in time, and my husband had to rush off to the trade show hall, so I was left on my own with the luggage, waiting for our room to be ready. The front desk staff and bellboy were polite if not truly friendly. All were very youthful -- barely over 21 if that -- and all of them were eastern European and barely conversant in English. I asked where the restroom was, and got a deer-in-the-headlights look. (Later, I realized I should've said &quot;toilet,&quot; but they *should* have understood &quot;restroom.&quot;) I was given vague directions to someplace where there definitely was no restroom. So after that wild goose chase, I settled down in the lounge to wait for my room and go then.The lounge was shabby and dirty, and I hoped this wasn't a preview of our room. The walls were stained and badly in need of paint; the cushions on the sofas and benches were flattened and misshapen. When we later realized this lounge was quite the place to be in the evenings, filled to the brim with hip, cigarette-puffing youth, we were surprised.After waiting an hour and a half, I began to think it was up to me to inquire as to whether my room was ready; no one was going to come and tell me. So I went over to the desk and asked, and it was. My bags were brought shortly thereafter, by a bellboy who looked sheepish when I tipped him. I still don't know if that meant tipping him was a faux pas, or if I hadn't tipped him enough. I couldn't have asked even if I wanted to, due to the language barrier.Our room: Very pleasant surprise! We were on the basement level with the spa (which we never had time to use, but it looked inviting), and our room was much bigger than we'd expected a room in a British hotel to be -- about the size of a room in an American Hampton Inn or LaQuinta. Modern, minimalist decor -- not what I would have chosen, but not at all unpleasant. Everything had a very clean, functional feel -- including the bathroom. No tub, but a spacious shower.Amenities in the room: Desk with vanity mirror and chair, sofa, coffee table, large closet with safe, iron/ironing board and trouser press, king size bed (a little hard but not unbearable), television, DVD player, CD player, video game console, hair dryer, refrigerator, kettle. Tea bags, instant coffee, cream and sweeteners were provided; although the in-room hotel guide indicated we would be charged for using these items, I don't believe we were. Wireless internet was available for an exhorbitant 10 pounds a day; we opted to save that and plug in our ethernet cable for a free wired connection.Room service: Unbelievably expensive, but one night we did break down and order two slices of cheesecake. It arrived promptly but had the flavor and consistency of shortening. We never tried the restaurant.Overall: This hotel markets itself as upscale, sophisticated and luxurious. But they don't have the staff, location or attention to detail to carry that off. There's not even anyone who speaks enough English and knows the area well enough to recommend a good restarant. But if you're not a high-maintenance guest, K West is good value for the money. The rooms are clean and spacious, the price is reasonable, and the tube is right around the corner.Next time I visit London, K West won't be an automatic &quot;stay there again,&quot; but it will be on my list of possible lodging choices.	
May 4 2006 	appauling stay	I have stayed at k-west many times I felt on this occasion I had to complain.The cleanliness of the hotel has dropped since the last time I stayed.Hairs on the bathroom floor and in the bath.The staff cannot speak english wihich is extremely frustrating.The duty Manager on duty was extremely rude I heard a receptionist call her name carolineI ordered room service and it took 65 minutes.would I stay here again no is the awnser	
May 1 2006 	Great atmosphere	When I approached the hotel the building was very odd, industrial feel. As I walked in to the hotel it was totally different feel. Very pleasant porter opened the door and greeted me. There was a long queue I decided to get some coffee whilst waiting. They serve Starbucks Coffee, delicious. I It was not very long when I got the room and, it was very nice and contemporary. Being on business in London Wireless- £30.00 for five days was very good value as it was unlimited during the whole 5 days. Room has got all the facilities needed. Breakfast was excellent. Restaurant and Bar staff are very attractive and overall very attractive staff throughout the hotel. Great feel, vibrant atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to anyone	
Apr 19 2006	K West Shepherds Bush	Just stayed for 2 nights (weekend) at the K West Hotel in Shepherds Bush. Found the hotel to be clean, modern and all the staff were courteous and helpful (although none of them had a British accent). We had the full English Breakfast each morning and it was delicious, very filling and very hot. Also the fresh fruit salad scrummy !!. Location, very handy for tube station also a good selection of local shops. Would recommend if a good rate for the room is available.	
Apr 9 2006 	The good the bad...the fugly	I am currently staying for a month on business in room 331 so I will have lots of time to evaluate this place. I am from New York City and my company is putting me up here while I roll out a big project in the London office.1st impression: Very nice, trendy. Neighborhood isn't the most exciting but is very safe and residential. There are food places about and places to grab a drink. Directions could have been better, as in which Shpherds Bush Station to get off at (Central or Hammersmith Line?) Little bits of info save lots of time.The Good: The room is very nice, well decorated, Modern. Bathroom is tasteful. Very minimalist. Room is very clean. Solid AV Equipment including DVD and stereo. Nice couch and full length mirror. Bed could be a bit firmer for my taste but overall very nice and big.The Bad: about 1/2 of the staff are native English speakers. That's fine until you need to find a local laundry place and the person at the desk doesn't understand &quot;laundry&quot;.Also, when I booked, it said &quot;Gym included&quot;. My email confirmation does't go into detail about this and they've informed me that they've recently instated a &quot;10 pound gym fee&quot;. Over the period of a month, that is $300 pounds for something I was supposed to have included. The recommended I long distance call the US booking service to clarify the issue.View. None. the odd rooms look into another building. Not a huge issue - the room is nice.Internet. I don't mind paying a reasonable rate for internet, but they charge 10 pounds a night, so again, another 300 pounds added to my bill. It is very slow and firewalled so you can do things like videoconference and audiochat to people overseas.Bar refrigerator is super small. I am staying for a month so I thought itd be good to get some beer, wine and snacks at the grocery store. When I turned the fridge on, I could hear it engage but upon opening it a few hours later, it was burning hot. All of my perishables ruined. I told the front desk and their response is that the mini bar items are now sold in a vending machine so you dont need the fridge.I will update this posting as my stay goes on. Obviously some improvement is desired	
Mar 30 2006 	I still can feel it	I stayed in K west September 2005, and it has been a pleasant experiance, The hotel has a contemporary style which is my preference ,I loved this hotel as it gave me a sense of relaxation Every little detailed contributed to the pleasant feeling I got out of the hotel, The music they play, the tiny screens on the corridors between the rooms, the decoration of the hotel, the chairs and seating, it is just a pleasant contemporary experience The Hotel was equipped with fitness center, high speed wireless internet access, simple healthy breakfast. The room was clean, neat and large with very nice decoration, the bathroom door was semi-transparent but the location of bathroom door is concealed away from the center of the room. Beside this gives it a touch of uniqueness There was a shopping mall with cinemas few steps away from the hotel, and shepherds bush is just within walking distance, there were several parks near as well.If you are into contemporary style.. This is the hotel for you	
Mar 29 2006	Impressed	This my second stay and I preferred it to my first around 2 years ago. Last time we had a suite, but it stunk of smoke and just felt depressing and there was just too much space! This time we had an executive room for £89- which was a lot bigger than usual rooms I other hotels costing at least double this. Complete with large sofa and coffee table, huge bed, and gorgeous bathroom. The only slight complaint re rooms design- it all feels slightly grey, maybe one wall should be a bright white to lift things slightly?!The staff in person were charming and very helpful though I emailed one person who was quite rude. They have a ridiculous policy of not accepting debit cards- either when booking to reserve or in person when checking in. I do not have a credit card and have managed at every other hotel Ive ever stayed in, this policy is crazy and another women who clearly was not warned got very flustered at check in when they would not accept her debit card.Only other complaint- they now charge £10 for use of their spa- which is actually a standard sized Jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. This seems a bit steep anyway especially considering this is a hotel which actually calls itself a spa and is one of main reason a lot of guests will choose it- I think to charge guests staying at the hotel extra when they probably might pop in for 30mins max to use it is quite cheeky. This policy was not there when I first stayed and I think they should reconsider this.Internet access is free which is also a bonus, all in all we had a very pleasant stay(bar some very noisy guests from BBC who came out of bar very drunk at 2am and proceeded to stand around and chat very loudly in corridor for ages- maybe more staff in corridors where other facilities are- to monitor noise level would be useful)	
Mar 7 2006	good rooms	my partner and i stayed in this hotel for a weekend brake in london, payed £125 for the room witch included a upgrade, reseption staff were ok, not the most helpfull but no real problems, the room was one of the best i have ever seen, and was newly referbished, as was the bathroom, the spa was lovley and we had it to our selfs for more than a hour, the restrante was ok, food was good but wasnt much atmophire, would defenatly stay hear again!	
Mar 5 2006	It is still the best hotel in London	We have been to this hotel some time ago and yet again it was FANTASTIC. This time it was the 14-Feb. Last time we were here for my girlfriends' birthday. This time she decided to treat me for Valentines to a stay in my favorite hotel.Yet again the hotel goes beyond any expectations. This time we also used the Spa and the Kanteen it just proved to me that I should not even try other hotels in London.We decided to go for the Executive room the same as before(just, last time we upgraded upon arrival) and it was very well maintained since the last time we stayed. Still the biggest and best beds I have ever tried.Staff are just perfect. Young, funky and cheerful. The feeling you get is as if you are in a land of HAPPINESS.	
Feb 13 2006	Total waste of money =-( =-( =-(	It seemed to me, that for our last night in London, it would be a great idea to spend time at a comfy, posh hotel with desirable amenities. It seemed that $300 CAD would be a reasonable amount to spend for a clean, quiet room, polite and friendly service, and a well-maintained whirlpool and sauna. WRONG!We were greeted nicely upon our arrival, and we looked forward to retreating to our room; however, when we started to settle in, I noticed a foul amount of mildew around the shower and tub. I had already put a great deal of effort into overlooking the obvious and protruding accessibility hardware (hardly an environment for a romantic bubble bath to begin with!), but couldn't bare the unclean state of the facilities. I'd never issued a complaint to a hotel before, but for my first experience, this was as unpleasant as it could get. Without even seeing the condition of the bathroom, the concierge proceeded to disagree with me. The tone of our conversation escalated when I demanded that he come to the room, and view the situation in person. He finally did, and at first, acted as if it was no big deal, when in fact, it was truly disgusting. I eventually managed to switch to another room, but it wasn't much better. Although I did not complain about the accessibility hardware, I was disappointed to discover that it was in the second room, as well.My boyfriend and I proceeded to the spa. The staff person monitoring the counter was short and rude to us. We collected our towels, and met up at the whirlpool. The women's dressing rooms were a mess, and my boyfriend couldn't help but notice that the men's toilet was disgusting. Apparently, they have some serious plumbing problems.We spent some time in the whirlpool, and considered using the steam rooms, but one was broken and the other was just as mildew covered as the washroom in our first room!Originally, our plan was to enjoy dinner that night at the hotel, but the amount of cigarette smoke in Kanteen was suffocating. We looked at the room service menu, and found it to be impossibly over priced, so we decided to go out instead. As it turns out, the area surrounding the hotel is about as boring as you could imagine. There are few decent restaurants in London to begin with, but this area is even more devoid of eating establishments than average.So let's tally this up: The service sucked; the room was an utter disappointment; the facilities were unclean; the location blew; the price was a complete and utter rip off. It's funny  the rhetoric offered by the hotel is one that says: &quot;I wanna be your friend&quot;, when clearly, the management couldn't care less. Why do they bother to leave comment cards? I requested that a service manager get in touch with me, and months later, no one has. I wish I'd visited Trip Advisor before wasting my money on this truly unpleasant hotel =-(	
Feb 12 2006	Kanteen service v.poor and over prices	Stayed for one night in Feb.Spa was excellent.Room was clean but no clock and had broekn lightKanteen was below average for the price. Service was amature and took 50mins to serve. Also order was mixed up. Overpriced. Staff did not go out of there way. Nice decor, modern but starting to look tired.They all need training in good service , pity as the hotel/spa was very nice. Could only rate as ok due to poor service. Wouldn't want to stay more than a day.	
Jan 17 2006	Good value	The hotel is very pleasent in all areas. I payed £65 pounds for a double room, which is great value, however the bed and room was quite small, but reasonable.The spa area wasn't busy at all meaning a more relaxed environment. The only down side was the jacuzzi was not working.Good value for money	
Jan 15 2006	never again	I brought my wife here for her 40th celebration and we stayed 4 days.When we arrived we were put on the spot with the sales talk of upgrading our room.i siad no We were put in the furthest point in the rear of the hotel overlooking railway tracks.i asked for another room which we got even though we were non smokers.The hotel does look great on the net but thats about it.The barman did not know how to make a vodka martiniThe drinks are expensive,staff barely speak english.The coffe was good(starbucks)We made several phone calls back to the states,when i asked about the fees to do so i was told 5 pounds a minute!!!!!!!!!!!!They then lowered it to 3 pounds a minute.All in all i will not be back when we return next month.The front desk people looked like they couldnt wait to leave for the night.Anyone looking to stay here with kids...... BEWAREThere are 2 computers for guests The first morning we went and ck our email wheen we saw a free sex icon on the desktopEach morning we saw the same thing and i guess the staff forgot to ck each day?I have no problem with whatever it is that people search but surely if the kids were staying and went on the pc then this would be a big shock for a minor to see in public.So,stay at a HOLIDAY INN cause this place is the worst ever.Expensive,rude staff,......Do the owners care?I think notI can see the management speaking to staffGet in to the wallets and get out and even give them bad service then they wont return...........ok enough said	
Jan 14 2006	Nice hotel	My friend and I stayed at this hotel at the end of December 2005. It is a nice, clean and modern hotel. It was overall a good, but average experience.The room was very nice with beautiful dark wood furnishings and a large bathroom. We had a double room with 2 very comfortable twin beds. The bathroom included Aveda amenities, which we enjoyed. The only thing we did not like about the room was that there was no clock. Make sure you bring a cell phone (that works in the UK) or a watch. Otherwise the only way to know the time is to turn on the TV and tune into CNN.Another gripe we had was the service. I would rate the service to be a tad below average. This is because we had to call servicemen to our room occassionaly due to a malfuntioning safe and blown circuits. We did not get prompt responses. They took their time from 30 min - 45 min to come to our room/get things resolved. We found this frustrating.Also, if you like to be in central London, this is not the hotel for you. The KWest is located in Shepherds Bush, which is in Zone 2 of London. There's not much to do in this area. On a postive note, their dining facilities are excellent. We had dined in their hotel restaurant practically every day. They served delicious food. Their continental breakfast was also good. They served apples and oranges, different flavors of yogurt, juice, coffee, milk, and teas and cereals. It was a very relaxing experience.Reception was also very helpful in providing information and directions.In conclusion, the KWest was a good hotel with good value. We had booked it at a special promo rate. However, I think we would feel unsatisfied if we had to pay a lot more.	
Dec 18 2005	I just loved it!	I found the K West when searching for a hotel near the Shepherd's Bush Empire. I had stayed at the Hilton twice and wasn't thrilled, and found the Novotel in Hammersmith to be uttlerly without charm. I booked at the KWest, and then was a bit concerned after reading the very mixed reviews on this site. I am very glad I barrelled ahead.Pre-arrival I exchanged numerous emails with reception working out package rates and with the spa concerning spa services and classes. All were friendly and helpful.On arrival, my room wasn't ready, so I was given a complimentary upgrade to a very large room. There was an enormous, comfortable bed, with nice linens; a good quality TV, DVD player and CD player, although I only made use of the last; a couch and coffee table, a desk with accessible electrical outlets and mirror; and a large closet with one side for hanging things, shoes and suitcase and the other with open shelving which meant that I could unpack somewhat without leaving my clothes strewn around. Finally there was a niche with minibar with room for my own water and supplies, nice kettle, tea supplies, large glasses, mugs and an ice bucket. (Working ice machine across from the elevator.) The decor was very spare and modern - probably not what I'd choose at home. But it was attractive, functional and comfortable.Breakfast (full, English) was wonderful, with a special mention of the leek and herb sausages, which were fantastic. On the second morning, I had to leave for Heathrow at 7:00, just the time the restaurant opened, but breakfast was delivered to my room at 6:15 (ordered for 6:00 to 6:30). I was only disappointed in that there were none of the lovely sausages. The lounge served great Cosmos. At 8GBP, a bit spenny, but twice the size of the similarly priced ones I had at a Marriott in Liverpool.There is FREE internet access.To address some of the negative issues noted in previous reviews:I was somewhat concerned about service and the &quot;cool&quot; factor. I'm a middle-aged woman, and distinctly uncool. I found service at the KWest to be exemplary throughout: at reception, in the restaurant, in the lounge. Everyone just couldn't have been nicer.I stayed a Saturday and Sunday night, and the hotel seemed to be reasonabl full; nevertheless, I didn't hear a sound from elsewhere in the hotel. And even when I had my windows open, I heard nothing but a normal city hum from outside.The hotel is located a short walk from Shepherds Bush Green (very busy at all hours, apparently) through a quiet residential area, past a typical local pub. Neither SBG nor the immediate neighborhood could be said to be the least bit upscale, but, frankly, I felt quite comfortable walking back to the hotel by myself, quite late on the Saturday, and around 8:00pm on the Sunday. I had asked both a (female) bartender and a woman at reception their opinion, and they expressed no reservations at all about the safety of the area. Because of my own schedule, I wasn't able to take advantage of the spa or the classes offered, but hope to.At 119GBP B&amp;B, the KWest was at the very top end of my budget, but I definitely think it was worth it.	
Dec 4 2005	K WEST .....no way go East!	Despite reading the reviews on trip advisor (a mix of good and bad) I decided to give this hotel the benefit of the doubt and book the special one night spa break as a treat for a weekend in London. BIG MISTAKE. The hotel while modern and quite easy to get to is K*** (thats what the K stands for). Upon arrival half an hour before check in the room was not ready so we, decided to leave our bags with the rude and somewhat incompetent staff.We checked in later on and we were directed to our room a deluxe .there was nothing deluxe about this room. It was cheap cheap and nasty. Nothoing like the pictures and rather tired. The towels where grubby and it was soulless even for a modern hotel room. We therefore decided we would pay the extra £35 to up grade to the next level  the superior. Unfortunately for use a hen party had already booked all of these grade (this should have set of alarm bells). Any way we there opted to pay the £150 + VAT to upgrade to the K suite which was huge and much better quality and to be honest really really nice. But £305 is a little pricey and we could have stayed at a really nice room in Claridges for the Sanderson for less. The Spa was cramped and the staff rude, abrupt and obviously did not attend charm school or any other school for that matter.To top it all off the sir conditioning in our room was faulty and wouldnt switch off, the broadband did not work and the hotel bar which was directly underneath our room stayed open till 2 in the morning was loud hens shouting and pumping house music.And breakfast, which was included in the room, rate run out at 11 am.Dont give this hotel the benefit of the doubt I did and had a terrible time. For the price of a few more pounds stay somewhere much nicer and more central!	
Nov 28 2005	Soul-less Ikea Catolgue	Total Luxury Health Spa Day and overnight stayCheap Package Deal FeelI was really happy to receive this gift voucher as I love spas having experiences, the Berkeley Spa, Champneys and Pennyhill Park I was really excited. I had booked pedicure and manicure as extra, because they would not allow me to trade the facial. My long suffering partner had booked a room to join me that evening. Sadly from start to finish the day was a total disappointment, the hotel a soulless badly maintained take on the Ikea catalogue.11.00 Arrive Hotel with large bag as have room booked. No Porter available, directed to spa.Spa Reception: No Hello welcome, told of harrowing journey, told can help myself to tea in garden room. Garden room is a dull room with two sofas and a bowl of apples and banana's not a fresh flower or magasine in sight.They should consider renaming it Hospital waiting area or airport lounge, in fact that is doing airports an injustice.Told first treatment is 12 and then lunch 12.30 menu is rammed into my hand. I choose salmon. No one explains the format of the day to me.I am shown to the changing room very ordinary.Change into swimsuit to use the Jacuzzi, I get in with a man we discuss the over chlorinated smell which is making both our eyes smart, as I get out the pink colour of my ELLE swimsuit has bled slightly. (This has not happened before.) We both mention this at reception and it is noted.SHOWER Facilities  cracked tiles, mildew, no shower gel in either cubicle and could not get the shampoo to work.11.30  go to purple room to await therapist. No explanation of treatment back massage which in itself was fineLUNCH time, no idea where it is served, wait in dressing gown for staff on reception to finish personal chit chat, told in K anteen. There are two other dressing gowned ladies, but it is the public restaurant, I became very uncomfortable with my oily hair and only a robe on as the place filled up. The food was fine.12.30  go back to spa area, no magazines to read, a price list and spa brochure. 1pm  taken to room for my treatments  very small, showing signs of ware and tear, water marks on the ceiling, noise from an intermittent drill, air-conditioning is hardly concussive for relaxation. Manicure and pedicure was mediocre with products being used from white plastic bucket. Facial was not explained and throughout the treatment I was sold to, the travel pack is exceptional value, the candle is lovely, it is a personal preference but I am not a fan of espa products that I said to the therapist several times. After two hours I asked for a glass of water.It would have been nice to know what is happening to your face rather than it just happen.4pm I leave the claustrophobic room with a headache from the air-conditioning and drill having said that I was going out in the evening with mud oil and products in my hair. As there is not shampoo and no towels in the changing area, it is lucky we have a room booked.I settle the bill £74 for the nail treatments.The room 219The room had the last occupants rubbish in it, the TV is not as advertised flat screen the reception is appalling, we complain. Nothing is done. There are no plush white cushions and the room has an overall feel of a cheap Ikea catalogue.The shower is fab though cutting through the gunk in my hair.We go out for dinner and return early to use the bar, there are some seedy types who make us feel uncomfortable so we go to our room.At midnight there is a fight outside in the street, the people in the adjoining room are having a loud argument and make up in the usual way, we can hear them clearly. At 2am a lively crowd decide to play football in the corridor outside of our room.I give up trying to sleep and leave at 7am, there is no one on concierge/reception to help me, no taxi so I make my way to the main road, my journey home was harrowing All in all a very disappointing weekend.Whilst K West cannot do anything about your location that, is great if you are exhibiting at Olympia I think you could do better with house keeping and attention to guests needs. May I suggest that in 2002 when it opened K spa was lovely from my experience it needs maintenance and some standards enforced.The hotel and spa is sold as a luxury package, which it certainly is not. At £165 it is an expensive travel lodge.	
Nov 25 2005 	Still worth a visit!	I've stayed at this hotel a couple of times in the past 2 years for leisure purposes and it was great, so I was a bit concerned when I read some of the recent reviews after booking in for a business stay this week.I got a great price of 90GBP for bed and breakfast through the Airmiles website (first but not the last time i'll use this service) and got a nice double room which was clean and spacious.The onsite gym is great with a good selection of CV equipment and actually had people using it, creating a good atmosphere for a hotel gym. The spa was empty though and therefore perfect too!Can't comment on roon service or restaraunt as my charity expenses budget wouldn't quite stretch that far, but breakfast was nice, if a little light.The area it self isn't as bad as people make out and it's nice to see a 4star hotel next to socially inclusive housing - it was nice to walk to the Tube in the morning with Londoners going to work. There's also a cinema complex and supermarket very close by, handy if you're on your own.K West does feel different compared to a couple of years ago but places do change and it is still a very comfortable place to stay if the price is right. I'll definitely be going back on business and leisure.	
Nov 9 2005	K-rap	K-West negative points: The hotel is built with rice paper. For a hotel that promotes tranquillity and £100 spa treatments it is somewhat ironic that you can hear people breathe two rooms away. It doesnt really help that they use the car park as a coach park too. I now understand what it would be like to sleep with a coach. Perhaps they would like to rename the place: The Koach Inn. Service is awful. Note to staff: Manners do not cost a thing. And please, I do not require the bill slipped underneath my door two days before I depart. Now thats relaxation for you. You might as well come round with two heavies wielding baseball bats. Original features: by this I mean the dirty towels, stained seats and bed spreads which, if you were looking for a seedy hotel at 10 bucks a night, may just be right down your street. For the price you pay here they could at least burn old filthy furniture. The blurb says the hotel is housed in an old BBC building. It must have been the set for The Young Ones.K-West positive points: Its in London. Albeit, Shepherds Bush, a puke and urine stained island surrounded by a motor racing circuit.Verdict: K-rap.	
Nov 7 2005	Not what we hoped	We stayed in this hotel to get away from it all for one weekend, get some rest and because we thought it would be fun to stay in a hotel in our hometown. We did the booking online. Found the hotel quick easily. The immediate surroundings of the hotel are not great but the most important is inside we thought! We checked in and went to our room. The room was really cold, the sofa and bed throw were stained, the mini bar fridge was leaking and did not contained what was listed on the menu placed by it, one of the towel was also badly stained and some of the sample product had already been used and put back with a third of the bottle missing. We were moved to another room. We had checked in for 3 nights and in the morning of the second day we found an invoice that had been slipped under our door in the night mentionning the quick check out option available to us. When we went to reception, no apologies were made nor explaination given - they just said it was a mistake and ripped the invoice. On the first day, we came back in the evening to find that the room window was open and if you really wanted to you could easily have climbed in from outside!! Breakfast was not impressive either, neither for us or for other people around us who shared their comments. Finally the noise inside the hotel and outside was quite terribly - from the room we got moved to (which was also an upgrade) we were actually facing a car and coach park! The hotel was so noisy that on the last night we had to phone reception at 00.45 in the morning to complain.	
Oct 25 2005	Good service but interesting area	Stayed at K West last weekend for 1 night as going to Shepherds Bush Empire. Did a search of the internet before booking and got a good deal - so worth looking looking around before booking.Arrived at 10.30am expecting to have to just leave our bag and come back later to get our room, but was told that they would upgrade our room and that there was one available immediately - brilliant. Room was well designed and a good boutique/modern style without being over the top.Can't agree with others about the staff as they were all really helpful and friendly.Slight gripe about the car parking - it costs c£36 to park your car next to the hotel in their car park - yes it is on website and yes I could have gone by train but still it seems a bit excessive. The hotel is only about 300 yards from Shepherds Bush tube station but the road you walk along to get to it is a bit &quot;shady&quot; - interesting characters going in and out of a pub up the road, police standing guard by a house, another house with industrial strength looking metal shutters.	
Oct 21 2005 	hated it a rip off	We stayed 5 days- booked this hotel because we were on a budget. The surrounding area is very seedy- I would avoid it if you are female and traveling alone. I hotel is extremely run down, with small rooms and dirty bathrooms- but that's not the worst part- we made three phone calls - two to the US for about 5-10 minutes each and a local call- all while using a callng card and got a bill totaling almost 300 pounds at the end of our trip. The staff is rude. Avoid this place if you can	
Oct 13 2005	A great bargain and Experience	A great bargain. The room was very big and the staff was very attentive and friendly. We didn't have a lot of time to explore the hotel facilities, but we had a great time there. Fantastic English breakfast!!! Thanks to Tablet Hotels, the website we booked our hotel stay through, our vacation was a success. We used three of their hotels during our recent trip to Italy by car. It's really fantastic that they focus heavily on providing great customer service which was such an important factor in determining whether our precious 14 days of vacation would be a failure or a success. Its good to know that someone is looking out for us!	
Sep 27 2005	Nice Design Too Youthful Service	The site looks like a former school house from the outside, but they've done a nice job making the rooms very boutique-y, modern and affordable. Though I did get the 60 dollar upsell (30 pounds) once I showed up to go to an executive room -- it was worth it to have a dining table in the room and I will say the addition of Aveda beauty care products for toiletries was cool. Oh yeah, reminder the british have no TV channels, but the room was comfy enough I decided to stay in that night, and have room service. We were on our way back from Turkey to the US, and this was our stay over night before return.I'm a young guy, but the staff most of them couldn't have been over 23, even the desk staff, so I guess that's why you are paying less for more of a room. A very Eastern European staff right off the boat / train, and one member didn't even know how to get to Holland Road, which is the next street over. So be aware - I know UK service is already weak, but this takes it to a new level. So overall nice rooms -- and affordable in this day of the weak dollar. Right off the tube, so that's convient. But Travel and Leisure's description of it being hip swank spot, a la South Beach, is way off. I don't think any cool London-er would ever step in here, but I could be wrong.Overall, It's a modern designed budget hotel, with a spa below on the basement level. But it's young staff, and lack of true character (again, it's a former school house or office building, or something industrial) make it a shy of what I would put down true 4 or 5 star Trip Advisor rating.I would recommend it on price and looks. That's about it.	
Sep 22 2005	Rooms=A+; however staff could use an upgrade	My husband and I stayed at the K West during the final days of our honeymoon. We had spent 3 days prior in an apartment and the final two days in the K West. It was certainly a nice change from residential living. The hotel is very modern, but sticks out a bit since it's situated in a residental area. The hotel is smaller, 5 floors, with 30-40 rooms on each floor. I enjoyed our accomodations immensely! Our room was situated on the 1st floor (the lobby is on #3) at the rear of the property. At first I wasn't too crazy about the floor selection, but once we got inside our room, I didn't want to leave. The room is not set up like a typical hotel room--it is more wide, than deep than what I usually expect. The room had a large bathroom with walk-in shower stall, terrycloth towels and waffle-weave robes. Our room featured a mini-bar/fridge (that can lock), tea maker, ample sized closet, trouser press. In addition, there was an oversized desk, a living-room sized sofa, coffee table, king size bed, two nightstands, TV/DVD/VCR/CD Player. And, nothing felt crammed in this room. There was lots of natural light that poured into the windows and light fixtures all around the room. The only downfall, there wasn't a bureau or area to place our bags/toiletires out (other than the closet). The spa is located in the lower level of the hotel, on the 1st floor (where we stayed). Also, their fitness facility is there, too. We didn't visit the spa or gym, and found some of the prices for spa services to be a little bit over our range. The hotel lobby doubles as the bar and the hotel's restaurant sits above the bar. With the exception of the woman who assisted us at check-in, the staff left something to be desired. Their level of helpfulness teetered between annoyed and just barely enough. The feel of the bar/restaurant area is modern, hip and very metrosexual. The bar spins techno and house music (loudly) in the evenings, and it seems to be a popular for the younger set in the area. That said, we didn't hear any noise--other than guests in the hallway--from the lobby area.Re: the helpfulness of the staff:We aren't the type of guests that call the front desk for requests--with the exception of a wakeup call or taxi, but even doing that seemed to annoy the staff at K West. (I would give them a 2 out of 5 rating)Location:The Shepherd's Bush tube stop (Central Line) is a 4-block walk--very doable. There are other restaurants, bars, coffee shops and a small shopping (mall) area right near the tube stop. The tube ride is about 5-6 stops away from the major sights.All in all, if you don't require staff members to help you that often, but want to stay in a beautiful, spacious and costly room, then stay at the K West. I think you may find a comparable hotel with a more accomodating staff closer to central London and possibly at a lesser cost.	
Aug 22 2005	Stop Your Bloody Moaning!!!!	My wife and I stayed here as part of a Theatre weekend. We looked on the tube map and thought it would be a long way from the centre of the city, this was not the case. From the outside it has an industrial look about it but once inside it was a chic mimimalist haven away from the London clutter. We paid for a deluxe room but upon arival we were upgraded to an executive room. This was very spacious and well thought out with pretty much everything you could need.The only downside was that there was a private function going on (probably the reason for our upgrade!) but once in the room it was inaudible.As for location, the hotel is 300yds from Shepherds Bush tube which is on the Central line which takes you right into the heart of the city in 15 minutes. This is a thoroughly modern approach to hotels so if minimalist or trendy is not your thing or if you are expecting to walk to the sights from your front door, give it a miss. If on the other hand you like things simple but funky, and like to be well treated by inobtrusive staff, give it a go.P.S. Your mother wouldn't like it!!!!!	
Aug 2 2005	Really Posh...but the rooms were just "ok"	I stayed at the K-West based on a recommendation from a colleague. Unfortunately, since I was there on business, I didn't have much time to take advantage of the spa :-( The K-West hotel was pretty nice. The decor was modern and simple, and room service arrived promptly. The other nice thing about the hotel was that they had a large gym (at least much larger than the flimsy closet called a &quot;fitness centre&quot; at the Radisson Sussex). After walking through the lobby, I was expecting the bedrooms to look like the photos on the website. I had a deluxe room with a couch but no plasma tv. The room was large, but the bathroom...just didn't seem very clean. Additionally, the tv was tiny. It reminded me of the tv that our family used to have when I was 6 years old (before we had a color tv!). It's really tiny. But, if this doesn't matter to you, then it shouldn't be a big deal.I took the tube from Shepherd's Bush into Central London every day. I didn't mind the ride, but I had colleagues stay at the hotel and THEY did mind. So, if you don't want to have to pay approx 20 GBP per cab ride back to the hotel after a night in Central London, then K-West is for you. However, if you're going to stay in the Shepherd's Bush area, then I highly recommend the hotel. I _do_ suggest that you make sure you get a room with a cleaner bathroom though.	
Jul 2 2005	Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	What a find!!! We stayed for 2 nights in this gem within the estate and couldn't have asked for more. The bar was stylish and the drinks cost a fortune - worth every penny though. The room was taken up by the bed but we were lucky to have a view of a real quaint old english wall. I reckon it must have been 30 years old!! We didn't have time to use the spa but it sounds delightful. We'll be back and that's for sure.	
Jun 26 2005	My favourite hotel	From the outside it looked awful, but when you step inside, it's quite a different story. Chic, minimalist and modern - an oasis of calm from the outside hubbub. The staff on the front desk are efficient and friendly. The room (deluxe) was quite a treat. Decorated to impeccable standards, you couldn't fail to be impressed. The room was enormous; a good thing too considering the size of the bed, which was 10 foot in width! Included were flatscreen tv, cd and dvd player. The bar is lively and trendy, and the included breakfast was wonderful. I didn't buy any spa treatments, however I did use the spa room where you melt away in tranquility. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who likes a chic and minimalist look, together will high quality standards and service.	
Jun 22 2005	Nice hotel shame about the location	Stayed here at the special weekend rate in a standard double room which was spacious with a nice size bathroom. The decor is minimalist verging on dull. There was a comfortable king size bed &amp; seating area. Used the gym which was very good for a hotel with a cardiovascular section &amp; weights in a separate room. The continental options for breakfast were very good with range of fresh juices, fruit , yoghurt, cereals &amp; toast. The cooked breakfast wasn't so great. There is a pleasant bar downstairs which did get a bit rowdy after midnight. The location is not good at all, very near Shepherds Bush Green-even though it's only minutes from the Central Line, I didn't feel that safe walking around.	
May 4 2005	Very Nice Hotel Location not great	I have given this hotel a 3 star rating. I loved the design and our room was fantastic. We were also able to book in at 10am instead of 2pm so we had somewhere to leave our bags. In my opinion you will either Love or Hate this hotel. You will either find things tacky or cutting edge in design.The location is not great however it is still only 2 mins walk from the tube.I would probably not go and visit again but only becaue of the location.	
Apr 25 2005	Enjoyed our stay Nice hotel	Stayed at the k west for 3 nights. The outside looks ok, very nice in the dark, has lights that change colour through the class. Very impressive. Although it is in a strange location, in the middle of a sort of housing estate, its not that hard to find. It is 5mins walk from shepherds bush tube station which is on the central line and easy to get into central london. The room was a nice size, something that i noticed was that the hotel and the room was very very clean. Clean bathroom, clean sheets on the beds.I was however a little disspointed with the size of the tele! It says on there website a widescreen tv, its hardly a widescreen tv, its about a 14-16inch one. Overall, a nice hotel but nothing special.	
Apr 18 2005	Wicked Trendy Hotel	Stayed at the K-West, very lovely and trendy Hotel, pleasant staff, stunning rooms. You must try the K-West Burger its delightful..!	
Mar 31 2005	Highly overpriced rundown hotel with bad location.	I recently came home from a three day disappointing stay at K West. London was great, but the hotel was a downer. Based on my experience I will advise the reader to consider it twice before you book. I booked the room through internet, mostly because of the stars (4) and because of the photos of the hotel, however compared with other hotels I can hardly believe that K West is more than a 2 and half star hotel, at highest three. If you go to London for just a few days the location is far from ideal. - You will have to use taxi, bus or the tube to come to major attractions or to the centre (The tube is a 5 min. walk from the hotel, but it takes approx. 20 minutes to get to the centre and 45 min. by bus). Add to this, that the hotel is located in a rather grey and boring neighborhood. Yes, there is a mall there, but nothing of interest for tourists or even locals;-) Our hotel room had view to a fabric or some kind of office building. I had a very strong feeling of living in a fabric area in middle of nowhere. The rooms:We stayed in an executive suit. There is nothing special with these rooms (the style was fancy some years ago, but now it is mostly worn down and looks a bit shabby). It doesnt seem like they have done anything with the rooms since they opened. The madras was very hard and uncomfortable, compared with other hotels I have stayed at in Europe and USA. If you still thinking about booking a room at K West I strongly advise you to NOT book a family room, or a room for three (The extra madras is more like torture instrument than a madras, not even children can sleep on this kind of madras).The bathroom was a little bit better, but not clean. The roof in the bathroom seemed like it was on its way down, but all in all it was worn down.The staff:Seems ineffective, or to be a bit kind, maybe they had too much to do? Most of them were friendly, but we had some really unpleasant experiences while checking out. - The staff had wrongly added a huge phone bill on my room, and I had to put much efford into convincing them that it was not my phone bill. This was a very upsetting experience and the receptionist was acting rude and unprofessional (I even had to check the phone number on the internet myself to prove for them that the phone call was made by themselves). Even after that they had understood that it was their own phone call, the receptionist was to proud make any real apology.Spa:I was not able to use it because it closes before 20.00 (also the gym close early). If you travel with teenager or children you should be aware that children under 18 are not allowed inside the spa.Breakfast: Chaotic experience, but friendly staff. We had to wait for a half hour to get some toast the first day. However, if you only order muffins and croissants etc. it goes smoothly K Lounge: I didn't use the bar or the restaurant at K, but that was the only part of the hotel that looked fancy and stylishConclusion: Highly overpriced rundown hotel, with bad location. My advice: Stay away, you can do much better for the same price in London!	
Mar 30 2005	K West Hotel+Spa - our view	Read all posts here and booked for K West for 2 nights over Easter. We paid £82 per night for a standard room which was a good size, had a great bed/bathroom and was well designed. We had room 506 which overlooked the garden - pretty quiet although you may be able to hear noisy people in the corridors like we did on one occasion at 2am! The reception is on level 3 and the spa on level 1 and gym on 2 so try to get a room well away from all this i.e. room number &gt; 499.Key card system for rooms/gym etc seems a bit hit and miss whether it works or not. On the morning we were due to check out we went to breakfast and found we had had our keycards deactivated prematurely - a bit annoying.Breakfast - continental style one taken in lounge reception area - at times this is chaotic but coffee/pastries/juice all of very good quality. I quite liked the setup but I think older people might not ;-)Staff - checkin and reception not bad but not quick either. Staff generally quite young but helpful/happy enough even when they could not find our booking on arrival (hotelpronto was the booking agent).Spa + gyms - well equipped and felt quite luxurious, particularly as we thought the hotel wasn't too expensive (food IS though). Gym has rowers, bikes, steppers and small free wieghts/machine weights area. Spa reception staff very helpful/polite. Jacuzzi not working because of high chlorine levels - I went in for 5 mins anyway and was fine. Sauna and steam room too. Again nice contemporary decor. Treatments start at about £40 to about £70 for say a 55 min massage. Some more expensive 'packages' available e.g. facials, wraps etc.Neighboorhood - 2 min walk from Shepherds bush tube (Central line zone2 which was fine) and a complex of fast(ish) food places/cinema/local shops. The area here is a bit grotty but walk the other way i.e. turn left out of K West and its progessively nice to the point where after 15 mins you are at Holland Park which is swanky. Women might be a little intimidated walking round at night on their own but this is definately not that bad an area.Overall - for what we paid I would recommend the place and stay again. For the price - you can stay in some quite tired places but this was modern and upbeat with good facilities. This place added nicely to our 3 day stay in London.	
Mar 30 2005	laptop stolen	The hotel it self is good compared to other hotels in london. You pay for it though, as it is one of the mroe expensive ones there. You can get a good rate on a few internet booking sites though. I had checked my laptop bag into the hotel and received a claim ticket. Upon return to claim it, the bag had been stolen. They had given my bag to someone else. Police were called and the issue is currently under investigation along with a lawsuit that will be drawn up. My laptop was stolen, along with an MP3 player, a book and various other things that were in the case. Beware of the safety of your items!!	
Mar 21 2005	Hip Hotel!	I had read good and bad things about this hotel but can honestly say me and my friends were happy with it. Upon arrival we were greeted by a busy reception, the reception is in the same hall as the K-Lounge bar. There are 3 receptionists there were all busy but we were dealt with reasonably quick. As I had booked quite a large party they kindly upgraded my room to the Embassy Suite which I was over the moon about.The room itself was a good size, check out the details on their website. The bathroom was the best with the Aveda products in there and the trendy fittings. Only strange thing was the glass practically see through door which is a bit embarressing if you are sharing a room with a mate rather than a partner!The spa is quite small, has a jacuzzi, 2 steam rooms and a sauna. It's not all that but was ok for us just to pop in. We didn't have any treatments due to not having enough time. There is a resturant called the Kanteen but we eat out in the evening, I had a nose though and it looked very smart. We didn't return to the hotel till the early hours but the bar was still buzzing with people, it's a very young, hip kind of hotel. We only had the continental brekkie the following morning which was quite a casual affair - pastries, toast croissents etc but was fine.All in all I thought the hotel was good and would recommend it and stay again. The staff were pretty attentive and may come across a bit blunt being all foreign but were actually on the ball.	
Mar 15 2005	Chic hotel	We stayed at the K West in April 2004. The hotel is very chic and modern. The rooms are very roomy and bathroom was surprisingly big. The bathtub had a trackless door, which I thought was a nice touch. When speaking to other travelers in London, we felt quite lucky to be staying at the KWest as the other hotel rooms in London were tiny and the bathrooms were dingy. Since the KWest is fairly new, everything was clean.The staff at the KWest in general were nice. Be aware if you order a bucket of ice, they will charge you 2 GBP. I was quite shocked when I got the bill. Also, any calls made local or international (even with phone card) will be charged to your room. Basically, everytime you dial your phone, you will be charged a fee. If you have a phone card, I suggest you use a pay phone outside instead. The KWest had a bar which we ended up going to practically every night. They played lounge music and it was a &quot;chill&quot; type of atmosphere. I saw some locals coming to have some drinks. It's a nice crowd. If you decide to eat there, try the grilled chicken panini...it was great!They also have 2 computers with internet connection (free of charge), which we often used when we booked trips to the outskirts. The only negative thing I have to say about the KWest is their location. Located at Shepherd's Bush, it was not within walking distance to the attractions. We ended up taking the tube everywhere. We did, however, get accustomed to the tube by our 2nd day. Their rail system is excellent. Their trains are color coded and they are very clean. We felt very comfortable taking the trains at night however, walking back to the hotel was quite scary. I wouldnt advise that to anyone who's going alone. We are going back to London April 2005 and we decided to stay at the Royal Garden Hotel instead since we want to be closer to the attractions.	
Mar 13 2005	First impressions last	When you see the place, you think there has been some terrible mistake. It's an ugly building at the end of a residential road. Once you go through the doors, it's painfully chic. Very nice. Very swish, a lot of people wearing fancy french loafers and having important coversations in public places (probably media PAs). Rooms are big, restful. Bathrooms are very nice. Avoid breakfast unless you pay for it upstairs (£££). The 'continental' breakfast is served in the bar and is difficult to eat as tables are low, unless you want to try and look cool and just pick at it. It consists of croissant and cakes. Personally, I need a good start to the day so I gave it a miss. A bit out of town too, but the price fairly reflects this. I got the impression that the staff were used to dealing with media types (the trying variety) and they had been broken down by their sass and attitude. I felt sorry for them. They were crushed and I doubt anyone works there for a long time. It reflects in the service. It lacks a heart.	
Feb 24 2005	From 4.5 stars to 2	I stayed here 3 years ago--the place was recommended by a friend who works at the BBC. They had just done a major facelift and everything was bright and shiny and new and I had a great time--my only quibble was the annoying glass half-door in the shower that allowed the bathroom to be flooded. When I paid the K West a return visit earlier this month I was sorry to see that it had not aged gracefully. The bathroom could have been cleaner--it looked like there was residue from someone's toothbrushing spray left on the rough tumbled stone tiles above the sink and housekeeping had missed a few odds and ends on the nubby weave of the carpet. I couldn't help noticing that the previously clear sealant on the tub surround had turned yellow and a strip of veneer had peeled away from the bathtub cladding and was drooping onto the floor, no doubt because of the moisture control issues in there. Also, the knob for one of the headboard-mounted reading lamps was missing and the whole unit was sliding around scratching the finish. This may sound really nitpicky but when you market yourself as a design hotel and choose this kind of high-maintenance design scheme, when it isn't immaculate, it just looks shabby. The lobby area and bar did look good, however. The service was generally good but has become uneven (staff members from North America were the best, not surprisingly. The concept of customer service is still pretty different on the other side of the Atlantic, and not just in hotels and restaurants--get used to it!) There was a big event in the hotel the night I arrived, for the Brit Awards, I think, which may explain why I had to hunt down my room service breakfast the next day and why I had to call 3 times before I got an iron that worked, but hotels are supposed to be able to handle these things and not offer a bunch of excuses. I should say that everyone was polite and did try to be helpful and I wasn't charged for that breakfast which was yummy once it arrived, and the spa is quite nice though I had a lot of business and didn't have the time for it. I don't have a problem with the neighborhood--boho-chic Notting Hill has its rough edges too, and I'd rather walk down Bush Green than All Saint's Road at midnight for sure! And it's really not far away from Central London--a fifteen-minute tube ride at most, and nearby Holland Park has lots of interesting shops and restaurants. All in all, I wouldn't steer someone away from the K West--it's still a good deal for the money, but I would no longer enthusiastically recommend it either. If you do go, get an even-numbered room on one of the top two floors--the views are definitely better.	
Feb 8 2005	Very Chic great experience	I loved this hotel. We stayed here after Wimbledon was over and just loved it. The rooms were great and the hotel was quite hip and happening. The front desk staff is a little too full of themselves though, as if they were the reason we were coming to be there and ready to ask for their autographs. But when you get past that, for the money it was the best. Also, it's a bit out of the way as well, when the cabbie was taking us there, after a while we thought we were being kidnapped! But as a place to stay in its category and price range, it's great. 	
Jan 24 2005	Definitely not about to return	With all the hype, I had expected something quite different from this hotel.The room (single) was of clostrophobic dimensions, very averagely furnished, and located directly on street level with a view on a dark alley (i.e. not possible to open windows).As the Spa was on the same floor, there was a stench of humidity in the air, as well as moisture stains all over the (endlessly long) hallways.The personnel came across as bored and unconcerned.The whole place appeared in serious need of renovation.Gave me the creeps - just wanted to get out as fast as possible in the morning (and Shepherds Bush is not exactly the place you want to hang out in London...)	
Jan 3 2005	OK Room Terrible Service	Room was OK, clean lines but this expected given the styling.Stayed for 2 nights, had to be moved on the 1st evening due to 'rodent type' noises from above the room. Hotel staff claim this was rain - there is no doubt the noises we not that of trickling water !!Terrible service from all staff in particular the duty manager, would not recommend going to a friend or colleague.Location was OK if you accept a bus (£4), taxi (£20) or tube (£5) return journey to Picadilly Circus.Initial impressions of hotel are poor - external styling could do with a make over.	
Dec 16 2004	Loved it!	First off, here are directions to this hotel from the SHEPHARD'S BUSH TUBE STOP: As you exit the tube station turn right and cross the street. There's a shopping mall right in front of you. Turn left at the front of the mall. You'll see a ramp on your right just after the pub-head down that ramp. The road splits--stay to the right and walk down the street. You'll see the hotel in the left-hand side.I loved this hotel. It was very convenient to all the tube lines. The shopping mall has a grocery store inside, movie theatre and restaurants all at your front steps. The shower was awesome and I loved the bed...very comfy. The only complaint I have is that there wasn't an alarm clock in my room and when ever my husband tried to call me from the United States, he got their voicemail. I definitely recommend this hotel. Oh yea, and the neighborhood wasn't at all sketchy as some other reviewers have stated. LONDON ROCKS!	
Nov 25 2004	Good Rooms	Looking for a great room, this is the place, as previously highlighted, very strange on the eye when you pull up but when you walk in you know you are at the right place....reception was slow, would have walked away if I had just walked off the street looking for a room, nothing wrong with the staff just very slow, the general feel of the hotel was good, didn't go to the Spa but felt it should have been bigger because of the hype, anyway all in all to crash in a bed for the night in a good room this was great, if I was stuck there though not sure it would have been as good, breakfast was as also described in other reviews, chaos...needs a better system. Hopefully this has changed now as I stayed there a few months back. Worth a visit but get out and about don't book it thinking you will want to stay in the hotel for two days.	
Nov 15 2004	OK Fun Bar but overall disappointed	Stayed with friends weekend Nov 13th. Very mixed feelings about the stay. Anytime spent in the bar was fun, with fairly good service and a great atmosphere; rock stars milling around which made a good buzzy atmosphere. Rooms were average - design was ok but nothing special - typical clean lines of modern 'trendy' hotel. The room was badly designed eg no mirrors, hardly any sockets, lighting poor.We ordered room service breakfast and it arrived wrong twice - after complaining we didnt pay, but ruined our relaxed morning.Spa was biggest disappointment - corridor was dirty with floor and walls in disrepair, showers were dirty, steam room had such noisy machinery that it was impossible to relax. Sauna was good, as was jacuzzi but not as good as my local gym!We got a deal on the room but drinks and food were very very expensive.I wouldn't rush back except for convenient location and unless I got a very good deal - dont have any great expectations of wonderful design, service or 'spa'.	
Nov 7 2004	staff r terrible	Hiya, went for a lovely weekend away but all i got from this hotel was grief. Staff not helpful, especially the bar staff-wouldnt recommend-not worth the money-gutted and annoyed with this hotel, plus u dont even get shampoe-its stupid!!!	
Oct 28 2004	Light hearted fun in Shepherds Bush	Booked a deluxe room as surprise treat for my boyfriend. As it was midweek, we were only after a quiet evening, using their spa facilites and then retreating to our room with room service and dvd.Spa was very relaxing, you can wander straight down in lift in dressing gowns provided. I'm not a huge fan of jacuzzis but it was pleasantly decked out in dark mosaics and they have 2 great steam rooms, one lemon the other eucalyptus and a good sauna. We only saw 3 other people that evening. The bed was truly enormous, although I found their 'hypoallergenic' duvets quite lumpy and heavy. The TV was in quite a strange position, whereby it couldn't be watched comfortably from the bed or the sitting area. As we never got round to watching our dvd, it didn't prove to be a problem!We didn't bother with the bar or restaurant - it is all very formulaic in design and a touch on the clinical side. Room service - stick to the simple like burgers - my thai green curry was watery and a bit of waste of money at £16 and the fruit salad a seemed a little tired. But service was prompt and courteous.	
Oct 27 2004	Style triumphs over substance	Stayed at the hotel last week and wasn't as bowled over as I expected to be from some of the earlier reviews. It's nicely decked out in the usual designer style. The studio room was an adequate size with a nice, big bed. However, the desk staff (although perfectly friendly) were not that helpful and there was an air of boredom pervading reception. The location of the hotel is a little odd - whilst handy enough for central London with the Central line station pretty close - its at the end of a residental street which you reach through a kind of dodgy alleyway. Breakfast is terribly chic but ridiculously expensive. Although we had a perfectly fine stay here I wouldn't rate it as a top place to stay in London. Stay at MyHotel in Bloomsbury instead.	
Oct 26 2004	very modern hotel	my saturday night stay here was a great present from by sister for me and my boyfriend. we had the hideaway pakage inc,duluxe room with widescreen tv, dvd player, cd player and playstation.well we checked in at 2pm only to find that the playstations we're all out and we couldnt have one although we had booked it, there was a very small selection of dvds and cds too choose from its ok if your a big fan of 007 they had loads of them. I was very impresed by the decor, all along the corridor there are small tv screens in the walls, and there is free internet access in a nice quiet area.The room was great, extreamly big bed and the room was very clean. the jacuzzi and saunas very good although there wasnt much space and there was a lot of people. We ordered a full english breakfast in bed and it was amazing a lot more than we we're expecting. All in all it was a lovely stay, the staff are all very plesent and the price was nothing out of the ordinary, i would definatly visit again.	
Oct 18 2004	Disappointed	After having such a good weekend in London it seems a shame that the only thing to spoil it was having the feeling that someones trying to rip you off. And that's how I felt during my stay at K-West. It started when we got in the room and browsed the breakfast menu £20 for a full English. Top tip, there is a great little cafe just down the road that has a great little menu. I then made my way to the bar and ordered a beer. A 10% service charge was added to the price of the drink. I don't mind tipping bar staff, but not for every drink. When I queried this, the barman told me that if I didn't pay the service it would be taken out of his wages. It worked out that it was actually cheaper to drink from the mini bar than go down to the bar, which incidently was closed one day for a private party.The room itself was very nice indeed. It certainly was a deluxe king size, with a bed big enough for four of five people. It's just a shame that the cleaning staff neglected to clean it properly. As for the spa, it was nice to a point. It's great if there is just a few of you in there, but once the numbers get up past 8, the place feels a little crowded. On the whole I would say that they could do better, though the location was ideal for our purposes.	
Oct 5 2004	BAD Experience. Unprofessional messy hotel. Avoid at all cost.	My partner and I stayed at the K West on 1st &amp; 2nd Oct 04. I was meant to be a surprise weekend for my partner's birthday. I want to give my partner a relaxed weekend, so I chose K West due to the spa. Instead of destressing ourselves, the hotel staff did their best to stress us out.I emailed the hotel prior arrival confirming the reservation, requesting non-smoking room, etc. The email I got back from them was saying I've booked an entry level room and I can upgrade the room to deluxe for £30+VAT per night. I replied and rejected the offer as I thought a standard room would be sufficient. On the day of arrival. My partner and I stood in front to the check-in desk to fill in the form. The receptionist asked if I want to upgrade the room for £30. I was put off by it as I felt that they're so keen to sell you upgrades all the time. Also, I've mentioned it's a surprise weekend for my partner, I don't think it's appropriate to ask such question in front of my partner.The standard room was ok apart from a bit dark. The room amenities were a bit on the stingy side. No shower gel in the bathroom. So I called reception (I had to wait for about 2 mins before somebody picked up the phone) to request some shower gel and disposable slippers. The receptionist told me the slippers are £2 each. So I said I don't want them.I complained to the duty manager Meena saying I wasn't impressed by the receptionist checking us in asking if we wanted to upgrade, and the cost of slippers. She didn't sound all that interested and &quot;lectured&quot; me that all London hotels do the same. Apparently K West has this policy they have to ask every single person who check in if they want to upgrade, etc. All London hotel has that policy?! THAT IS NOT THE CASE MEENA!!! I stayed at other London hip hotels many many times over the years, including Sanderson, St Martins Lane, MyHotel and many other London 4 &amp; 5 star hotels. Never once been asked that. Furthermore, I worked for Sheraton, Holiday Inn and Thistle Hotels. It's never a policy to ask every single guest on check-in if they want to upgrade.The room included continental breakfast. It's a complete chaos. There are about 8 tables and 3 staff to serve all the guests who is having continental breakfast. It's a self-service type and most of the time you have to clean your own table (if you're lucky enough to even get a filthy table). Also, just one person smokes will fill the who area with cigarette smell. Very off putting.I asked for a late check out at the reception. The receptionist told me they'll charge £10 per hour after 12pm if I want to check out after that. This hotel is incredible, all they care is how to get more money in an unprofessional manner. I'm sure all business want more money from their customers, but surely there are more subtle ways to achieving and not having to put people off.The spa on the other hand is good. Clean and well maintained. K West has definitely spoiled my weekend. Avoid at all cost.	
Oct 1 2004	Modern  a nice hotel	Great 4-night stay here recently. Interior is very impressive with clean modern lines. Bar is nice, but could use a couple of draught beers. Didn't eat at the restaurant or use the spa, though the cardio and resistance rooms looked nice. Good selection of pastries, fruits, &amp; cereals for breakfast, as well as a friendly and accomodating staff. Standard double room was very nice...plenty of space, nice bathroom, &amp; comfy bed. My only complaint is that our room was near the back of the hotel, which was a very long walk down the corridor and overlooked the train tracks. Train noise was not really a problem, though. Great convenient location near Shepherd's Bush Tube Station in a quiet neighborhood. Very reasonable price for what you get, especially in London. I would definitely stay here agian!	
Sep 8 2004	great design shame about the.....	If you're one of these people, maybe even a couple who prefer design hotels when looking for somewhere to stay then the K-west will not disappoint you. However, the spa will.My girlfriend and I very much enjoy 'working out' in gyms to then head off to the spa or steam room to 'relax' then off to the room to drink wine, eat olives read magazines or a book and just generally enjoy the hotel. Why bother paying a small fortune for a room to only then spend most of your time away from it? The spa was a bit of a let down. The CV room was tiny so one felt closed in. The resistance room was next door so you had leave the CV room to find it, which was odd but it was ok. The Thistle Hotel in New Hall had better spa facilities even if they don't advertise it as much as the K-west ( see our review ) Anyhow, The k west is extremely well designed and has the proverbial 'wow factor'. Our first impressions were a bit muted as the hotel doesn't particularly look much from the outside but the interior is very sharp. The corridors leading you to your room are superb and there is a smell of vanilla in the air. The rooms were a good size and again, excellent in design. Our bed was huuuge!! We stayed just the one night and had breakfast included and this is where my main complaint is. It was a free for all. It seems that everybody had breakfast included in their room price and it also seemed that everyone went for the 'last one down to beakfast' routine because it was manic. And to top it off, not only could you get a seat ( we just marched upstairs to the restaurant area and gave them our best 'dont even try and stop us sitting down' look...which worked. You can't stand up and eat!! ) but I was unimpressed with the mayhem downstairs. Guests were spilling coffee everywhere and it looked really quite messy. To top it off, there was a lady downstairs sat with her family, amid the army of guests, smoking!!!! Her 3 year old granchild was sat opposite!! Ooh it made me mad. STOP THE SMOKING IN FOOD AREAS GUYS!!!!Anyway, if you're after a trendy looking interior in London at a fairly affordable price ( last minute.com ) then its ok. Its near enough to a tube line and seems quite safe at night. Taxis are plentiful. parking is pricey. Ps: One final moan is that when we arrived, the 5 reception staff must have just gone on strike as they left one of their colleagues to check in the 10 of us that stood waiting. Not good enough!! eventually one then two of them stopped what they were doing and resumed checking in. No apologies and not even a &quot;sorry, i'll be with you in a minute&quot;. Poor reception guys!! there were however, plenty of other staff around who did say hello at every opportunity. See, its the simple things we want MR HOTEL OWNER!! would we go again? probably not because of the spa. Otherwise it's alright.	
Aug 1 2004	Modern arty and great for romantic weekends!	Hubby booked us in for a wedding anniversary which coincided with their Valentine's romance package. Despite the concrete facade, it was lovely on the inside and the bedroom was huge and dressed like it was ready for a homestyle magazine shoot! Lovely modern colours, styling and artwork.The clincher was the balloons in the bath, the heart sequins all over the bed and floor, and the free 'kneetrembler' cocktail at the bar. All in all, it was wonderful!	
Jul 11 2004	Nice Hotel	The hotel was nice, it was in a neighborhood that there was not a whole lot to do, so you will need to take the tube everywhere. The room was nice and spacious, my only real complaint about the room was that the air did not work very well. The Kanteen restaurant was way over priced, we ate there only once for breakfast and it was 19 pounds a person, a total rip off. We ate at the McDonalds and some Starbucks for breakfast, don't pay for the hotel breakfast! I would stay again it was a good value, just don't eat at the restaurant	
Jul 10 2004	Stylish modern rooms with great deals available	There are great rates to be had at this hotel through various online booking sites, and the property is definitely above average - much nicer than other London hotels offering comparable prices. Very modern, it even has small LCD TVs in the hallways playing BBC News! It's in a quiet location, but very convenient for the tube as well as the Kensington High Street shops. Rooms are fairly spacious by European standards, very nicely outfitted, and the magazines and hipster-oriented local guide provided in each room are a nice touch.	
May 23 2004	Nice Rooms	I styed at the K West during the last weekend in April 2003 in a hen night. The bookings were all handled by a friend and I believe we got a good rate of about 99.00 GBP but, I would not stay here again as it was a little far from the action for me. There are better more central hotels at cheaper rates, but for now I will review this hotel. The building itself is a concrete box and I now know why there were no pictures of the frontage on the website. The reception area blends in with the bar area and I though it was very bare and cold. Luckily the rooms made up for the lack of warmth to the reception. The bathrooms were decorated beautifully and were very, very clean and spacious. The decor in the room it self was very modern and neutral. You won't get a bigger room in london for the money. The tube was a two minute walk away and there was a wetherspoons around the corner by the traffic lights which served a very good value full english breakfast at 2.99 GBP. Overall a good hotel, with nice rooms, but too far away from the west end for me.	
May 15 2004	Awful from the outside great on the inside	A shockingly bad looking hotel from the outside but great on the inside. Great interior design: good sized, clean rooms: helpful staff and very comfortable king sized beds (I had a studio room). Unfortunately I didn't have time to test their spa treatments which people seem to rave about but I did have a look in at their gym (once I'd managed to get hold an access card that worked). Open from 06.45am until 9.45pm, it was clean and there weren't too many people, so no waiting for the machines. The only thing I found disappointing was the continental breakfast which was rather overpriced for a Starbucks style start to the day. Liked the idea that guests could help themselves to fruit from the bar anytime though.In summary, an out of centre hotel within easy access of central London and well worth a visit. I would definitely return to K West!	
May 4 2004	Trendy and not overpriced	A trendy, new design hotel for the young (at heart). Good value for money, which is probably due to the location. A bit off the beaten path, which can be nice too. The hotel is on a small and hidden street, therefore very quiet. The spa is disappointing though. Very small and unfortunately not very clean. 	
Apr 18 2004	Great Hotel	My family and I stayed at the Kwest in late March. Our rooms were clean and roomy for Europe and the spa treatments were very relaxing.We also thought the food in the Canteen and room service was also very good. The staff are friendly and accomodating and worked hard to please us.	
Apr 8 2004	Dont believe the hype - except for K Spa	Oh dear. K west - stuck out in the hinter land of Shepherds Bush needs to be special to make up for it's poor location. However based on my experience this is not the case. Lets face facts - this is no five star hotel. Okay so it is trying to be hip and trendy but that is no excuse for basement rooms that have &quot;views&quot; of a path outside and staff that are over stretched and poorly trained. The rooms are okay for the price. The bar is nice - a few BBC types can be spotted here. The Kanteen is a joke - small, noisy and not a place to spend a romantic evening. But lets leave with a positive - the K Spa is superb. I had the Hot Stones treatment and it has to be the best massage I have ever had. Fantastic staff and great therapies. For this element alone its worth staying here. In conclusion a avaerage hotel with one exceptional element - just dont think you are going to get a 5 star experiance.mra	
Apr 3 2004	great hotel	I thought the staff was very helpful. The rooms were clean and the bathroom was big. The tube station was a block away and the airport bus can be picked up at the Kensington Hilton, which is about 3 blocks away. The area wasn't bad. It's a working class neighborhood, which I felt safe in. There's a little shopping mall which you can get groceries and pharmacy things in.	
Jan 9 2004	Good undiscovered gem	I have stayed at K West a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed my time. The staff are nice, the rooms are comfortable although the views are not so good. The approach to the hotel - some back roads - did make me wonder, but once i got inside, all my worries vanished.I have stayed in standard and a delux room and have also had a peak at the suits - which are WOW.They have just refurbished the restaurant so have not eatent here recently, but in previous times have and thought it lovely. I did a get a bit upset once as I had paid for a continental breakfast and had a piece of toast and some juice and then left the dining room. As I walked out I saw someone I knew so went back in to have a coffee with them and they wanted to charge me the whole cost again!The hotel is located just off Shepherds Bush which is handy for the tube, not far from Hammersmith if you are coming in on the Picadilly line from Heathrow, good bus links and also near to Kensington Olympia which is a main line station.They are regularly used by local companies who are based in the area - think big media/television companies - and they put their guests up at K West, so you may be lucky and see someone you know.I like the bar. Its small, has comfy sofas, a lovely fireplace but the prices are a bit high.All in all, if you want somewhere different, then try K West. It is certainly somewhere that I recommend. Its not so chic it hurts, but it has some twists. The rooms are good sizes, but the views poor. The food was good, the bar good but a bit pricey. It has a lovely spa but no pool. Also has free internet from the communal area.	
Dec 29 2003	Great Room	Earlier this month I spent 5 nights at K West. I had booked a standard room at the best web price I could find, then upgraded to a deluxe for a very reasonable charge All together I paid just over 100 pounds for a large room with very comfortable king bed, large stylish bath, suede sofa, wide screen TV, DVD, and CD, desk, safe, and excellent amentities. For the price, this is by far the best room I have ever had in London. The exercise facilities are excellent for any hotel. They try to make evrything stylish from the staff (sometimes too stylish) to the spa. On the downside, my room (and most, I think, that face north) looked out onto an alley. You might try a south facing room if available. I also asked to see a standard room. They are much smaller but have full size beds and similar appointments and amenities. I like the location in a residential neighborhood. It's an easy walk to Kensington, Holland Park, and Notting Hill. Friends who live nearby were unaware of K West and will be recommending it to other visitors.	
Oct 30 2003	Perfect Vacation at K West	K West is just off the London map in Shepherds Bush. The bus and tube are steps away. The hotel is modern and chic and the help courteous and my family found them friendly. This is a very nice place and would surely command much more per night if more centrally located. Attracts artistic crowd. During our stay we met models, buinessmen, and a rock band that was very big in the early 80's. And my party was a 3 generation family vacation. So, they cater comfortably to all. Has a beautiful spa/gym, and delicious restaurant. Used to be the BBC building in the 60's. Highly recommended if you don't mind using the bus or tube to get to town.	
Oct 23 2003	Hidden gem	I loved the K West it's hip and funky and the staff were very pleasant. It's near the Shepard's Bush tube and definietly not in Notting Hill - but I liked the neighborhood - for once in London I didn't have to feel like a tourist. It's located in a residential neighborhood with stores nearby. The shower did run all over the floor - poor design - but I'd definitely stay again.	
Oct 1 2003	Nice Hotel Comfortable Roomes So-So Location	K-West has a nice flare to it - very modern interior. The rooms are comfortable and clean. They even provided large umbrellas for guest to carry in the rain.The only disadvantage that this hotel had, in my opinion, was the location. It is not centrally located, but does have close access to the Tube - Central Line (about a 2-3 block walk). For the price (I got a room for $130/night including taxes) it was a great deal.	
Aug 20 2003	Quite nice...	I stayed at the K West for a night (Aug 3-4) and I thought it was very nice. The location could have been better but I rather liked the fact that it was hidden away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Almost like a jewel in the crown. The lady at reception could have been a little friendlier :-) but the room made up for it.We stayed in the deluxe room with the KING bed...I liked the CD Player/DVD Player that came with the room. Great sound...and the bed...wow...it was like sleeping on a cloud.My issue was with the bathroom door...I mean it was nice and all...but what's with the door? If someone was sitting on the couch, they could see right into the bathroom...the shower door wasn't frosted either...so that got a little tricky.I had a great experience there...it cost me 129.00GBP plus taxes...not bad for a four star hotel...I didn't take advantage of the SPA facilities that came with the room...but that's ok.Next time I go to London and I need a quiet, relaxing time...I will definitely check out the K West again. The CD Player and bed are definitely a good thing when looking for romance on a vacation.Enjoy...hope the review helped	
May 27 2003	okay but in the dead zone	My husband and I stayed at the K West in early May. We had the deluxe room which has a comfy king size bed with nice fluffy duvet. There was also a small kitchenette (fridge/oven/sink/kettle) in the room. The bathroom was nice but the shower had only a half glass door which was awkward as we were afraid we'd soak the whole room from the shower spray. Poor design. The room was quiet. There is a bar downstairs that is kinda sad and there is pretty much no breakfast available from room service although we did see some empty trays with cornflakes left behind. Food from room service is good however. There is a nice spa that you can use for free with a good jacuzzi and steam rooms. There is nothing to do in the area by the hotel and the neighborhood around the hotel is kinda grim. When walking at night we thought we were gonna get mugged by a shady dude hanging out on a nearby bridge. Remember, we are very city savvy New Yorkers. The Shepards Bush Tube is very nearby and it is easy to get a nightbus back from the center of London although if you stay out late lots you are better off booking a hotel in the middle of the city. We found the staff to be very helpful and polite. If you don't mind being out in the dead zone of London, KWest is a good cheap option.	
Apr 29 2003	Worst hotel experience ever!!!	I stayed at this hotel in February 2003 and it was the worst experience I have ever had as a frequent traveler. I rented a mobile phone during my stay and left it with the front desk to be picked up by the mobile phone company. The phone was missing when the package was picked up by the courier (plastic lock broken). Subsequent investigations were met with arrogance by the hotel, from the front desk manager, Joanna Walker, all the way up to the General Manager, Steven Kyjak-Lane. I found the hotel on the web advertised as Kensington/Notting Hill, which are two exclusive areas of London. It was actually West Kensington, a rough, dark &amp; seedy neighborhood. The rooms are comfortable but after having to pay for their dishonesty and putting up with the terrible service, I would never stay there or at any other kwest hotel again.
