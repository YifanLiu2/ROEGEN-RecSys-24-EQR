	Great value smart clean modern hotel	I have now stayed at this hotel twice in the last month and have stayed at other Shaftesbury hotels in the area this year. Having spent most of my business travel staying in big top hotels outside of London this year I am a little spoilt. Finding a decent hotel for a decent price in London is hard work and this company have hit the right note with a fair mix of cheap rooms (for London) with smart, fashionable, modern, clean rooms. This hotel is in a great location very close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate tubes and handy for the bright lights of the west end and the parks. For the money you will have to relinquish any thought of large spacious rooms, they are a little on the tight side but as I am travelling alone and do not normally spend much time in the room this was not a problem for me. The rooms are modern, well kitted (tea, coffee, complimentary biscuits, an iron which is great for business travellers). Good television set and clean stylish bedding and free broadband (and its quick). The service is ok and far from the worst and again it is all reflected in the price (book via the Shaftesbury group website for great prices £75 for a deluxe double). The breakfast is fantastic for the money (the acid test for any in England is the sausages and bacon and they are good here and not the usual 'frozen' fair). There are a number of reviewers complaining of turning up with no room...check out the terms and conditions when booking as some prices do not guarantee a room at the hotel you have booked but you are then ferried to another of the groups hotels. There are about 10 in a 0.5 mile vacinity so not too far and they are all alike. I now use no other hotel chain when staying in London (and this is someone used to the Hiltons and Radissons of this world)	
	THE WORSE HOTEL EVER !!! DOn't stay there !	HORRIBLE HOTEL EVER !! NEVER EVER stay in this hotel again. We booked the 2 rooms at this hotel in early Nov 2009, got their confirmation for all. Then after about 15 hours on the plane, we were all no energy to do to anything else ! We got to the hotel for the first check-in, and they said NO rooms for us ! THIS WAS THE WORSE THING HAPPENED TO US : - We got STOLEN right inside the reception area of this hotel : the bag with 700 USD cash, one laptop, one digital-camera inside the bag . The bag was put beside the 2 laddies in our group, while the 2 men dealing with the check-in problem.The camera in the hotel recorded everything, but don't know for what reason COULD NOT find out who did this !! We did report this case to the police in London.- Final treatment that we got from this hotel was that they sent us to other hotel, and still charged us for the first day of this hotel that we had never had any chance to stay ?!	
Nov 24 2009 	great value for money consistent standard	I stay at this hotel regularly on business. Its great value for money given its central london and the rooms are a consistent good standard throughout - and I've stayed in lots of different rooms in this hotel!! The breakfast is very good. Main complaint is that its a bit of a rabbit warren and the lifts don't serve all the rooms and so sometimes you have to carry your case up and down stairs hunting for your room.	
Nov 21 2009 	Book based on price only there is no other recomendation	I have now stayed here 3 times, as I have been forced to by work. There is one positive thing in that the very, very small room are well decorated, and appointed.Otherwise expect poor service at check in, poor service at breakfast which isn't the best and difficulty in swinging a cat in your room.If I were booking this hotel I would do it as a single person onjy, and based on price.Also if you are fluent in polish or indian then you should be able to understand the staff.	
Nov 7 2009 	Warning do not stay in this hotel: bed bugs booking mix up rude staff dark and tiny rooms	This hotel had a clean flashy reception area and a small bar with the same decor. However once beyond this point the hotel turned into a maze of tiny corridors with a strange smell and brown carpets, similar to a retirement home. The doors were all held open by fire extinguishers, hoovers left permanently in corridors, tatty door frames, ripped carpets. DEFINITELY not a 4 star. We walked up many stairs to get to the 3rd floor as the lift only went to the lower floors and when we finally reached our room with our suitcases in tow we realized that we had been given a twin room instead of a double room. So back we returned down the stairs and informed the man behind the desk politely and in a clam manner about the mix up.Only to be met with a rude response. Basically we were told that the hotel is very popular and we were lucky to even have a room (I am not joking these were his words!). He also said that the hotel had tried to contact all the people that this had happened to but the numbers had not been working (which did not sound very believable) Finally he agreed to giving us a twin room the following day. We stayed in the double room that night and it was TINY! Pretty much only space for a double bed which was so small I was afraid to turn as I might knock my friend off!! There was also a narrow corridor beside the bathroom (which actually was a nice bathroom , but tiny if you bent down in the shower you could get stuck). The next day we were moved to a new room and luckily the previously mentioned staff member was not on and the people on duty were much more accommodating. The new room was bigger but still dark and dingy apart from the bathroom as mentioned before. HOWEVER............ it was in this room that I was bitten by BED BUGS. I did not realize that this had happened to me until I had returned home as the bites appeared then (they can appear up to 9 days later). I had to hoover my whole room, mattress, bed frame, suitcase, all of the furniture, wash and dry everything that I had with me at a high heat in case any of these critters had returned with me but I was very lucky that they hadn't because they are a nightmare to get rid of. The bites have still not healed and are very itchy and I cannot believe that untop of everything else this happened to me. It is so disgusting. This hotel is certainly not deserving of its four star status.I just don't understand it. Four stars hotels in Ireland are a pleasure to stay in: clean, luxurious, friendly staff. I cannot believe how this can be a 4 star unless the rating system is completely different in England? Do you have to stay in a 5 star to get a clean bed??? and this hotel has so many bad reviews how does it get away with it????	
Oct 17 2009 	Comfy clean and an amazing breakfast	I stayed for 5 days in what felt like a newly renovated room and found it to be very cozy and clean. There was a small kitchen facility complete with microwave ,Kettle &amp; fridge, a full sized iron &amp; ironing board. The bed was really really comfortable with lovely white bedsheets. The bathroom was very clean and had a bath and shower and was a good size. There was even in room internet access too. The only problem is I was given a basement room which had a slight 'basement smell' about it so had to leave the window open at night. Had I been given a room away from there I couldnt ask for anything better for the price.The breakfast was amazing. There was ham, cheeses, pastries, yoghurt, fruit, cereals, bread, and a gorgeous English full english. The best breakfast ever - totally delicious.Overall I had a perfect stay and would definately stay here again	
Oct 1 2009 	Pretty sure I got bedbug bites there... best to avoid I would say	I stayed here for five days with wife and daughter. The hotel room we were assigned seemed somewhat small (after some initial problems and rearrangement to get a room with a double and twin bed with the desk clerk, which was done quickly enough), though seemed clean enough. However, A few days following the return from my trip I started itching and realised (confirmed by my doctor) that I probably got bedbug bites, and my guess is they are from this hotel room: on three separate occasions we had found blood on the sheets, which we thought was an odd (if disgusting) oversight and asked them to change. However, I now realise that they were probably bites from our own bodies... Ugh! I must warn that I am yet not 100% sure of this, though it seems quite likely.The reception desk was almost always full of guests and the simplest request or question took a long time to answer, nor were the staff particularly receptive or accomodating. One particular incident drove my pregnant wife a bit nuts. We needed to change rooms halfway through our stay and were told to &quot;pass by&quot; the front desk to do so (so we thought it would be a technicality). The ordeal took an hour, and was far from pleasant, in which she spoke to three people (two did not seem to know quite what they were doing). She asked them to keep our room, but were asked to pay 1 1/2 the amount we had been paying for three days (they finally knocked the price down, but we still payed more). My wife also asked them, rather politely, if they could move a huge bouquet of flowers sitting right next to her on the reception desk because of the rather pungent smell, which was bothering her, and was told that she would get used to it, that &quot;it would pass&quot;... all in all, an unfortunate experience.Their breakfast was adequate. But the bug thing just killed it... and negative reviews here, which I mistakenly only looked up AFTER staying there, are confirmed wholeheartedly.	
Sep 28 2009 	Be warned	This hotel regularly overbooks and therefore ships people around London.Would you book Paddington if you ended staying in Edgeware? Not recommended. Staff were not at all sorry or helpful - try elsewhere	
Sep 27 2009 	Great for One Crowded for 2	Best Western Shaftesbury Paddington Court London 27 devonshire terrace. Becareful there are at least 3 other best westerns and shaftsbury hotels with similar names in the same area. This seems to be some kind of a combination of two hotel chains.I had room 211. we stayed for 4 nights (prepaid online) the room overlooked a big mechanical thing. on the bright side it had nobody overlooking us so we could keep the curtains open. The window opened, good thing because the room was so small that got really stuffy. The AC took along time to get the room comfortable. But then seemed to go artic and not turn off. In order for us to move around at night we had to close our suitcases and stand them up. Location of this hotel cant be beat! great access to paddington, hyde park, etc, First night we left an apple and an orange on the desk. The cleaning staff or somebody took the apple. Odd. good thing we locked our belongings in our suitcases during day. One of the pillows was feather. we are both allergic. we put it in the wardrobe and left a note asking cleaning staff to please leave it in the wardrobe when making up the room. they put it back in the bed. the next day we put it back in the closet and it disappeared. hotel breakfast was 11.95 if prebooked and 14.95 if not. we did not want to pay that and easily found several cafe's around the corner with breakfast for under 5 pounds. Paddington station was great for shops, cafes and the Mad Bishop and Bear has great food. The bathroom was small but perfectly formed. Nice products, ie: shower gel with ginger.Staff replaced towels even when we hung them up. The room was clean and didnt have any nasty bugs which I had heard was a problem in London.If you plan to spend alot of time in your room don't book this hotel. For a base in London it was great.THe hotel appears to have been recently renovated since the pictures seem to vary so much. The place I stayed in looked like the pictures taken by CBTBarcelona and asioto. The main bedroom portion of the room was 10' x 10'. Yes REALLY that small.We could rarely hear anyone else. Once in a while footsteps in the hall and on our last day someone tried to use the emergency exit at 6am and set off the alarm.	
Sep 25 2009 	Items Stolen From Room	Had jewellery stolen from the room while sightseeing. Had a lovely holiday until we stayed here. Very, very dissapointing as the last thing you would expect is to have precious personal items stolen from your room. Rooms are extremely small and had some sort of worms in the shower. Not recommended at all, rather have stayed at a bus stop.	
Sep 20 2009 	Good value in Central London	Stayed for one night following Coldplay gig at Wembley Stadium. Paid £97.75 inc. full english breakfast for two via Laterooms.com. Excellent base for both Wembley and Central London, Got upgraded to a suite across the road from the hotel - these rooms would be ideal for a longer stay as you also get kitchen facilities (e.g. sink, microwave and fridge). A double bed and a single, lovely new bathroom and a wide screen lcd tv. 7-8 mins walk to Paddington Station and plenty of places to eat locally. Would stay again, especially for Wembley which is around 25 mins on the tube.	
Sep 5 2009 	Good Deal	Last minute deal, cost me 59 a night in a single room booked via London Nights. Excellent, clean, tidy and in a quiet location. Bathroom was pokey but for the one night easy to live with. I would recommend this as if you are only looking for a comfy bed and clean surroundings you won't get much better for the price.	
Sep 1 2009 	Value for money on this occasion	I booked this via the hotel chain's own website but, beware -The dates kept clicking back and I was watching that, but then did not pay enough attention to the fact that the hotel kept changing back to the one at the top of the list. I wanted Notting Hill hotel, but ended up booking this one! I did not notice this until we were actually on the way, but we wanted the room for Notting Hill carnival and it was close enough for us so no great damage done.Location - Fantastic! short walk from Lancaster Gate tube (not far from Paddington Station either), opposite Hyde Park which you can walk across to get to Kensington High Street, Palace etc. Rooms - a little on the small side, and not helped by dark decor, but we booked a deluxe room and had a microwave and a fridge which were really handy. Decor and quality of furnishings good quality, fantastic tv, quality bathroom, although water pressure in our room not brilliant. I asked to see the room first to check it out, and staff fine about that.Value - far superior to Travelodge/Premier Inn type hotels and, on this occasion, we paid alot less and got a lovely breakfast included. Negatives - don't pay the £15 quoted for breakfast if it hasn't been included - loads of cheap cafes locally. Breakfast room bit small when hotel full. &quot;Fitness room&quot; is a bit of joke - 2 treadmills in a stifling hot converted basement room!! Forget it and go to Hyde Park! Would recommend if you are interested in excellent location, having a good room to sleep in and nice breakfast, but not really for you if like the whole hotel bar/gym/ldining experience.	
Aug 23 2009 	Never ever again !!!	I booked a weekend away with my partner to London and expected to stay at a hotel which wouldnt cause us not to enjoy ourselves. How wrong could I have been !! On arrival we were shown to a room which was so tiny i couldnt have swung a Gerbil around in it less alone a cat.The bed was fitted into a space where you couldnt get round it, the decor was drab and dreary and the bathroom was so small you couldnt turn around in it.There was no hot water in the evening and in the morning when we woke up the lights in the room ddnt work. After complainig three times we were moved to a larger room but it still wasnt great . If you want something with a bit of comfort DONT STAY HERE !!!!	
Jul 18 2009 	Good location average hotel	This hotel is in a great spot near Paddington station and while not spectacular, I've stayed in worse. Stayed with my small daughter - at first we were given a room right next to the lift (419 - avoid if you can) which was unbearably noisy and very small - I asked at the desk if we could change and the desk clerk was very accommodating (they all had the jaded look like this had happened 100 times). Bathroom was updated but small - anyone other than average size would very seriously be unable to fit in the shower. Room, including blankets, sheets and towels, could do with an overhaul. Overall, don't think I'd go back but considering the price we paid (105 pounds per night) I'm not complaining.	
Jul 10 2009 	A value for money hotel in london	We were given a tiny room at the basement of the opposite building of the main hotel. Trying to find our room in the hotel was a challenging task...it was like a maze!! And when you need to carry huge heavy luggages...it aint very pleasant...in the narrow corridor of the hotel. Glad to know the room was newly refurbished...and there was complimentary internet in the room(though we always have problems with the connection). The breakfast was so so...typical english bfast...but make sure you get there by 9.45am on weekday...else there's nothing much left to eat. The hotel staff was not very pleasant....in fact some were very arrogant. They should do something about their hospitality !	
Jul 9 2009 	Would def stay again	Stayed at Paddington Court Rooms for 2 nights recently and have to say I was very pleasantly surprised going by some of the reviews. We were given a club room and I have to say I have never seen such a big bed in my life! Nice 32&quot; plasma on the wall and all round general very good, clean facilities. Bar looked nice for quiet pre theatre type drink but didnt use it.Breakfast very good (once you get seated) and location is superb. 3 minutes walk to Paddington, 5-10 to Hyde Park. Would def stay here again when we go back to London	
Jul 1 2009 	Very small rooms and decor still needs updating..	For a four star hotel this is a bit poor... rooms are so small booked a superior double and was dissapointed. Kept banging my leg on the bed everytime went near the desk and the room was so dark with dark wood everywhere... if they insist in making us sleep in shoe boxes please decorate them lighly so we dont feel like were suffocating.. sadly this is not somewhere id stay again.	
Jun 17 2009 	an unfortuneate choice	We stayed in February in 2005 in a &quot;suite&quot;. The room was small and located in the basement. As a result there was no view, the room was chilly but managed to have black mould on the walls. There was a tiny shower stall in the bathroom and a light fixture held in place by wads of toilet paper. Our complaints fell on deaf ears. Later we were promised a free stay in a better room if booked within a year. In February 2006 we attempted to have that promise honored with no success. The hotel refused to honor the promise of the manager as he was no longer with the hotel. To compound matters, they appeared to have lost our proof of payment and billed my credit card. I was able to successfully prove we had paid and the charges were withdrawn without benefit of an apology from the hotel. A great location but the amenities, service and commitment to their customers is sadly lacking. It has been some time since we were there but the reviews indicate many of the same problems exist.	
Jun 14 2009 	Not a bad little hotel	We booked this hotel for a romantic stay in January '09. The reception staff were pleasant and we were given our room key. The room was very small (not much bigger than the double bed) but it was well furnished with quality furnishings. The bathroom was also quite small but, it, too, was fine. The hotel is reasonably well located a short distance from Paddington Station, with plenty of small local restaurants nearby. Breakfast was good. Overall, a decent hotel for the price.	
Jun 11 2009 	Right in centre of London	Right in the centre of London.. walking distance from Paddington station which is well connceted to Heathrow airport &amp; all small &amp; major stations in London/UK. For internation traveller this is nice place for dinning around &amp; for some shopping.But the hotel is little cozy (standard rooms) &amp; staff service are pretty normal. Food quality is ok &amp; you can enjoy this place if you have to travel multiple places in UK/London	
Jun 10 2009 	Rather Good Actually	I was expecting a little hell hole when I booked this hotel for a price of £67 for a double room including full English breakfast ( the hotel website offered better deals than the usual Lastminute , Expedia websites).The location was ok and quite central although you have to walk about a mile I think to get to the nearest Tube station (Paddington).The exterior was not very appealing so I thought well it's only for 1 night ... The receptionists and staff were all foreign and extremely hospitable and pleasant and as I arrived about 6 pm I got a free upgrade to a &quot;club room&quot;...It was a twin room and as I had booked a double the efficient housekeep quickly made up the room into a large double roomThe room was an ok size for London Hotels...( remember NY hotels are usually even smaller!) The room was clean, the linen clean and the flat-screen tv worked well. The complimentary food included an apple , orange and nice biscuits, tea, coffee, The fridge however did not work and the promised free 2 bottles of water were not there!The bathroom was reasonably clean too and quite spacious.The hotel has a small restaurant and bar which I didn't sample and has a gym too ( which I didn't visit).There was free high speed internet which I didn't use.The full English breakfast buffet also included a continental choice and of course the staff were friendly and helpful.Overall a very pleasant experience and super price...I would definitely stay at this hotel again!	
Jun 8 2009 	Quiet Area	Beautiful Hotel in a quiet and safe area. The hotel is spotless clean and reception staff are very helpful. We arrived at 10am and as it was too early to check in they looked after our bags. Room was big and bright with a huge plasma tv on the wall. Did not have breakfast in the hotel but saw a sign at reception saying it was £15 or £12 if you book it the day before. You can get a full English breakfast in any of the cafes around the corner for £3.50.About 5 - 10 minute walk from Paddington tube station. Can be a bit confusing making way back to hotel as there about about 3 different exits from the station.Would recommend for a nice quiet break but wished I had stayed more central.	
Jun 4 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	Stayed at the hotel, when i arrived early my room was ready. The rooms are pretty small but so is most things in London. The hotel is under renovations and i was lucky to get a renovated room (single), close to the elevators. if you are looking to stay in your room all day it might be too small, for someone who is mostly out , it was ok..It is very close to the Paddington station walking took me 5-10 minutes. My A/C did not work and some came up right away to fix, forgot to have iron/board in room which was brought right to me. the free internet was great. Be very careful of phone charges...I would stay here again when i return. Great price!!	
May 27 2009 	Convenient Location	Booked hotel on line and got a special rate - 391 pounds for five days. Our room was &quot;tiny&quot; and we are big people. The bed was full size and although it was okay comfort wise it didn't have fitted sheets. The plasma television and free internet service were good features. The bath had a corner shower that was very difficult for us to get in and out. Our room (413) overlooks Devonshire Terrace which gave us something interesting to look at. Tea and coffee making items were in the room which we utilized several times each day. It is only a 5 minute walk to Paddington bus service and the underground. Lots of shops and restaurants virtually on the doorstep. The Chelsea Deli was especially good with delicious latte and pastries.	
May 15 2009 	The Worst Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and the room was extremely small. There were two twin beds with no walking space in the room and the bathroom was tiny with a small shower. The bathroom could barely fit a person in there without hitting the wall. The customer service at the reception was terrible because we asked several times to fix the TV remote control. The reception never send anyone to fix our TV remote control, so we couldn't watch TV at all for 3 days. We set up a wake up alarm call for 6 am and the wake up call was 30 minutes late at 6:30am. I brought my own alarm clock and that was a good thing. On our 3rd day at the hotel, we found a new bag of cookies was taken out of the luggage by the hotel staff and they put the cookies on the table. The hotel staff opened and ate the cookies. We were shocked that the hotel staff went through our luggage and reported the unacceptable behavior to the reception at the front desk. The hotel was very defensive and rude when we told them their staff went through our luggage and took cookies out. The hotel said there was nothing they could do made us very upset. They at least could apologize for the staff behavior.	
May 8 2009 	Close to Underground and Hyde Park	Decent Hotel, very close to Hyde Park (a short walk). Rooms were okay, but fridge was busted and cupboards seemed to need a bit of a fix. Elevator was not worth the risk of riding in. Good place to sleep after a busy day though. The lounge downstairs in nice.	
Apr 19 2009 	Room is like a matchbox	Just come back from staying at this Hotel. I went to complain about the size of the room. It was one of those &quot;special rates&quot; things you find on the internet. I will not do this again. The room was one of the smallest I have ever seen.There were two people already complaining about the rooms whilst I was stood waiting at the desk. The staff were East European and just sounded like they were robots. They were obviously used to dealing with these issues. It was not cheap and my problem was that the Hotel was nothing like the pictures and description on the internet. Do not stay here if you like nice rooms. The location is good and the food is ok but I was disappointed. Very, very misleading.	
Apr 15 2009 	Nothing Special	When we arrived our room wasnt ready but we were able to leave our luggage with the receptionist. Its close to the train station and tube stations which was handy. When we got into our room, which was tiny and very difficult to find, the only upside was that the bed was big and comfy! The bathroom was very small too. I struggled to get into the shower unit and shut the door, so I couldnt imagine Rik Waller staying at this hotel....... Sorry! Also, when on the loo I could see right into someone elses room, which was also their toilet.. Not good. Overall, was a nice stay, comfy bed but wouldnt be able to stay longer than 1 night..	
Mar 10 2009 	Poor overall	The generally possitive reviews and good price were what made me choose this hotel in the first place. The reviews were wrong and I suggest you heed my advice. I paid extra to get a deluxe room but there was nothing deluxe about what I was given. The cons are as follows:Star rating: The hotel sells itself as a 4 star and in the past I have experienced many hotels ranging from 2 to 5 star. Of the 4 star rated hotels I have experienced they have all been reasonably good and often provide you with the comfort and quality of a 5 star with slightly inferior finishing and fewer facilities. In this case however the hotel would more realistically be categorised as a mediocre 3 star. On this ground I was disappointed as the Shaftesbury did not live up to the standard you'd expect from a 4 star hotel in any sense of the term.State of room: The room was in the basement floor. There was marginal natural lighting and you had no view. There was something resembling a sky light that was apparently what made the room habitable. The carpets were a disgrace, there were marks all over them, they were worn, stained and grubby looking. The television remote did not work, except to change channel but no volume control or standby function worked. The room was stuffy due to poor ventilation and no window you could reach to open. The crockery for the complimentary tea was mismatched. The complimentary soap in the shower was empty. The minibar smelled like farts (seriously it did) and there was nothing in it except two lonely bottles of water. The safe was locked and could not be opened to store valuables in. The shower did not have adequate water guards and water would splash off you onto the toilet and toilet floor. Staff: with the exception of one receptionist they were indifferent to you, would not greet you as you entered the rather intimate lobby and would barely acknowledge you upon approaching their counter. They were not overtly rude but they were falling far short of the standard you would expect from a so called 4 star hotel's staff.Overall condition: The hotel had the fascade of style but it was cheaply done and already there were signs of detiroration from the marked up walls in the corridor to the disgraceful state of the room we were allocated. Facilities: The gym was a glorified home gym with very few machines. The lack of space or windows was also oppressive. i did not use any other facility but there didn't appear to be many in any event. There was no lift down to the basement level which meant we had to carry our luggage down/up on check-in and check out. I could have used the porter but chose not to. The point remains that the Shaftesbury is allocating rooms in it's basement that lack sufficient natural light, a lift and proper ventilation.All in all it was tacky, tired, psuedo-stylish, poorly kept, poorly presented, poorly attended and just generally rubbish.The only good points were its location and selection of television channels. However, these are not selling points as the area is full of similarly convenient hotels at a lower price and of a similar quality. Why should I pay extra for a 4 star that doesn't deliver when I could save the bulls**t and get a more honest 3 star for less money?	
Mar 9 2009 	awfull beware this place was disgusting	we stayed in a basement room across from the main hotel the room was so tiny, the bed was hard and dirty and the bathroom was filthy. We didnt get much sleep all night as there was some sort of courtyard outside our room and people were using it to smoke in through the night . On checking out we complained to the staff on the front desk who just gave us blank expressions as if we were talking to a brick wall.	
Mar 8 2009 	Very clean more than just a B	I'm quite confused at the many negative reviews on this hotel, it's lovely for the prices offered, a lot cheaper than expected. It's a lot more &quot;luxury&quot; standard than a £114 a night TravelInn. I arrived at the hotel alone (met up with spouse later), to check-in to a busy reception area and checked in within a few minutes, the reception staff were lovely. I was annoyed as the porter showed me to my room along many corridors, up several flights up stairs without helping me with either my heavy suitcase or rucksake - rude! I made it to my room and the porter showed me in...single? Looooong trek back to reception!! They quickly changed my room no problems and with much apology. Looooong trek to room again, carrying bags on my own! The rooms are quite posh, lovely little shower room, TV welcoming on arrival and complimentary iron and board. The rooms are small but do the job. The only complaint with the room itself would be the view from the window overlooking lanes and yards. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to Paddington, and the area is much safer than dodgy King's Cross where you'd pay the same as you pay for this hotel but get a terrible 1* b&amp;b. Just booked up for another stay here in a few months!	
Feb 19 2009 	A cynical rip-off to put anyone in the room we were given	We booked a twin room at this hotel for 2 nights via Laterooms at quite a good price so perhaps should have been prepared for something to be wrong with the room. When we first saw the room we thought it looked good - nice decor, clean, plasma tv, great view etc. However this changed in about 5 minutes when we realised that it was right next to the top of the lift shaft of a very noisy lift. I tried to get a different room but was told there was nothing available until next day, and that it would be quieter at night. However this was the only lift for the whole hotel and people were travelling up at down the lift every few minutes until 3.30 in the morning. As the noise level was like being right next to an underground train, you will understand why I was in tears with exhaustion and lack of sleep by this time. Rooms like this are really unfit to be offered as guest accommodation at all. I don't know how many of the other rooms near the lift were similarly affected but as ours was near the lift machinery it was probably the worst (room 419 - avoid like the plague). I found the reception staff very pleasant to deal with - I felt sorry for them as this situation probably arises every day and it is really the fault of the management to put such rooms on the market. If they do so there really ought to be a health warning attached. The fact that they refused to change the room until the next day made me wonder whether this was a deliberate management policy - always have one set of mugs in the room for one night then move them, and put another set in etc, that way the room stays in occupation.It really is a great pity as I thought this was otherwise a fairly good hotel in a convenient, quiet location with restaurants and shops, Hyde Park and Paddington station nearby, although minor grouches would be that the hot water ran out on the first night and also that there was a fire alarm nearby beeping for lack of a new battery which probably should have been checked.However the room we were given on day 2 was much better - I fell asleep at 9.30 pm from sheer exhaustion after the previous night!	
Jan 27 2009 	'Nice area had a lovely break away'	My partner got me the weekend break for my 30th birthday 24-26 January so was really looking forward to it. I rang the hotel before we set off to make sure we had a room booked and breakfast was included as we booked over the internet. Everything was fine and i asked if we could leave our case with them as soon as we got there, as our train was at 5.30am, so we reached London way before check in time at 2pm, so that was really good for us. Travel was spot on and managed to find the hotel within minutes. No problems on checking in and the staff were polite and pleasant. Used the lift to the third floor and found our room. Very clean, modern, just as the pictures show on their website. Very small but most places are in London, but we were out all the time so it made no difference to us, we only wanted somewhere to put our heads. The only thing that made us laugh was the floor not being totally level so dont put a drink on the bedside table or it would soon hit the floor. Managed to level it out with my paper haha Shower wasnt very powerful but we managed, no problems with the water. The only downside to this hotel is the breakfast - nice but not warm at all, and it was a shame cos if the plates had been warmed through it would have been most enjoyable, good selection. The location was fine and close enough to tubes so we managed to get about all over the place. Only bad thing at the moment is the roadworks close to the hotel. Didn't affect us as we were up and out, but if you want a lie in, forget it and it seems like they will be there for quite some time yet! Views from our room wasnt anything to shout about - builders and more builders working below! We had no problems checking out, we were treated very well. Overall i would recommend it for anyone that is in London for a break, and we would visit again if we were in the area. Some reviews i think are over the top and wrong - we never experienced any bad feelings.	
Jan 27 2009 	Very Average hotel in an above average location	As if landing in London on the coldest weekend in years wasnt enough, there was nothing to warm or cheer us up about this dreary little hotel in the heart of London. Agreed, its not meant to be an exclusive hotel, but its not meant to be exclusively average either! They first checked me into Room 30, which is, truth be told, no more than a small hole carved into the wall, I've seen bathrooms and closets larger than that room! I obviously requested for a room change quite firmly, something they gave in to and gave me a slighly larger room across the street. The Air conditioning wasnt functioning properly upon entry as well as a couple of power plugs. Its clear that the hotel isnt too bothered about maintenance. Its good that we werent there for more than 2 nights before shifting into another hotel. To summarise, this hotel is a very basic place without great service. Its about a 10 min walk from the paddington underground from where you can of course quickly get to lots of places in the heart of london. If you have a choice of a hotel, avoid this one!	
Jan 21 2009	Great Location	Stayed here for 3nights.Great location. We caught the train to Paddington station and found the hotel easily and only a short walking distance.You can catch the Big Bus Tour just a few streets away..Also a choice of places to eat nearby.Staff were friendly and always helpful.Rooms are small but we were told to expect this in London.Plus we were only in our rooms to sleep as we were too busy sightseeing in the day.Our room had everything we needed and a great TV.	
Jan 11 2009 	Horrible Experience and Theft!	The heating in our first room didn't work, and only after having demanded to move rooms twice, did they give us another room.The staff (predominantly Eastern European) aren't very friendly and having returned after a late Saturday night out, we entered our room to discover that a member of staff had gone through our things and stolen cash and personal items. We immediately went down to the reception to inform them and the police were already there. About 4 other rooms had also been rummaged through and things stolen such as laptops etc.Alarmingly, we were told by the police that this happened two months ago and it was a member of staff who had done this as they found all the stolen items in one of the spare hotel rooms. There are no CCTV cameras anywhere and any old stranger can walk into the hotel.Stay away if you value your things and want to enjoy your stay!	
Jan 7 2009 	An American Traveler's Nightmare	We booked this hotel as part of a British Airways package deal - thought the price was good and location convenient for London sightseeing...specifically intended to NOT stay in an Americanized hotel, but...I'd have gladly paid more for better accommodations. Our nightmare began in just trying to find the hotel via rented car. (That's another issue altogether, maybe, - I strongly advise independent American travelers to use taxi service anywhere near London! The difficulty finding on -street parking; feeding the meter; getting parking tickets for being 5 min. past due; the &quot;Congestion Charge&quot; for driving a vehicle within city limits - all amount to much, much more hassle and money than a simple hail of a cab. We tried parking a block away, just to drop our bags off, but had trouble with police-(on the upside, for wary American travelers, the area is well patrolled by officers on foot.). The &quot;car park&quot; is NOT convenient to travelers staying at this hotel - with or without luggage - it is at least 4 long city blocks away and in an area that is difficult to navigate by foot. The &quot;car park&quot; seems to be designed for Paddington Station travelers. Next, the hotel tried to tell us we had no reservation. They were short rooms - some large group staying there - and initially would tried to turn us away. After proffering the online reservation confirmation and some heated negotiation, they did find us a room, alas, finding the room ourselves was another &quot;adventure&quot;. The hotel was under construction/renovation and guests were given rooms in the wing under re-hab! Painter's tarps lining the hallways, painting, hammering and fumes - workers inside and out harassing my teenage daughter with suggestive comments, all made for a lousy stay. There is no elevator and no bellhop offered to help us with our bags - we traversed a literal maze to find our room - it became comical after getting lost in London - to get lost in the hotel too, trying to find our way through little narrow, winding staircases and connecting passageways...Pictures on hotel website are deceiving. I recognize the double room and the front desk - minus the harried employees who were all foreigners with difficulty communicating in English, but I never saw the bar as pictured and the hotel facade was hidden by tarpaulins and scaffolding - maybe NOW, it looks as advertised! The room and bath were tiny-cramped by American standards, but clean. My daughter got a severe electric shock when using the iron provided - (frayed cord). No hallway amenities as in American hotels, but night staff was obliging and I was able to get a beer (warm, mind) at 2am - (suffering jet-lag). The lounge did offer 1 computer for guest use - this was inadequate, however, as the line was always 3-4 deep waiting (it was available at 2am, lol). Also, lounge boasted big screen TV. TV in room was flat screen, mounted on wall and wholly adequate-&quot;breakfast included&quot;, by American standards was not. Breakfast room found in basement - long line - short time frame of availability and again, harried, impolite staff - we opted to buy a muffin and coffee at a local deli/lunch shop while walking to the tube.Finally, since our travel plans had us arriving/departing the UK via Heathrow, we booked this hotel for our first night stay and our last - we were unable to cancel our reservation for our last night without losing the money prepaid by credit card online - thus we suffered a return to this establishment as we bid farewell to London as well. In any case - quaint ain't exactly what we were looking for - we needed comfort and convenience at both ends of a UK adventure. Whether you're on an extended stay in London or just passing through sightseeing before journeying onward, I suggest finding other accommodations. For Americans desiring American standards like Holiday Inn or Marriott - stick with the airport hotels...otherwise, &quot;while in Rome...&quot; It appears most non-American travelers rated this hotel with flying colors!	
Jan 3 2009 	Just a Hotel	Not all rooms are refurbished. We got a room that was quite bad, the tv didn't even work. Make sure you get breakfast included in your booking. They changed us to a different room after we complained three times. This location is not ideal to downtown. Victoria is a much better location.	
Dec 12 2008 	Creepy staff	As others have stated the rooms and bathroom are small and suffer from design flaws, but not so much that it should be a problem. Room was comfortable, clean, everything worked if on the small side (not so small by London standards just could have been laid out better really).However I found the majority of the staff friendly but found one or two very creepy, and got the very distinct impression that the guy who looks after the luggage was making a personal comment about my appearance to someone else in whatever language they were speaking, causing them to eye me in a way I found extremely discomforting. Frankly, I don't expect that sort of behaviour from hotel front of staff, I found it creepy and uncomfortable to be around them - I popped to the shop across the road to buy milk and this guy was outside giving me funny looks then too.It's a shame because it is relatively low cost and convenient, I'd have stayed there again as a good hop on and off point for the Heathrow Express from Paddington. However ... no thanks!	
Nov 27 2008 	Small but comfortable 	We arrived several hours before check in. The friendly staff were more than happy to look after our bags while we went to our business meeting. Checked in later, retrieving our luggage with no fuss - and all done with a smile. The room (on the 3rd floor, but the lift worked) was smaller than expected - almost no room between the foot of the bed and the wall - but everything was clean, including the en suite, and the bed comfortable. There was plenty of hot water, the TV reception was fine, the room temperature just right and the buffet style English breakfast (as much as you wanted) was average to good. Hotel rooms in central London are expensive (the Paddington Court Hotel is less than 5 minutes flat walk from Paddington station), so the price represents good value. The location was great - just minutes walk to Hyde Park &amp; with superb public transport links (train, tube &amp; bus) from Paddington - it felt like a very safe area and there were decent restaurants and cafes nearby. All in all the hotel is a good, comfortable base for a short stay in London. I would stay here again.	
Nov 14 2008 	Stay Away	This hotel includes a few different buildings and is a bit confusing. The rooms in the building with the front desk are much nicer than the rooms in the building across the street. This may explain why some reviewers were very happy with their rooms and others hated theirs. The guests in the nice building probably have no idea that the building across the street even exists.I reserved what was supposed to be a 4 star room for what was supposed to be a greatly discounted $139 pounds per night (plus an additional $20 pounds tax). Like many others staying in this area, we had an early flight out of Heathrow and wanted to be close to Paddington station.We checked in, and to reach our room, were directed to a completely different building across the street. The building was musty, our room was in the basement, the room had a damp smell, and there were stains on the walls. It was so small that we could barely move. There was no space for the (stained!) ironing board, so it was propped up against a wall. For $70 pounds a night, we probably would have stayed, but this was definitely not a 4 star hotel, definitely not worth $159 pounds/night.The elevator that had taken us down to the basement would not take us back up, so we had to drag our bags up the stairs, then walk back to the front desk to complain about the room. We were told that the hotel was booked, but when we refused our room, were shown another room. This one was slightly less musty, but not a whole lot better, definitely not 4 star. The bellhop who showed us these rooms said that every time guests received rooms across the street, they complained. &quot;Every time!&quot; he said, shaking his head.We refused this second room as well, and were eventually shown a room in 27 Devonshire Ter, the building that the front desk is in. This was a perfectly acceptable room, probably the 4 star room that we had reserved to begin with, but we were so upset by our treatment that we left. There are a number of budget hotels in the area, and we picked the first one we found, the Lawrence Hall Hotel, for $85 pounds/night (including tax and breakfast). It had the feel of a youth hostel, but our room was spacious and we were treated well.If you're lucky enough to get a room in 27 Devonshire, you may very well be happy with your room, but if you get a room across the street, beware. Or at least be willing to complain, as it's quite likely that you can negotiate a better room.	
Nov 9 2008 	Fantastic Location	Great location - less than 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station and Kensington Gardens. Close to 2 underground stations, local pubs and shops.Friendly staff on reception. Room on small side and flat screen tv ridiculously large for size of room! Bathroom on compact side but clean. Few issues - bathroom fan not working and shower hose leaking badly - reported them to Reception and they were repaired/replaced when we returned to room.Hotel in convenient location which suited our purposes. Generally ate 'on the go' from Paddington cafes.	
Oct 29 2008 	Small but cosy!	I stayed at this hotel with my son (13) in October of this year. The website reviews said they rooms were small and they weren't kidding! Our first room was so wee one of the single beds had no view of the TV at all but they were happy to move us. The next room we both had a view of the TV but there was no room to get round the chair at the bottom of the bed and you had to jump over it to get to the window. Apart from the size of the rooms the hotel rooms were clean and the staff were very nice and helpful and offered to print off boarding cards for us on departure. Great location for Paddington Station and it felt like quite a safe area to be in with a child at night.	
Oct 28 2008 	lovely stay	After reading some of the reports we were quite worried about what to expect, but thankfully were suprised! On arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a Club room. The room was quite small but big enough for the time spent in it. Yes, the shower and bathroom were really small, but everything was spotlessly clean and new, towels changed every day and complimentary toiletries. The bed was a normal double size, clean and not at all worn or shabby. There wasn't much space to move around in the room, but who cares when all you really do is sleep and get changed etc. The staff were so friendly and polite, the breakfast was good with lots of choice and there were left luggae facilities which was really useful. The really only negative point was that it was absolutely BOILING in the room! Thanks good ness there was an air conditioning unit which helped! Maybe we were lucky with the room we were given??? The area is fantastic with lots of nice pubs and restarants withing walking distance. A great Indian beside the Victoria pub and a fantastic Greek restaurant on Leinister place - the small restaurant not the huge empty one! Have a good trip if you're going soon!	
Oct 19 2008 	What facilities?!?!	Booked this as a &quot;Top Secret Hotel&quot; on the LastMinute site. When I'd looked at these before I think I'd managed to work out one or two of the hotels and they looked good, so I thought why not try it this time. It wasn't quite the loaction I wanted but neither was it too inconvenient, so not too bad there. The lobby seemed okay too, although the person checking me in seemed more concerned with the person he picked up the phone to half way through checking me in - so rude!I was told that my room was down one floor. i double checked...down one floor? Yes, apparently that was the case. The explanation? It's a clubroom...whatever that was supposed to mean. Hey, maybe it means it's big enough to hire out for events and stuff? No, unfortunately not...it was pretty small. And being in the basement you had the feeling that a) it wasn't secure, and b) people were looking down on you from street level. It also suffered from lack of light, although the big wondow did go some way to remedying that. Shame the catch on it wasn't secure. I didn't feel happy leaving my stuff in the room to go out and get some food. And wasn't hugely happy about sleeping in the room either for that matter!Oh well, maybe I'll just stay in my room for the evening and use the facilities. Mini bar first...totally empty. So it looks like I'll have to go out and get some stuff to eat and drink after all. Oh well, I can at least browse the web first. No...that didn't work either. Fine I'll just go out now, get some food, come back and watch a film. Nope...movies weren't working either. Great!My only other real gripe about the room was the bathroom. It was very small, although that was less annoying than the fancy sink/tap combo. I've had one of those free standing sinks myself so know they're more form over function, but this one had a water spout that protruded out of the wall almost entirely over the sink, so wetting your face to shave, cleaning your teeth, whatever, it was a pain to use and ended up with water all over the place.Breakfast was okay and the dining room staff were friendly enough, although i was put on a table and then told to help myself at the buffet, only to come back to my table to find they'd subsequently also sat someone else there. *sigh*Won't be going back, and probably won't use LastMinute's Top Secret Hotels again either, although I have heard people having good experiences from them. I prefer to know where I'll bebad sink setup	
Oct 7 2008 	Had A Comfortable Stay After A Small Hitch	.We had gone to London on an official tour and had taken a 5 nights stay in Paddington Courts and suites After reading reviews about the small size of the rooms at Paddington we were really nervous about our fate.The first good thing which happened to us was an amazingly early check in ( 8:30 am).The first room that we got was very tiny.In fact my husbands legs dangled out of the bed a good 11/2 feet !And if he were to sleep on the bed I would have to sleep on the floor..never mind the fact that if I slept on the floor the luggage would have no place to go !!Luckily the AC in the room wasnt working and we requested the staff to change our room.A nice fellow at the hotel took pity on us and whoa..we got a decent sized room with a complimentry fruit basket to boot.After this we had a very smooth sailing 5 nights.Breakfast was good but the menu was more or less the same everyday !!All in all it was a comfortable stay	
Sep 28 2008 	What a dissapointment!!	I regret that we booked this hotel! After searching for hours for a 4-star hotel, for a romantic trip for two, what a disappointment this was! We missed to read the reviews of this hotel, which is highly recommended for your future trip. This is definitely not a 4 star Hotel ( from our point of views it deserves less than 3 or rather 2). The room that we were shown was tiny, with no light in basement, and we complained and they brought us across the road to the 'suites'.Unbelievable! - the 'suite' is smaller than an average hotel room. The 'kitchen' is a metal cupboard. There is no mini-bar, just two small bottles of water. The bathroom is the tiniest we have ever seen. The bed is 2 feet from the walls on all sides. There is an ironing board in the room but if you set it up you would not have room to stand behind it! The shower was so small that it was difficult to wash in as we kept hitting my elbow of the wall. The worst part was the extremely small double bed, my husband and I are of average build and we found that we had hardly enough room to turn, very uncomfortable!One positive welcome was the served fruit plate in the room at arrival. However, funny enough we did not get it touched as after 5 minutes, a person without speaking English, knocked the door at took it away! Another ting was that we did not have any towels after one night, the dirty ones were taken away without replacement! In other words, everything was wrong, so our only solution to enjoy the romantic trip was to spend minimal time at the room.	
Sep 17 2008 	Small but clean tidy and comfortable	We stayed in the Paddington Court Suites, and although the rooms were very small (barely cat-swinging territory) they were very clean and comfortable. The way we saw it was that we were in London, so we wouldn't be spending that much time in the room anyway. The bathroom smelt of sewerage a bit, and we had to keep the bathroom door closed all the time, but we came across that a few times in London, so it's probably more to do with the old sewerage pipes than anything else. With the door closed we didn't notice anything. We had no problems with service and the cost was reasonable, for a location so close to town. I would recommend it to others, and stay there again on our next visit.	
Jul 27 2008 	Small rooms!	We knew not to expect large rooms in central London but this hotel had the smallest room, bed and en suite i have ever stayed in! The shower was so small that it was difficult to wash in as i kept hitting my elbow of the wall. The toilet was through an arch way which was exactly the same width as myself. The worst part was the extremely small double bed, my husband and i are of average build and we found that we had hardly enough room to turn, very uncomfortable! We could only access the bed from one side which was a nuisance.We travelled with our son and daughter who had a twin room which was slightly better but when they came into our room in was standing room only. I was glad we were only staying 3 nights.Apart from the above problems the room was clean with lovely fluffy towels and toiletries and staff were friendly.We did not eat in so cannot comment on the food. It is only 5mins walk to Paddington underground and was in a nice quiet area of London.	
May 29 2008 	very good	the reception guys are adorable, helpful, there for youthe rooms are more than good, bathroom toowell locatednest time i'll come there!!!!!!!!!!!	
May 28 2008 	Good Value hotel	Booked into the Best Western Shaftsbury Paddington for 4 nights as I was working in London for a total of £255 which is good value for money.The hotel is clean and tidy, the first room we had was victim to some ants, don't know where they came from. But we had been victim to heavy rain.The hotel without reservation gave us a choice of rooms to move to and we obviously picked which was the best.Although the rooms are on the small side, they are equiped well with a huge flat screen TV and tea/coffee facilites.I would reccommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Bayswater/Lancaster Gate area, and I will be planning on staying again.	
May 4 2008 	Far better than we expected.	We have just returned from a weekend in this Hotel and cannot thank the staff enough for making our stay in London a great experience. We had booked a double and a twin room for 2 nights but on arrival the twin room was unavailable. This meant that our 2 teenage boys were each given single rooms. Due to this 'inconvenience' our double room was upgraded to a club and breakfast was added at no cost!We paid about £110 per room per night but for a bank holiday in London we did not feel overcharged., The rooms are small, but very comfortable, big flat TVs and good AC. Our shower (room 141) had a door that opened only enough to let me squeeze in side ways. I weigh 13 stone and I would bet money that nobody who was a stone heavier could access this shower! Having said that it was fine for us.Breakfast was really good. The dining room is tiny but the staff are freindly and the food is good, self service, english breakfast.Reception staff were great, Ones we met were mostly Asian and very helpful. Particularly Ravi who sorted all our problems, arranged a late check-out and looked after our cases for no charge.I could not fault this hotel.	
Apr 13 2008 	Disappointing	Booked the hotel as a last minute business trip (combined with a small amount of pleasure). Booked a superior double room for 2 nights. On arrival was directed toward the building opposite which on face value seemed quaint. However my room was in the basement and definitely didn't warrant the 'superior' title. The sound insulation wasn't brilliant either as I could hear the person walking around in the room upstairs. Access to the room was via a tight stair case or lift. Natural day light was almost non existant as the rooms window backed onto a small enclosed courtyard. My main gripe was the size of the room and facilities. The fridge had pre-opened bottles of water in it, the hairdryer didn't work (which annoyed my wife as she hadn't packed hers) and when cleaning my teeth the angle of the tap was such that any more than a trickle it soaked my trousers. Not so hilarious when stumbling around at 5.30am on my way to an important meeting. Parking was at Paddington station which is a good 10 minute walk away and the hotel doesn't offer any discounts for parking. The hotel is located fairly close to Hyde park which is a fairly nice part of London and is 3-4 stops away from Leicester Square on the Tube. I wouldn't recommend staying unless it was purely a room to rest your head. I wouldn't want to stay in our room longer than necessary.	
Apr 8 2008 	possibly the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in......	OK, the title of my review isn't too encouraging! Reception was courteous and efficient. The room was spotless and well equipped, it was though possibly the smallest hotel room I have ever been in. I think could reach out and touch the walls either side of the bed without stretching!That said it was reasonable value and I only needed a bed for the night arriving late and leaving early.Its really close to Paddington station.	
Mar 31 2008 	No Hot Water	Where to start with this hotel........? Well start with the positives.1. Staff were friendly2. Hotel looked nice and had recently been refitted.3. Room cost me £69 for a night.Negatives.1. Internet didn't work in the room.2. Room was 2m wide by 4m long (ish). Including bathroom.3. No heating (It was really cold)4. It was draughty5. Only a light blanket on the bed and no extras available.6. No control for the TV so no in room entertainment.7. NO HOT WATER! 8. Managers think nothing of shouting at staff in front of you.I was in Room 030. Which was at the top of the stairwell going down to the breakfast room. Just as well for me I was up early anyhow as this is noisy. Not a good overall experience.	
Mar 18 2008 	You get what you pay for	I stayed at the hotel overnight with a friend. Fortunately we got the room for a bargain £60, which we bore in mind during our stay (reasons to follow!). The room was clearly a single with twin beds squashed in. It really was small, even by London standards, there was just enough room to move around the beds. The curtains didn't fit properly and the window was draughty. The hotel was like a rabbit warren, rooms seemed to run in every direction, and there was a lack of signs to the reception area. The real problem was that we were woken at 3.05am as the central heating system sprang into life, rattling the life out of the radiator and the ill-fitting radiator cover. My friend thought that there was an earthquake! |This was followed by a blast of gaseous fumes through the window. Beware room 015!On the plus side there was a large wall mounted TV and the bathroom had been recently refitted. The shower worked well but would have been impossible for a larger sized person to access. The was plenty of tea and coffee available in the room and the hotel is well positioned only a couple of minutes walk from the tube. There are plenty of places to eat locally and the staff are friendly. At Christmas I stayed in the City Inn, Westminster which was excellent and only cost £40 more for a large room, including breakfast, champagne on arrival, bath robes and a free newspaper.There are much better places to stay in London and I would be unable to recommend this hotel.	
Feb 7 2008	Not as bad as I expected..	We booked this hotel through the web in March 2007 as it was quite cheap, was in a great location and the website said the hotel had recently been renovated. To be honest, I didn't even think about reading reviews before booking (and I'm fussy), but stumbled across this site a few weeks after booking and read some terrible reviews. I spent 4 months constantly reading the new reviews to see if things had improved, but 90% of the reviews were quite negative. We had booked for 3 nights and from what I read about the rooms, service and staff, I was preparing myself to go to war if things were as bad as people reported..We arrived around midday, the staff knew about our bookings, our rooms were ready and we were handed the keys. I was actually surprised when I walked into our room as it had been fully renovated and everything was really clean (including the bathroom). I have to say the room was quite small and we had to re-arrange a few items to fit our luggage, but it was good enough. The shower however, was a different story.. I have never seen such a small shower, and to top it off, they had also fitted a saftey handle/rail thing inside, which causes you to lose even more space once you're inside!! I had to actually keep the shower door open in order to be able wash myself properly!! We stayed 3 nights and only had one problem, which was on the 2nd day when the hot water system was down for the whole day. We asked the staff whether it would be fixed, and they told us that the problem was only with the rooms in our block. We were given the keys to a vacant room and carried our stuff across the site to another room, which hadn't been cleaned yet. I tested the the water temp in this room just to see whether the problem was only in our block. It didn't surprise me that there was no hot water here either (a complaint most reviewers had). I gave up after wasting around half an hour moving from room to room and ended up having a cold shower in my own room (luckily we were in London during summer). Apart from that, everything else was fine and we were charged the correct amount when we checked out. The hotel is in a quiet and convenient location. We didn't have breakfast included, but we found a little cafe which was only a 2 minute walk up the main road, which served a great hot breakfast for 3 pound.I would stay at this hotel again if I was visiting London. It's in a great location with everything you could need only a walking distance away including the Heathrow Express.	
Jan 27 2008 	Cramped But Clean	first room was too small,second room was slightly larger,but still very cramped.wardrobe was about 6&quot; in depth!.We asked for a bath also,but bathroom only had a shower and it smelt a bit(room 204).towel rail was too high unless you're very tall!Also asked for two glasses on day 2,but they still hadn't arrived on day 5On the positive side .good tv and general facilities and bathroom toiletries.cleanliness ok.  Bethan  Llanelli	
Jan 18 2008 	Well worth the £55 per night	Read some terrible reviews of this hotel before I stayed but my fears were unfounded. Room was small but the TV was huge. Linen and towels changed every day. Plenty of roasting hot water for showering, shaving etc. Could not find a fault with this hotel. Door staff very friendly, counter staff seemed very reserved and not too friendly. I booked through www.Laterooms.com and got the room for myself and my wife for only £55 per night for the room. Overall I would give it 9 out of ten. Don't waste your money on breakfasts in any hotel or surrounding cafes. One block away from the hotel is a small cafe named Raffles Cafe Diner. a breakfast of two eggs, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, tomatoes, will cost you only £2.99. They also do evening meals of similar value the food is excellent. Went for an Indian dinner across the road the hotel it was terrible small portions and lukewarm, overpriced plus a service charge of 12.5% daylight robbery. to conclude I intend to visit London in the near future and will be booking the same hotel again	
Jan 8 2008 	Didn't think it was so bad!!	We stayed at the Paddington Court for 2 nights in January 08. We did find the room to be quite small, and I can see how a big person would not fit in the shower, which had odd doors. However, every part of our stay was fine. The elevator worked, we had hot water, continental breakfast was above-par (compared with other London hotels on the same trip). Check-in, check-out were smooth. We enjoyed the mini-fridge and free internet in the lobby, although shame on the guy who spent 90 minutes hogging the computer one evening. Our tea kettle was fine.We picked this hotel because of its proximity to Paddington Station and the Heathrow Connect, but the area around the hotel was also very fun. There were a lot of restaurants, shops, and pubs within 10 minutes' walk. While there are several hotels in the area, it is also a neighborhood with a lot of locals. Overall not so bad-- we booked through British Airways online and felt like we got a pretty good deal for what we paid for!!	
Dec 8 2007 	What a dump! or "just how bad can it get?"	Just how bad can it get? First, the good things about the hotel: nice plasma TV in the room. There are quiet rooms facing out the rear of the building if you can get one. 3 minute walk to Paddington station for access to the Heathrow Express and the London Underground. Now for the litany of the things that went wrong that made me feel this is a real dump.1. I reserved a room starting Monday and leaving Friday. On Monday afternoon London time, I called the hotel from the States and explained that I would be arriving around 6 a.m. Tuesday morning but that I was willing to pay from Monday night to insure that I could have access to a room when I arrived on the red eye from California. I arrived Tuesday morning and was told that I didnt have a room. When I showed my confirmation papers I was told that Im sorry, sir, this reservation was for yesterday and you did not show up. After a small hissy fit with the manager, it turns out they had plenty of rooms and I was given one.2. I requested a quiet room facing out the rear of the building. I was given a room below ground facing the front street. I tried to take a nap but the constant footsteps out the window made it difficult. 3. There was no remote for the TV.4. The internet access was broken in that room5. There was no hot water. I had to take an ice cold shower.6. In the ice cold shower, the handle came off and the shower would not turn off. (I am pretty handy and tried to fix it but to no avail.7. I tried to call the desk to tell them the water would not turn off. The phone seemed to be broken (turns out that you have to dial 851 to get the operator but there is no instruction in the room or on the phone. You can only find that out by asking the desk. So, that evening I asked for the manager again and explained the difficulties and I received a new room. In the new room:1. The tea kettle did not work. I called the desk and asked for a replacement. They said it would come right away. By 2 hours later and a second call, no kettle. ON the way out for the day I stopped by the desk and gave a written request to have the kettle replaced. 2. In the middle of the night (2 AM), the air conditioning condensate tube overflowed. The a/c/ is high on the wall and water just came pouring out drenching the wall and the desk beneath it. On the desk was my cell phone charging  now soaked. 3. When I returned in the evening, same old non-working kettle. I called the desk again and asked for a replacement. A few minutes later a bellman showed up with a nice plate of tea bags but no kettle. I brought him into the room, handed the entire kettle tray to him and asked him to leave and return with a new one. About ten minutes later he did. 4. Internet was dead as a door nail. Called the desk, they said theyd reboot the system. Still dead. Now in day 3 with no internet access. 5. For some inexplicable reason, the plasma TV that worked just fine in the new room went haywire. The remote quit working all together. The TV had 30 or so channels the first day now only had 6 channels. I pushed every button I could find but no luck. I complained at the front desk and they said theyd get it fixed. When I returned to the room that evening it worked fine  until the next morning when it went out again. 6. That final morning found that the housekeepers took all the shampoo and soap and left none in the room  not even the half empties from the day before. So, bottom line is that the desk people are very friendly and nice but nothing works in this place and no one seems capable of fixing anything. Too bad, it could have been a good hotel otherwise.	
Nov 19 2007 	The Smallest Hotel Room in the UK	Right from the minute we walked through the door we thought this might not be one of our more pleasant London stays. One man was angry at the size of his room, the other was checking out early because &quot;he could not fit in the shower&quot;. The staff were polite but overwhelmed and this wasn't helped by the departure of the foh manager as soon as things started to get heated.We were only in town for one night and had plans which took up most of the evening but if you intend to spend any time in your hotel room then please avoid this hotel. The room is truly the smallest room I have ever spent any time in (bathrooms included!). I have been in hotels where the wardrobes are bigger.On check out I mentioned this but the response was of no use at all.Good location but service not so good and size appalling.	
Nov 12 2007 	good value for money good location	Have just got back from a two nite weekend stay in London with my boyfriend. The hotel is easy to find, straight down the road from Paddington station- which is why i booked it. On arrival we were politely greeted by friendly but foreign staff with good English. The reception was modern and clean with fresh flowers- always a good sign. We were checked in quickly and were soon in our room (103 on the first floor) some people would have been disappointed with the room as it was very small, although the finishings were good and for the price, having a 3star hotel in central london, i was presently pleased with what we had! The bed was small but cosy! The room was modern with newly fitted compact bathroom- good shower and facilities but very tight. There were free toiletries which were nice, not cheap smelling! The big draw back in the bathroom was the towels being so high up- if you were short, forget it! we had a large plasma tv on the wall and although the reception wasnt good(quite snowy!) it was ok enough to watch - mind you, who goes to London for a weekend to watch tv!!!???!!! Tea and coffee making facilities and a small fridge- which is perfect as there are quite a few small convenient stores around the corner to buy milk, juice wine and snacks etc. Couldnt comment on the food as we didnt eat there but the restaurant looked ok. Iron and ironing board, hairdryer etc all in room. We asked the concierge to order us a taxi for our show and when we went downstairs there was a private chauffer there with a Mercedes, much nicer than a black cab!!! We had a late train home but could leave our bags in the luggage room for no cost and picked them up later. All in all the weekend was great, if you are going to london for a short stay and would like somewhere central and good value for money i would recommend this place!	
Oct 29 2007	if your taller than 5ft 7inches dont go	I have had wardrobes bigger than the double room booked the staff were uninterseted in your existance and well the shower could fit a size 0 supermodel any bigger than that forget it . on the plus side we laughed for hours at the size of the room and the fact that they couldnt find blinds long enoug for their windows........never again	
Oct 17 2007 	Tiny	My suite was actually a tiny room with 4foot double bed. Tiny bathroom and minimal facilites but clean and cheap in good location.	
Oct 8 2007 	Absolute disaster - worst hotel experience ever!!!!	I would not recommend staying at this &quot;hotel&quot; to anyone. I had prebooked a self contained studio apartment in January 2007 for a 5 night stay in July/August 2007with another booking company (Quality Apartments London). Arrived early in the morning after a 30 hour flight and checked in. Could not get into the apartment as it was too early, so we were told to come back after 2pm. So after 40 hours of no sleep and walking the streets, we arrived at the hotel to be told that our apartment had been given away to a family. I was furious as I had prebooked and had this confirmed back in January. We were given a twin share room which we were &quot;told&quot; had a plasma TV and air conditioning. There was a hole in the wall where the TV was supposed to be, the air conditioning did not work and the bar fridge was blowing hot air. The bathroom had just been renovated and the bath fitting fell off when trying to have a shower. We had to ask for our room to be restocked with toilet paper, soap, shampoo and clean glasses. What a joke!!! The staff at the desk were rude and did not give us any explanation as to why they had given our room away. And to top it all off, a mouse ran across the dining room floor during breakfast one morning. In conclusion, our 5 night stay was not very pleasurable and I would certainly not recommend this establishment to anyone staying in London. And after reading other reviews, it appears this hotel has a long record of over booking. What a disgrace!!!!	
Sep 22 2007 	beware beware beware	I booked this hotel via a reliable online source but it was a disaster. I have stayed at a different property Hogarth Kensington, which is all owned by the same conpany. I thought since the prior experience was great I would have no problems but I was fooled. The webiste boast amentites(iron/irioning board ,internet access, air conditioning) none were in the 1st room. I asked to be moved and that went well initially. I had a room with a double bed, that was fine as with the London way, it was tiny. The large window in the room led to a balcony which was nice but the window did not lock. The shower in the bathroom was a tight tight fight, you can not turn around in the shower. The 2nd day in the hotel the air conditioner started pouring water all over the desk and my luggage. Maintenance came about 1 hr later. Room service was non responsesive..no for real, 1hr passed I called the front desk again then they came about 30 mins. later with the wrong order. After that the desk clerk called trying to talk harshly to my mate, which was totally unacceptable. I I was so disappointed with the customer sevice of the front desk including the manager they were not helpful nor friendly. There were 4 other guest complaining about their rooms on day 3 of my 5 day stay. Do not stay here, no matter how great of a rate you may get. The stores close by do not sell alcohol after 9pm so get your drink and shopping on early!!!	
Sep 22 2007 	Beware of phony "suites" and overbooking.	Don't be conned by the title &quot;suites&quot;. A sink and a kettle do not a kitchen make - especially when the rooms are already so tiny.BEWARE - they seem to have a passion for overbooking. Turned away several guests - with bookings - when I turned up. Took some time to persuade them to find me a room to stay in even though I had booked AND paid a deposit.Only good point - manager's response - when I finally got hld of him - was to offer some reduction in room rate. Expected - as I was not put into the type of room I booked - but nonetheless welcome.	
Sep 21 2007 	Convenient but flawed	I booked this hotel without any knowledge of the area or what I would be in for, but compared to many reviewers I was pretty happy with the accommodations and I understand the rate I paid is pretty typical. The hotel is a bunch of old Georgian homes cobbled together so the hallways are mazelike and narrow but that wasn't an issue. The elevator (lift) is among the smallest I have ever seen and will hopefully be working otherwise you must haul your bags up several long flights of stairs. If the breakfast is not included in your rate it is pricey and just fair, so I suggest trying one of the little cafes on the street nearby heading towards Paddington station. The room was clean but tight although I knew that would be the case in London. The bathroom was fine, the heat worked and beds were fair. The tv was tiny and there were only about 6 stations but I came to London to see the city, not watch tv. Paddington station is a short walk and convenient with train and subway connections. The Heathrow Express runs non-stop from Heathrow into Paddington but is more expensive than taking the tube via Piccadilly. The reception staff were ok but not overwhelmingly helpful. I've never stayed elsewhere in London so I don't have anything else to compare, otherwise I think you could do worse!	
Sep 19 2007	Value for 30 GBP / 60 USD do not stay more than 1 night	Be prepared for very bad service and lots in inconveniences. Location is OK, that's about it. Hotel staff obviously is the biggest problem!	
Sep 15 2007	A reasonable hotel for those with reasonable expectations	Let's be honest about London hotels - if you want them to be up to American standards (spacious, modern, flashy) then London is not the place to visit unless you have a very generous accommodation budget. I was booked into this property by my company. When I found out, I immediately came to Trip Advisor to see what I was in for and I was dreading my arrival here based on what I read....for no good reason it seems (as I write this review from the hotel). it's perfectly pleasant and adequate for business or holiday requirements. By area:Reception: Average - I never expect anyone in London service roles to speak great English and the guy here didn't. But my reservation was in place and the process was as expected.Access: Americans beware - it never looks flashy accessing your room in a converted mansion hotel! The hallways are narrow, the fire doors are a nuisance and it's basically a rabbit warren. Stay at the Hilton if this bothers you - it's standard even in good hotels in the UK! It was no worse here than other properties, and better than many. For the record, the lift was working fine, although I acknowledge the many reviewers here who have said it wasn't during their stays.Room: Yes they're small. But only when compared with American or Australian rooms. This one is small, but has a microwave, sink, refrigerator and basic equipment to allow me to buy dinner at Sainsbury's and heat it up myself., Wood floors, recently renovated and a modern bathroom - doesn't lack for anything except perhaps a new bed (this one is a little saggy, but sleepable and clean).Amenities: Free broadband internet access is a must for business travellers (which I am) so this was great. And there's proper air conditioning as opposed to the usual groaning radiator in need of a bullet to put it out of its misery. While the hotel doesn't have room service or any particularly useful amenities within its walls, it's only seconds walk to Craven Road/Craven Hill with all shopping/eating needs easily met. Five minutes to Paddington Station (or two others) in a very affluent part of London. The location is superb! Safe, easy to walk around and Reception is happy to provide maps free of charge for those who don't come packing their London A-Z. From groceries to cafes to pharmacies to boutiques, nothing is more than two or three minutes from the hotel. And if you're prepared to walk for 10 mins or take a bus, the amazing Edgeware Road shopping is imminently accessible.Overall: Service is never brilliant in London and rooms are never large. But as a business traveller who has had mostly dreadful experiences with hotels in London, I'd say that this one is perfectly acceptable and reflects adequate value for money within a London context . I don't agree with it's 4 star rating - it's a 3 star in my book. But I'd stay here again over many others, particularly as the ability to heat up/refrigerate a healthy meal rather than eating British hotel slop is a real bonus!	
Sep 3 2007	Not bad at all	My bf and I stayed at this hotel over the weekend for 2 nights. I think its OK for its price. The room was modern and clean, plus there was a plasma screen telly which was a bonus. We could use more channels though.Like most other reviews on this site, we were just abit disappointed by the size of the room. It was a double deluxe room and so we expected abit more space. Walking around the bed proved difficult. The shower was also very small but again it was clean and modern, so we can't really complain.My biggest problem with this hotel was that we were disturbed by the cleaner both mornings just barely past 9am. Since checking out time is up to 12 noon, wouldn't be a better idea to have cleaner go around rooms at that time or later when most people would have either checked out or at least out for the day? Something to consider!Overall, I think its value for money	
Aug 28 2007 	Nothing learned	I recognise that writing a review almost 2 years after staying at a hotel may seem strange. However, out of curiosity I had a look at the Paddington Court Hotel and Suites convinced that things must have improved since I stayed there almost 2 years ago. One would expect any self respecting business to implement an improvement programme given the level of bad reviews / complaints this hotel has attracted. Sadly, and almost unbeliveably I see from recent reviews that nothing whatsoever has been learned and that Best Western continue to simply not care about its customers. My family and I booked 2 nights at this dreadful hotel but we cut our stay short and stayed only 1 night even though it meant a financial loss on my part. Time has not erased the memory of the hostile reception on arrival or of the rabbit warren of rooms which in our case was incredibly tiny with a number of non functioning fittings. Don't whatever you do stay at this place , the only redeeming feature was breakfast which was best described as ok.	
Aug 1 2007 	Give it a miss	This hotel is a huge dissapointment. The rooms are tiny and the corridors are gloomy and tight. The check in staff were very offhand with us. They started dealing with us and then dashed off to deal with someone else - eventually returning 15 minutes later. We were not told how to find our room and when we asked, the staff member sighed and looked annoyed. There were major works being carried out when we stayed. This caused a lot of dust and noise and our plumbing was very intermittent. The housekeeping staff had a heated argument in the corridor, which was very uncomfortable for the guests. This is one to avoid.	
Jul 25 2007 	Unsafe Hotel	Stayed here for 4 nights as I was on business in London. My room was on the 3rd floor which meant a long walk past the reception, through the lounge and along the back of the hotel and then up. Room had a single bed but the shower was by far, the smallest that I have ever seen in any hotel. Big flat screen TV but very poor reception. One day into my stay the refurbishment work in the hotel meant that the lounge was closed off and all had to use the side Fire Exit door to gain access to the hotel. This meant bypassing the reception and there was no checks being performed as to who was entering the hotel. Anyone could have come and gone. I mentioned this to the hotel staff but they seemed very indifferent over the matter and I doubt that it even got to the ears of the general manager.	
Jul 16 2007	London In June	Nice hotel and only a few blocks from the Paddington street subway station which is a 15 minute ride to heathrow airport on the express train.Beware the telephone. They charge you $2 per call and about $4 per minute, so the first minute of any call is $6. This is insanity.	
Jul 10 2007 	Lovely location shame about the room.	We booked our room at The Paddington Court through The Shaftesbury website where the prices were discounted and thought we had a good deal. It wasn't a bad hotel but not great and I don't think it was worth the £95 per night we paid for it. Its location was the best thing about it - Hyde Park is just at the end of the street, it's a five minute walk from Paddington Station, the road it's on is not too busy and there are restaurants and grocery shops just around the corner. Our room was across the street from the main hotel building and we were a bit alarmed that the lock of the outside door was broken meaning that anyone could get in. Our room was tiny enough to bring the words 'swing' and 'cat' to mind. It was so small that we had to move the beds to shut the inside door! It was clean though. The room was really hot, but there is air con so that wasn't too bad. Bathroom was tiny but clean - the sink is nothing more than a hand basin though so be careful not to drop toothpaste down yourself! The main light wasn't working but they fixed that for us straightaway. The most annoying thing was that a kettle and lamp were provided but there was only one plug socket where they stood and this was the one that the TV was plugged into. After a hunt we found two more sockets behind one of the bedside tables, so you could either turn the TV off or make your coffee on your bedside table - but in the dark because there wasn't room for everything. The breakfast buffet was fine and included in the price and the staff were helpful and friendly. They also let us leave our luggage with them after we checked out as we weren't going home until the evening which was appreciated.It may sound like I'm being fussy, but it's not what you expect from Best Western or for £95 a night. There are plenty of hotels in the surrounding streets - next time we'll try one of those.	
Jul 9 2007 	not goog at getting your reservation right	We booked our stay at the hotel 4 months before arriving. When we arrived there was a family in front of us who's reservation was wrong. They had booked a triple room but I over heard the staff telling them that they don't have any triple rooms. As they were with an 8 year old the parents had to be seperated and one had to stay with the chlild. So when i got up to the desk, i knew in advance there was going to be a problem as i had booked 1 double and you guessed it... one triple. I was told i had only booked a double until i showed them my booking form. So then they send us off to the lounge to wait to see what they can do. in the end we managed to get a 2 doubles and a single which was fine for us but if we had had a child we would have had the same problem as the previous couple. After talking to other people in the hotel, messing up the reservations seems quite normal. one family from australia had their 2 children in one room and the parents in another but the rooms were at total opposite ends of the hotel.The hotel in general is clean and in easy reach of paddington station. a hint though.... if there's 5 of you, get a taxi from euston instead of paying on the tube. they both cost £20 and a taxi is much more comfortable!The breakfast was ok, plenty to choose from, thought orange juice was foul. also make sure they don't try to charge you for english breakfast when you check out. we had booked it but they told us we had only booked a continental breakfast..... when you go down for breakfast there is a choice but you are not told that full english costs more!Another recommendation to the hotel is to get a lift installed ion the refurbished part of the hotel..... 6 flights of stairs 4 times a day is no fun for anyone, least of all the maids who have to drag up and down heavy loads of laundry!I'd recommend this hotel to back packers and 1 night stayers. we stayed for 2 and it was enough.	
Jul 7 2007 	Don't turn up late	I made the booking through [--]. I stated that I would be arriving late (after 10pm). I arrived at midnight. I was asked to fill in a registration card. The staff were dealing with multiple tasks at the same time, and kept leaving me to go &quot;out the back&quot;. Some minutes later, the fire alarm went off and every one of the staff decided they needed to be involved looking at the fire panel. Some few minutes later I had completed my card, then stood waiting while the reception answered phones. I really felt like I was being ignored. I then waited again to get my room key. I was then told that due to reburbishment of some rooms not being completed, that there were no rooms available. Did they really expect the refurbishment to be completed by 10pm, or did they just book the room to someone else since I didn't arrive until midnight?I was then told that they were trying to find me alternative accommodation at another hotel. I was told no hotels in the area had vacancies, and would have to go to a hotel in Earls Court. It was now 12.30am. A car is called to take me there, then I hear that no, I am not going to Earls Court, I am going to the Shaftesbury Hyde Park Hotel, and a car would be there soon. The car arrived at 12.40am, and then there was confusion about the address. The driver was told... &quot;it's just near Queensway&quot;. He insisted on being given the full address (I can understand why!). So, some one hour later I arrived at the alternative hotel.So, they knew I was arriving late, but did not arrange alternative accommodation BEFORE I arrived. When I did arrive, everything was completely disorganised, it took 45 minutes to sort it out. .Following this, I emailed the hotel twice to ask for a further explanation, and have so far received no reply. I won't be staying here again.	
Jul 6 2007 	Good location Poor hotel	We arrived in London on 1 June 2007 and stayed at the Sister Hotel in Bayswater. Our month long vacation required us to book an additional three days at the end of June to do some further sight seeing. We booked the Paddington on the 3 June for three nights ( 26,27, 28 June ) , had our confirmation number and when we arrived we were informed we were being shuttled to a different hotel due to &quot; construction problems&quot;. We were re located to the Hilton Kensington -- Great -- No this place looks great but we were treated as second class guests. The last two nights we were shuttled back to Paddington only to stay in a room that was ten feet by ten feet. We had no place to put our luggage. -- The staff suggested we could store it in their storage room -- This is an ok hotel for the business traveller but not for people vacationing with luggage. We stayed in the newly renovated room but found the bathroon very small and poor lighting. It ws very difficult to have addequate lighting for my wife to apply her makeup.  We paid 169 pounds ( $325 Canadian) per night for this cubby hole. Would not stay here again and will probably not consider Best Western chain for future vacations.	
Jul 2 2007 	Not as bad as you might think	We stayed three nights in this hotel in June 2007. We had three rooms at the hotel. One room was a very small room the needed some work. One room was very nice and large by comparison to other London hotels I have stayed. The last room was in the newly renovated part of the hotel. It was very nice. We had read so many terrible things about the hotel so we were not looking forward to our stay here, but it turned out to not be near as bad as every said. Everyone seems to complain about the desk being across the street, it is not like the street is a major freeway. It is a quiet, not busy street in Paddington. I would stay here again if ever in London.	
Jun 7 2007 	small but nice	We booked through central-london apartments to get a studio suite. When we arrived late, we got stuck with this really really tiny room that was really only big enough to fit a double bed and a sink. The bathroom wasn't too bad. When I tried to test my adapter the room's circuit almost blew up and all the lights turned off. We quickly ran over to the front desk and they helped us fix the circuit ... kinda. Our lights were not properly working still, but since we arrived late (11 pm) they could not move us to another room until the following day. The following day there was a different staff at the front desk so they were not aware of our situation entirely. They knew we had to move but we had to explain to them about our fizzing circuit. They assured us that they would have an engineer look at it and if we needed to, they would move our stuff for us to another room. We also asked them about an adapter and they said they would have that ready for us as well.When we arrived we were informed that they moved our stuff to another room (see pix), which was much nicer and had no circuit problems and gave us an adapter. Overall, the staff was friendly, the location is not too bad (about a couple of blocks away from lancaster gate and paddington tube stations). There's a convenient and cheap deli you can go to for breakfast around the corner as well as many other restaurants. I'd recommend this hotel. Just be aware of if you have a late check in...	
Jun 5 2007 	Beware	I stayed at this hotel and it was horrible. I wouldn't refer it to my worst enemy. At first we were put in a hotel room across the road. The room was super small, the walls were dirty and the blankets were ratty. The closet door wouldn't close and it was very dim. The telephone would not work so every time there was an issue I had to walk to the front desk in the rain and cold. Also the HEAT WAS NOT WORKING! I asked to move to another room and they said they were booked but would move me the next day. The other room was newer but the shower was so small that you could not turn around. I asked for an adapter each day and was told that they were out. I was very dissapointed in this hotel. Save your pennies and stay at the * up the street.	
May 30 2007 	cheap but not great value	We chose this hotel as it was the cheapest we could find that looked nice and had ok reviews. The pictures on the web are of the rooms in the main building, we were put in a building across the road from the main hotel and this was in much need of updating. The room was clean although very small, only just enough room to squeeze in the double bed. We had to put the kettle on the floor to make a cup of tea as the wire would not reach to the only plug socket. Also the shower door did not shut although there was plenty of hot water.Don't book a breakfast in advance, it was advertised at £15 each but when we arrived we were offered breakfast at half this price. During breakfast they were constantly running out of food and staff were slow to replenish it although the standard of food was good.The hotel is in a good location as it is approximately a 6-7minute walk from Paddington station.	
May 28 2007	Stay Elsewhere if can	If you can find other comparably priced hotels to stay in London, do so. The Padding Court Hotel in London is not a good choice no matter the price. We arrived at the hotel as part of a large family reunion of at least 60 people. I would have expected the hotel to be ready for our large party as they knew we were coming, and we were also 2 hours behind schedule due to a delayed flight. When we did arrive, the staff had no idea what to do with us. Getting our room keys and trying to find our luggage turned into a stressful event. Some people in our party had disabilites and had asked for rooms that did not require stair access but turned out being given rooms that required at least half a flight of stairs just to get to the front door. The manager and front desk staff were cold and indifferent and were never able to give us accurate information. When I asked if the changing of the guard was taking place a specific day, I was informed no only to arrive at Buckingham Palace with the changing of the guard going on. The rooms are terrible! I do mean terrible unless you are lucky enough to be a large family and given one of the suites across the street from the main hotel. A large renovation has just gone on making the rooms smaller than anything I have ever seen. My husband and I had to crawl across the bed to access either side of the room. There was not enough space for the 2 of us and a bag a piece especially since there was no place to put the bags. It looks like they took the size of a normal hotel room and cut it in half. The bathroom is even smaller with a stand up shower that can barely fit a 6'2&quot; man. The only pluses going for this hotel are the free internet access in the lounge and the buffet breakfast. The breakfast offers a large array of cereals, pastries, juices, fruit, eggs, and ham. The downside of breakfast is that the restaurant is located in the basement where too many tables have been crowded into a small space so you have to eat with your elbows attached to your side. Because of the renovations, other problems exist in other parts of the hotel. We heard stories about phones not working, the walls being too thin so every cough, laugh, or opening door could be heard by the 3 adjoining rooms, strong paint smells etc. If we could have changed hotels, we would have. The biggest plus is the location. The hotel is between 2 different tube stops, Padding and Lancaster Gate, which is conveinent. There are also several great pubs and Italian and Indian restaurants within walking distance. If you need/want to stay in the Paddinton area, there are so many other hotels to choose from. Stay away from this one.	
May 25 2007 	Perfectly Decent Very Reasonably Priced	This is not a four-star hotel. The rooms are small and the service is harried. But it's clean, the furniture is modern, the air conditioning and broadband work well, and it's very conveniently located. I f you intend to hang around in your room or are bothered by minor imperfections, you'll want to stay somewhere else. But if a clean, reasonably priced place to sleep is what you want, this is just fine.	
May 20 2007 	Can t understand what the complains are about	After reading the reviews for this hotel I was a bit worried about staying here. But now I can honestly say I don t know what all the fuss is about,I suppose you just can t please everyone and some people are nt happy unless their moaning and complaining.unfortunately i fell over and damaged my ankle so had to leave after only one day , the reception staff gave us a full refund for the remaining 2 nights we should have stayed there,the staff were very helpful,friendly,and also spoke good english (so what if they didnt you only need to go to reception to check in and out).And they arranged a taxi for us to go to euston station at a very reasonable priceOn the whole I found this hotel to be very clean,modern,and my room was fantastic with all mod cons ,their was a plasma tv on the wall,very modern decor ,lighting e.t.c,the bathroom was great aswell very modern and most importantley spotlessly clean.So I would nt take too much notice of the wingers and let them put you off this very excellent 3* hotel(If you want something top class go to the Ritz or The Hilton)The location was fantastic lots of little shops and restaurants and little cafes if you want a good english breakfast for £2.99.I have stayed in other 3* hotels in european cities ,mainly Paris and Amsterdam and this is by far the best, and I will definately be going back.	
May 2 2007 	Stay away from this hotel	The receiption people are far below what should be excpected when arriving a hotel. We arrived late in the evening and were told that they could not find any resevations, despite I called the day before to assure that the booking, done 4 months ago, was OK. The hotel was full, and after 1 hour they sent us with a taxi to a hotel near Marble Arch (they said). It appeared that the hotel was in Kilburn far from central London. We went back to the Best Western Paddington asked why they were lying, but instead of an apologize, we were told that we had misunderstood the situation. After a lot of argueing we were told that we could stay 2 nights in Kilburn and then be pick up 10 a.m. in the Kilburn hotel. Our rooms should also be upgraded to suites when we returned. Both the pickup and the upgrade was written down and signed by the reception manager on request from me. At 3 a.m we were installed in a very nice and service minded hotel in Kilburn. Sunday, when we should return to Paddington, we had the receiption in Kilburn to call Best Western Paddington to assure that a car was sent to pick us up. After 8 calls they finaly got hold of the head receptionist, but he did not know anything about sending a car for picking us up. After a lot of new arguing and lies, he sent a car that picked us up 11 a.m. The upgrade to suits was what I would call a joke. The room was so small that just one suitcase could be opened at the same time, and in the breakfast room it was queue for about half an hour to be seated. The only positive about this hotel is the location and the room cleaning. Unfortunately that was not enough to save a 4 days stay in London from beeing like a nightmare.Displeased visitor from Oslo, Norway.	
Apr 27 2007 	Noise no Sleep and Poor Facilities	Stayed here at the end of April 2007. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!I was put into one of the &quot;suites&quot; across the road from the main building, room 653. It is in fact a very small basement room with one window looking into two other toilet windows and at the bottom of a dirty vertical gap about 8 feet square.Do not be tempted to open the windows as the downpipes for rainwatrer are corroded and leaking and the sound of even light rain cascading down wakes you up. This means you have to ensure the windows are closed. If you put the air-conditioning on it freezees up around 3'ish in the morning and makes a very loud dripping onto the carpet. (and lovely wet socks the next morning)The TV did not work initially and needed to be tuned into the 5 channels available and a couple of frozen digital channels. This takes about 10 mins every time, annoying if you come in wanting to see a particular program . Then again you would end up with a crick in your neck as the TV is installed at a slant. Why ?Slight personal moan here, if you need glasses to read, then the lighting will not be enough to allow you to read without straining. I had to remove the lampshade to read, even the natural light was dimHave a wash or shave? Not unless you have the tap running continually. The plug for the sink was missing and despite 5 requests over 3 days and promises that it would be sorted, nothing was done. That I think epitomises the standards of this hotel !If you are late in and want a drink, forget it , the bar closes at 11. However there is a do not disturb card that you can use, if only there was a handle to hang it on.Do NOT expect to get any sleep after about 07:30. The noise is incredible with people walking above, cleaning staff (I think)dragging and banging stuff around for about an hour.Breakfast is open till 10 and is nothing special, not quite poor, but close. Be aware of when you are checking out as I was charged for extra breakfasts that I could not have physically managed.Overall I was there for three nights, got broken sleep EVERY night, woken up EVERY morning, could not get a drink and a very poor service indeed. Thank goodness that there are lots of restaurantas in the area I have stopped in many B&amp;B's that offer better facilities than here I think Best Western are using an a superlative without reason	
Apr 23 2007 	You can hear the neighbours talk!	So expensive for so little! The rooms are ok, but tiny, tiny. The worst thing was that you actually hear ANYTHING the neighbours talk about. ..oh, and the breakfast is not to be recommended. The area is nice, though.	
Mar 30 2007 	I was very satisfied with this hotel	I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The room was small but it was clean and neat. The temperature in the room was easily ajustable and there were windows that could be opened.There was instant coffee and tea bags provided and an electrical waterheater to heat up the water in seconds. There was free internet service which was nice ( although very slow ) and when the keyboard was not working and I called the desk , somebody was send up immediately to check out what the problem was ( it needed new batteries, which were provided) The bathroom was nice with a tiny shower but in perfect working order, some very nice fluffy and supersized towels and a hairdryer. Continental breakfast was included ( mixed fresh fruit, yoghurt, cold sausage slices, cheese, a variety of sweet rolls, bread, orange juice and coffee ). I was told that my breakfast could be upgraded if I wished for 5 pounds more and than I could have eggs, bacon and potatoes included. I found the hotel staff extremely friendly and helpfull ( when I asked for a converter for my camera and at first was told that they didn't have any for my american camera, somebody knocked on my door about 30 minutes later to tell me they had found one). The location was very good ( in walking distance from Paddington Station) and next to a cozy street with lots of restaurants and shops.	
Mar 28 2007 	Fair for the price	I stayed here for five nights in mid-March. The pluses: the staff was very friendly and courteous, it is a very short walk from the Paddington Train station (which you take directly from Heathrow), and it is in a good location. Hyde Park and Kensington Park are two blocks away, and there are lots of little cafes nearby. It was very quiet yet near lots of sights. The hotel also provided internet access in the main area, as well as wifi. The negatives: the &quot;lift&quot; was broken, which meant we had to hoof it up four flights of stairs (which was kind of a pain after walking and seeing the sights all day), the showers were TINY (ie, if you moved slightly your body touched the shower curtain), and the comforters on the beds appeared to have stains on them. Although I enjoyed my stay in London, I will probably not go back to this hotel. I would definitely stay in the surrounding area. We got a fantastic rate so I am not too disappointed in the hotel.	
Mar 15 2007 	They Should Close Down for Construction	I agree that it is always better to come here first before reserving a room! I didn't know anything about London but knew I wanted a certain location which would be good to walk to many attractions.This area is perfect. It is residential so you feel like a local walking the streets. There is a pharmacy and little cafes closeby, Paddington Station was an easy walk so the Heathrow Express worked out great. The best thing was that you are only a few blocks from Hyde Park, which is perfect for kids.Saying this, there are several hotels in the area. I would recommend the same area but ANOTHER hotel.It is true that the staff do not speak English. They are not polite and are not helpful. Thankfully, my husband and I travel internationally a lot and even with two small children are pretty self sufficient. I was annoyed that I requested an early checkin (as we had an all night flight) and a crib (I even emailed to confirm a week in advance, with no reply). They seemed to have confused our reservation...wanted us to have a double with no crib and wanted us to wait until 2:00 for check in time. I finally spoke up and said that we booked through British Air, booked a Triple with crib and an early checkin. They said that maybe we could get in around 1:00.Our room was a triple...it was neat and clean. The bathroom was large, I thought. Our crib was not waiting for us, we had to ask again for it.The biggest problem I have is that after I made the reservation (months ago), a week before my trip, I received an email from British Air saying that the hotel advised them that there would be some &quot;slight construction&quot; but that the workers were instructed to work only during &quot;regular business hours&quot; so as not to affect the guests.Listen. The construction is not limited to one area only. They start early in the morning. So you may be asleep at 7 am (that would be 2 AM eastern time!!!!!!!!) and suddenly a chainsaw starts right outside your window. Or you could be relaxing on a Saturday morning and at 7 am, someone hammers on the floor above you. The walls are super thin which I can deal with when it's only talking or tv on the other side of them but demolition is not something I want to hear first thing in the morning.Their construction project is extensive. They really should've shut down until they could finish but I get the feeling they are too cheap to do so. I think they feel they can sucker people in with polite and vague warnings.So stay in the area...it's beautiful~ Stay away from Best Western Paddington Court.	
Mar 14 2007 	Left with a sour taste	I spent 4 nights here and left feeling the experience could have been better. The room was fine - it was in the building across the road from reception - but in the basement. I had problems finding the door as it was behind another unmarked door. It was clean, but the TV Internet did not work even after a complaint. The bathroom was not bad, but the shower leaked onto the floor and the sink tap was partly blocked so it squirted sideways and got me wet whenever I used it. The rest of the room was fine with a comfortable bed, a desk, heaters, and a nice little kitchen bench with fridge and coffee making facilities.Breakfasts were reasonable. But we needed to navigate the redecoration mess to get to the restaurant. I had continental each day, and this was part of the price. However, on checkout they charged for a full breakfast and no amount of arguing would persuade them that this should not be paid. It was &quot;in their system&quot;. I was with a group of 8 and, I some of the others were &quot;taxed&quot; for the same amount. I was extremely upset at this and is the reason I would never go there again, and I would warn potential guests that this could happen. I would also suggest that if you take a taxi from the hotel, do not use the service &quot;recommended&quot; by the hotel staff. We took 2 taxis to Gatwick, and the drivers would not take credit cards, and they wanted to charge us 300 euro!! We managed to find 130 GBP for the 2 taxis. Location was OK but there's nothing really to see in Paddington anyway, except for the station and the underground. in summary, there's no real reason to recommend this hotel.	
Mar 13 2007 	Would not stay in this hotel again	We required two rooms for our family. Neither room had a tub and the shower was so small, my children had trouble staying in! It took over 20 minutes for the hot water to come up, the walls are paper thin and grungy. Not at all what I expected from a Best Western.	
Mar 10 2007 	Cheap and convenient	For the price we paid this hotel was fine! Rooms are clean with towels supplied, pretty small but we only wanted somewhere to sleep and get clean so it served it's purpose. It is a bit like a rabbit warren, many corridors! Breakfast was fine with hot food brought through regularly. Lots of restaurants surrounding hotel - good Indian and Lebonese.At most a 5 minute walk from Lancaster Gate tube (even with luggage). It was approx. 10 minute stroll to Oxford Street through the park.Overall the hotel is in a convenient location easy to get to from Paddington or Victoria - however, if you spend lots of time in the room or intend to dance in it this is not the place for you!	
Feb 21 2007	Don't waste your money here!	I really wish I'd checked this website before booking this place!!We were given a room on sublevel 1. That means the Basement level. Not much daylight. What kind of hotel puts its best western gold crown club member guests on the basement level?! This one!!To get to the room we had to go through no less than 7 fire doors through VERY small corridors and hallways with used plates and trays lying on the floor, so quite difficult to get your luggage through. The room is TINY. Couldn't even open the suitcase properly as there was no room. All website room pictures are from their suites in their adjacent property across the road!Water cooker not working, electricity socket needed to be replaced, remote control broken, hair dryer missing, window latch broken. Bathroom repairman had installed some water pipes OUTSIDE the wall rather than IN THE WALL. No mixer taps. Dirty shower curtain. The list goes on and on.On 3 occasions in 6 days the hot water stopped working. From previous reviews I notice that this is an ongoing problem. Also, it doesn't seem to make much difference on what floor you're on as all the rooms are miniscule. Breakfast was a nightmare too. Long queues of hungry people with nothing being brought out and rude restaurant staff who don't speak a world of English. (This is England after all).It's about a 10 minute walk to tube station of Lancaster gate - not a very nice tube station, far away from the city centre, which frequently is overcrowded as all there is in this area is hundreds of &quot;budget hotels&quot; which still charge extortionate prices. Trust me, if you shop around your money can go A LOT further than this poor excuse for a hotel. You can get a much nicer place a lot closer to town centre for the same money. I can't believe best western doesn't read these internet reviews and take away their name branding from this branch which clearly doesn't deserve it.I don't think there's anything positive I can say about this place. Take you money elsewhere and complain to best western head office if you've stayed here.Ever since my stay here I now always check the hotel reviews online for wherever I'm going before I book anything.	
Feb 20 2007	Good place to stay	My husband and I go down to London every year for our wedding anniversary and I always book a hotel online. I found the Paddington Court on a few websites and thought it was in a good location and was clean,which are the most important things to me. We arrived at the hotel on the evening of Feb 13th, about 7.30pm,booking in didn't take long and we were shown to our room by a polite member of staff. Our room was very well equipted and although not massive,was plenty big enough for a base (which is all you really need when you visit London). All the equiptment in the room was in good working order and of good quality. This hotel was clean,the staff were polite and friendly and the breakfast was very nice.I would recommend this hotel as an excellent place to stay for a visit to London and will book again!	
Feb 18 2007 	Great!!! as long as you dont have to deal with reception to often (Book a suite)	We are a family of 4 and we booked to stay in an executive suite. The rooms are a good enough size - esp for London - and the kitchenette was godsend considering we have a 6month old baby! The only problems we had were if we needed something specific - the recpetion staff are hopeless and a cannot speak or understand good english. When we arrived we lugged everything up to the 3rd floor to find the room we were was occupied - that was ok as the guy on recep was only training and the girl was so rude to him - like ' i told you that was occupied!' V rude! No sheets were left for using the sofabed and the cot wasn't put up. the final thing we thought was so funny - out room key wouldnt work so we had to get a it reactivated - apparently the underground deactivates the key !!! LOL the hotel breakfast is great and the room (as long as its a suite, are a good size) I would reccommend this esp to families.	
Feb 13 2007 	possibly the smallest room ever	stayed in this hotel for one night on the 10 feb 2007. The room was tiny you could't even walk around the bed which was not even a full size double. The hotel is very tired and really needs the facelit which is underway. The staff are very unprofessional and had a queue of people with mucked up reservation some from far afield with no where to stay. so we put up with our small room and was glad to get out	
Jan 29 2007 	Do not stay here	This was one of the worst places I ever stayed..and is proof that hotel websites are not to be trusted. My friend and I (two girls) booked in for 4 nights...we arrived off the plane from Dublin to get there around 12.30 and were told our rooms weren't ready. We didn't feel that it was safe to leave our bags at reception - a girl working there was having an argument with someone (they were both speaking a foreign language, it was a fairly heated argument). Anyhow, we had to wait around till room was ready. At that stage, I wanted to move hotels but we had pre-paid on the credit card so couldn't really leave. We were shown to a room on the second floor - it hadn't been cleaned yet and quite frankly it was disgusting. The wallpaper was dirty in places, the furniture was pulled out of place for some reason (I believe repairs were taking place to a light switch) and the bed was barely made either. I told reception we would not stay in that room and we were instead given a room right at the top of the hotel - to get to it we had to go through a fire door and along a fire exit type of structure. It was a bit tricky to get our luggage along the catwalk part (and I felt that neither of us could get too tipsy in order to get back to our room). It was a tiny room, twin beds wedged in, old fashioned shower close by and a toilet too. It's good that my friend and I get on because we didn't have much choice in the following few days. There was no air-con and the window was sticky to open, this was bad as I get migraines if the air is too stuffy so this happened a bit over the few days. We didn't venture down for breakfast as going by the rest of the hotel, we weren't thrilled with the cleanliness etc. Anyhow, it's up to you - it's an ok price and people say it doesn't matter what your room is like as you're too busy in London. Well, safety and cleanliness are two things I expect in a hotel and I won't stay anywhere dirty or dangerous. I felt this was the case with this hotel. The only plus is the price and the location but neither matter when you're not happy with the room.	
Jan 25 2007 	Clean + Convenient	Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend with a friend to see the sights and for some shopping. In walking distance of numerous tube stations which can get you to anywhere in London. Room clean but bit small with all the usual facilities. Price for the room was very reasonable. Would recommend this hotel for any young travellers.	
Jan 24 2007 	Not as bad as other reviews suggest	Positive: Good breakfast, reasonalbe location near Lancaster Gate tube station (5 mins walk). Free wired broadband in room. Clean enough. Noon checkout. For £49 per night (inc breakfast) you can't expect perfection.Negative: Slloooooooooooww check-in. Small rooms. A bit tatty in places - the aircon pipework and cabling in the corridors looks awful. Very poor signage - you will probably get lost looking for the restaurant - although building works were in progress none of the staff seemed to have had the initiative to put up any tempoary signs.	
Jan 23 2007 	Dreadful building site	I do not recomend this hotel - a building site in January 2007. touble with locks on room doors, no hot water, shabby decor in bedrooms, damp smells. small room, small bathrooms, no service after 11 pm in reception. Cold rooms and no wy of altering the heating controls and then they have the nerve to charge an extra £7 if you want cooked food at breakfast. DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH.	
Jan 19 2007 	better than expected	I have to say we didn't expect much after the reviews, but we got such a great deal through Britsh Airways, that we decided to go for it anyway. The rooms are small, what we expected in London. The hotel is located in a nice area--very close to paddington train stop, which is a good stop for heathrow express and the tube. The breakfast included was good. We did have a water situation on our last day and were trasferred immediately to a &quot;suite&quot;. This new room was across the street and even though it had a kitchenette, it felt smaller than our first room. I would not recommend paying extra for a suite unless you are planning on cooking a bunch to save food costs. there wasn't even space to keep our bags out. All in all the hotel was pleasant and I would recommend it especially if you are getting it as cheaply as we did through a BA deal.	
Jan 1 2007	Had a good laugh at the size of the room.	The staff at this hotel were very nice. They were the best thing about the whole place and tried their best to look after us. The room was the smallest we had ever seen - I actually had to climb into bed over the end of the bed! The shower was tiny. The email/TV did not work. We were given a filthy towel (and I mean filthy!!!) instead of a clean one on one of the mornings we were there.Location was good.	
Dec 19 2006 	Don't take the risk	My stay at this hotel was one of the most unpleasant ones in my personal hotel history, not only because of problems encountered at the hotel but also because of the staff's attitude.The first problem was that when I got up in the morning the aircon/heating didn't work. No way to make it work. Considering that outside it was about 4ºC, you can imagine that the room was quite chilly. So I hoped that a shower would warm me up. However, that proved to be impossible, because something was wrong with the temperature control, the water came out boiling or freezing, no intermediate option. I tried every possible position of the control and almost got burnt in the process, but nothing. Finally I realized that it was impossible. I reported all that to the person at the reception, he apologized but wasn't able to offer any solution.After all that I suggested the hotel staff that I shouldn't be charged the full rate, considering that I paid for facilities which I couldn't use (such as heating and private shower), and having to leave the hotel feeling cold and uncomfortable. When I chose the Paddington Court Hotel for my stay, I thought that the Best Western brand should be a guarantee for a pleasant stay, but unfortunately that was not the case. I complained twice in writing, but there was no kind of response (after reading other reviews here, I think I get their point, why should they care about customers??).I will definitely not go back to this hotel and of course will try to avoid any other Best Western Hotel.	
Dec 16 2006 	Awful Rooms!!	Wow, what a terrible place. Just got back from a 1 night stay. Staff very pleasant I must say. 1st room we were given was a suite, it was just disgusting, we were moved to a sister hotel around the corner to a newly refurbished room on the top floor. THE LIFT WAS OUT OF ORDER, and apparently has been for weeks. The room was lovely but the smallest we have ever stayed in. All in all a stressful experience, you are definately not a guest but a number in this place. Never again.	
Nov 27 2006 	No bugs and could be value for money!	Ok, I wrote earlier that I probably would not stay here again. After a business trip I ordered three nights private. The best offer was Paddington Court Suites through www.laterooms.co.uk at 80£ pr night. I called the hotel to ensure they had reserved a suite for me. I was worried about the bugs. The porter guaranteed the pest control had approved room 503. I was then offered a room in the basement. I could not get into this room due to a faulty el-lock. Then to room 555, still in the basement A large and nice double room. Was not to comfy down there, so the next morning I asked politely for a room higher up. I was given 501, another nice double room. A bit to close to main front door, but I settled down.Here is the advice for Paddington Court: Book a suite, ground floor or higher. You will get one of the best hotel values in London. A suite with air con, kitchen, Internet and comfy bed in a quiet location. Clean and modern.The hotel part of Paddington Court Hotel, used to be great value. New management/owner has neglected the service. I can see the staff is overworked and they are doing their very best. They are mostly east European and probably dont dare to complain. I wish the Best Western administration would visit and advice this hotel in their chain.Again: Make sure you book a suite and enjoy some of the best hotel value in London.Moen Sandnes	
Nov 25 2006	Disaster - Will not go there again	Having booked 5 rooms for two clients and 3 colleagues, at the Paddington Court Hotel, on the internet several weeks before an awards event in London. On arriving at the hotel at 5.30pm to get to the event at 6.30pm we were told that our rooms could not be used (probably double booked) and that we had ben booked into a hotel around the corner. The money was taken from my company credit card and we were pushed off to the alternative hotel. The hotel was not expecting us but gave us 5 rooms which were substandard and then I learned that the room rate was half of what had been taken from my card.The stay was a disaster and I would never book with Best Western again and would certainly never go near the Paddington Court Hotel.	
Nov 13 2006 	What a Pleasant Surprise	Cant believe this was a Best Western. I think I found the perfect budget/business hotel in London after searching for seven years.I travel on business but I have my own firm so I keep the budget low- I try to stay close to 100 GBP / night in London. I try to stay exclusively in nice Best Westerns or cheap (four-star) Hiltons, to accumulate points on each.I booked a double bed/superior room at the Paddington for 89 GBP. When I arrived they had given me a complimentary upgrade to a suite (which is actually in the building across the road from the hotel entrance). As opposed to many hotels the room was exactly as pictured on the hotel website- the one with the beech-colored table and TV sticking out in front of the bed. On the other side of the room was a sofa and small kitchenette. Parquet floor. Everything extremely clean and modern. A far cry from the dingy, musty London hotels Ive stayed in (including the four-star Hiltons) and a much better room rate. I asked at checkout how much the suite would have cost- they said 120 GBP- in my opinion still a bargain.Oh, and its literally a five-minute straight-line walk from Paddington station- so no need to take the Tube or a taxi if you have a rolling suitcase and come into town via the Heathrow Express, and five minute walk to the tube. If you take the Heathrow Express, just continue off the train by foot, head to left-hand corner of the station, up the ramp (outdoors)- thats Craven Road. Walk to your right on Craven Road for about four blocks and youre at the hotel.I would definitely recommend it and plan t	
Oct 24 2006	lovely but small	I recently stayed at the best western paddington court, and after reviewing the reviews i have to stay i simply dont agree. Yes the rooms are a bit compact, but in london unless your paying extorsion prices what to expect? the staff were kind, warming and helpfull. The cleanliness was up to a very good high standard. i would definitly stay at this hotel again. it is also located excellently, a mere 2 minute walk from the paddington station, which offers numerous tube lines to get about. EXCELLENT!!!!	
Oct 17 2006 	nice little room	Not quite sure if I went to the same hotel as everyone else, as I was quite impressed! Got a good deal online, the room was very small, we were falling over each other but for a couple of nights it was fine. The room was v clean and everything worked unlike some other hotels i've stayed in. Would defiantely stay there again. Not luxury but good value for what I paid.	
Oct 15 2006	Never Again	Hotel staff was friendly, but the room was not what I expected. The room and bathroom were small. The room was clean, but the smell in the hallway was gross. We complained about the smell and nothing was done. The walls seemed to be paper thin also. Very noisy.Generally, this hotel was ok, but I would never stay there again.	
Oct 9 2006 	a good hotel	I stayed at this hotel back in January 2006 and have to say my friend and I had no problems with it. The rate we paid was good for London and comparing it to other hotels we seen in the area it was good value all round. The rooms weren't that small. We had a standard twin room and there was enough space for both our suitcases. The bathroom was clean and wasn't as small as some others say. The hotel is located 5 mins from Lancaster gate tube station and 5 mins away from Paddington station so location is excellent. There was also plenty places nearby where you could have a nice breakfast or lunch for a cheap price. The only problem I had with the hotel was my outer sheet on my bed had a cigarette burn which was really revolting especially for a non-smoker. We had a non-smoking room but could still smell smoke from other parts of the hotel. The fire alarm went off a few times and we were told this was because of smokers in their rooms. This was annoying again.However hotel is good quality price for London and i would definently stay in it again.	
Oct 4 2006 	Suites are good value	Overall very happy with the Suites side of the hotel. A tip if you book via laterooms.com - Hotel thought we had booked a hotel room not a suite. I took the hotel room to throw my bags in and then the manager gave me their internet terminal so I could check my booking. He showed me the fax through from Laterooms and it did look like the std hotel room. Showed the manager the web page I booked from and we managed to decipher from the website and the fax via a few key words on the fax that I should be in a suite. They immediately moved me into a suite.Standard suite is small but nice modern decor and very clean. Bed comfortable, air cond worked. Bathroom small but ok. Free toiletries included. 24 hr reception. Wake calls booked daily and were actioned. Room was cleaned to a high standard everyday and toiletries and coffee etc were always replenished. New towels everyday. Big bath sheet towels provided. Kitchenette was useful. Broadband LAN internet access provided free. TV and TV Internet free. Swipe cards to enter suites building and the room so very secure. Safe provided. No problem with valuables not in safe. We paid 79GPB per night. If you want a big room expect to pay a lot more in London.We stayed for a week (2 adults). Room is small but that's London! Good location 5 mins walk to Paddington Underground and trains. Reception staff were helpful and professional. Only issue during our stay was a loss of Broadband internet for a few days to all their hotels due to their ISP. Wireless still available. Staff let me use their back office internet which was direct line from a different ISP. Also as I got to see their Hotel standard room for about half an hour I can attest that it was clean but small.We were on the ground floor towards the back and never had any noise issues. We would happily stay here again. Clearly from the reviews people are assessing two different products hotel and suites. I would recommend paying a little extra and booking a suite.	
Oct 4 2006 	Worst Hotel I Ever Stayed In	Room I was given not only did not match the description I had booked against, but was the worst hotel room I have ever seen - small and squalid. Advert said newly renovated, free broadband, kitchenette, no smoking - room stunk of smoke, felt dirty, had definitely not been renovated or even decorated for at least 20 years, no kitchenette, internet access did not work (I tried to log on to download the advert as evidence). When I complained I was told I was wrong and all standard rooms were like that. Had to get my booking company to fax a copy of the advert to the hotel before they would move me to an adequate room (I will not call it more than that), which was down a dangerous set of stairs and was another very small smoking room with no internet access, and it was very noisy. I would rather commute the 4 hours each way and stay at home than stay another night in that hotel!	
Oct 1 2006 	Left a Day Earlier! Terrible!	The staff was horrible....no one paid attention to anything...the rooms were dirty, the tv didn't work and even though I called the reception 3 times no one ever came, the keys to my door never worked, and I was put in the basement until I requested my room to be changed that wasn't much better. I saw bugs in the bathroom and on my bed.Even though I paid in advance I left a day early and went to another hotel.Terrible!!	
Sep 21 2006	Won't stay here	First of all we did not stay here but we were thinking of it. My wife and I are planning a trip to the UK to celebrate our 50th anniversary next spring. As we can get Best Western Travel Cards through our Air Miles program we were looking for a BW hotel in London. After reading a fair amount of negative reviews on Trip Advisor we had some concerns about the Paddington. I therefore sent an e-mail to them asking four simple questions, rates, decent room etc. I did not receive an answer and sent it 3 more times Still no answer. I then sent an e-mail to central BW booking asking for help. A lady there , Laura, phoned the Paddington asking them to reply to me. They then sent an e-mail to HER quoting her a price for twin room for 99 pounds a night. They the offered HER an anniversary special 0f 139 pounds a night and they would place flowers in the room and chocolates and serve breakfast On the bed. Such a deal! As they had not answered all my questions Laura again phoned them and then forwarded their answers to me. Obviously this Hotel either has too much business or needs a good public relations person. Needless to say we will not be staying at the Best Western Paddington.Ron Fagg Sorrento BC Canada	
Sep 17 2006 	Not high standard	Location good but there were a few niggles. Broken tap and cracked basin. Temperature control on shower broken resulting in near scalding. Tiny shower room. Air conditioning in room which doesn't work. Hair drier worked for about 20 seconds before over heating. Advertised as being refurbished with high standards of decor but that certainly didn't apply to corridors! Cables hanging out over most rooms.Complaint got me a free breakfast [worth just over £5!!]	
Sep 16 2006	Cheap Sleep but with a Price	After years of staying at affordable (cheap) hotels in London I consider myself an expert. This hotel goes at the bottom of my list. I booked a single room for 3 nights which turned out to be down a maze of very narrow hallways and questionable stairs.The room turned out to 6ft by 10ft, (I measured it). I think this is about the size of a prison cell. However, compared to the bathroom, the sleeping area was a suite.. At 1$120.00 US a bench in nearby Hyde Park would be an improvement.I have not slept in such a small space since I drank too much wine one night and fell asleep on my bathroom floor.Now the bath....one small bar of soap for 3 days, one plastic drinking glass which unfortunately I tossed and was not replaced.Now the bed....ok, if you like sleeping with a depression in the middle.OK so at least the room was reasonably clean, that is if you immediately remove the bed spread and stuff it under the bed.In short, I have stayed at some reallly &quot;quaint&quot; places all over the world but this was even too much for me.FYI.. looking for an affordable sleep in London try the Phoenix Hotel nearby. I have been there many times and was never disappointed.LDF	
Sep 15 2006	Terrible terrible terrible.	Worst hotel experience ever. Tiny and stuffy rooms. Staff most unhelpful and with a very bad attitude. The only thing that worked about the elevators was the alarm, which sounded loud all night long. Smell of urine on the stairs to the room. Staff took 15 mn to figure out whether breakfast was included. They eventually told us it was, but the restaurant charged us anyway. Good location. Close to Paddigton (5 mn walk), but there are lots of hotel in the area. Avoid at all costs. We wished we had read the other negative reviews before booking.	
Sep 13 2006 	An upgrade makes all the difference	We booked our stay through Octopus travel for an excellent price but were contacted directly by the hotel a few days later to say there had been a mistake and that we would need to pay more to them. We agreed to pay an additional £40 in exchange for an upgrade to a suite and breakfast, which hadn't been included originally. We were anxious at these problems arising before we even arrived but in the end the rest of the trip worked out alright. The upgraded room (across the street from the main hotel and in a basement) was very comfortable and spacious and worth the initial inconvenience. It had a queen sized bed, and decent kitchen area, although the bathroom was somewhat cramped. There was an unpleasant smell in the corridor outside our room which thankfully stayed outside! The breakfast was a served cooked breakfast which suited us but only as we had it included in our upgrade - we wouldn't have been as impressed had we paid the full price for it (there's plenty of cheaper cafes nearby).The staff were very friendly and helpful - the concierge made travel enquiries for us and the rooms which were clean and fresh were serviced daily. The advantage of the suite was that we were able to enjoy the traditional London cuisine (fish and chips!) in the comfort of our room after our late arrival!The location was excellent in a nice area, with restaurants nearby but still quiet and relaxing. The only downside was a good ten minute walk to the nearest underground station and travel to central London could be slow. There were lovely parks to walk through if you had time to enjoy the area instead of hurrying on the tube.Overall our room and the hotel service was fine on this occasion although we wonder if we would have been satisfied with the standard room we had originally booked, as our upgraded room was really what we would expect from a standard room anyway.We don't have complaints about our stay this time but probably would look elsewhere next time anyway as we get the impression we were quite lucky on this occasion!	
Sep 12 2006 	worst hotel ever - very disapointed	we booked to stay here on the internet for 2 nights - saturday 9th and sunday the 10th of September. When we arrived at reception on the saturday we were told by the girl that the hotel was full and that we had to stay somewhere else! They said they would pay for our taxi to this other place - like that made a difference! Now we were extremely ennoyed but went in the taxi anyway to what I can only call a 2 star B*B up the other side of paddington station. This 2 star was extremely basic and the room was dark and old with just a porta cabin as a shower &amp; toilet! I won't slate the 2 star as it wasn't their fault but NO WAY should we of been sent here when we paid for the paddington court which is branded as a 3 star hotel. The same thing seemed to happen to an older couple who where checking in in front of us at the other hotel. We went back to the Paddington the next day and were told we'd be in a superior room to make up for beign moved but were in a tiny room with barely any room to move! No way could you stay here more than one night. The air con wasn't working and neither was the stupid broadband. We weren't even offered complimentary breakfast for being moved to another 'hotel'. We were also given our keys for the sunday night and went up to the room about 10.30 only to find someone in it! They never even told us to wait ti 12! A disaster of a hotel and no way would I recommend it to anyone!!	
Sep 10 2006 	Wouldn't stay here again.	Stayed here for one night in September and couldn't wait to leave. We had a double room that was perhaps the smallest I have ever stayed in. The side of the bed was positioned against a wall which meant having to climb over your other half if you needed to visit the bathroom. Mind you, there was no other alternative as the room was so small. Note, not all the rooms are as small as the one we had (based on fire escape floor plan layout on wall), so it may be worth asking to be moved if you do intend to spend more than one night here.Housekeeping came knocking on the door at 9.00am despite a midday checkout and again at 10.20am, so no chance of a lazy lie in if needed. The air conditioning unit did not appear to work and the wardrobe was entirely taken up by the ironing board.Positives: It was clean.	
Sep 7 2006	Worst waste of money despite location	We originally booked a 6 night stay at the London Elizabeth (which is wonderful and less expensive) but HotelsRUs lost our reservation the day before our departure from the US (29 August 06) and we were left with the BW Paddington Court. Below are listed the worst issues that need attention:1. lifts did not work 90% of the time - carrying heavy luggage up multiple levels was not fun2. rooms were very small - 3 twins when we booked a double??bath tiny - in this small space there were 2 standing fans and when I requested their removal, it took 6 calls to reception and 3 days.3. there are a/c units in walls - none are hooked up and there are exposed wires in the halls throughout the hotel. The hallways are so narrow that fire hazards are a major issue.4. our window looked onto the back of a residental area that was FILTHY - people throwing garbage from windows. One building was under construction and workers arrived (with boomboxes, etc.) before 7am on a Saturday. What a way to start your day.5. One morning i ordered coffee from room service, which never arrived and when I called to follow up was told that room service was closed for the morning. Another evening, we requested room service as advertised (24hours/day for light snacks) and was told that service was 'temporarily' not available.6. the bar and dining room are in the basement and do not have any type of ventilation - the bar smells of cigarettes even when empty and the dining room smells of curry (even if it is not on the menu). They are not open for the posted hours. 7. Daily: no face cloths - they gave us bath mats for the floors!After 1st night, used towels were taken away and no fresh towels provided until we complained. Cheap plastic glasses in the rooms and were not replaced when used. After requesting clean glasses daily, they finally brought 8! Clever, no?8. Hotel staff is very smiley but do not follow through - probably due to lack of understanding. No one spoke English fluently - making questions pointless. Had to go to the London Elizabeth to have travel/tube/etc. questions answered. This hotel is more like a youth hostel, which is fine if you are paying $20.00/night. One does not expect constant problems, especially in the UK. I will never use a website to book again and certainly intend to pursue this with Best Western.	
Sep 4 2006 	Very enjoyable stay	My family and I stayed at the Best Western Paddington Court Hotel a couple of weeks ago and we had a great stay.There were 7 of us altogether and we had three nicely furnished, well equipped rooms. i would recommend to anyone, families or business folk to stay here, we came from the US, and found the location to be a major bonus, it was a primary reason for staying here, plus the rates we got were good. Paddinton station is about 4 blocks from the hotel, all in all the journey from heathrow to the hotel took around 30 minutes, just great for a large group, especially with the kids. The facade of the hotel is just beautiful, as is most of paddington. I think they recently did some refurb work as the floor we were on was very modern and fresh looking, the reception is bright and spacious and very welcoming, we went down for breakfast one morning and there was a good selection fo hot and cold food, the bar seemed quiet though in the evening, cant have it all i guess! Highly recommended, very pleasant stay.	
Sep 3 2006 	Feels Like Home	Honestly, Id give it four stars and a half. I spent around a month at this hotel with my friend and the service was really nice, smiley faces were there to greet you every morning. We booked for a studio with a microwave, air-condition, and shower power. The air-condition did not work the first day but they apologized and moved us to a brighter room after two days with the same price. The room had all we needed and the best thing was the excellent use of free internet 24/7. The only thing that was annoying was finding a cockroach almost one per day because our room was in the basement, but beside that the room was cleaned everyday and nice flowers were arranged. The price we got through booking online was also great and they gave us a special offer when we wanted to extend our stay one more week. We would definitely book there again if we went to London. The area seemed very safe and quite. Close to the hotel were mini supermarkets, restaurants, Hyde Park and Oxford Street. The close Paddington Bus Station and Underground Station made it easy for us to move around form area to area.	
Aug 22 2006 	Excellent Customer Service	I stayed in the first week of August for 4 nights at the Best Western Paddington Court hotel on a business trip.Impressed with the customer focussed staff, their attention to details and above all the willingness to go that extra bit. Surprisingly after just 1 day everyone from restaurant staff to the manager knew me by my name and greeted me.Rooms are very well equipped with the modern facilities like free broadband internet and interactive television. Lounge and bar are equipped with free wi-fi internet access which made my business meetings very feasible.Location is great; just about 4 minutes walk from the Paddington train station, Queensway underground station, many restaurants and the Hyde Park.3 STAR HOTEL WITH 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICEI	
Aug 16 2006 	Too Expensive for such a Small Room	Stayed there for 3 nights in Jul of 06, Stayed in a Single room, I could stand in the middle of the room and touch both walls, Window would not open, to let out the heat, I could hear people in the rooms next to me talking, Front Deskstaff not very friendly and over worked.The location is great near paddington, Lots of Stores and restraunts in the area, I would stand in the Paddington area again, just not at this hotel	
Aug 14 2006	Worst hotel	We stayed one night at the Best Western in Paddinton in London and that was one night too many. They ask for payment on check in not check out and I now believe that is so you do not leave when you see the rooms. No airconditioning and our room was in the basement. The smell was horrendous, probably from the shower which looks like it floods all the time. You have to be a contortionist to use the tiny shower stall and if you drop the soap forget it. We were told they had upgraded us to a family room. I cannot imagine what a twin looked like! One powerpoint in our room was held together with electrical tape and paint was peeling off the walls. The rooms are small-tiny small. The check in time took forever and the staff are generally unhelpful. Stay here at your peril!	
Aug 14 2006	Great find	Stayed at this hotel over the August Bank Holiday and couldn't really fault it. Pleasant hotel with nice staff who were glad to help us with everything. Rooms were clean, bright and comfortable. The hotel was also in a great location and only minutes from Paddington station which was a god send after the day shopping.Would definately recommend this hotel for a nice relaxing city break	
Aug 12 2006 	Cockroach in the night!	I have returned home from a lovely trip to London despite trying to rid myself of the memory of finding a huge cockroach in my bathroom in the middle of the night and having been provided with a cot with shakey wooden supports for my daughter in a musty basement suite. Needlessless to say, my wife and I slept poorly that first night as did my daughter who slept with us.I will definitely consider getting something more for the money next time I am in town!	
Aug 11 2006	Great Hotel!!!	I stayeed there in April and the hotel was sooooo nice. The staff were great and breakfast was perfect. There was free broadband and interactive TV. Room was great, only problem was the bar only opening at 6pm but overall a great hotel.	
Aug 4 2006 	My home away from home	I live in Washington, DC and travel to London on average once every month or two and stay anywhere from 5 - 15 days each trip. I have tried them ALL! I did some research to find one place that I could continue to return to and I decided to try this hotel despite the reviews. Well, I have stayed in the Suites part of the hotel about 6 times so far since Spring and it is the cleanest, brightest, friendliest, most reasonably priced hotel in West London. Other hotels make all of these promises regarding their 'suite', but they never meet expectations. This place does!Since I stay so often now I have my favorite room and it has become my home away from home. It never disappoints. On the occasion that there is some reason I need to deal with the hotel staff for a problem, it is handled promptly and with great customer service! The Management is the best and I have heard other customers mention this as well - they want people to enjoy their stay, plan to return and tell others to do the same because they are proud of their hotel. I have referred associates here who usually stay at one of the large chain hotels and they prefer the suites here to those monstrosities. The street and the area are both clean and quiet with the conveniences of stores and restaurants right around the corner and Paddington station within 5 blocks walk. This is a great hotel! Just don't ask for my room;-)	
Jul 31 2006 	Nightmare	I had researched many hotels and consulted Tripadvisor before making my reservation. Obviously I was not expecting anything luxurious given the price paid, however I did expect a clean room and professional service from a Best Western Hotel.I had requested a non-basement room with A/C after reading the previous reviews on Tripadvisor. On checkin I was given a a basement room (b08) with no A/C, the room was awful with cobwebbs above the bed, no natural light, tiny room, A/C not working. I asked to change immediately, I viewed room 227 and 219 both tiny and equally as awfull. I was informed by a staff member only rooms on the 3rd and 4th floor have been refurbished and the A/C does not work in all the hotel. I asked the room to be cleaned and left to enjoy our 3 day stay in london. On return that day the cobwebbs were still there, it seems when you try to communicate with reception staff they do not fully understand. On the second day the carpet seemed to be wet which appeared to come from the corridor and the room next door, and the room was not serviced. The building work started each morning outside at 8.45, however on the last morning it was next door. The room was totally gutted and drilling began whilst we were sleeping, this was the final straw.On check out I asked if the manager could come with me to our room, he did not but sat us down in the lounge and listened to me rage. I was also informed by other guests staying in the suites over the road that the rooms were reformed but were tiny and not worth gbp140.00.My advise to other guests is stay away, perhaps pay a little more and go elsewhere. We were shocked by the low standard and service and it totally ruined our first visit to London.	
Jul 25 2006 	Filthy Hot Unsafe and Uncomfortable!	This room was booked as a free two-night deal through British Air (one of their &quot;recommended&quot; hotels. We weren't expecting luxury, but we did expect a clean, comfortable, and safe place to stay. The room we were given was horrific! It was very small, which would not have been an issue if it had not been so very filthy! The upholstery on the one small chair had large dark stains, there was visible dust and cobwebs on the wall just over the bed, there was a thick layer of black grime the inside of the window sash, and I was afraid to touch the TV remote. The carpet was torn, there was a huge rip in the drapery, and the nightstand and wardrobe were chipped up. The glass of the window was cracked, and just outside the window (which went all the way to the floor) was a terrace upon which we found a rusty razor blade and many, many cigarrette butts. The window also did not lock properly, which was very troubling as the room was only on the second floor and had the terrace outside. There was a chain hanging from the door-frame but only four holes on the door where the rest once had been. When we first arrived there was no fan in the room, as was promised on the website. The front desk sent up one which had a plug so badly broken that the wiring was exposed! The second fan did not arrive until after midnight. I called BA Travel to complain, but they only offered to move us to another hotel if we paid for it. We did wind up going to another hotel (Travelodge Kings Cross Scot: clean, comfy, and cold AC!), but not through British Air as I could no longer trust their &quot;recommendations&quot;. I took lots of pictures of the room and sent them to BA customer service, but the only response was an offer of a &quot;free upgrade&quot; at the same hotel the next time I'm in London. If I am ever so fortunate as to return to London, rest assured I will not give the Best Western Paddington Court another chance to muck up my vacation!	
Jul 25 2006 	They cancelled me rerservation without informing me!	We booked to stay with Best Western Paddington Court Hotel and Suites through hotels(--) for our stay in London, for the Live 8 concert. I rang the hotel the previous night to confirm my reservation and to my horror our reservation had been cancelled, which my partner or I never did. I contacted hotels(--) and they said my reservation had not been cancelled through them or myself. Personally I believe as it was a busy weekend the hotel over booked or somebody offered over the odds rather than booking in advance and paying the going rate as I did. I never got an apology from the hotel and if I had turned up without confirming my reservation I would have been extremely upset had I turned up and they told me this. However I spent the night before my trip to London on the phone for hours and worrying that I wouldn't have anywhere to stay, Fortunately hotels(--) arranged for us to stay in a far better hotel - the 5 star Great Eastern at the same price I paid for the 3 star Best Western Paddington Court Hotel. This made our stay - what a fabulous hotel! So glad the Best Western Paddington cancelled our reservation in the end - would have appreciated them telling us though! 	
Jul 25 2006	If Booked Through British Air Stay Away!	Dirty room, rusty razorblade and discarded cigarette butts on the balcony, filthy windowsills, unresponsive staff, etc. Shouldn't a three-star hotel at least be clean and safe?Given the wonderful reviews that this hotel has received from other guests, is it possible that only the rooms unfit for occupancy are set aside for British Air?British Air, please stop recommending this hotel to your customers. They deserve much better than this!	
Jul 25 2006 	Disappointed	I am a very frequent traveller, both on business and for pleasure, and know what you can and cannot expect from various classes of hotels. My verdict: you can be better off at other hotels.Rooms were clean and nice so if you are lucky and go without a hitch, should be OK. It is when there is an issue that the hotel apparently has difficulty addressing it. My initial room was in the basement, (yuck) but not unacceptable, except that I found (very late at night) that the plug for the bathtub was missing, which made it unable to take a bath. Unfortunately, it was in the hours that maintenance was not in, so I had to make do with a shower after alerting reception, although it wasn't really what I deserved after 12 hours in the plane. I made sure they can follow up on it by also leaving a note in the room as well as at the reception as I left the hotel the next day. However, when I came back in the afternoon, although the room was already made and maintenance must have been in from 7:30am, the plug was still not there and no indication of replacement. I talked to reception, and after some conversation got another room which was much nicer and had a perfectly working bath. They helped me move, so I was almost about to forget about the not-so-nice night before.The next day I was attending a wedding and therefore spent time in the room until 1pm preparing. Housekeeping ladies came and asked when I wanted the room made, so I said &quot;After 2pm, please.&quot; They were having some difficulty with English, but pointed at their wristwatch so I pointed at 2pm and they appeared to have understood. Then another man came and asked the same question, so I told him the same thing. His English sounded natural, and I assumed the ladies sent him to confirm my instructions. However, upon returning to my room late at night, I found my room un-made, with a note stuck under the door saying &quot;did not clean because you instructed us not to disturb.&quot; Again, it was late at night so I had to make do by getting someone deliver clean towels etc. I made it clear about my displeasure, but there was no follow-up when I checked out the day after and I was past the point of caring anyway, just happy to leave.Nothing critically wrong, but not the level of service I would expect from the rates.	
Jul 17 2006	Clean nice convenient hotel	I stayed at the Paddington Court hotel for a couple of nights last month and found it to be a nice hotel, in a good location. The staff were pleasant, smiling, the breakfast was very tasty, in fact not advisable to eat the full english every day, you get a really good selection.As i was in London on business, the hotel was really good for me, close to Paddington, and great for coming from Heathrow. I am a big guy so the shower was thankfully large and it was like a walk in shower, something i havent seen too often in hotels, the showers are usually cramped but it was all good!! I would suggest the hotel to employ more staff as sometimes you may wait 5 minutes to be seen at reception, apart from that, all in all a fine stay. I come to London a lot on business and intend to return to the Paddington Court.RegardsNed	
Jul 11 2006	Gets my Vote	Stayed at this hotel in May for 2 nights, provided as a freebie from British Airways when we booked our tickets from Vancouver. The walk from the Paddington station may only be a few blocks, but with luggage it's a bit of a haul. The area the hotel is located in is beautiful. Gorgeous white/cream buildings all around, good pubs/restaurants within walking distance and a couple little corner stores within a block. The rooms are pretty small, which was fine by us as we weren't there other than to sleep. There is so much to see and do in London and it is so easy to get around on the tube! Only complaints are that the walls are thin...noisy neighbours can be a little bothersome if you're a light sleeper...and the free internet they provide is through the TV and it was hard to navigate and slow (compared to what we're used to in Canada). There isn't an elevator either, so be warned if you have trouble coping with stairs. Overall, a very decent hotel and enjoyable stay. On a separate note, I would definitely recommend taking the Paddington Express to the Paddington Station from Heathrow. Only takes 15 minutes...but it's nearly 15 pounds...worth the cost for the convenience. The walk to the hotel is less than 15 minutes.	
Jun 27 2006 	Paddington court  clean nice quiet and good situation	Coming to London for professional reasons, I am very disappointed about the general level of the hotels in London. I found with the Paddington Court &amp; Suites hotel the place where I return regularly ; I benefit from a room at the 2nd or 3rd floor very luminous, vast and clean, with a large and beautiful bathroom, and internet broadband access included. The continental breakfast and English breakfast are varied and served by a smiling team. The situation of the hotel is ideal between the Paddington station and a large range of buses, taxis, and tube stations, and 3 minutes walk to Hyde Park. The building of the hotel very pretty and is well maintained, clean, with flowers changed everyday, and well provided in daily newspapers. The management team is directed by a very dynamic director, professional, and with the listening of the requests of the customers. Coming regularly to London for professional reasons, I booked to come also on holiday with my family in this hotel, for its quiet, its cleanliness, its situation, and its personalized reception.	
Jun 22 2006	Good situation but bad conditions!!!	When I saw the hotel, i was surprised by the beautiful old style facade but when i was discovering the room, my hapiness stopped : they are very tall and dirty . The A/C doesn't work ; I needed to change twice to have a correct room ;;	
Jun 15 2006	higher rates and poorer service	I've stayed at this hotel for a number of years now. The level of service has deteriorated over this time and the place is now quite poor. I'm a British reviewer (it takes a lot for us Brits to winge!!) The internet did not work. It was an extremely hot day and night and the air conditioning did not work. My room was on the 3rd floor and as warm air rises the lack of air conditioning made for a very uncomfortable experience. The iron had exposed live wire which could have proved highly dangerous. I left a note for them to kindly remove and replace this but this was not done. The very basic fan that was provided could not be held in one position and it made an annoying clicking noise. The staff are no longer as friendly as they once were and do not seem happy to be there. The rates for the hotel have increased in the last year but the level of service has deteriorated. I have seen much better days. One good thing was it is quite clean and the location is very safe, pleasant, quiet and ideal for local amenities and transport links. I don't think the price is now worth it and will try elsewhere next time.	
Jun 15 2006	Great value hotel	I always stay here when I'm in London. This is a very pleasant medium sized hotel situated in a quiet neighbourhood next to Hyde Park but still only a few minutes walk from central London and the West End. The tube and Paddington Station are 5 minutes walk away, it is this station that provides a service to/from Heathrow. I have stayed here many times and always found that the staff are courteous and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable and exactly what I'd expect from a 3 star hotel. I have read some other reports where people say this hasn't been so and can only say they must have been incredibly unlucky or had quite extravagant expectations. The rooms are reasonably priced and I have very rarely had a problem and when I have it has either been fixed immediately or I've been offered another room. The free broadband internet is a real bonus and has proved invaluable. In summary a great moderately priced hotel in a great location.	
Jun 4 2006	Go Elsewhere	My husband, my elderly mother, and myself stayed in this terrible hotel for two nights. It was a promotion by British Airways (they'll be hearing from me too), so one room was free for the two nights, but only one night was free for my mother, so we had pre-paid $163 for her room for one more night. What a huge mistake! I would never stay here again for free or even if they paid me! In fact, after seeing our rooms at the Paddington Court, we called our usual hotel in London, willing to pay full price to get out of this place, but at that late date they were already full. So we ended up staying for 2 unhappy nights. It was like staying in a bad youth hostel. The first room my mother got was one of the tiny basement rooms. It was dirty, looked out onto an airshaft, smelled heavily of cigarettes, and had the tiny shower mentioned in previous reviews. It was reached through a narrow dark hallway with rubber pipes/hoses (not sure what they were) dangling overhead out of the ceiling. We asked for a different room but were told they had none until the next day, so my husband ended up sleeping in that room to spare my mother. She and I shared the twin room, which really wasn't a lot better. It was a narrow room with two twin beds lined up foot to foot! The room also reeked of cigarettes, even though we had asked for non-smoking rooms. The toilet leaked and we both got our socks and slippers soaked from toilet water! When I called reception, they sent someone up who said all he could do was stuff some extra towels on the floor around the toilet! The bed linens were of questionable cleanliness, and the walls were absolutely filthy, covered with smudges and stains. There was a bare light bulb hanging over the &quot;desk&quot; with no lampshade. The room really was quite hideous. The next day we were given two &quot;better&quot; rooms. They were marginally better, but still very dreary, with dirty walls and one of the towels was filthy with a large brown smudge on it! I brought the towel down to reception and was told that the towel would be replaced. It never was. And one of the &quot;better&quot; rooms was on the 4th floor (really the 5th floor) and the lift was broken, so we had to walk up and down many flights of stairs. At breakfast we were shown the &quot;full English&quot; breakfast but were told we could only eat from the &quot;Continental&quot; side - tacky! All in all it was a terrible experience. Don't be fooled by the decent lobby and the nice lounge area. They are no reflection of the rooms you will be given. And I have no idea where those nice rooms are that are shown in the photos on their website. Over our two nights we had four different rooms and none looked anything like the ones on the website. Run in the opposite direction!	
May 29 2006 	Absolutely terrible experience	Having chosen the Best Western for its proximity to the Heathrow Express, as I was arriving close to midnight with medical appointments the next morning, as well as the brand name (hoping this meant a basic level of 3 star comfort) I was astounded to be told on arrival that there were water problems in the room and I would have to be sent to another hotel nearby. As I had two nights booked, which the staff had apparently overlooked, the advice was that I would move to a hotel for one night and then have to move back the next day. When I refused on the basis I was busy all day they sent me to a different hotel - after a half hour wait. No apologies, no refunds, no nothing. The other hotel was the 2 star Comfort Inn on Hyde park. It was quiet enough I suppose, but absolutely 2 star with a tiny, tiny room, no internet access, no air conditioning, no toiletries in the bathroom and a freezing cold room - certainly not the level of accommodation I expected for the price paid to the Best Western. I was not the only guest being sent off to other hotels - there were at least three others in the time I was waiting - extraordinary for a suposedly reputable hotel. Based on this experience, I would never stay at the Best Western again and would recommend others avoid it.	
May 21 2006	Good location basement rooms nasty	We arrived here after first checking out of the Lincln House B and B, that was a nightmare to begin with, we reserved online quickly same day and arrived one hour later. I am a travel agent and told this to the front desk when we arrived, they were only able to accomodate us the first night in the lower floor room which smelled terrible and had a curtin covering the windows. I looked outside and saw that the window could stay open however there is a chance someone could reach the room, YIKES, the botton of the window was like a sliding door and covered in filth, Basically we spent the one night in this horrible room and the next day were moved to a better room on the first floor in the new wing, Internet never worked, but we were mostly sightseeing so we did not bother again to change rooms after that, I would not stay again at this hotel, and would opt to pay more and try a Thistle hotel or another upscale brand.I would lastly say the location to the Paddington stations was perfect, easy in and out with the National Rail to Windsor and London Underground.	
May 20 2006	Give me a Break.....	We arrived at the Best Western to be told they were having &quot;problems&quot; with the air conditioner and would be putting us up in a sister hotel a few blocks down. The sister hotel turned out to be a building of new corporate apartments that had just been completed. You would think this a plus, but it sucked. It meant you were on your own, no concierge, no attendant at a front desk (in fact, no front desk), a hot towel heater that burned your leg every time you sat on the toilet, a bed the that was basically a futon for one on a wooden frame. Hated it!!!!	
May 18 2006	Disgrace to the Best Western name	Just returned from a dreadful night in this so called Hotel.When I got to my room after a big delay, I discovered there was a problem with the lighting. It flickered on and off and the light in the bathroom did not work at all. Plus, the bed linen had not been changed after the previous guest at all!!!I tried to phone down to reception but got an engaged tone all the time so I had to walk down to them as the lift is broken. They sent the service manager up to investigate. First he told me I could keep fixing the trip switch on the landing and when I told him this was unacceptable, he decided to fix it properly there and then. This took about 20 minutes. I showed him the dirty bed linen, he phoned the hotel manager and told him this was not good enough and then assured me the bed would be changed soon. He also told me that if an inspecter walked in and saw the bed, this place would loose the use of the Best Western name.I spoke to this hotel manager myself before I went out and he agreed to give me £8 off the price of the room on account of the bad service. He too assured me they would change the linen.However, when I returned at ten o'clock that night, the bed had not been touched, it took 3 calls to reception to get someone to come up and he only had one sheet, he went away for ages to get one more and then told me they had no pillowcases for me!!!! All of them were locked up. I believe they tell lies to the guests all the time as nothing makes sense. After he went, I discovered the soap in the bathroom was almost worn away. I have stayed at Best Westerns in London before and was always impressed with the fresh soap each day in its own plastec bag.Next morning, as I checked out, the hotel manager was &quot;unavailable&quot;. I pressed for more money off the price and after much discussion, I was given £20 off the price for the bad service. I settled for this as they had my credit card and I could not get a better deal. But I am disgusted with such a place and I would never stay there again. They do not care at all about their guests. The area is lovely but there are far better hotels around and many have much better rates.	
May 18 2006	Would never go to this hotel	This is by far the worst hotel that I have stayed. I knew that European Hotels were small and upon reading the terrible reviews before I vacationed in London, I braced myself for what was to come. I was not disappointmed. It lived up to its reputation. I checked in with a group of 12 and alot of luggage. The staff in the hotel did not seem prepared for such a big check in. One person in particular was rude and informed us that the hotel had booked us all in smoking rooms (we had requested non smoking). The staff proceeded to swipe our charge cards to charge us for the rooms which had already been prepaid through our travel agent. We insisted on non smoking rooms and were told to give the staff a few minutes to find the rooms for us. We were told that we were getting the larger rooms because of the original error in booking smoking rooms. My boyfriend and I were put in a basement room. How we found the room and were able to find our way out everyday is surprising. The hotel is a maze of small hallways with multiple doors closing off the hallways. The lift, on top of that, was broken during our stay so we had to lug our luggage to and from the basement. Upon getting into the room we found the room to be small. It was very dark and smelled musty. The bedspreads and window treatments were also a very dark navy blue which did not help to brighten up the room. Our window was open to the outside and was at waist level where anyone could break in. We closed it and tried to turn on the air conditioning. It didn't work. We went upstairs to check with the staff and was told that the air conditioning did not work and to just keep our window open because no one would break in. The bathrooms were very small. The worst part of the bathroom was the shower which was literally 2x2. Everynight when taking a shower, I was assaulted by the shower curtain which clung to my body. There was no way to get away from it because the shower was so small. Water flooded the outside bathroom floor everynight. Since the shower curtain was so long, I learned the first night that it floated over the drain of the shower and caused the shower to fill up and overflow. If it was put on the outside of the shower the floor got wet. Being very conscientious of cleanliness, I wondered how many bodies this shower curtain had clung to before clinging to me everynight. I found the thought disgusting. I next noticed that there were two PVC pipes snaking along the wall and draining into the shower. I realized that one of the pipes was attached to the backside of the air conditioner and had the the air conditioner been working, I think would have drained condensation into the shower. The other PVC pipe came from the other side and originated from the tank of the toilet and drained out into the shower. I wondered how this could pass anytype of sanitary inspection.The bed was okay in terms of comfort, but when I initially pulled back the sheets I found hair (not ours as we had just checked in) on the sheets. I also found that the sheets were not changed the whole time that I was there and maybe this is customary to save on expense. I knew they were not changed because the same brown spot that was on my sheet remained there for the duration of my stay. The internet television service did not work and every night, usually after 11:30 p.m. a group of people staying on our floor would talk noisely in the hallways and slam doors. Our neighbors could be heard carrying on a very clear conversation.I usually don't write letters or reviews like this as I am easy to please but I felt that my experience was bad enough that anyone choosing to stay here needed to know what they could expect. I understand that the rates are affordable and I can deal with small, but cleanliness and good customer service are important. Please don't get me wrong, not all the staff was rude, in fact I really only experienced the initial check in person to be short with us. He seemed to change his attitude after another hotel representative (I think he may have been management) reassurred us that the room situation would be worked out and thanked us for our patience. Then out of nowhere a number of employees came out to assist with our bags.Overall, I don't think that I will ever go back to this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone.	
May 18 2006	Ok for the price	When we first checked in we were given a room in the basement which I found kind of scary. The room and bathroom was very small. The noise above us was really annoying. They moved us to another room on the first floor and it was a tad bit better, the bathroom was definitely an improvement from what we had the night before, actually the bathroom was perfect. The bed was small for my husband and I and the bed spread was old and not attractive. But to be honest with you for the price and location it was fine. Since we are NEVER in our hotel (only to sleep and bathe) when we are on vacation these problems did not bother us. The location was excellent because it is near a main underground. If we return to london we will stay here because you could not beat the price. If all you want to do is sleep and bathe I recommend this hotel!	
May 17 2006	false advertising	The photos online do not represent the rooms or quality of what you actually get. Standard dorm room would be more appropriate, as the double bed took up half the square footage of the room, without exagerration. Harried front desk staff do their best to keep unhappy clients at bay.	
May 10 2006 	Bad experience	I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, I wish i could move to another hotel during my stay but i couldn't since it's already booked and paid for. From the first day, i already have bad impression on this hotel, since the lift doesn't work at all, and everyone have to take the stairs to go to their rooms, luckily my room was not that far away, but the hallway to the room is narrow and confusing to find a way. The room, itself, is very small and the bathroom eventhough it's quite clean, it is also small.The bad impression leads to bad experience on the second day of my stay. After a long day of work training and sightseeings, i went back to the hotel room and found out that my key didn't work!!! I went to the reception and told one of the receptionist that it didnt work. She put my card into the card reader, reprogram it and gave it back to me to try it again. So I did, up the stairs, around the hallways, went back in front of my room, just to find out that the key still didnt work. I went to the reception again, and this time with different receptionist, and he did the same thing as the previous receptionist did, and gave me back the key and i did the same process again. Until the third time i went back, the receptionist came to the room, brought something to program the door key but it still didnt work until 5 minutes later. I was really tired and weary at this point, and when finally the door was open, the guy said to me to report the problem to the reception the morning after and have them to reprogram the door so i wouldnt have this problem again. WHAT??? Shouldn't he, the one who report to his collegue in the morning to fix the problem?? I'm already tired and can't argue anymore, so i just went inside the room and sleep on this lousy spring bed.Before I stayed in this hotel, i stayed for one night in premier travell inn county hall. I have totatlly different experience. With almost the same price, travell inn definitely have more spacious room, clean beds, linens and bathrooms, and also helpful staff. I really not recommend best western paddington hotel, if you have other choices, you better off with other hotels rather than this one, believe me..or try it for yourself :)	
May 1 2006	Very Poor	Upon arriving to the Hotel we were impressed The entrance gave the impression of a spacious, clean and up market hotel but it was all downhill from here. We checked in and were told(not taken) where are rooms were. The lift was far too small, there was only two of us with a small amount of luggage each and we only just managed to get into the lift, call me fussy but I find it rather frustrating having to struggle just to get into a lift.As went got into our room it just looked very used and tired, although it was fairly clean. The bathroom was smelt of... well you can imagine, which was poorly disguised with bleach. The beds were very uncomfortable and the bedspreads and curtains were very tasteless. We were only given a few sheets which were rough and itchy.After getting settled into the room we went sight seeing. When leaving the hotel via the awful lift we ended up on the basement level where we got a little confused and were rudely asked &quot;Can we help you!?&quot; and were told this was not the exit and to use the stairs.When we got back to the hotel we went straight to out room then didn't have a very good nights sleep. The next morning we went down to breakfast. The dining room and staff again were well presented. The breakfast itself however was AWFUL. I had a bowel of cereal and a croissant and my friend had an English breakfast. Both our meals were very tasteless. The milk was off so we had to ask for a fresh jug of milk. The coffee was weak and tasted like it had been sat out all morning. Overall the breakfast was the worst I had ever eaten.Again that day we went out sightseeing.When we got back to the hotel room I discovered my towel was missing, it had been mistaken for one of their own towels. Although it was white just like thiers, it was far better qaulity than the ones they had provided. I phoned the reception asking where it would have gone. Because of a laungauge barrier he only just understood what I was saying and said they would call back, no one did.The next day we checked out and I had to enquire about my towel again. They took my address and said they would mail it to me, you may think this is a bit silly just for a towel but it was an expensive one and I don't see why I should have to buy another one because of someone else being incompetent and not realizing that its a different style.Later that day after checking out we decided to stay another night, after experiencing this hotel we were not going to stay there again. We found a hotel near Tower Hill called Apex Hotels, you can read a review of this one by searching.	
Apr 24 2006	Customer Service Wasn't a Priority	I wish I would have given the harsh reviews more thought, however, I work in Customer Service and I can be the first one to tell you people look for things to complain about. However in this case Best Western had it coming to them. First as other complaints after flying 12 hours only to find our room not ready. Which luckily, Paddington had quite of few restaurants so we went to go eat. Finally get a room. Oh the elevator is like a death trip. It is old, noisy and SLOWWWWWW. THere is only 3 flights of stairs.! The room is fairly clean. Especially the bathroom. BUT....our room is supposed to have interenet service. Ours was broken and never was replace in the 6 days we were there. The TV only had like 4 channels. Oh and if you want air conditioning or heat that is only avaliable in the suites. Even though there was a thermostat on the wall. But my all time favorite is...i brought a calling card with me to call home to say I made it. Even though there is a big label on the phone saying they accept all calling cards. THEY accept NO CALLING CARDS.But all those were minor details compared to the staff. Not all of them but mostly the ones working during the day shift were the laziest and rudiest. We left a note for extra towels and coffee creamer everyday. And everyday after our day of sight seeing we had to call the first desk. &quot;Be right there&quot; was a favorite saying. Because they knew in 30 minutes there were off their shift therefor leaving us to call down again.Overall hotel not to shabby, the customer service was crappy	
Apr 21 2006	Good Location	Good location....that is the only good thing about this hotel! Our room was in the basement. There was no fan in the restroom. In fact ,we actually set off the fire alarm when we used the shower. Without a fan, combined with the basement location there was mold all over the walls. It was really awful. I guess there are no health codes in the UK. I am certain that there must be $200/night hotel rooms that are better.We arrived at about 10am, and the room was not ready. This seems to be a recurring statement by many reviewers. After a long, overnight flight from the US, I would atleast recommend looking for a hotel that may be able to accomodate.Luckily, we were in London to sightsee and didn't spend alot of time in our room. On a good note, the bedding was clean, and the beds were comfortable.I would never stay here again. This was definitely the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Avoid at all costs	
Apr 19 2006	We loved it	We spent 3 nights in this hotel, and we really liked it. In our opinion, the hotel is stylish. Our room (standard twin) was quite small but clean, and the beds were comfortable. Nothing disturbed our sleep - perfect. And the breakfast was great! Paddington station is nearby, so when we were leaving we took a train to the Heathrow airport - very convenient.We just can't understand all the complaints about this hotel; we would stay there anytime.	
Apr 3 2006	Quite simply: A DUMP	Reviews don't lie..this place is a class a &quot;dump&quot;. Staff is simply &quot;lost&quot; and shouldn't be working in the hotel industry. Elevators not big enough for luggage...hallways are a never ending maze and a classic fire hazard (no emergency exits)...rooms are beyond small and beyond dirty...I didn't even feel ok showering in there. I arrived on a business trip with a colleague and they fumbled the reservation causing us to only have ONE room and even better ONE bed. After arguing for an hour and stating the obvious: I was not going to share a bed when we booked months ago they found me a room at 2 am ... they basically had the room all along but made me wait 4 hours to get it. The breakfast area has CONSTANT line-ups ... down the hall way...PLEASE...do yourself a favor..stay away.	
Mar 27 2006	Stars Lie	On arrival just before the 2pm check in time my wife &amp; I were told that our room was not ready yet, which can happen in any hotel - we accepted this. During the following 1 hr 10 min wait before we got a room, no bar or cafe was available - the bar does not open until 6pm &amp; closes at 11pm.No lift operated in the part of the hotel we were put so we had to carry our luggage up 78 steps &amp; through one opening 25 inches wide &amp; one 30 inches to our room in the group 320 - 324. This room was 8ft x 14.75ft with an additional 2 x 2 shower.Continental breakfast was limited.The chamber staff must work extreamly hard to keep the rooms, bedding &amp; landings spotlessly clean.What we want to know is how did this hotel get a three star rating?	
Mar 22 2006 	Shabby 	I stayed here on a business trip to London in March 06. I was deeply disapointed by this hotel.The problems began at check in where reception staff seemed barely able to manage a simple check in.Eventually I was allocated a room which was small, grotty and had walls so thin that I could hear other residents use their bathrooms. Avoid the restaurant, the breakfast buffet looked great but most of the food was lukewarm at best, a real health hazard. The Paddington Court does not warrant its rating and I will not be staying here again.	
Mar 21 2006	Give it a chance for the right price	I read all the reviews and I see the experience somewhere in between them all. We got the 2 free nights from BA and paid an ave. of $84 for the 5 nights including the freeby. That's about where I see it as a value/budget hotel. Not the $152 Rack rate. Just as advertised, very small room with a small bath. Low water pressure. Much like a dorm room. It was clean and if you only plan to sleep, why pay big bucks. TV adequete with local channels, internet did not work. Continental breakfast was good. Location is fine with Paddington Station a few blocks away. Quite neiborhood with a mix of restaurants and shops. We made it all around London from here no problem. Staff was a bit trying when my non-ba reservation not showing. I had to fix myself with phone call to Orbitz. We knew London would be expensive and did not want to pay for a Hilton. As I stated, set your sights lower and you will sleep well here.	
Mar 18 2006	Just about OK but wouldn't pay full price	We stayed here for one night only, £50 a night B&amp;B via the Nectar card hotel offer. The hotel is reasonably close to Paddington Tube in a decent area and from the outside appears promising. However, whilst checking in we found that the staff spoke poor English and were not friendly. We noticed several bare pipes and taped-up wires hanging from the ceilings en route to our basement room. Our room was tiny and in need of refurbishment but it was clean. The internet TV, heating and shower were faulty. Breakfast was poor and again the staff were unhelpful.Overall, for what we paid the hotel was OK for a one-night stay but we would not recommend it for a longer stay or at full price.	
Mar 13 2006	I urge you all to NOT stay in this hotel	Where do i start. First of all, i stayed for 2 nights, and from when i checked in until i checked out i didnt no receive one single smile from any of the hotel staff, be it te reception staff, or the restaurnt staff. In fact, the restaurant staff barely acknowledged the guests, it reminded me of fawlty towers in so many ways. And the breakfast is a bap and coffee - so not worth it.the reception staff are incompetent. Whilst i was checking in another lady had a problem with her bill, which the reception staff did not know how to deal with and the lady had to wait for ahes while the staff rang numerous people who still did not know how to fix the problem. NO one knows whart is going on in this hotel.So i checked in and went to room. The smallest room i have ever been in in my life. From the hotel's own web site i was expecting a fair bit of luxury, which i so did not get. I cannot express my dissapointment here. I have travalled to many a city, and this has been the highest nightly rate i have ever paid to get the most basic room. I have stayed on one star hotels and have had a better room.Which then leads me to when i checked out (which wasn't to soon - still no smiles by the way) Even when there was a billing error, and i made the staff aware of this, they proceeding to charge me double my total price to my credit card. They told me they could not fix this, and i would have to ring head office my self. That was the first thing i did when i got back home, which was three weeks ago, i have since been on to them a furhter two times, and both times i have been told my card has been refunded, and it still hasnt to this date.Overall - no smiles, terrible customer service, small room, the advertised FREE internet is actually an internet TV that doesnt work, terible staff, still waiitng on refund. Please DO NOT STAY HERE	
Mar 10 2006	Great location	My daughter and I stayed in this hotel for 8 nights in January. We found the staff to be very helpful and courteous and always available to answer questions. The room was small but comfortable, very clean, excellent bathroom facilities and the usual English continental breakfast was included. The price we paid was a great value for the location and accomodations in this part of London. We found the location to be great because bus service and tube stops were a short walk away. It is also a short walk from Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. I would not hesitate to stay here again anytime in the future.	
Mar 6 2006 	Confused by recent reviews	I felt the need to write a review after reading recent posts on this hotel (giving it only 1 or 2 out of 5).I stayed here in October for 8 nights. I absolutely loved it, its in a busy (but not noisy) area so I felt safe as a woman staying alone. My room looked brand new, very clean including the shower which worked perfectly. Very comfortable. Tiny but I am used to that from staying in other London hotels. There was a tv, a phone, a safe, a microwave and a fridge which was really useful as I was there for over a week.The hotel is also very close to restaurants, cafes, pubs, 3 tube stations including Paddington, grocery stores and theres an internet cafe nearby. I cant comment on the shopping or sightseeing as I was there on business and didnt have time for that :( but it is about a 10 min walk to a shopping centre and a park. My only complaint (reducing rating from 5/5 to 4/5) was similar to some others which is that I arrived exhausted from a transatlantic flight to find my room not ready, in fact I was taken in a cab to another hotel for my first night. I was not given any options other than this, which was frustrating being so tired and carrying heavy bags. However the hotel they sent me to was very nice and nearby, and I had no further mishaps during my stay.Messing around with rooms doesnt bother me much, I am more interested in a clean and comfortable room, which I got here, so I would highly recommend this hotel based on my own experience. In fact I am booking it again for a trip in April.	
Mar 5 2006	What a Dive!	Unfortunately I read the review of this hotel after I booked it and I wouldn't have been able to get a refund. All I can say is what a dive! The rooms are very small (admittedly ours seems to have been one of the bigger ones when you read some of the comments on here). The sound insulation is APPALLING. You can hear the people in the room next door having a quiet conversation and unfortunately the people next us were shouting instead!! The free internet on the TV is useless, it doesn't work properly and they switch it off on the morning that you're leaving - not good when you want to find some info out about the museums and stuff. The bathroom was clean and the hot water seemed constant. Also, the tea and coffee making facilities were OK - it makes a change for a hotel to leave you a pint of UHT milk instead of those little pots that always run out.The only other complaint I have is that whilst there is a key-entry lock on the main entrance door (the suites are actually across the road from the hotel!), the lock appears to have been turned off or is broken so the main entrance is never locked overnight - I was expecting to see a tramp in the hallway in the morning.I would never ever stay there again!	
Mar 4 2006 	Worst place I have ever stayed!	We have booked to stay in this hotel through a discount hotels website.It turned up to be a complete nightmare.We had booked a room with double bed non smoking. After arriving at the hotel, they told us that they run out of the double bed rooms and they would give us a twin room. We accepted that being very tired of traveling. The room was so small that we could not even fit our suitase in. The two beds were placed the one opposite the other. The window would not open. No ventilation. The room was smelling. Toilet was so small that you could not even stand inside.Would never ever stay there again!!!What a terrible experience.	
Mar 1 2006	What a dump......	The first thing that greeted me was being told rather rudely that my reservation had been cancled.... they couldn't give an explanation and told me it would be a few minutes.... 25 minutes later they managed to find a room for me. I was shown to a room the size of a closet with a single bed. The bed was so patheticaly bad I couldn't beleive it. it was litterally caved in on one side, I had to flip the mattress over to find a reasonable flat surface, even with this, you could feel ever hard spring. What absolutely defies logic, is that for the price of one nights stay in said room, this hotel could not go out and replace a mattress that was years past it's usefullness. The bathroom was VERY worn around the edges and had a filthy shower curtain. I was awoken to not one but three ear pierciing alarms through the night. The radiator was not working and was stifelingly hot all night, with not ventalation. I had prepaid for the room the night before, as I had an early flight to catch, only to be told in the morning that I owed them an aditional 48 pounds. This was while I had a taxi that had been pre-aranged waiting and racking up expense. I said I wasn't going to pay it, and he had the nerve to ask for my credit card to swipe. I will never stay at this or any other Best Western hotel or thier affiliates.... and beware, there are several in London. Shame on British Air for being associated with such an establishment... it's a reflection on an otherwise good airline.	
Feb 28 2006	Thriller	We spend 3 nights in this terrible hotel in February 2006.The staff is unpolite and unhelpfull.The hotel room is dirty, dark, smell and windy(old windows).The breakfast is a tipical english breakfast, nothing special.The only think wich is good: the area. This is a quiet district of London, appr.15 min. walk from the City Center and 5 minutes from the Hyde park...You can find 100 differents hotel here in Paddington, so try to find another one, not this hotel	
Feb 23 2006 	Be Afraid be very afraid	I stayed at this Hotel on a business trip, booked last minute at a rate of £130 per night. This is without doubt the biggest dump I have had the misfortune to not sleep for quite so time. The rooms are small, dirty and smelly. The bar and resturant arent much better. Dont do it	
Feb 22 2006	Nice Very Clean 	Just returned from 2 free night with BA staying at the Paddington Court.After reading all the reviews for this hotel it was exactly as decribed.Friendly front staff, very very small rooms much to small for two people staying longer than 2 days we had carry on luggage only but still there is no room to put anything.The rooms are very hot we eventually the second day managed to turn of the radiator.Very nice breakfast included lots of choice nice staff and a nice dining room.This hotel great for free and would be OK if you paid the discounted rate of approx 50 pounds.Good location -----buy a daily bus pass for 3.50 pounds and just jump the busses lots of them go through Paddington	
Feb 22 2006	A total gem	This hotel is situated in Bayswater which is an ideal location for business and pleasure as it takes less than 10 minutes to get to the heart of London. We booked a standard double room and the rooms don't do too badly for space and luxury considering that this is a London hotel! The service was excellent right from the word go. The staff were friendly and very professional. One evening we had guests over for dinner in the hotel restaurant. We were all very impressed with the quality of the food and the variety to choose from. This hotel is truly a gem and worth every penny! I will definitely be staying there on my next trip to London!	
Feb 15 2006	Lovely Hotel	The hotel was charming along with the staff, I found all members of staff to be friendly and professional and helpful at all time, the rooms are quaint and comfortable and I will definately recommend this hotel to friends and family and friends	
Feb 12 2006	Paddinggton Court Hotel 	Hands on charming manager, looking after our every day needs and always attending to requests immediately. Polite and courteous staff, both in the reception and in the restaurant. Very clean and well decorated suites and rooms. Excellently located, 5 min walk from underground. Great value for money! Highly recommended.	
Feb 11 2006 	decent digs for a decent price	As a regular traveller to London and having tried numerous hotels in the capital over the past few years I can honestly recommend this hotel to any one. It is clean and tidy, situated in a good location and the staff are always willing to please. If you are fortunate and get a special deal, it makes your stay even more cost effective.	
Feb 11 2006 	Slightly Dissapointing for a 3 Star.	I stayed in a single room on the ground floor of this hotel for 2 nights. I paid approx £45 per night. This didnt include breakfast so I cant comment on their restaurant.I found both the room and its ensuite to be on the small and cramped side but for the price for this hotel in Central London , I cant complain. However what disappointed me and what I found to be inexcusable for a 3 star was the fact that the carpet in the room looked very old and dirty (i.e rotten!) and the wall that the side of the bed was against was gruby. It much needed a coat of white paint, instead i had a gruby off white wall with black marks and stains on it.The general standard of the furnishing and lighting in the room was above average and it came with the standard colour tv with remote. coffee/tea kettle and telephone. Also a trouser press, hair dryer, alarm clock and Internet point (which I didnt use).The small ensuite bathroom was furnished well but the shower hose and head was a toy. Room cleaned and new towels punctual during my stay.The quiet-ish area that the hotel is in has wide roads around it and I wouldnt bet on &quot;dead silence&quot; not untill after midnight. Also Im fairly certain I heard the rumblings of the underground trains directly below! personally thou this didnt bother me and I found the general noise levels at night to be acceptable, also my room was on the ground floor which I would beleive to be the least quiet.Hotel staff seemed very ready to help and friendly. Also they were well presented and smart in appearance. The highly polished floors and corridors of the ground floors look great, its a shame that things like blankets on the floor (just outside my door) and dirty plates on a dining tray seemed to be left around the corridor all day, presumably awaiting the next shift.The reason why I chose this hotel is beacuse Ive had reason to stay in the area before and having walked passed I noticed its very impressive looking entrance and reception area.I now believe this to be a &quot;honey trap&quot; of sorts as the standard of the room I stayed in did not reflect the standard of the reception and entrance area.I would possibly stay in this hotel again because of its cheap rates and convenient location, especially for Paddington Station which is about 8 minutes walk away. Id also like to point out at this stage that some older people may find the walk to Lancaster Gate tube a bit of a drag, especially if they are doing it twice plus daily.I am giving this hotel 3 stars out of 5. 2 stars is a little harsh, but I beleive i am being generous!	
Feb 8 2006 	Review	The hotel is well-furnished, provides good value for money (especially if you can get a discounted rate) and the staff are very helpful. A full English or lighter Continental breakfast can be taken. Light snacks are available throughout the day and a bar menu is provided in the evening. Alternatively, if you want to vary your dining there are many relatively inexpensive bars and restaurants nearby. The hotel is well located for seeing London  it is only 5 minutes walk from both Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations. Additionally, you are able to leave luggage before check-in/after check-out so that you dont need to carry it around with you. In summary, the hotel provides a good base from which to see the city.	
Feb 4 2006	Great Service!	I found the staff at this hotel to be thoroughly professional and always very helpful. My room was clean and quiet. The hotel is well located, being a short walk to Paddington Railway Station. I booked the room through an internet site at a very reasonable rate and found it to be great value for money.	
Jan 13 2006	Do Not Stay Here If You Can Help It!	I booked the hotel before I read the comments. The comments and reviews about this hotel are very true, and mostly they are bad. Take heed... there are many other choices in London that are not that much more expensive and you will be very sorry if you waste your money, however little of it, on this hotel. It would be like just throwing money out on the sidewalk to doss down with the bums in the street.Ok, so maybe not that bad...but Best Western really ought to look at this hotel and considering pulling its franchise. Don't let this bad hotel put you off of Best Western entirely, I stayed at a perfectly nice Best Western in Paris.Here was what happened to us -- we arrived early in the day and waited in a long line to check in. Their staff is all Indian and we could hardly understand a word they said...and their systems seem to be mostly manual. I didn't expect the rooms to be ready, and they weren't but the hotel did offer to store the luggage in a secure room. So far so good...except for the garbled language problems.Then when we came back after dinner for our room we collected our bags -- we had to get them *by ourselves* out of the little room -- and went up to our rooms. On first glance they weren't too bad. We had two twin rooms and they put us at least on the same floor. When I sat down on the bed I almost went down to the floor! The mattress was up against the wall, so the side of the bed to sit on was completely sprung. When I say that the springs were sticking up, it's an understatement. There was absolutely no padding on the mattress and it seemed as if I was just sleeping straight on the springs. It was late, I was tired...so I toughed it out for the night.The bathroom -- ha ha ha. The shower -- ha ha ha.The next day we asked if the bed could be changed, but they made us change rooms. This couldn't be done immediately, fair enough, but I had to come back to the room to change clothes after lunch and they didn't have my luggage moved so I had to do that myself. The new room...no better. The bed was extremely bad and uncomfortable. I didn't get any sleep at all.The neighborhood, by the way, is very nice. Paddington is close by and there are other tube stops nearby. Hyde Park is just down the street and if you like to walk you can include Hyde Park in your stroll. There are some excellent pubs and restaurants and a couple of internet cafes nearby too. Breakfast: Don't bother with the hotel breakfast. If you can book room only it's worth it to find breakfast elsewhere. Theirs is rubbish.Bottom line...don't stay at this hotel. If you must, ask to see the room first, and try the bed, before you commit to a room. If the first one they give you isn't any good then leave yourself some time to find another or get another hotel. There are hundreds in this neighborhood.Beware of the cheap price, you get exactly what you pay for.	
Jan 11 2006 	Nothing like the pictures	Recently stayed at the hotel - booked a suite. It was a bedroom with a stainless steel kitchen unit. Television didn't work, couldn't open window, no bath only a shower cubicle with broken shutter door and cubicle built for a dwarf. When you book a suite you actually expect space I have stayed in bigger single hotel rooms. Very disappointed as it did not match the description shown on website.	
Jan 6 2006	It will do	First off, thanks for all the previous reviews. Reading them helped me choose this hotel and give me a realistic view of what to expect. The hotel is 'ok', I would be a little peeved if I had paid the full price though.We stayed in the old wing and contrary to the magnificent frontage and reception the room was pretty dated. Enough room for 2 to sleep, if you don't mind crawling over one person to get to your side of the bed. Not enough room for 2 to get dressed whilst standing and trying to get things from the wardrobe.Water was hot as described, along with lacking in pressure. Bed was comfortable and clean. With some engineering the window stopped rattling through the night.The location turned out to be great for our visit and there are plenty of great places to eat very nearby. If you are using the new oyster card, dont keep your room key with it as I did for a day, it becomes de-magnetised and needs to be sorted at reception.conclusion :- get it cheap and dont expect much but the somewhere to lay your head and get washed and you wont go far wrong.	
Jan 4 2006 	Average	I stayed here for a night in December whilst visiting London for the day. Its well located and good value but only really worth staying if its at a discounted rate. I couldnt really argue with the 65 quid that it cost. You couldnt swing a cat in the room, the shower was rubbish and the bathroom dated. Having said that, the staff were helpful (despite not having knowledge of my booking), the communal areas were pleasant and above all its cheap.	
Dec 28 2005	Good value clean and lots nearby	I stayed here mid-Dec. 2005. For most people taking overnight flights, the hotel will store your luggage for free until your room is ready. I had a double bed in the newer section. There is no lift service to the newer section and I was on the third floor; great for exercise, but if stairs are an issue, this could be a problem (the older section has a lift). The room wasn't as small as I feared from reading about London hotel room sizes. KEEP IN MIND if you see the pictures of this place on expedia or other web sites, the rooms shown are for the upscale studios, not the standard rooms! The room is fine though, comfortable and clean, and includes tea maker, full wardrobe with shelving, nightstand with 3 empty drawers, and iron and ironing board. The two windows near the bed opened up fully onto the nice residential street, which was a great way to start the morning with fresh air. The bathroom was awesome; very large (as big as the bedroom almost), very clean, with a high tub and shower. Only complaint was there was VERY LITTLE water pressure, but the water was very hot, so I got used to it. The towels were awesome; big and fluffy--felt good after the shower. The Front Desk staff, while very professional, were not very responsive; requests for extra pillows, etc. were forgotten. Walk to Paddington station in only 10 minutes, or walk to Lancaster Gate 10 minutes. This hotel is short walk to Kensington Park and Hyde Park (near Lancaster Gate Tube). Nice quiet-enough street. There's 2 convenient-stores right across the street, plenty of pubs and souvenir shops, and a GREAT DELI across the street next to the medical office and NISA store that has high speed internet for only 1 GBP for an hour's time. The food is outstanding, the staff friendly, the deli is small but you can sit outside at the tables or inside. The hotel offers free internet in all rooms VIA THE TV--it SUCKED. The graphics are not the same as via the web, there is no back feature, it was time consuming and frustrating, so don't rely on this as a benefit; I would just go across the street to the deli and use the internet there, or there are plenty of internet cafes all over London. The breakfast buffet is very good, but b/c of my low rate, wasn't included; it was 6.95 GBP, unlimited English breakfast delicious. The cocktail bar is small but nice and the the common lounge next to reception is very spacious and comfortable, great for reading or watching TV. I got this for 39 GBP/night w/o breakfast--a great deal for this place. Would stay here again, but realize it's further west than many of the attractions.	
Nov 24 2005	Good Result in the End!	I booked an executive queen sized bedded suite - requesting a quiet location. Upon arrival, received a very small cramped room with standard size bed on the rear elevation which was extremely noisey as a result of externally mounted air conditioning. After complaining I was told none of the suites had queen sized beds but was offered 2others to view to assess the noise. Both were on the same elevation, so had the same noise problem. After rejecting all three rooms, I was offered a basement executive queen size bedded suite - yes the very one they said they didn't have! This room was perfectly adequate although I have to say the bathroom was very snug - my knees touched the radiator when using the loo! On the positive, the staff were extremely friendly and very oblying in dealing with my series of complaints.	
Nov 13 2005	location was good	we had a great offer when we stayed at this hotel. 45 quid, which reflected in the size of the room. no space to hang your clothes or to put your luggage. i had to crawl over my husband to get to the other side of the bed. bathroom was excellent though. and the tele needs tuning.	
Nov 12 2005 	Good Hotel Great Value for money	I am currently staying at this hotel and have always booked with the paddington court hotelon my frequent visits to london in the last 2 years. The staff have changed but are more friendlier and the hotel is refurbished quite well. Free Broadband is great as well.All in all no complains especailly if you are paying £79 for a double room and the hotel is really close to hyde park &amp; the paddington station for the Heathrow Express. They serve dinner but there are lots of Chinese, Italian &amp; Indian restaurant round the corner plus Whitleys Shopping centre is just round the corner as well for lastminute shopping.Have been staying there will be staying there again.	
Nov 1 2005 	Stolen Goods	A colleague and myself had booked to stay at the Hyde Park Paddington hotel. Upon arrival at 10.30pm, we were informed that there were no rooms available due to renovations and were being moved to the Best Western Paddington Suites around the corner. Our room was the only room on the floor and could only be accessed by going through two fire doors and up two flights of stairs.After returning from a day of sightseeing, we found our room had been robbed, with gifts, watches and passports stolen. There was no sign of forced entry, which alludes to an inside job. Management were most unhelpful with resolving the issue.Never a judge a book by its cover applies to these hotels.	
Oct 27 2005	Good Value	After reading some very negative reviews about his place i was expecting the worst. But the staff were efficient and friendly and the location was great just 5 mins from Paddington. The room was small but clean (I think the bed was less than a double!) and the continental breakfast that the price included was ample. Full English could be purchased at a suppliment of £5.00 but didn't look worth it. For £40 a night and just a short walk through Hyde Park to the Natural History museum, it was just what we were looking for, for a budget short stay to London.	
Oct 23 2005 	the worst hotel in London	I am a journalist and I have travelled all the world. I 've been in the worst places in Africa, S.America, China etc., but this hotel was a terrible experiance for me. My room was in the basement . The restaurant as well.No windows , no tasty food, awful breakfast... Even though I love Paddigton , Court Hotel was a kind of nightmare.	
Oct 22 2005	Not the best	On arrival at the hotel we were told that we were being upgraded to an executive suite for our 2 night stay - thank goodness, I dread to think what a standard room may have been like! The room was extremely small, with the tiniest double bed I have ever seen, however this would have been ok if the room wasn't so hot and the air-conditioning unit was too noisy to sleep through. Also, our internet didn't work and although we informed the desk staff of this shortly after our arrival, many excuses were made over the next 2 days as to why this was never fixed. 2 saving graces, the tube station is a 5 minute walk and the suite had a little kitchen so we didn't have to risk the hotel food!	
Oct 15 2005	We were lucky	I'd read about this hotel shipping guests off to other hotels, so it was no surprise when we were told on arrival there were &quot;problems with the rooms&quot; and we would be going elsewhere. They comped drinks while we waited and a taxi, a Mercedes no less, that took us to the Shaftesbury Kensington, which is a four-star hotel.This is the former Hogarth Hotel and not to be confused with another Shaftesbury elsewhere in London.The hotel is very nice and new. My guess is they we were guinea pigs while they trained a new staff. You'll hear no complaints here. The hotel was nicer than I'm used to, it was close to the Earl's Court tube station and the area was lively with plenty of good restaurants.	
Oct 5 2005	Pictures on the website are very deceiving	I saw pictures of it online before booking and the hotel looked modern and up to date. Plus, the website stated that the hotel had undergone remodelling which coincided with the more modern look. When we got there, the carpet was stained, one wall had been painted blue, and there were 2 strange looking stains on the bed cover. The room was extremely small, which is fine since most european hotels have small rooms but the bathroom was smaller than a cruise ship's bathroom AND it was dirty (grout stained yellow and black and a yellow stained shower curtain). For the amount of money one would pay for this room, it is so NOT worth it to stay here. Look elsewhere. We were so disappointed with our room and we will never stay here again.	
Oct 3 2005	No Probs!	After reading some reviews I expected the worst. We got a good deal £40 per room per night. I have to say given the location it was great value.Only problem was the location of the room. It was at the junction of two corridors and stairs and overall was noisy. I tend to blame the other guests rather than the hotel for this.Room was fine, clean and tidy. had i been staying longer I would have requested a change of room but other than that good value and location!	
Oct 1 2005	Quite average	This hotel is best described as average. From the outside it looks like big luxury, but the inside can't quite keep up. The room and the bathroom were both clean and tidy, but it was very small - the bed took up most of the floor space. The breakfast was filling, but nothing special. All in all not a very memorable experience, but not terrible either.	
Sep 20 2005	Frustrating and inconvenient...at its best	After researching and selecting this hotel &quot;on sale&quot; online (ok, maybe I should have known better), we somehow managed to find this hotel, and arrived late at night only to be told that they had overbooked the hotel and we would be transferred to &quot;another 3 star hotel&quot; which was &quot;just as good&quot; as Best Western Paddington. Of course, they paid for a taxi to transfer us, and our room was paid for at the other hotel. However, notification at arrival of our transfer to another hotel I had never heard of --and didn't enjoy--was frustrating (the understatement of the year) and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!!	
Sep 10 2005	Could have been better and bigger	With a child about 1 1/2 year old, we had ordered a double room with a cot. We got a twin room, but no cot. One of the reasons why, was perhaps that it was no space for a cot, without throwing out one of the beds... We also got a room in ground floor with a window that could not be opened. With C 25-30 in the room, and no AC, this was hot... The next day, we got a new room, that was a little bit less small, and with a window that could be opened. The service was ok, but not all of the staff spoked english (or Norwegian...)One pre for the place was free Broad band internet. I brought the laptop with me, so that we could make plans for the next day. I think the price we paid, £ 45 per night, was ok but that didn't include breakfast. The next time I am on a holliday I will look at reviews on this web page BEFORE I go...Gunnar/ Oslo, Norway	
Aug 22 2005	best western games	Well, we've fallen into the same trap that many others here have reported. We booked a room at Paddington Court and, surprise, surprise, AFTER we signed in, we were told that we had to be transferred to another hotel because of some unexplained problem with fire alarms. We then arrived at the Hogath building site in Earl's Court and waited in line to check in again - now an hour behind schedule. Our room was coated in thick dust the result of the building work they obviously hadn't finished. Our windows were covered in scaffolding and plastic sheeting. There wasn't any air conditioning. The bed wasn't a full double and was a mattress on a box frame. They also insisted on running our credit card through the machine and asking for authorisation to cover any &quot;extras&quot;. This, they insisted, was normal but was queried by everyone we saw at reception and led to long waits to check in and out. What is their game? This transferring has been going on for months. Saying all that the dining room was nice - Moroccan stlye - and the breakfast good.	
Aug 20 2005	Absolutely OK!	I spend five nights at the Paddington Court in the middle of august. I must confess that before I left Sweden I was really worried, especially after reading all the negative reviews. But there was no need to worry. The hotel was fine. It was a typical three-star London hotel. Nothing more and nothing less. The staff were very helpful and polite. Although I had only book and paid for a single room I received a double. I did not find the room smaller then any other three-star hotel I staid at in London. It might not be a perfect family hotel and if I was travelling with children I think that I would book a room at a four-star hotel. But I would definitely recommend the hotel to my single girlfriends since the area felt safe. The hotel is conveniently located close to the Paddington Station, were you can catch several buses, underground trains and the Heathrow Express. At the hotel I notice that they could help the quests to book a shuttle to the airport, something that I did not use since I was travelling from Heathrow.However, even though I enjoyed my stay at the hotel I would not recommend it to someone who is handicapped. The hotel state that they have a lift to al flours which is a large over statement. The hotel has a lift, but when you reach to your flour I will have to take several steps of stairs before can get to your room. When I staid there most of the guest were from USA and UK, some from Germany, Italy and Spain, but no one else from Sweden. I believe that most Scandinavian tourist would prefer the Mornington Hotel , Lancaster Gate, with its Nordic stile and smorgasbord.Anna Jansson, Sweden	
Aug 9 2005	Makes "Fawlty Towers" look like paradise	I recently stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. I paid 79 pound for a single room and received a room the size of a dorm! I could only get my large suitcase through the door sideways. The following two mornings, there was no hot water. Finally, on my second last day, I complained, and was upgraded to a double size room (still small by international standards). The breakfast also was horrible... very poor selection and the eggs were stone cold if you arrived after 930am. In fact the maitre'd and a guest were having a very loud fight over the breakfast, which ended with a demand by the guest to &quot;meet him outside to sort things out!&quot;. The Manager of the Hotel and the reception staff were friendly, but I do pity them, as this hotel is an overpriced disaster zone. It's a shame, as the location is terrifc, but you dont get much, if anything for your money!	
Aug 7 2005	Not a bad hotel	We spent 2 weeks at the Best Western Paddington Court in late June and early July. We found the hotel to be very pleasant. We stayed in a suite room across the street from the main hotel. The room was small but very well maintained, clean with a great bathroom. The room had a refrigerator, micorwave, and A/C. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpfull. The location is great, close to Paddington Train and Tube Stations and Lancaster Gate Tube station. The hotel is only a few blocks away from Hyde Park. There are alot of local pubs and resturants in the area. This was our 4th trip to London and our 2nd time at this hotel. This is not a bad hotel.	
Aug 7 2005	Do your homework and avoid places like this!!	Stayed at the BW Paddington for one night 7/31/05. Check-in was fairly prompt...however when we got to our room..it was already occupied!!! You can just imagine the look on the gent's face as we strolled into &quot;his&quot; room.I went back to the desk..and the reservation clerk actually told be &quot;that's not possible&quot;...&quot;the system shows the room is empty&quot;...He at first would not believe me!!! I told him to call the room and see. We were then assigned a room SO small that we could barely move in it at all, with half of a window!!!This is NOT an exaggeration. I have NEVER seen a double room so small. The map on the back of the door that shows the floor/room map...our room was actually pencilled in(carved out of another room)!!!Now I have read the reviews that say...&quot;it's a small room, but it is London&quot;...That is a bunch of B.S.!!! Only people who have never been to London before or never stayed in decent reasonably sized/priced accommodations allow for such crap!!! Never again!!!!!! Spend just a few pounds more and stay at the Millenium Gloucester(79GBP avg) or the Saint Georges Hotel (95GBP inc VAT) especially if you dont get to London often!! :)	
Aug 3 2005	honeymoon disaster	Like so many other reviewers, my husband and I arrived at the Paddington Court straight from our flight from San Francisco to discover the hotel was overbooked and that we would be transferred to another hotel. Now let me emphasize: this was our HONEYMOON! We were transferred to a nicer hotel, the Hogarth Hotel, (with a new name) but it was under renovation so our first room had no hot water, no a/ c (during the heat wave) and a view of scaffolding! The staff was very nice, and we knew the situation was not their fault; they did transfer us to a nicer room that was larger, with no scaffolding view, and hot water! It was actually a very nice room, except there still was no a/c. Thus we got not one night of good sleep, although the fan they gave us helped a little. I would recommend the Hogarth to people when the renovation is done; the staff was great. And the staff at the Paddington Court was very nice too. But what I am forewarning others is to be cautious of booking these or any other hotels in London, Europe or anywhere in the world through Expedia! You have the chance of your hotel being overbooked! They did not offer any compensation- only a travel voucher to book through them again! That's bad business, in my opinion!	
Jul 25 2005	Disorganized in the extreme	Like the previous reviewer, we showed up to find that we were being transferred to another hotel. The only difference is that we had booked over 6 months in advance, so they have no excuse for not knowing we were coming! While the staff was apologetic, we were still made to sit in a hot overcrowded lobby for over an hour while they found us a cab to transfer. When we transferred we found that we were nowhere near where we wanted to be in the city, causing us to incur additional costs in order to meet our tours each day. When I complained to the hotel management after the fact, I was offered a &quot;discount&quot; rate on my next visit that was the same as the rate I can book online anyway. Of course, I will not book with this property or this chain again.	
Jul 22 2005	Sense of Humour Required	My husband and I had a horrendous experience with the Best Western Paddington in July. We arrived, tired, at the end of a long trip, looking forward to a good sleep before our flight home. This wasn't to be. The first man in line as we arrived was berating the frazzled desk clerk about his accomodations and was wanting an immediate room change, which couldn't be accomodated. Next up were two businessmen, who were told there was a problem with their rooms and they would need to be put up in another hotel. After a lengthy, heated exchange, they stormed out of the hotel, cancelling their 'reservation'. Next up, we were also told that there was a room problem, but they were going to put us up in an upgraded, four star hotel and they would pay for the taxi over. Sounded good. However, we waited much longer than an hour for the ride. Turns out they couldn't just use a taxi service, it had to be a company they have an arrangement with, so we waited, waited, waited, with the clerk intermittently phoning them, pleading with them to come as the list of unhappy travellers continued to grow. When we finally arrived at the hotel, well after midnight, we were horrified. The 'four star hotel' we had been promised was under major renovation and in the dark all that could be seen was scaffolding. Our sound sleep was not to be. There was no air conditioning and the room was stifling. The window wouldn't budge more than an inch. The front desk person came up and fought with the window and also couldn't get it to open. His solution: open the door to the hallway to let cool air in. By then it's about 1 a.m., so that wasn't a particularly viable option. And sure enough, in the morning, construction started up, so there was no quiet and no privacy as construction people walked right by the window.The only good thing about our experience was the camaraderie developed with other exhausted people who were waiting with us, caught in the same predicament. An Irish couple dubbed our '4 star hotel' Fawlty Towers, which had us hooting. You'll see why, when you see the attached picture of our &quot;4 star upgrade&quot;.	
Jul 18 2005	booked here but transferred to another hotel	I booked this hotel before reading the reviews. We arrived to check in only to be told that their system had crashed the day I made the booking online ( 3 days before) and as a result the hotel was overbooked. The staff were apologetic and explained that they had booked us in to another hotel close by of the same calibre and would put us in a taxi to get there. We were on a week-end break and had chosen this hotel because of its location and because it had a bar where we could meet our friends. We arrived at our &quot;new&quot; hotel only to find it was further away from where we had wanted to stay and had no bar. I felt disappointed and wondered why the Best Western hadn't had the courtesy to call me up as soon as they realised they had no room for us? I would have preferred to know this in advance instead of feeling conned.	
Jul 13 2005	sucks	My husband, I and our 17 month old daughter travel from NY to London....we had no sleep and our baby was cranky....when we reached the hotel at 10 am they said they would clean up the room by 2pm and we could check in then....w came in at 1pm to see if the room was ready...they said they had no rooms and transferred us to another hotel....they also took the money for our 4 day stay in advance and assured us that the rooms will be the like the one we booked for in best western paddington (BWP).......we were all so tired that we went to this hotel they transferred us to...the Hogarth Hotel...in Earls court.We had booked for an executive double...paying premium $$$ / pounds... and when we checked in to the room it looked small...but we decided to call it a day as our daughter was very cranky.....the next day we found out that the room was a standard double(costs 70 pounds) instead of an executive double. We paid 90 pounds for an executive double. To top it all there was renovation work going on at hogarth place...that robbed us of our sleep.They moved us in an executive double only on the last day of stay and did not refund us the balance ....their argument...best western paddington told them that we should be booked in a standard double. The hogarth hotel gave us free cab ride to Kings Cross station (18 pounds worth) on the day we checked out.Pls....take our advice....do not book in the BWP......unless u want to spoil your vacation.	
Jul 9 2005	Not worth it!	Myself and two friends arrived home from London today and will definitely not be returning to the Paddington Court Hotel. After booking a room with three single beds, we were told that there wasn't one available and was given a room with a double and a single that had a lovely view of a brick wall, as we were in the basement. The shower was stuck at 50 degrees and after complaining 3 times it still was not fixed. The television also didn't work and after complaining twice it was not fixed. The iron did not work, the window was not secure and the light in the bathroom didn't work. All in all the worst hotel i have stayed in!	
Jul 7 2005 	Give it a miss!	I was sent to this hotel because of overbooking at a 'sister' hotel nearby. The double room I was given was the smallest I have ever seen. The decor of the room and bathroom was fine and very new but the window was old and metal. It lacked a catch and swung in the wind. The room was on the third floor and the water pressure was feeble.The worst thing that happened was that I arrived back from a visit to the theatre to find that my luggage had disappeared. I was initially relieved when I went to reception to be told that, no, it hadn't been stolen but had been moved to another room. That room was already occupied by some people and they had to go an extract my bags. The luggage included my laptop and passport. I was very cross but they seemed to find it funny. My advice is to avoid this place like the plague.	
Jul 6 2005	Rude staff and a huge rip-off	I wish we had read the reviews before booking. Initially, they wanted to put us (two adults and two young children) in two rooms that I am sure were closets in their past life. They were damp, dirty, really small, and desperately in need of renovations. After we had a fit, they &quot;upgraded&quot; us to a room with a double bed and pull-out couch. The pull-out couch looked like it came from a second-hand sale. It was ugly, dirty, and the bed matress was about two inches thick. Our internet did not work. The staff was unbelievably rude on multiple occasions. There is some serious attitude going on at this place. Do not stay at this hotel - it is terrible.	
Jul 5 2005	Hot 	The staff was not helpful. On one occassion the information we were seeking was right around the corner in their hall, but they knew nothing of it. You had to go beg for a fan. The room was not clean. The rooms were hot and the mold was awful. Two of the four of us went to the doctor 2 times the first week back and 12 days later we are still dealing with Respiratory problems. Breakfast was very slowly restocked and was nothing to brag about. This is not my first stay in London so we were not expecting an American style resort. It was a health risk.	
Jun 12 2005	Disappointed	Don't impress yourself with the pics on the website. The rooms are very very small with no place to move. The smallest I ever been. Top sheets of beds were dirty...never seen washing in my opinion. The staff at reception were helpful and nice but considering the price per night I don't think I visit this hotel again.	
Jun 9 2005	If you require space skip this place!!!	To say the rooms are small, would be an understatement!Hotel is clean, and most of the staff is helpful and flriendly, just the rooms are incredibly small. Now I'm not saying this, as the &quot;ugly american tourist&quot; either. I;ve stayed in London before, and all over the world, just simply put, these rooms are freakishly small. Take that as you wish.Continental breakfast was includsed w/ the room, otherwise, skip (too expensive at 10pnds).Internet was ok, kinda like TiVo internet, for basic stuff, not to fast, not terribly slow, but allows you to access your web-mail, so cant't beat that.Tube IS NOT close by!! It's not a Long March either, but after all the walking you do, you dread that final walk from the tube to the hotel!Neighbourhood is safe, clean, and middle-classish... not a knock-down, just, its not Chelsea, or Kennsington.Beds are decent at best, shower is tooo small as well, hall-ways are small! If you are a Keibler Elf, its not a bad place to stay.	
Jun 3 2005 	Tatty	A dump.Don't be fooled by the pics. They look great - when you get there you can't believe it.It wasn't all that clean The bathrooms have chipped tiles and bits of mould. Havent been decorated since the eightiesThe handyman in the hotel wants sacking. Taps are loose - the overflow in the bathroom wasn't connected and caused a flood. Loose fitting everywhere, wonky shelves and towel rails hanging off.The carpets are worn and badly fitted - the lift looks like a goods lift is tiny and very very old.They cocked up my room key for my original room and when the moved me after the flood.Internet didnt work in either room and wasn't fixed when I complained either time (they sent the handyman who said he knew nothing about it). Telly reception was bad.Made me wait til 2pm to check in. Staff thick and rude. Its not as near to the tube as they make out either.	
May 2 2005	OK for the price	For 49 Pounds per night one could not complain about the location of this hotel. Clean and centrally located. Staff was ok. The single room re-defines SMALL in London - extremely tight as I could hardly turn or move in the shower.I wonder about accessibility for disabled guests in this hotel - way too many stairs and just bear in mind if you are placed in the 'new wing' on the first floor, you will have close to .5 miles to walk and a multitude of stairs to climb and NO ELEVATOR. (despite the clerk told me first set of stairs through the lounge, up another set of stairs - but she forgot the other long corridor and almost 3 flight of stairs with my bag!).Area is nice and quaint. For this price, a good deal - anything more, look elsewhere!	
Apr 25 2005	could not complain	Booked a triple room thru Londonnights.com for this hotel and got it for £20 cheaper than going thru the hotel itself. When we checked in the room was out of commission and they gave us 3 single rooms instead! Better again for three blokes after a day and night on the town!! Single room was small but clean and had all the amenities required (towels, soaps, iron, etc.) It even had Internet access in the room. Great value for money compared to some of the joints Ive stayed in for a few quid less!!!I highly recommend this place and will be back again.	
Apr 20 2005	Very Nice..	We stayed a this hotel in March of 2005, I totally loved it.. granted the room was small, but it was a very pleasant hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful..The location was excellent, it was about a 5 minute walk to paddington station and about a 5-10 minute walk to Notting Hill.we would stay here again.	
Feb 4 2005	Stylish hotel with friendly staff	I've stayed in this hotel four or five times over the past few years and have always found it a very pleasant experience. Why? The rooms are modern and clean, the location is excellent for public transport and the buffet breakfast is ample. I have no complaints. The negative comments I've seen elsewhere on this site surprise me since the hotel has given me no cause for complaint over a number of years and my partner and I are very particular over where we stay. I regard this hotel as a 'safe bet' when booking accommodation in London and would unreservedly recommend it - in fact I have just booked it for short break having stayed several times before. I seriously doubt that you will find somewhere superior at this price. Don't let the complaints of a few disgruntled customers put you off.	
Jan 5 2005	Not so Cheap and cheerful	We arrived on 27th December with our young son who became sick whilst travelling. We waited patiently in reception(very busy). When we were served, I explained that my son was ill and we needed to take him to our room as soon as possible. We were told our room was ready. The receptionist then said there was only one bed in the room ( we booked an extra one for our son). I asked her to sort this out and she said it was not up to her - it was up to the company I had booked the accomodation with. I had to call them and it turned out it was the Hotels fault. We then had to wait three hours for a room.The room was small, the shower in the room above leaked into our accomodation. This was reported and nothing was done.The hotel is in a lovely area but we were disappointed by the attitute of the staff.	
Jan 2 2005	Pleasant stay and good locale	Having read other reviews on this forum re Best Western Paddington Court Hotel (BWPCH) and after having already booked a 4 night stay (Dec 28 - Jan 1) I was a terribly worried about staying there but maybe that was good because in the end we were very satisfied with the place. All in all the place was perfect for a couple of heavyset middle aged North Americans on a first time trip and a budget.We had a room on the 1st floor overlooking Devonshire Terrace. General Comments: No bugs in evidence anywhere; Pleasant and quite helpful staff;Safe neighborhood; Minimal, if any, noise from other rms or street; Rms numbers and locations clearly signposted; Great location for accessing public transport and airport transfers (13 pounds for one way Heathrow to Paddington trip on Heathrow Express train - 15 minute trip exactly); 6 minute walk to Paddington from BWPCH; 5 minute walk to Lancaster Gate stn; 5 minute walk to Hyde park; Small rms but what do you expect in London without paying a fortune; Beds were quite broken in and much too soft for our liking; Bathroom size was fine and shower curtain complaints were a bit exaggerated I think and Im 230 lbs; Lots of restaurants nearby - Braza's (Italian) was probably the best value. (Nobody in the neighbourhood had heard of Brazzas because the name in the window is Fontana di Trevi and I only eventually discovered it was Brazzas because of the name appearing on the receipt) It is about 2 minutes down the road at 10 Craven Terrace; Bizarrios on Praed St was ok as well. For economy, breakfast was best dealt with at Paddington stn (Simple breakfast for 2 at Garfunkels on Praed St was (gulp)20.00 pounds); Didnt use the BWPCH restaurant so no comment there; Several small grocery/convenience stores within 1 minute walk of hotel open until 11:30 pm. Moores pharmacy on the opposite corner from BWPCH was quite handy for medicinal needs as well;	
Nov 16 2004	Stay away!!!!!!	We live in Essen, germany, and stayed in this hotel from 10-14th november 2004.We didn`t expect much and have been in London several times ago. But this was too much: We had no hot water in the shower in 3 from 4 days. Every day we told the reception. As other users already have written, they are unfriendly and don`t react until you become real angry, making a scene. They told us, the boiler (water-heater) was defect and had been changed, so we should wait for the water to heat up again. Our request for another room was denied, they had none. On the third morning we had at least no water at all in the shower. The reception was not really impressed. Nothing happenend until we went the third time down and made a real scene. They admitted, but without apologizing, that the whole 4th floor had no water. After argueing a while, they generously gave as a room in the third floor, there everything worked.By the way, this room was significant bigger than the first one. This first room in the 4th floor was, as others have already told, very, very small. The room was the bed and the walls around the bed....At the weekend there are waiting times up to 15 minutes to get a place in the breakfast-room. You`re waiting standing in a line down the stairs to the room...But I would have accepted this, but the cold shower I couldn`t accept. This is too much! I even couldn`t wash my (long) hair properly.If youv`ve already booked: Don´t accept a room in the 4th floor and if you have reclamations, repeat and repeat them at reception, otherwise nothing will happen.....!!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!	
Oct 25 2004	Cannot imagine a worse place to stay	I have well over a 1,000 nights in hotels in the last 10 years at various places around the world and nothing comes even close to being as bad as this hotel. The staff was rude, the room was unbelievably small (I have seen bigger closets) and it was not the cleanest place either. If this is your only choice when staying in London I would suggest trying a bench in Hyde Park instead.	
Sep 27 2004	Not the best Best Western in the world	At first sight this ought to have been a good hotel, but sadly it wasn't. We requested a double sized room, and found a broom-closet. The room would have been small for a single bed. One side of the double bed was hard-up against the wall, and if two people stood up at the same time, you had to be thin. Tiny bathroom too. Everything was there, no air-con, but TV, tea-maker, closet etc all present, and clean, just very small. Unfortunate occurence on checkout, they had lost the prepaid voucher and we nearly got into an argument over payment. Took half an hour to sort out. In fairness to them, their lobby was being redone and thet were in cramped temporary quarters. Not cheap either, but nothing is in London. Five minutes walk from Paddington Station and the express train to Heathrow, so a good location. Might go back again, but would look elsewhere first.	
Sep 8 2004	Just Fine	After reading the terrible reviews, my friend and I were pretty apprehensive about this hotel, but it turned out to be just fine. Of course the rooms are small, but any visitor to London knows that you're not going to get a spacious and super-fancy place at this kind of price. There wasn't any air conditioning, as had been advertised, but we did get a big oscillating fan, so the A/C wasn't terribly missed. The room was clean, the bathroom fine and the staff very courteous and helpful. They are in the midst of renovating their restaurant and bar - the lounge was just finished when we left and is very attractive. We had no wait to get into our room and no hassles checking out. I would definitely stay here again. I seriously think the strongly negative reviews must be from people who are not aware of London hotel standards and were expecting something luxurious at a budget hotel price. Don't be afraid. It's just fine.	
Sep 7 2004	Great hotel!	I thought this hotel was great! Yes, the room is very small, but how much time is spent in the room? Plus, with the standard cost of London hotels, this was a deal.It was very clean, a decent sized bathroom, a beautiful lobby and lounge area. The restarunt was being renovated when I was there, so they offered to bring breakfast to your room. It was a great location, only 3 blocks from Paddington train station. My only complaint is that the website stated they had air-conditioning and they did not. They did provide a large fan which was sufficient.	
Aug 28 2004	Not good enough for american standard but their suite is cool	The room is so small for 1 person and I book for double. No aircon, you can smell the diesel fume if you open the window. What we did is, we transfer to their suite which is across the street and just add 15 pounds per night with small kitchen, brighter color, with aircon and bath tub but still small. The receptionist and all other staff are all very polite and helpful.	
Aug 7 2004	Price good but hotel very average	Arrived early (0600) and asked what time I could ckeck in. I was told (by the rude and unfriendly staff - people that the whole of England can be proud of) that a room would be available at 1100. When I returned at 1100 I spent the next 3 hours waiting for the room. The room was extremely small, even by English standards, but it was clean and functional. There was not enough room to have two bags on the floor.The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel. The shower was enclosed in glass and I could not turn around without breathin in - I am very tall. The water temperature was hard to control so I ended up scalding myself as I could not get away from the water without getting out of the shower. In the end I showered with the door open.The breakfast wasn't worth waiting for and in the end I just breakfasted at small cafes in the area.All in all the hotel would not suit those used to Asian and American hotels. It is, however, OK if you get a cheap rate as it is convenient.	
Jul 27 2004	Surprised after all the negative reviews	Okay, I had read all the reviews here before my first trip to London this month. I was fully prepared to have a horrible experience based on what I saw here, but the reservations were made and could not be changed. Was going there for a friend's military retirement ceremony.Took the &quot;Black Cab&quot; in from Heathrow because I wasn't sure how to manage the tube. Also, tired and wanted to get straight to the hotel. The cost of that was about 50 pounds--with tip.When I arrived at noon, my room was ready and I was able to proceed there. I found the staff friendly, competent, and helpful. There was no bellman available so I had to take my rather heavy luggage myself up the stairs and through the maze to find my room. That was really the worst part of my stay. The winding corridors (very small) and multiple stairs to manage (And, I have a heart condition). That part was exhausting after a long day. You definitely want to get a room toward the front of the hotel and on a lower floor. Request to be as close to the lifts as possible, otherwise prepare yourself for a tedious hike.I had read about so many nightmares here regarding the rooms, but mine, albeit small, was remodeled, clean, and a window that opened onto the cross street, Craven Road. I read the guest book rightaway and found that they had a small number of fans available for the rooms. I went right back down and got one, which was a great help in keeping the air circulating, and cool for sleeping. The bathroom was small, as was the shower stall, but adequate and clean. If you have been on a cruise, imagine the bathroom in an inside cabin. That will give you an idea. I am a large man, but managed to work out a &quot;deal&quot; with the shower curtain so it didn't stick to my body the whole time I was bathing.The bed was okay. Not a great mattress, but I was only there to sleep.I had the continental breakfast included and so partook of that each morning, with the option to expand into a full breakfast at a minimal charge. It too was adequate, and there was one server that I saw continually that greeted me each morning and as I left wished me a great day. I REALLY found all the staff courteous and very willing to help out. Most all of the staff except the front desk are there around the clock it seems.Had dinner in the restaurant the first evening, but found the outside restaurants more appealing. BTW, there is a new restaurant down the block from the hotel called Brazas that is outstanding!! If you stay there, don't miss it.........especially the homemade pate'. There is also a Chinese restaurant around the corner that is quite good.I usually came back to the hotel lounge to have a brandy in the evening before retiring.I never used the underground, but took taxis (the Black Cabs) everywhere to save time. I didn't have many days to explore after my friend's ceremony so time was of the essence. A bit pricey, but worth it. But then everything in London is double what we pay in the States. Although, when I asked the hotel to arrange for a taxi for the airport return, I got a brand new Mercedes with AC, a wonderful driver, and great conversation on the way back. This is a company the hotel contracts with and was only 22 pounds. A bargain for the convenience and comfort.I took the &quot;Original London Bus Tour&quot; and that gave me a quick overall look at what I wanted to go back to to explore. Very helpful in getting myself oriented to the city. It was only 16 pounds and the ticket was good for 24 hours. You could get off and on at will. I even got a free river cruise as part of the deal.Across the street from the hotel are their suites. I did not see them and only heard one upset family about the size of the accommodations. Other than that, I really didn't hear any complaining. And, there was a wide range of people staying there from business people to tourists.All in all, I had a good experience and would stay there again, although I found it a bit removed from the rest of the &quot;action&quot; in the city. I think probably most people would go there to be close to the Paddington Station, which I never saw. I also felt very safe in this neighborhood.I went with a lot of aprehension about staying here, but decided I would make it a &quot;good stay.&quot; I spoke to say &quot;hello&quot; when I encountered any staff and they responded warmly. I think for the most part the staff don't speak unless spoken to because they don't want to disturb you. Maybe a London thing........I thought more courteous than removed.So, that is my experience and I wanted to come back to add this review. Maybe all the bad ones were brought to their attention because I saw remodeling going on everywhere, and found the staff delightful.I guess it sometimes boils down to &quot;it is what you decide to make it.&quot; Yes, it wasn't what we are used to in the U.S...............but this isn't the U.S.Hope this helps!	
Jun 27 2004	You Get What You Pay For...hmmm	Reception Desk Staff: LOVELY, HELPFUL, KIND!!Room- Triple: Three twin beds. One was broken mix and match blankets, aged bedspreads, heat by radiator...no thermostat. If the maintenance staff turns the radiator on...beware...you'll roast and you have no way of adjusting the temp. other than to have the staff turn the rad. off.Telephone: COULD NOT make calls. Could ONLY call Reception Desk.NOISE! UNBELIEVABLY NOISEY. Doors slam. Walls as thin as tissue paper. You CAN hear your neighbors. The door to your room will rattle if another door closes. BATHROOM- shower-rediculously small. UNbelievably inefficient. NO room to move AT ALL.Sink- NOT a mixing faucet...ONE HOT...ONE COLDOUTDATED! The shower is about 2ft by 2ft if that. Hair dryer is nailed down INSIDE the top drawer of the dresser. Hmmm??? It's a good price but be prepared for noise and more noise. NOT lovely in anyway but served the purpose for sleeping on a bed. Don't expect any luxuries at all. It's plain and loud and inefficient. The computer for 'rent' does not work. Date of our travel...June 19th-June 25, 2004 Think twice before you choose to stay here.  Beware. You get what you pay for.It is located in a nice area!	
Apr 7 2004	Worst service ever! Save yourself the trouble...	I initially booked a room at this hotel because I thought its location would be ideal since it is in close proximity to the Paddington tube station, and in fact that turned out to be the only positive outcome from my stay there. The hotel appears lovely from outside and the lobby is quite nice, too, but on the first night there I was waiting to check in and I received an omen that I was about to experience an awful stay. A couple there was complaining about how they had requested coffee 48 hours ago and they had called several times to remind the concierge but no one did anything about it. It was obvious that they were upset and the concierge really did nothing to help them out, it seemed he couldn't care less. He wouldn't answer them when they asked for the manager's name, nor would he give them a contact number. The couple was enraged and they left fuming. I thought at first that maybe it was just them but then that same night I discovered that we didn't have a blowdryer so I went to the front desk to request one and the concierge there said there wasn't one available because all the rooms were booked at the moment and he would need to wait until someone had left the next morning so that I could have one then. I found that hard to believe but went along with it. So I called the next morning around 6:30 and asked for the blowdryer. I was told then that they would deliver one to my room in 15 minutes. Half an hour passed by and there was still no sign of the blowdryer so I called again and this time another person answered and he told me that it's &quot;in the drawer&quot;...I asked which drawer, and he continued to be vague so I just hung up. It turns out that it was in the dresser drawer right beneath the TV (which by the way didn't even work properly) but I couldn't understand why I wasn't told that the other night when I initially asked for it. Anyway, we had this other problem with the staff there. Besides the fact that most of them 1) were rude and disrespectful and 2) were totally incompetent, it seems that they actually went out of their way to make our stay difficult. We needed a room for one extra night since we were spending part of our vacation in Paris and we were told that we wouldn't have a problem getting a room. The next day, however, when we tried to book something, this other receptionist, a short Indian woman whose name I couldn't catch, told us that we were mistaken, there was nothing available for the night we requested. Obviously we were furious because not only were we given the wrong information the previous night but she did absolutely NOTHING to help us, and her sour expression showed no sign of empathy at all for our situation. We decided to speak to someone else the next day and the assistant manager, Roy, handled the matter but he did put on a very arrogant and snooty attitude. He didn't give us any confirmation of a room but merely signed a letter saying that something was available and that was all. So we came back from Paris and apparently there was a mix-up because they couldn't find anything booked under the cardholder's name (my friend's, who was staying with me) and they told us that they were fully booked for that night so we couldn't stay there. Fortunately, we were able to get assistance from the manager there who was really a blessing. If it weren't for him we would have been left with no place to stay our last night in London. Not only was he corteous and kind but he also went out of his way to do what he could for us. It turned out that the room was booked under my name although it would have saved us a lot of time and trouble if Roy had told us that to begin with, but anyway, we got to stay at this 4 star hotel instead of at Paddington for the same rate that was promised to us, so in that sense we lucked out. Even our transportation to the other hotel was provided for us thanks to the manager (I can't remember his name because I lost the business card but I think it was something like Peader; he had a slim build, average height, and red hair). Really, I can't fully express just how terrible the service was at this hotel and the manager was the only person who stood out as someone who cared about the customers. If you can settle with bad service then stay there because it is in a good location but I would rather stay somewhere else that has a nice and friendly staff. I'll admit that the rooms were decent but still small, and the TV gave us problems (it wouldn't turn on at times). Overall, I would have to say that it's really not worth it to stay at this hotel because it will ruin your trip by making you disgruntled twoards Londoners thanks to the poor service and attitude at the BWPCH.	
Mar 30 2004	If you love to sleep with bugs and bad service...	Deceptive. Upon arrival to the Paddington Best Western, the lobby looked clean and quaint. The staff was curt and uninviting (but that could just be Londoners). When we arrived at our room, other boarders mentioned that the electricity was out in their rooms and they were waiting for over an hour and had called the concierge multiple times. So we waiting in our cramped toom. The room looked clean, but upon getting into bed, I noticed a cockroach next to my pillow, then later in the bathroom. That was enough to disgust me, but I sucked it up. Meanwhile, our bathroom had a sign up that said, &quot;DO NOT USE&quot; and we were worried that there was a problem so we called management and they said not to worry about it. Any reasonable person would take the sign down if there wasn't any problems. We were reluctant to use it, but ended up conceeding. Then I went in search of a hairdryer. This is where the problem escalated. We didn't find one in the room so called the concierge again and noted that to them. They said it was in our drawers, but we mentioned that we couldn't find it. So I went to bed with a wet head. Then in the morning before we left for the day we AGAIN notified them that we did not have a hairdryer and AGAIN they said it was in our drawers and we said it was not in there. So they said that they would take care of it. By the time we arrived back at night we decided to stop bothering them and hoped that it would be there by then. Again, no sign of a hairdryer. So I called the concierge AGAIN and he said that his colleague went looking for one, but never returned. He in the end brought me to another room to actually use the hair dryer before the new occupants arrived. I was furious by then, but too tired to complain to their manager about this frustrating situation. I had to ask them FIVE times for a *** hairdryer! I was afraid to even ask for roomservice after that! Besides finding bugs in my bed for the rest of my stay there, we opted to stay out of the hotel as much as possible. If you can find a better hotel with better service, I would highly recommend it. The Paddington BW, is a poor representation of the Best Westerns in the US.	
Mar 29 2004	Worst hotel in London	LOL...We couldnt locate our room, so we asked a maid to help us. She couldnt even find our room, we had to be escorted back to the reception area (because we had no idea how to get back to it) to have someone else show us where our room was. This hotel is like a labryinth of twists and turns. It gets better...Once in our room, the floor squeaked with every step. I literally thought we would fall through. Oh and how can I forget the bed! It was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever attempted to sleep in. I do not recommend this place. Learn from my mistake, do not stay here!	
Mar 15 2004	Not my cup of tea	In full agreement with the negative reviews offered by my fellow carping arrogant whining Americans and other discriminating travelers:The Good : Proximity to Paddington Station; safe neighborhoodThe Bad : Unhelpful staff; billing dispute (didn't want to honor the rate on my booking confirmation)The Ugly : Rooms. &quot;Small&quot; would be an improvement. Hallways. Did someone mention a rat maze?	
Feb 29 2004 	Did the job	These critical reviews are completely unfair. I spent 4 days staying here while working in London and the hotel was absolutely fine. It was warm, quiet, comfortable and above all - clean. Many hotels in London keep you awake with constant traffic and sirens all night long. It was peaceful here. The stations are nearby. There are lots of restaurants nearby. The area is pleasant and safe. The staff are friendly and helpful. The restaurant serves reasonable food and is cheap. If you want a big room and lots of grovelling personal attention then pay 4 times as much and go elsewhere, but if you want a reasonable and perfectly decent deal, this hotel is absolutely fine. I have been in really nasty flea pits that cost much more. This hotel is a pleasant place to go with nice friendly staff. Don't take any notice of the carping arrogant whining Americans - this hotel is civilised.	
Feb 28 2004	Bad hotel.	Terrible hotel. Quite expensive, but not good value for the money. The hotel is a maze. I actually got lost on my first attempt to leave the hotel. Had to write down the route through the hotel (Ok, that can have its charm). Room was very small. Shower was almost unusable: way too small and not much water. Breakfast buffet almost doesn't show any choices. Neighbourhood is Ok. Would not stay there again.	
Feb 28 2004	Do not stay here whatever you do!!!!!!	The Best Western Paddington needs to have any association with Best Western terminated at everyones convenience. The hotel has a wonderful location that suited my girlfriend and I quite well because we are avid runners. Hyde Park is just a short walk down the street and perfect for running. The Hotel is quite repulsive to the eye once a guest darkens the doorstep of this quagmire. The desk staff speaks little English and seems more inconvenienced by a guests presence than anything. The first room we received was a smoking room (not what was reserved) and the evidence of smoking was ripe in the air, carpet, comforter, curtains, and anything that could hold a scent. The comforter had burn holes all over it and was complete with a permanent depression from the last bed smoking beheamoth. Upon bringing this to the attention of the desk staff they suggested another room. Alas perhaps something good can come about this. No chance however, room#2 fared somewhat better though despite it's immensely tiny size. The entire stay we had to yield and signal our intentions as we moved around the room. It was much like living in a doll house I imagine. The light fixtures must have been hung with the cheapest hardware imaginable because their collosal weight stripped them right from the wall and consequently dangled precariously above the bed by the remaining screw. The bathroom was good except for the shower which was so small it was like taking a shower in a phone booth. The shower curtain would cling to your back like a vinyl skin the entire time one was in the shower. The heater was stuck on and the only relief was from a window that could only be opened 4 inches to let air in. The hotel decided to screw the windows shut at this height so there would be no escaping to more comfortable lodging in the area. The dilemma of a fire presents the most challenging moment for a guest because this hotel is quite literally a rat maze. The fifth day of our stay marked a moment in trip milestones because I had finally remembered how to find the exit to the street. It is this bad, if a fire were to happen guests would never find their way out. The Paddington is a converted rowhouse which presents navigation problems even without smoke, confusion, and panic. This hotel is OK for those wishing to spend as little time as possible in it, perhaps even sleeping there. The first night we spent sleeping in our running clothes so that no exposed skin would come in contact with the bed, blankets, comforter, or pillows.	
Feb 26 2004	Minimalist Hotels Incorporated	This being my first trip to London, I had no initial basis of comparison on choosing a hotel to stay at, but because of Best Western's price and quality here in the states I assumed things were the same overseas. And that's what I get for assuming. I am 5'11 and 155 pounds, so it shouldn't be a problem for me to navigate from point A to point B in any situation, even a cramped one, but the traffic areas of the hotel were downright unsurmountable. Comments about the shower were primarily true from my experience save for the flooding issues. However, I did have an extremely intimate relationship with the shower curtain by the end of my stay as it insisted on clinging to my body every five seconds. Channel lineup on televisions is basic but understandably so; if I recall correctly, we had a total of 13 options including cable radio broadcasts.Location is a definite benefit for this hotel; walking to the tube station took less than 10 minutes and there were more than enough ATMs and restaraunts as well as one breakfast stop that made one killer Peppermint tea (located along the main road connecting hotel to Paddington tube station). I chose to eat breakfast outside of the hotel after I realized that the concept of &quot;continental breakfast&quot; consisted of nothing more than microscopic pastries, dried cereal, milk, and juice. Any additional options must be ordered from the waiter/waitress at cost. Portions are meager at best and for the price, the external breakfast eatery made several quality English breakfasts with faster, friendlier service and bigger portions.Along the lines of service, guests at this hotel can safely assume they will not maintain a first-name basis with anybody working. For personal reasons, I detest their night crew simply on the premise that I had mistakenly taken a wrong bus and wound up all the way out in Chiswick at 1AM and upon calling the hotel in pursuit of a cab (none were to be found in sight), I was simply shrugged off and left to my own devices...dress shoes and a minimum of four miles' walk. When my guardians who were positively grief-stricken over my absence at such a late hour confronted the front desk, they appeared unfazed. Maid service appears to disregard our preference of a different location for the wastecans as each time we returned to the room the wastebaskest were reset to their default location.In short, there are far better places you can room at if only for a smaller amount more, but the quality is exponentially different. Upon return from Munich to London, we changed our stay to the Millenium Gloucester and were positively blown away by the difference. Our shower was no longer a cubicle, beds were comfortable (even the cot they had brought in for me considering the only non-smoking room they had left was a double was easy to sleep in), TV listings were far more expansive and distance to the tube was more than cut in half. Also, they had a fitness center, EXTREMELY expansive continental breakfast and very friendly staff. I don't recall a time I had to open the front doors or walk into the hotel unassisted. For those who still yearn for American food, there's a Burger King less than five minutes away. All these reasons added up make it unmistakably obvious that the Best Western Paddington Court does not even possess the ability of gaining a two-star review. Websites meant for planning trips should update their four-star rating accordingly.	
Feb 8 2004	Get what you pay for....	Having booked this hotel before I had read the review page, I nearly changed the booking, the hotel is ideally situated near Paddington, so easy access to Underground, however that is all it is convenient for.The room was tiny (and us British are used to smallish rooms), the bed uncomfortable, no bath in en suite, the shower ran like a tap and flooded the bathroom (they did change it!), the bathroom itself you had to side step into as door was so narrow.Breakfast - had to pay extra for a hot breakfast (not worth the ?4.50), was served &quot;cups of tea&quot;, no pots of anything! very basic.Not one member of staff ever said &quot;good morning or good evening&quot; apart from a laundry boy on the final morning.Next time we're staying at the Hilton, Paddington.	
Jan 11 2004	Miserable  dishonest property!!!	After a typical overnite flight from the US, we presented to the front desk at appox 0930 hrs. We were told that our &quot;room&quot; would be available by 1130 hrs. We understand this is the norm, and no big deal. We were instructed to wait in the lounge. We sat in this room until after 1430 hrs with about 30+ other people who had been told the same story or had screwed up reservations of some sort. As the growing number of waiting people grew (to the point of an overfull luggage room) the staff cheerfully checked in travel agents and their families!!!! Finally, we we reached our room we found it to be substandard, dirty, and somewhat dishoveled. We have traveled Europe extensively and found this property to be the biggest dissappointment we have encountered! Perhaps the benches at Paddington Station would have been more accommidating???	
Dec 27 2003	London hotels	When we arrived at the Paddington Court our room was typical London, small and not to well furnished. The friends we were with found the mattress in their room had seen better days and complained to the management. We were moved to larger and much nicer rooms on the first floor. All in all our 8 day stay became very nice. The staff, both hotel and kitchen, were great, the breakfast was very nice, the rooms were cleaned everyday and it was convenient to the tube and buses. My only complaint was I had joined a Best Western Crown Club and getting the points became a catch 22. Because I had made the reservations on the internet from another party it was not counted. That to me was the big joke. This was not the hotels fault however.	
Dec 23 2003	Don't believe the 'Best' in the title...	Without a doubt, this is one to avoid. The only saving grace it offers is some proximity to Paddington Station and nice, cheap adjacent eats (but there were a lot of hotels in the area closer than this one). Stayed for a weekend in September. I had &quot;confirmed&quot; a reservation while in the UK by phone, that had been botched up upon arrival. It took the staff 20 minutes to put me in a single room. Felt sorry for the people in front of me, their reservation through hotels was apparently NO GOOD and the staff did nothing to help them find other lodging!!! Rude staff throughout stay, most were non-Brits. Would agree w/previous comments that the rooms were very small, even for European standards (approx 8'x10' in single room). If you're over 6' and 180 lbs, you won't fit in the shower and don't leave anything on the floors (due to flooding). Pipes leaked, beds were as hard as the floor and walls were thin. It's a shame because other BW-affiliated properties in Europe have been moderately nice hotels especially in Austria/Germany. Key drop-off was a bit childish (was a little leary of this considering not all rooms have safes). Don't let the pictures fool you on other sites; I can't remember the one website but it listed this property as a 4-star hotel. Don't think so.	
Dec 12 2003	Modest accommodation	I test-stayed at these after reading the multiple and fairly poor reviews in tripadvisor.com. Comparing these to my thoughts as I left: the rooms are small, minimally functional, the beds are springy and make a crunchy springy sound when you press them, other furniture is light weight, the colour scheme is mid-green, mid-wine, mid-blue. There was no kitchen in the hotel rooms so I need to go back and check whether the suites across the road are better. I would have stayed there when I was young and naive but not now - why go on a holiday and stay in a place that's less comfortable than home? One reviewer on tripadvisor said: &quot;I'd recommend staying as close to Paddington as possible, or better yet, staying in an area that is closer to more active streetlife (pubs, shopping). I'd rather be able to step outside of a hotel, and be in the thick of things.&quot; A Londoner giving advice to a tourist would say: &quot;What can you expect from accommodation near Paddington? This is how it works: many people stay at Paddington as it is a direct route to Heathrow, that leads to competition between accommodation providers, which leads to lower profit margins, which leads to smaller 'units' and less expensive staff. So all the complaints about low staff levels, shortage of service, low quality furniture, etc are just inevitably typical of the basic choice to stay in a tourist trap. And I am not sure there is just one 'thick of things' in London, there are several 'thick of things' which are not within walking distance of each other. I think this reviewer wanted to stay in Soho or perhaps Kensington, which has more cappuccino bars than you really need. You can't really swallow London in one gulp. Stay near the Jubilee Line, which has a north west to south east axis, and you will get to most places of interest with one train ride. It is the best line in London, and takes in Baker Street and the north west for Regents Park, London Zoo etc, the West End via Green Park and Westminster stops, the South Bank via Waterloo and London Bridge, Canary Wharf via ... Canary Wharf. Lancaster Gate is on the Central Line - this mainly goes to Oxford Circus, which is a stroll from the West End - and Paddington is on the Circle Line, which does what is says.&quot; When I was the staff were surrounded by people and lots of others waiting around. You know there are smarter ways to stay in London.	
Dec 11 2003	Much too small double room feeling like in a basement	Room B06 certainly didn't look like anything we saw on the Internet. Quite disapointing small room, had to move the bed to get around, under ground level, facing backyard, dirty carpets, stressed staff.	
Dec 6 2003	Small Room - Dirty hallways	Chose this hotel for proximity to Paddington Station. Our room was in the &quot;old&quot; wing (there appeared to be a new wing which was much nicer, with elevators and electronic room keys -- but we did not see it). The room was very small (even by European standards) and at ground level. The bathroom was relatively clean, although the hallways leading to the room were quite dirty and the carpet in the room had old gum on it. The chain on our door was broken and was not fixed after two requests, although staff was otherwise relatively friendly. There was a coin-op internet terminal in the lobby, which was very convenient. Otherwise -- would not recommend, I'm sure you can do better!!	
Dec 1 2003	Ugg... think twice before going here	Some how this was by far the worse hotel experiance I have ever had. This was a 3 star hotel. It was more like a no star. We sent reservations in advance for 2 rooms. we ended up being on different floors than our kids. the first room we were given was smelly, bed was broken down and in poor condition and extremely small (like no room to walk). We immediatly went to the main desk and requested another room and were given another room. This one was 7X7 (this is not a misprint) This one had a bed with springs that popped through the matress. After a sleepless night we requested and were given another room. this one was okay but nothing to brag about. Looks good on the outside but not worth the money or sleepless nights!	
Nov 13 2003	Creaky Charmless Hotel	Recently returned from a five-night stay at this hotel. We chose this property online from Hotels.com, as we needed a room for three people. We also made much use of tripadvisor.com, and were a bit scared by all the comments being made here, but decided to go for it anyway.The hotel itself is 4-5 (not unpleasant) blocks down from Paddington Station. The area appears mostly safe and residential with several small groceries, delis, coffee shops and pubs along Craven Road (the main road from Paddington to Devonshire Terrace). I'll admit, more than once we gazed longingly at the Hilton Paddington, perched seductively smack dab above the rail and Tube stations, as we trudged back to the BW Paddington Court after each day's sightseeing.(Near the end of the trip, alas, we discovered that Lancaster Gate tube station was a wee bit shorter to this hotel than Paddington.)The triple room appeared just as in photos on various web sites: three very &quot;springy&quot; single beds arranged parallel with three nightstands in-between, with a dresser at the foot of the beds. That meant a surprising amount of drawer space, but the smallish room felt somewhat crowded with all three people in at the same time. Either the floors were slanted or the beds were, as I listed to the right every time I laid down in bed. The tv was a small remote-controlled, 19-inch color with 10 cable/satellite channels, plus 4 radio stations. Worked fine, if placed a bit high, hospital-style at the corner of the room.You could really tell this wasn't a new building by the creakiness of the floors, and the numerous steps going up/down/every which way. There is a lift in the building, but nearly useless as there are always half-flights of steps leading everywhere. Trust me, you'll always have to take steps somewhere. Definitely NOT for wheelchair bound patrons.I did notice that the room, beds, and carpeting were very clean, which helped tolerate other idiosyncracies. Such as? Well, the shower for one thing. A typical London shower I guess -- it was basically a 2 foot square corner of the bathroom with 4-5 inch raised barrier at the bottom. The flimsy shower curtain hung loose, and you couldn't help but get caught up in it bathing. We joked that we were always so intimate with the shower curtain, that we needed a cigarette afterwards!Naturally the bathroom floor would get drenched, no matter how hard we tried. Perhaps that's why it was always so clean. We also had difficulty with the controls of the shower. The left side controlled the flow of the water, but the right side controlled the temperature, and was hellishly difficult to turn. And it was stuck on HOT! Finally required getting a hand towel and lots of strength to turn it down. One night we came back, and there was a nice letter explaining that today was wash day, so they took everyone's shower curtain down! You know how this story ends -- the next morning the bathroom floor was practically a lake.We only called the office the first night for a wake up call the next morning. The phones are &quot;hotel phones&quot;, i.e. they have push buttons reading &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; and &quot;Front Desk.&quot; We couldn't get thru either, but no problem as we had an alarm clock in the room. But they really need to work on this aspect of service. What if somebody really has an emergency?Overall the front desk staff would smile when you smiled first at them, but otherwise were cool. Perhaps it's a European thing, as most of them were from Western and Eastern European countries (although they all understood and spoke English well). The Polish guy at the door was the friendliest of the lot. Every time we exited the hotel, there was always someone cleaning the lobby, the waiting lounge or the sidewalks outside. Cleanliness was definitely not a problem here. Leaving the key at the front desk didn't bother us either. I'd rather do that than keep up with it.So what's the verdict? I can't really give this hotel 3.5 stars, like several sites do. It has a certain worn charm to it, but isn't quirky or personable enough to overcome its flaws. There are several other hotels that we passed from Paddington (other than the Hilton) which I recognized from this site. I'd recommend staying as close to Paddington as possible, or better yet, staying in an area that is closer to more active streetlife (pubs, shopping). I'd rather be able to step outside of a hotel, and be in the thick of things.	
Oct 17 2003	Be Aware	We agree with the reviews posted: the room was inconvienently small, front desk never answers the phone, hotel is under-staffed. We would like to add that we were nearly the victims of an apparantly common hotel practice of being overcharged for transportation when we requested a cab. The hotel concierge called their transportation, which was an unlicensed, unmetered, uninsured van which would have charged us 12 lbs for a ride to Victoria Station as opposed to 8.40 for a licensed, metered regular cab. So if you request a cab, make it clear you want a regular, metered London cab, not their private van. The room rate was good, but we got absolutely no more than we paid for, and we won't stay there again.	
Oct 14 2003	Terrible choice; stay elsewhere	Chose this hotel for proximity to Paddington station so we could easily be at the airport the next day. It was much further from the station than we had anticipated. We were given a former janitor's closet as a room. You could clearly see the former sign on our room door and our room number was marked in pencil on the hallway directional sign. Clearly, our room had recently been &quot;created&quot;. The room was below street level so you could only see the outdoors with half of the window. Staff was rude, we always had to wait just to drop off the room key which you must do EVERY time you leave the hotel. The key was like an elementary school hall pass. We saw several young guests lounging barefoot in the common area. It was only one night, but we will never go back there again.
