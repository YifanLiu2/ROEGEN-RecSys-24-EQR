Nov 24 2009 	Very Small Rooms	Fairly conveniently placed for underground connections to most of tourist attractions. Check-in was friendly and efficient and reception staff generally pleasant and helpful. Similarly, waiting staff in the Breakfast Room were hard working and attentive. All very positive so far, Unfortunately the rooms are very small, and I do mean small! In our room there was a king-sized bed which left little room for anything else, not even a chair. If you wanted to sit down, there was only the bed. The bathroom was also very small. There was a TV in the room but reception was so poor as to make it unusable. The walls between rooms were paper thin-or appeared to be-as we could hear the conversation quite clearly from the room next us. The hotel was spotlessly clean overall and we had no complaints on that score.Breakfast was more than adequate with a reasonable range of dishes. The published &quot;rack rate&quot; was £135 for a double and I don't believe it is value for money at that level.I have stayed in much worse hotels but none with smaller rooms-even in Tokyo.	
Nov 13 2009 	Good value and location  fine for a short stay.	Stayed one night following a concert at the RAH. Nearly went for something more expensive on the basis of some of the shocking reviews here but were glad we didn't. Yes, the room was small and the decor tired but the bathroom was clean , the shower hot and the sheets clean. The location was great, an easy, safe walk from the RAH with a selection of restaurants nearby. We didn't have the breakfast but there is a large Sainsburys nearby (with a Starbucks) that can fulfil most needs. For £65 a night in this part of the world we thought this good value although a stay of more than one night may have been pushing things.	
Nov 2 2009 	dont stay there!	the hotel was a big disappointment, i greatly regretted staying there. the room was in a bad state, it was freezing cold but they would not turn on central heating till november! there was a breeze coming in through the window, it was like camping in a small room. thank god they gave me a wool blanket so i wouldnt be as cold. unfriendly &quot;room service&quot; if you want to call it that, rusty bathroom, no food or snacks available, only breakfast for 5 pound which is a ridiculous price for some toast and orange cordial. i would never go back there, sorry.	
Oct 14 2009 	Good Location Everything else terrible	First of all, this hotel is in a very nice and quite area, not too far from Hyde Park, near Earls Cross underground. By tube its only 3 stops to Covent Garden and its has not far some restaurants and pubs. And from outside the hotel doesn't look too bad. Ok, this is the nice part. Then comes the rest: my bedroom was in a basement (a lot of rooms are in the basement) were there is a awful smell of gas. The bedroom was tiny (we couldnt walk straight because there were practically no space between the bed and the wall), the sheets were too old, there was a cockroach in the bathroom. I dont ask much in a hotel but this one was bellow standarts.... Most of all, the staff was very rude and everything we had to pay in advance (room, breakfast and so on). They could not charge in the room altought they pre-autorized 20£ charge in my credit card so if i didnt pay anything (who it was impossible because, as i sad, payed everything in advance including the 4 nights i stayed there). One night we arrived about 00h00 and the key didnt work. There was no one in the reception. We looked and found a girl in the kitchen. When we ask her to solve the problem or go get the clerk she stood there and sad that she couldnt do that because she had no autorization. Well, we had to wait about half hour before the clerk arrived... In conclusion, dont go to this hotel	
Oct 8 2009 	Good location room is poor ok for one night	I stayed at this hotel for one night during Wimbeldon and it was reasonably priced considering most hotels were booked during this period. The hotel was a good location but the room was not good. It was extremely hot with no air conditioning or fan. The elevator was broken. The internet terminal was in the lobby and cost $. There was no safe in the room for money or passports etc. All and all not the best hotel to stay at for more than one night. The hotel was clean and safe. The hotel was close to an internet cafe and the subway.	
Sep 22 2009 	Better than the reviews led me to fear	We stayed from September 6 to September 12. The hotel was booked in conjunction with our Air Canada flights. I was a bit worried from what I'd read in the reviews, but we were able to check in early without any difficulty. Our room was on the third floor near the small lift. It won't fit more than two people with luggage but it got us to the third floor every time. The room reminded us of a university residence with an ensuite. The bedding and towels were clean, the shower had good pressure and the temperature was good. My companion asked for a second blanket and one was delivered. Breakfast was fine with toast, cereal, buns and croissants. Plenty of jam. The spread wasn't as extensive as an all-inclusive, but the price was much less. Staff were friendly and helpful, although many had limited English. We did not visit the bar so can't comment. If you are in need of a clean bed in a great location, this hotel is an excellent choice. The location is roughly half-way between the Earl's Court and Gloucester Road tube stations. If you are coming from Heathrow, alight at Earl's Court and use the lift.	
Sep 15 2009 	Poor! Choose a travelodge instead!	Even for what we paid at supposedly 50% off this was poor value for money.The shoebox of a room consisted of a bed and 1 foot leg room around the bed. The bathroom was basic, dated and poorly constructed.The check-in was fine, after that it went downhill rapidly. The main lift didn't work, hadn't for sometime apparently, so you had the stairs or service lift, which could fit a maximum of 3 people, and you had to share with the dirty linen and staff that could not speak any English. The way it clunked its way up the through the floors had you offering prayers on a safe arrival at your floor!The bed linen was pretty non existant, and appeared to have been in use since the war! No duvets here, just a sheet and tatty blanket.The night time entertainment consisted of pornographic type soundtracks eminnating from a room a few doors down. At least he seemed to be enjoying his stay!!The breakfast was very poor. A stale croissant and toast, though there was no toast left!Oh yes don't forget the cornflakes! For an extra £2.50 you can upgrade to a cooked English Breakfast. based on the continental we didn't bother! McDonalds is just around the corner!For a few extra quid you can stay in a travel lodge type establishment - it would be money well spent!Whats good - great location for Earls Court - there are plenty of other hotels in the area you'll be pleased to know.	
Sep 12 2009 	Absolutely Horrible - Don't Go There!!!	Room tiny and dirty. . Staff uninterested and unhelpful. Breakfast disgusting. Doesn't deserve any stars.	
Sep 10 2009 	Clean central accessible close to a good selection of restaurants 	Helpful staff, clean with comfortable room/bathroom. Shower temperature stable with power, towels adequate with shower/shampoo sachets &amp; soap provided. Tea, Coffee, Sugar &amp; milk tubes (sometimes a challenge to open) gave refreshment. TV channels provided the basic 5 with reliability.Noisy guests returning later in the evening posed an irritation but it was momentary.Air Conditioning was provided &amp; both silent &amp; operationalDuring our last visit the lift was being maintained &amp; therefore out of use - we were in the basement with only one flight of stairs to negotiate.Breakfast was simple but enjoyable - we kept to the basic 'Continental' option with a more than adequate supply of croissants, butter, jam, marmalade, cereal options, milk, coffee, tea, orange juice etc. - you can inexpensively upgrade to 'Full English' if you wish.The Bar was well provisioned, a discount voucher provided for your first round, spending over £4 gained 30 minutes use of the hotels computer network.Staff were friendly &amp; helpful, room service left our room re-provisioned &amp; neat &amp; tidy.All in all this is the 4th time I have used this hotel - it provides a reliable, clean &amp; easily accessible hub for Earls Court &amp; surrounds	
Sep 2 2009 	Room was rundown and unclean. Insufficient bedding to keep warm.	No heating in room and room was cold. Light bulb not working. Bedding stained.Room poorly cleaned. Insufficient bedding to keep warm. Breakfast was very poor quality and very limited choice. Don't stay unless you are desparate.	
Aug 20 2009 	Not as bad as expected	After reading the reviews here I thought I was going to spend four nights in a dump. It was really not that bad!! The single room I was staying in and the doubleroom my friends were staying in were tiny, but all you do is sleep there so it doesn't matter. The room was clean, which is the most important thing. The location was super, only a five minute walk from Gloucester road underground station.It is definitely not the best hotel I have stayed at but it is not the worst either. I don't think I would recommend it to a friend, but I would tell my friend it is not as bad as the Trip Advisor reviews makes it sound like.	
Aug 12 2009	STAY AWAY	Okay I got to this hotel 2 hours before check-in so I left my baggage with them in their security room. Thing about it though, it's not locked, anyone can go in there. Anyways I checked in and I went to my room. The hallways were very small and I had to go through a fire door to get to my room which was not very convenient with all my luggage. I then go into my room and first thing I notice was the size. Very small barely any room to walk. Supposed to get 2 double beds instead got 2 single cots pushed together. The &quot;colour&quot; television only had 5 channels which only 3 had actual colour. Bathroom was not bad despite a hair I found but very small. At night it sounded like i was sleeping in the hallway, I could hear every door shut and close and I could hear people talking, showering and even brushing their teeth. Also our phone didn't work and it was very fixed. No fridge, microwave nothing. The customer service was horrible because I always got stuck with the same guy who was no help at all. Finally I got a room switch. The room was bigger, had bigger beds, bigger windows but it still wasn't great. The shower curtains didn't close all the way so water would go all over the place. Not to mention when I originally went to the room there were guys in it fixing it. The location isn't bad because it has very good restaurants around it plus an internet cafe which was excellent and had dirt cheap phone calls to Canada (5 pence a minute). Luckily there was a tube station 3 or so blocks down. The internet at the hotel was 12 pounds for 24 hours and not to mention anyone could access it unless your on your laptop. I got a late checkout because of the time of my flight. I had 2pm as a checkout time but at 1:30pm I was rudely interrupted by room service complaining they had to go home at 2. Not my fault. The man at the front desk actually called my house in Canada telling me if I wasn't out of there he was going to charge me 180 pounds.Bad stay. Don't go there.	
Aug 11 2009 	Terrible experience	Really terrible! We had all the &quot;adventures&quot; possible!!! A screaming client during the night (and the staff haven't made much to help), 1 hour locked in the elevator (that was broken before), a bug in the room, the window didn't opened weel (it was blocked), the room was very hot, the shower didn't worked well, the door was jammed (so we needed to pull and push very hard) the TV wasn't working well, the water heather wasn't working at all, the service was poor.... anyway, if you have a choice, don't go there!!!!	
Aug 4 2009 	Horrible service	Hotel is overrated. Service is terrible. Rooms are small, with dirty walls, and dirty carpets. If you need help than the hotel stuff wont be of help. They are very rude and nervous.Only good thing is location.Hotel is located in Kensigton aria.	
Jul 30 2009 	Very Accomadating	I found this hotel to be an excellent place for the money spent. The room was clean and had a beautiful view of the church across the street. Very close to the tube and supermarkets. The staff was very accomadating since I travelled with an 11 month old. They checked us in 5hrs early so we had a place for her to sleep, warmed her food daily as well as provided us with a mini cooler fridge in our room to put her food in. I would definately stay there again.	
Jul 27 2009 	The WORST hotel I've ever stayed in!!!	Oh boy, where to start...This piece of [--] hotel should be condemned and closed down. Never, ever have I ever had such an awful experience at a hotel. I was there with my 14 year old son and if this hotel hadn't already been paid for through my vacation package, I would of checked out immediately after seeing our &quot;double room&quot; which consisted of two twin cots pushed together without enough space to make them seperate beds. I was with my 14 year old son for goodness sake. I tried calling down to the front desk only to find out that our phone didn't work. I went down to the front desk to ask for a larger room with beds that didn't physically touch and also had a working phone only to be told that they were fully booked and I would have to wait until the next day.During this time, there was a problem with part of my vacation and I NEEDED a telephone. Since the phone in our room wasn't working, I asked if they could dial a local number for me from the house phone in the lobby. Nooooo, that phone only RECEIVES calls. So I asked where a payphone was only to be dismissed with a wave of a hand. I asked for change for the payphone...NOOOOOO they can't provide change for the payphone either. Finally, in tears from frustration, I demanded to know where exactly the payphone was and was given the answer of &quot;on Cromwell Road&quot;. Beautiful.Reluctantly somebody finally dialled the number I needed (on the house phone that only RECEIVES calls) and I was able to make my call.The next day, I came down and asked if they had another room ready for me. Nope.Needless to say, it took 4 days before they changed our room. It was slightly larger, and at least there was some space between the beds. However, there was a massive ball of thread or yarn or something in the corner of the room when we checked in. Not a big deal but I decided to leave it there to see how long before it was noticed or cleaned up. Needless to say, it was still there when we checked out. Housekeeping consisted of them coming in and making the beds and folding the towels. Not once was anything actually CLEANED.I wouldn't stay in this [--] again if you paid me. The front desk guy is the rudest, meanest, [--] I've ever met.I requested a late checkout til 2 pm and they told me no problem. Just call down in the morning to remind us. I said okay. I called in the a.m. to remind them of the arrangement I had made the night before for a checkout of 2 p.m. &quot;No problem&quot; I was told. So the day of checkout, my son and I are out and about doing our last minute London things. We get back to the hotel at 1:15 to a yelling front desk clerk. He said he's been trying to call my room and there has been no answer. No [--] sherlock, we're just getting back. He is absolutely livid that I was supposed to be gone at 11 and I'm still there and if I don't check out they are charging me 135 pounds. I told him I had an arrangement (with him of all fricking people) to check out late. Anyway, he rants and raves for awhile. I go upstairs to finish packing and now it's housekeeping banging on my door telling me to get out. OMFG!!! These people are whacked!!! So I finally get everything packed and we're downstairs in the lobby by 1:30. Mr. Personality at the front desk is still ranting and raving. I told him that obviously there was a miscommunication and that I was out in plenty of time for housekeeping to &quot;clean&quot; the room. He did not charge me 135 pounds (but even if he did, I would have disputed the transaction with my credit card company).And get this, I get back home to Canada the next day and there is a message on my answering machine from the nutjob at the front desk telling me if I'm not out of the hotel by 2 pm they are charging me 135 pounds. Now seriously, what are the fricking chances that I'm actually going to receive a message left for me in Canada when I'm in LONDON!!!I would never, ever, in a million years recommend this hotel to anybody, not even my worst enemy.Stay away families, stay away couples, stay away elderly travellers, stay away students, stay away anybody from anywhere!!!	
Jul 12 2009 	Awful awful place worst hotel ever stayed in.	Booked this a week before our visit through lastminute.com. Hotel website describes refurbished rooms and believe me, they must have had a very good photographer to make the place look something it isn't. We arrived after lunch and they hadn't allocated us a room. They then tried to put us in a twin despite having a print out that confirmed we had booked a double. They placed us in a corner room on the 5th floor which according to the receptionist was a &quot;lovely nice room&quot;. It was absolutely boiling hot, with no aircon and only one of the two windows opened. The room was an absolute disgrace, it's only saving grace was the clean bathroom. They had pushed together two single beds, and there was a gap of about one and a half feet to squeeze round the bed. The sheets were clean, just, but the scabby old blanket on the bed left a lot to be desired. To say I was quite possibley scared of touching said blanket is an understatement.It is quite obvious, unless the other rooms are as bad, that they have kept a few un-refurbished rooms for lastminute.com customers who aren't paying &quot;full whack&quot;. We didn't even bother with breakfast. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, unless you really don't care about where you stay and only want a roof over your head for the night.	
Jun 16 2009 	Great location for Earl's Court - very basic	I stayed here with a friend when we visited London to go to the Brits in Earls Court. The hotel was ideally placed for this, and was close to the bars in Earl's Court. Our room was booked a day or so before we were travelling, and was quite inexpensive at about £30 per person. We had a twin room but it was very small, with the beds close up next to one another, and very little space. Ensuite bathroom was tiny but fit for purpose. Only real complaint would be that the room was boiling hot, and there were no windows which could be opened. English Breakfast was included but this was very basic and wasn't to our taste - we headed for a local coffee shop instead. All in all cheap and cheerful, but great location.	
May 10 2009 	Looks better from the outside!	Had the mis-fortune to stay at the Ambassadors for 1 night on Tuesday 28th April, booking through Lastminute.com . The room we stayed in was very small, run down and dirty. The bed linen appeared to be old and dirty and needed to be thrown away rather than changed! The bathroom was extremely dirty with paint peeling off the walls and dirt and rust hanging off the radiator.The cooked breakfast was thrown at us and was poor quality although there was plenty of toast and croissants to fill up on.This stay cost £61.00 for 2 people so for London it was quite cheap but I certainly wouldn't want to stay more than 1 night. We definitely won't be staying here again!	
Apr 17 2009 	Blood stained pillow dirty sheets rudest manager in the UK!	Where do I begin... I booked the hotel on a &quot;special offer&quot; at £50 for a nights stay. Alledgedly this was a huge price reduction. Upon arrival we were given a key to a room in the basement. After eventually locating the room through a maze of dingy corridors we found the room. I say room, but cell would be a more accurate description. It was dark, tiny, very shabby and had bars all over the window. Hate at first sight! We went back to the reception, and complained. The man at the desk said people often complained about those rooms, could not give us a refund as the manager was unavailable and offered us an alternative on the third floor. The room again was very shabby, boiling hot, very small, the shower was clearly bodged as was a array of grotty pipes in a bathroom that you couldn't move in if the door was open. Reluctently after a long day travelling, we accepted the room as we were only going to suffer it for one night. After returning to the room post dinner in a local restaurant, we got back and decided to watch the tv to distract ourselves from the grimness of the room. We could get poor reception on only two channels on a tiny old portable tv, so gave up and decided to get some sleep. Bad move. I pulled back the first thin quilt to reveal it's underside was obviously unwashed for some time, underneath it was something that resembled an old &quot;velvet effect&quot; curtain with some burn holes in it. Under that was a very thin sheet on a very cheap, lumpy mattress. But the worst wasstill to come... One pillow had a turin shrine like image of someone elses make-up, another, had a deep, large blood stain the size of a fist on the actual pillow. Now exhausted and extremely fed up, we threw the revolting articles on the floor, and resolved to complain in the morning. We woke up and got out as soon as possible to see someone to complain. The receptionist got a duty manager, who spoke to presumably a cleaning supervisor who went and checked our bedding. Obviously embarassed and not too surprised by our circumstance, they went to see the hotel manger, whho was desperately trying to avoid us in his office. We were offered 10% back. Understandably unimpressed, we asked again to speak to the actual manger. This time he stormed from his office, told us we were only able to have the 10% off and what did we expect for what we'd paid. I pointed out his customer service skills were as acceptable as a blood soaked pillow, at which point he shrugged and pointed out it had a pillow case on it so it wasn't bad at all. Not once did he apologise, in fact if anything he was busy trying to be intimidating and arrogant. We gave up and left, promising to seek compensation another way. So in short, don't book here! By the looks of other reviews we're not alone, 3 stars is a joke of a rating for this hell-hole.	
Apr 17 2009 	location good-value poor-single room at double price	The pictures on the website are nothing like the hotel. Our single room masqueraded as a double. We booked a twin and got a room with a double bed and nothing else. There was no room to walk round the bed-jammed against the window. The shower leaked all over the floor. The blankets needed cleaning. No staff spoke at breakfast, very few seemed to speak english. Cooked breakfast resulted in the same breakfast being placed in front of everyone, including the vegetarian, no toast available. Visitors who asked for a cot were told, no cots availalbe. Complain in the morning to the manager. The morning receptionist was very helpful. More like a hostel than a hotel, definitely not 3 star. Definitely the worst hotel we have ever stayed in.	
Apr 13 2009 	Much better than expected	I have recently read most of the reviews of the Ambassadors Hotel and my expectations were very low after that. However when we arrived it turned out to be really very good. It was clean, the service friendly, the breakfast (cooked) good. I agree that the rooms are a bit on the small side but on the other hand, the bed was enormous. No mould or dirt as described in other reviews. The rooms were made up very nicely every day. We all agreed, we would certainly come back another time	
Mar 2 2009 	Terrible Service mouldy walls insects!	Where do I start???My Mum had booked a triple room 2 weeks before arrival on rooms.com and we arrived with the confirmation sheet that the room was booked and paid for. We were told there was no such booking! We waited close to an hour before it was sorted. We were offered 3 single rooms which we did not want. We were not even offered a cup of tea while we waited! Eventually got the room which meant some other visitors would have the same hassle later that evening. The receptionist had not got a clue and never once apologised for the mix up!the room was tiny and the walls had mould on them. I am not fussy but when my mother woke up with insect bites, i was disgusted!we decided to just try and enjoy our weekend away anyway!Breakfast conisted of 3 choices of ceraels, bread rolls (not croissants) and tea/coffee - all of which we had to get ourselves through the crowded room.when we were checking out, we were told that their was a phone call at 7am that morning from someone!!! We asked who called and were told 'I forgot to write his name down'. We were told that they had tried to put the call through which I dont believe for a second as we were awake at the time.Checking out, there was no thank you and no apology for the mix up. This kind of 'hotel'! should be closed down as it gives foreign tourists a bad impression of London.	
Feb 17 2009 	Inexpensiveno frills hotel! Excellent location for price.	Firstly, I would say that the reviews that I read before my boyfriend and I went away did worry me but I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt.However, I think most of the reviews are exaggerated and people obviously didn't realise a 3* hotel in the centre of London would be the standard of the Ritz clearly not done their research if you ask me!!!!!When we arrived we did have to wait in reception in order to check in and get our key card as the reception area did seem to be under staffed. Not the warmest of welcomes to be honest.We were allocated a room on the 3rd floor, yes the room was small but it was clean and to be honest we were more interested in seeing the sites of London than lounging about the hotel room. The shower was super and the bed was comfy what more do you need!There wasn't too much wardrobe space as we were there for 4 nights but it was ok.The breakfast was a full english not worth £7.50 I must add but nevertheless it set us up for the day. There could have been more of a selection on the continental side. We had paid for breakfast anyway but some people would pay that price.One thing I would say is that there is not a lock on the door of the luggage room were we left our bags on our last day. Anyone could have said they stayed at the hotel and went and took someone's luggage. Our purpose was to see the sites of London over Valentines long weekend we had a fabulous time and the hotel was overall a great base for seeing the city. If you read this and are after a cheap and cheerful hotel in the centre of London then this hotel is ideal.	
Feb 16 2009 	Very disappointing	First impressions were good - the location is an expensive-looking quiet street and the foyer and juice bar looked perfectly fine. However, our double room wasn't big enough to swing a cat in. Both my wife and I cut our legs on the corners of the bedframe squeezing round the bed (such was the lack of space). The hallways were roasting - heating must have been up full blast. Bathroom was basic and tired but adequate. Required renovation. Room appeared clean, but upon returning one evening we discovered a large cockroach in the bathroom - perhaps attracted by the warm, humid conditions (there was no fan in the enclosed bathroom). The 1980s portable TV barely had reception for 2 channels. Breakfast was mediocre and overpriced - we got a far nicer one in Covent Garden the second day for a fraction of the price. For central London this hotel was well priced, as long as you don't mind very small cockroach-infested rooms with poor facilities.	
Jan 12 2009 	Disgusting!	I can honestly say this hotel is THE worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I went away, for one night, with a friend and couldn't have been more disgusted. The first room we were put in didn't even have enough space to walk straight forward. This was supposedly a twin, which to my understanding is two single beds? Instead it was two beds joined together. Mould was growing from the walls and the skirting boards were rotting, which affected my asthma. We went to reception and the receptionists looked worried but agreed to move us to another room. This was a triple, and had no heating apart from one small electric heater which took nearly an hour to heat up. We could have dealt with this if it wasn't for the shower also not working (only cold water would come out of the taps!).Again, we got moved to another room, this time on the fifth floor, which was the worst of the lot. There was mould growing from the ceiling, tiles coming away from the bathroom floor, blood on the bedsheets, womens hair on the towels and beds (this can't be ours as i have short hair and my friend has blonde hair whereas this is long black hair). My friend and I couldn't be doing with another argument with the very rude management so decided to put up with the room as it was only for one night, only to find that after Id showered, the bathroom floor was flooded in about an inch of water, ruining my clothes (which i hadn't expected to be in danger when i left on the floor!!). When we went downstairs to speak to management, we were told that there was only one member of staff until nine the next morning, who was a newly trained, obviously very nervous reception who ddn't speak the best english. We cleared the water up best we could with the few handtowels we were given and wentt out. In the morning we had out &quot;full&quot; english breakfast which consisted of, on my plate: 1 bacon, 1 sausage, 1 hash brown, 1 quarter tomato and on my friends plate: 1 bacon, 3 button mushrooms, a tiny slice of tomato and 1 hash brown. Although our breakfast was included in the package, some people would've paid £7.50 for this! Before we had a chance to even eat the little we had, I found a hair on my sausage and it was pink in the middle so we left, hungry. The waiting staff were also extremely rude and made both my friend and I feel extremely uncomfortable, by speaking not to our eyes, but to our chests (&amp; we were still in our baggy pyjamas! not sat there in our underwear!!)Management had not arrived at nine, as we were told but we had to wait til we collected our luggage (from the unlocked, unguarded cupboard!) when we finnally got to speak to someone. The way I was spoken to was nothing less than disgusting! I was spoken to as if I was 5, and accused of leaving the quite obviously old blood on the sheets and putting my hair on the towels and sheets. Obviously I did this before I even checked in ;)Overall, this hotel is the most repulsive place I have ever spent the night! And my standards are not high!!	
Dec 1 2008 	don't let this place be your ambassador to London	This was the worst hotel I've ever experienced. Carpets are stained and patched with mismatched patterns, window blinds are broken, rooms are tiny, dirty, and undecorated. I had to borrow pliers from the front desk to adjust the radiator. The phone in my room was not wired for outside calling. Employees represent many nations of the world, which is great, but makes communication very difficult. The in-house coffee bar doesn't serve coffee until after 11:00 AM. I was told that if I filled out the customer complaint form, the manager would just throw it away.	
Nov 6 2008 	Clean but tiny room and extremely hot in there!	Down to London for four nights with my job. I choose this hotel because it was working within a budget and it was a sensible distance, via the Piccadilly Tube, to my place of work. Checked in - fine, and I found the staff to be friendly and polite at all times. Got to my room - opened the door - this was the tiniest bedroom I have ever been in. Very clean - but just a tad too small to be considered cosy. During my stay the room was made up as one would expect - with nice new clean towels, etc. no problems there. Unfortunately the central heating in my room was on full blast at all times, all through the night. The large window had a chain on it restricting the opening somewhat. It was like a bloodly Turkish bath in there! I reported this after the first night, but it was,nt corrected by the time I came to check out, days later. Continental breakfast was provided, - but unfortunaley the staff there did,nt seem to be able to toast 2 slices of bread. Pity - might have been prepared to put up without the toast but the sauna conditions have meant I will be staying elsewhere in future.	
Nov 5 2008 	Terrible terrible terrible	We booked through &quot;Superbreaks&quot; for 3 days in London to celebrate the 21st birthday of my daughter and have never ever been so disappointed with a hotel anywhere in the world.We had been &quot;upgraded to the suite&quot; which was in the basement looking out onto a small terrace covered in rubbish including a used condom. The double glazed units around the terrace did not fit properly and there was a constant draght. On the first morning we had an electrical problem which meant no power to the suite for over an hour. We then found that the shower wouldn't drain and the bath taps did not work. Additionally there was no heating in the room apart from two oil filled electric radiators and one broken a/c unit.The &quot;full english&quot; breakfast food was lukewarm at best with a very poor buffet selection of cooked items.On our second morning the toilet blocked and overflowed and filth started coming up through the bath plughole when the shower cubicle was used.The management seemed totally disinterested in any of the problems. Just dreadful.	
Oct 23 2008 	Filthy Hovel!	Absolutely filthy, grotty hovel.We work away from home at least 6 months a year, and this is one of the worst hotels we have stayed in for a long time. We arrived around midnight, complete with booking number. They could not find the reservation, and hence the payment made by our company. After paying again we went to the smallest, dirtiest room I have seen. Towels were dirty from the last occupant, bedclothes were just as bad! Glad we only had 2 nights there. Didn't try the food - didn't want to take the risk.NEVER AGAIN!	
Oct 14 2008 	Wouldn't go back	I booked this hotel because I had stayed there about 4 years ago and was very pleased with it. However, I was disappointed with my return visit. We arrived at the hotel after 12.30pm and approached the check-in desk. I acknowledged that we were early but asked if there was a possibility we could check-in (I had checked the website before travelling and noted that check-in time was 1pm). I gave my name and handed the man on reception my print off of the confirmation email from Roomex.com. He asked what name I booked under and searched for my booking, he then asked who I booked it through and continued searching. It was as if I didn't have a booking. I was then told that he couldn't find my booking and I was asked to take a seat and wait. Eventually he approached me and said we found it but you can't check in until 2pm, I said that the website said 1pm and he said 'well its 2pm'. I had to ask if there was somewhere that we could put our bags for the hour while we waited and he said 'ya, over there' without offering help. At no point did he apologise for the delay.We returned after 2pm to check-in and waited at the desk and handed in the printed email again and he didn't even acknowledge the fact that we had been there earlier and had dealt with him. He then said 'One twin room, yes' and I said 'no the booking is for two twin rooms', we eventually got to our rooms - one twin and one DOUBLE! One of my companions contacted reception to say that they had been given a double room instead of a twin and was told by the person at the other end of the phone that they didn't understand what she was saying. Eventually, after the third phone call they were told to come back to reception where they were asked repeatedly if they touched anything in the room - which they obviously hadn't. They were finally given a twin room in the attic.Based on my past experience I have recommended this hotel to friends and now I am sorry that I have. I certainly wouldn't book it again.	
Oct 3 2008 	Basic but OK	Stayed here on business for a night on the 1st of October and to be honest it wasn't that bad. The rooms are very small, but then I wasn't there to lounge about in the height of luxury so it didn't really bother me. The furnishings are clean and in good repair and the bed was pretty comfortable.The staff were friendly and helpful, although I didn't really have cause to deal with them much... The restaurant does a decent enough breakfast, and the waiting staff clear and reset the tables very efficiently.Probably the only two negatives were the bar didn't appear to have a licence and only sold non-alcoholic beverages (hey I'm not a drunkard, but it would have been nice to be able to relax with a beer) and that the wi-fi wasn't free.All in all, happy to have stayed there on business but if I was visiting London for fun I'd stay somehwere a bit more plush!	
Aug 9 2008 	Absolute Crap	I wish I'd known about this website before we booked.Wanting to spend a few days in London, we opted to go for a 3 Star Hotel and not go for our usual Holiday Inn weekend break. On arrival the place looked disappointing. We checked in and made our way to the lift. It was tiny. It smelled, was covered in graffiti and it was obvious someone had been smoking in there. (And this is coming from someone who smokes). The corridors were tiny and on opening the door to our room, the look on my boyfriends face said it all. I took one look at the room and burst into tears. The &quot;art work&quot; on the wall was a map of the London Underground - need I say more?The carpet was ripped, the bedside lamp was broken and hanging off its fitting. The bathroom - covered in mould. It was hideous.When I told reception it that there was no way this was acceptable, he seemed to be suprised! We were shown another room and again, the bathroom was hideous. We decided that there was no way we could stay in the hotel but nor did we have the time or energy to look for another one after a long day travelling. We were then given a twin room. Again the bathroom was hideous. There was a huge crack in the sink and had simply just been filled in with super glue. Our travel agents were a problem, as they really didnt care how bad it was or offer to help move us. After &quot;settling&quot; for the twin room, realizing it was only for one night, we took a trip down the road to Holiday Inn and ended up staying there afterall. The consierge who helped us out was worth the extra money we had to pay.All in all, AVOID this hotel at all costs, the staff really didn't care how upset we ,weren't helpful and looked at us like we were mad when we told them about the problems with the room and the management were not available to speak to. 3 Stars? 3 STARS! YEAH RIGHT!(IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE PICTURES OF THE &quot;DELIGHTFUL&quot; ROOMS THE AMBASSADORS HOTEL OFFERED US, INCASE YOU THINK I'M BLOWING THIS OUT OF PROPORTION - I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO E-MAIL PICTURES :D )	
Aug 3 2008 	DISASTER!!!	there is absolutely no atmosphere in the hotel.alcohol is also not served and the people prefer to just stare at you than serve you!!i booked a twin room and was given a tiny double, eventually was moved to a twin which was extremely tiny.your arms out stretched reached 3/4 of the way across the room.the bathroom was even smaller and was nearly impossible to shut the door when inside! there was ripped carpet and the mattress' were broken! there was no a/c either and the rooms were boiling, it was too noisey to even open a window.when leaving the hotel a man asked what room we were in and that he was on that floor the week before and had a similar problem.The hotel is not deserving of a 3star and it is far from it.	
Jul 29 2008 	Never again	I had to stay in London for a few days during high season. This hotel was horrible. It was August so terribly hot, but all you can do is open up one of the small windows. In the middle of the night, it's like 3 AM, the fire alarm goes off! So quickly into our shoes, alrady in the hallway when the alarm gets turned off again. Not one notice of why, how, or not even an apology. Rooms are very noisy, there was a big group so during the night doors keep slamming and lots of street noise. Breakfast was far below average. Rooms are sooo unbelievably small and the shower water gets all over the place. Only positive thing I can say about this place is that it's located near the subway.	
Jul 7 2008 	Worst Hotel I Have Been In My Life	I travel an average of 2 weeks a month, and this is without doubt the worst hotel I have ever been in. The whole experience with this Hotel was an absolute nightmare. We stayed for 4 days in this hotel, the rooms were smaller than a prison cell. Our door wouldn't open and was not fixed during our stay. Every time we wanted to get into our room, we had to be scorted by someone in reception with a masterkey. the Hotel was fully booked and we didn't get an alternative room. We complained to general management, but obtained no response at all	
Jul 3 2008 	Ambassadors - Basic but acceptable	Had decided at very short notice (ie at 5pm that day!) to stay on London following a corporate event and a friend had recommended the hotel.Rate was good - GBP63 so booked the hotel.Got there at 11.30 and the reception desk was smily and helpful. Life was a bit 'bouncy' and small but it worked and was not groaning.Room was really clean and tidy: little small but I literally needed somewhere to sleep and then to shower in the morning. Bed was clean and comfortable and there were tea and coffee making facilities. Room was on the road side so was noisy when a fire engine came for somewhere nearby - but hardly the hotel's fault.Shower worked fine and there were fresh toiletries and nice clean towels and facecloth. A small thing which I liked - tissues in the bedroom and the bathroom. Small table which I sat at to blow dry hair and TV worked fine.I did not have breakfast but the room looked lively. The hotel also has a bar: I did not partake but again looks nice.Overall I was happy - I got what I paid for in London and I'll certainly go there again.	
Jun 22 2008 	Good basic hotel	We stayed 4 persons in two rooms at the Ambassadors at the beguinning of june 2008and had an excellent stay . The hotel is located near busses and the underground and all parts of London are easily accessible.Staff at the hotel especially at the reception were very helpfull. The rooms were small and not very cozy but they were clean and neat as were the bathrooms.Our stay included a fair continental breakfast.When we vere there the temperature outside was around 20 degrees celcius and the rooms vere quite warm and I guess it will not be a pleasant stay during the summer as there is no air condition.The Ambassadors is low priced and as such we got good value for our money and we will come back to the hotel, if it is not in the summer.	
Jun 3 2008 	Do Not stay here!	I booked this mistakenly thinking it was part of the same organisation as the Ambassador(s) in Bloomsbury, where I have stayed &amp; it was lovely. After my first night I asked to be moved as the shower did not drain properly so one had to shower in 'stages' - also the shower stall absolutely tiny &amp; water ended up on the floor. TV did not work in first room; it did in second room, but standard 4 channels only. I ate breakfast the first morning but not again - watered down fruit juice &amp; average food. I have stayed in much nicer hotels for the same price (£75/night). Location is good, but that's about it - the staff, I must say, were charming &amp; helpful, although I did not have many dealings with them. Furniture is very poor standard, both rooms I occupied were noisy. The second room was a double, allegedly, although the only way one could use the desk/dressing table was to sit on the end of the bed - no space for a chair! I filled in a feedback form but have yet to hear from them!	
Apr 21 2008	Would Never Stay There Again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wanted an inexpensive place to stay in London for the last night of my trip to England and Paris. I only stayed here because the B &amp; B I usually stay at in Chiswick (The Swan Private Guest House; a very nice inexpensive place) was totally booked (I stayed there the first night of my trip). I arrived and the check in staff was very nice (a bit inexperienced). That was the last nice thing I can say about the place other than the lobby cafe and internet services seemed nice but I didn't use them, and the hotel is convenient to the Gloucester Road tube station. I arrived to my floor in the elevator to see what I thought was a welfare hotel with old mentally unbalanced residents lingering in the hallway. When I arrived to my room the horror show continued with a very run down room. The carpet was wet and smelly (which I discovered why the next day when I was showering in the miniscule shower the water just gets all over the bathroom floor and proceeds to the rug hence the wet smelly carpet). The bed was uncomfortable. My room was on the street side and was noisy because of that. I could go on and on but overall a bad experience!	
Apr 17 2008	A nightmare	I've been at the &quot;Ambassadors Hotel&quot; on Work and it was a nightmare.When we arrived we were amazed by the rude treatment at the reception and it just got worst. They give us a room on the 5th floor, both lifts got broken on the 2nd day, so, during 2 days we just had to use the stairs. We only found 2 nice members of the staff. All the others were just unfriendly and unpolite. For several times we asked them informations and they answered rudly and turned the backs on us for twice. that's not normal....The room was very small. When i had my bag open, my collegaue couldn't have her's open at the same time. There is no mini-bar and no CD player on the room as they advertise.The breakfast is nice.,nothing supreme, has the basic things.If we could, we would have changed hotel, cause is its the worst we have ever been.	
Apr 16 2008 	Disaster!!	Long story short. Arrived@hotel 11.30pm, late check in went fine. Woke next morning and noticed an old used condom hanging from the in-room hairdryer!!! Politely notified reception on way out 4afternoon, asked 4room 2b cleaned. Came bak 2find room clean and my cash (roughly £200) stolen from safe we'd (admittedly, stupidly!!) left ajar!! Notified reception after tearing room apart 2b sure it was gone, the response being a flat &quot;..its nothing 2do wit d hotel, u need 2contact police&quot;. No offer of using recepion fone or help finding police station number. She simply ignored us. Most staff we came in contact with from then on pretty much avoided us. No member of management (after many requests) would speak to us face2face (4d record, d officers said dare was every indication it was a member of staff since dare wasn't forced entry) Only saving grace was a very empathetic 20sumthing man on reception who was friendly thru-out. Location was convenient.	
Apr 16 2008	Absolutely horrible!!!!!!	This was without a doubt the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel. This double booked my room and told me that they would find me a room at one of their partner hotels. They assured me that there would be rooms available at the other hotel. There were not any rooms available. After waiting almost 3 hours, they finally found me a room at the Best Western.They told me that since I only gave a credit card number to hold the room, it only guarantees that I will have a room. Perhaps they need to look up the definition of the word guarantee. To all those looking for a room in London, please book it anywhere BUT the Ambassadors Hotel. From other reviews I have read, it seems like double booking is a common occurance there. The staff was rude and very unhelpful.	
Apr 14 2008 	Poor staff - 'tatty' apperance	The hotel is situated close to the tube at Glouster Road approx 5 min. walk.When checking in the staff on duty appeared to have trouble understanding me as their English was not good enough, he appeared to have trouble locating our room!! I expected a problem because our party had three rooms booked via two agents under the same name - this shouldn't really cause a problem. We were sent to a 'suite' in the basement which was not a suite, but was in the basement. The room was cold, the ceiling was low (i am 6'6&quot; so not a freak), the wardrobe door was hanging off, the paint was peeling from the ceiling in the bathroom, the bath did not run, the shower did not drain very quickly, and there was no view of London from the basement. I was running the London Marathon on the Sunday morning and had requested the facility of an early breakfast on the day of the run as offered by lots of London hotels - this request was met by staff who did not appear interested. They stood around with hands in pockets shrugging shoulders - I heard one staff member say to another guest who was double booked &quot;you have to help me out here&quot;!!! The bed was uncomfortable, and the general cleanliness was poor - we found a dead cockroach in the bathroom upon arrival.The breakfast I did have after night 2 was good, and there were plenty of staff. I was also suprised by the amount of guests who had stayed in the hotel, and wondered if they thought it was acceptable or not. As we waited to check out there were still un-happy guests and potential guests complaining about various problems and being met by indifferent staff who didn't want to help. So much for service.This hotel is poor, I am aware it is only 2star but the basics were missing - it is more like a hostel and if you want a hotel - then book somewhere different, if you just want a 'tatty' room stay here.	
Apr 1 2008 	Great Breakfast included in price	I And three other friends stayed at the Ambassadors hotel. The biggest problem was that my room had been shorted by about a foot with a build to the wall headboard and My friend and i were sharing and repeatly stubbed our toes from the first bed. But to be fair the housekeeping was first rate. Every day the beds were made and the room was clean. But by far was the breakfast that was included in our price. Fruit, Breads, Cereal, Cheese, Preserve, Yougurts, Tea Coffee Hot Chocolate &amp; Hot Milk which were restocked quickly and repeatly. The dining area was clean	
Feb 26 2008 	great location nightmare time- They distroyed our trip turned out ok!!	In November my boyf and i booked this hotel online as it seemed convinient to our plans in London.We had a theatre - dinner ticket for 6 o'clock and arrived at the hotel at 4:00 only to be told they were double booked, with this we were told nothing else except we were off to a Travel lodge in Battersea, obviously not knowing London well i was asking location and trasport and they gave me nothing- also the girl was extremley rude and obnoxiousAfter alot of upset as it was now 430 we were told we would have a taxi to Battersea and not to worry. I called someone who lives in London whom told me i could only get a train or bus as there is no tube stop and Battersea is over the river, not far but very incovinient. The manager could see i was distressed and offered to send a taxi to take us to covent garden at 510, so we reached Battersea at 5:00 with no time to change (after a long day urgh), - The travel lodge was next to NOWHERE (and a scruffy one at that)and more in Clapham(i think) than Battersea, the taxi wouldnt wait as another had been booked and we rushed to get changed in 5 mins thinking we mayas well/Several times we called the hotel and the taxi had not arrived (amongs a comedy of errors), finally at 610 it got there, we had to phone the restaurant who were understanding, we got there 650 and had to explain that we needed to be seated at 720 in the theatre 10 mins away. They were really good and got our food quickly, but the whole night and the whole point of visiting London was ruined for us both. Not to mention after the show we had to have a drink in CG when the plan was to get the tube back to gloucster road where we had already cased bars out by the hotel (as there was NOTHING by our travelodge)- we then had to get back to battersea and as we had no idea where we were in comparison to buses and trains (as hotel didnt know and we had no time) it cost us £20 (And the taxi driver deducted £5 as he felt sorry for us) to get back, which was money we didnt need to spend if we were at GR.anyway after all the waste of time (shows is good by the way) and alot of complaining the hotel manager agreed to refund us and offered a free nights stay. - with that she was really helpful and understanding. We took the nights stay up in Feb and were put in the executive room, it was nice and clean, a bit small and not very executive (what do you expect in central London for the price), we had a good time tho. The view was a bit rubbish and bathroom a bit dark but we couldnt moan as it was free. The 2 men on reception were brilliant, and friendly (they must have beentod to be extra nice to us after) and we had a ful compimentary breakfast whch was quite nice and pretty good for vegiterians too!!all in all if your not messed about its alright, pretty budget - and not recommended for more than a night!	
Feb 25 2008 	Decent hotel in a decent location	This hotel is nothing special, but a decent hotel in a decent location, not too far from Earls Court, about 0,8 miles to Earls Court Station, but a little closer to Gloucester Road (station). Have in mind that there aren't a lot of restaurants or shops near the hotel, but Earls Court are, as mentioned, not too far away.The rooms are small, though clean, and the continental breakfast, which is included, is also decent, though, if you're planning to stay for more than two or three days, you'll probably rather buy breakfast somewhere else, just to try something different.But as I booked a room for this hotel, all I was looking for was a room with a good bed and a bathroom at a fair price, and that's what I got, and I had no problem with the staff. But that being said, there are other hotels I would rather recommend, especially if yoy're staying for longer.	
Feb 17 2008 	Basic but Good Value	Rooms - small - (very small if you are american) - basic but clean. Kettle / coffee etc.Windows didnt shut properly - not a problem as need air in small room but someone decided to play loud (disco loud) music in the street at 5am and the windows wouldn't shut to reduce noise.No blanket provided for bed - ok as weather good.Bathroom tiny - door just misses toilet pan but again clean and great shower.The coridors could do with being redecorated but they do not smell or anything.Didn't have breakfast but it looked OK - very busy, people queueing.reception staff were courteous and friendly, as were bar staff.Location of hotel was excellent - 3 mins from underground although if I had followed the map on the website i would have been near Euston!!!Overall i would recommend the hotel - great value for money - convenient location and staff were friendly.A lot of people have moaned but if you accept you are not actually in a 3 star hotel and you have not paid the earth it is more than fine.	
Feb 9 2008 	Worse hotel ever been	Me and my boss booked 2 single rooms to stay during the WTM. We arrived very late in the night very tired from a long day and wantet to get some rest. It was almost immosible as the room was cold (-2 outeside temp.) and the heating was off. The window was not properly closed as it was damaged and the most important.......the bed was very small!!! It was made for people no taller than 1,60m (I am 1,80 normal built). The next morning I asked from them to move in an other room but the hotel was fully booked. I asked them to check the window so at least I could sleep without freezing and the noise of the road but nothing was done during the 4 days we stayed there, although I was asking for a solution every day. The &quot;room&quot; was tiny and the furnitire was made of the cheapest material existing. The cleaning staff was just covering the bed every day without even trying to make it proper. The bathroom was dirty and the shower curtin in a very bad condition. There was a notice about enviroment and not to give the towels away if there was no need but as I was always hanging them in order not to be taken away, I was finding new towels every day.There was a small boiler for coffee in the &quot;room&quot; but was not ever cleaned since it was bought. Full of remains from previous uses!!!!I work in hotels for more than 20 years and travel a lot due to my work and I can tell that this is by far the worse hotel I've ever been.......Avoid it...........	
Dec 23 2007	not great	I suppose for what you pay it's not bad. But not great either.The smaller independant hotels offer better value and are, if you get the right ones much nicer.Felt a bit like student halls, and I was at uni 30 years ago! so I'm probably doing Halls a diservice.the worst thing was the minute shower. I'm reasonably tall, just under six foot but not fat and it was a real squeeze, the flippin shower curtain kept sticking to me and you couldn't even turn around in the shower.Try somwhere else if you canrodge	
Dec 16 2007 	Awful !!!	I attended London on business and used an agency to find this hotel.It would have been far better ataying in the YMCA or some other hostel, than stay in this place. My room was a single with enough room for a single bed with unpainted MDF carcassing knocked together to form shelves and vanity unit.The room door (frame) looked as though it had been broken into by burglars the day before.I had a long wait for breakfast, which I hasten to add, did not hang around for.Definitely give this hotel a miss.	
Dec 11 2007 	Terrible room conditions	On the web-site the hotel is described as a 3 stars hotel. However, i would rate 1 stars hotel. Specifically the carpet was dirty. The room and the toilet was very small. The furniture was more than old and cheap. I would describe them few pieces of wood joined together to make a cupboard. There were no extra blankets to cover up and the heat went off during the night. Definately no airconditioning as they describe it- or a switch to control the heater's temperature. No cutleries available when they were asked to take up in the room. Fot health and safety issues, the boiler and tv available in the room have not had the electric inspection up to date. Finally you could hear the tenants from next door. Very unpleasant stay there	
Dec 9 2007	Most Enjoyable Stay	We stayed at the hotel for two nights on the 6th and 7th of December 2007 and to be honest I was extremely worried about the hotel after reading the reviews. I was however, pleasantly surprised. We arrived at 9am and although the check in time was not until 2pm we were able to leave our bags in the luggage room for the day and head to central London. On checking in we found the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were small, but they were clean, and very warm. The corridors of the hotel were very warm albeit in need of some decorating. The reception was bright and airy and the hotel is very close to the tube (Gloucester Road) which is on the Picadilly line. Again when leaving the hotel staff were extremely helpful. We were able to leave our bags in the luggage room and again shop without having to carry our bags with us. The receptionist then organised a taxi for us to take us to Heathrow and again I have to admit that this was the cheapest taxi ride to Heathrow that I have had a long while. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good budget hotel while visting London.	
Dec 7 2007 	Great hotel - considering the bad reviews!	I will be honest, I was very worried after I had booked this hotel due to the awful reviews I had read about it. But I was very surprised when I got there. Taking into account, it was probably the cheapest hotel I could find in central London, it was great. A short walk away from Gloucester Road or Earl's Court tube (we used Gloucester Road, as it was on the Picaddily line) you can't knock the great location. As for the hotel, we were welcomed by a very friendly receptionist. The reception is modern, with an internet cafe. Great, as if you spend over £2 (easily done with a drink!) you can get 30 minutes use of the internet free! Our bedroom was on the 2nd floor. The corridors were nice &amp; warm (great, considering it was so cold out!) The room itself was admittedly small. But as we were only staying the one night, it was perfect to have somewhere central just to sleep. The room was clean, couldn't find any faults. We didn't stop for breakfast, but there is a supermarket at the end of the road (24 hour) spent the 2nd day shopping. They had a luggage store, so we didn't have to hold onto our bags whilst shopping. Overal, I would highly recommend this hotel. Don't listen to these horrible reviews . . . IT IS GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY!!	
Nov 30 2007 	Dreadful	Stayed in this hotel for two nights recently with my wife.We were visiting family and needed a central location in Kensington close to Tube etc.In the week in question I had great difficulty finding any hotel but settled for the Ambassadors with some reservations based on reviews.The first room allocated to us had a broken window handle which meant the window could not be shut.On changing to a room on a lower floor we found that not only did the window not close but the window blinds were broken and did not shut in addition to which the tiny handbasin was severely cracked and had black stains around the cracks.A very friendly Duty Manager finally allocated a room which did at least have the basics although seriously run down and dilapidated.This is a dirty run down dump masquerading as a hotel and I pity the staff who have to work there.I observed several complaints from other residents and I am surprised that the authorities who have responsibility for monitoring standards in the industry have not done something to remedy the problem.Billed as a three star hotel this place would not pass muster as a grade E guest house and was the worst experience of my life.If I had a choice again I would prefer to sleep on a park bench.I strongly urge all who read this review to avoid this hotel like the plague.It is truly awful.	
Nov 8 2007 	Good Location...Bad Hotel	This hotel, for me, was ideally located near the Earl's Court tube station, some cheap and decent dining and pubs, internet cafes, etc. But the hotel was just awful. The room was smaller than ANY room I stayed in throughout Europe. It was &quot;spartan&quot; to put it mildly. The bed was uncomfortable and the hallway outside was very noisy. I would only stay here again as a last resort.	
Oct 2 2007 	Filthy and Awful!	I booked this reservation through hotwire.com, which, in my previous and extensive experience of being a customer, has always been accurate with thier star ratings. This hotel, however, was a different story. Hotwire advertised it as a 2.5 star, a notch below the self-procrlaimed 3 star rating on the hotel's website, but still well above the half star rating it actually deserves.I arrived at the hotel at around 9 pm, with three bags ranging in weight from 40 to 60 lbs. (I was staying at the hotel while searching the area for apartments as I was relocating to London for work). No one even looked at me as the cab driver and I struggled to get them through the door. I left the bags at the entry to go to the desk and check in.I was ignored by the staff of three for about 5 minutes, as they collectively struggled to check in a single guest who had arrived right before me. When it was my turn, no one welcomed me or even said hello. The woman behind the counter just demanded my credit card. When she found my reservation, she pulled a piece of paper from a drawer, pointed to an amount at the bottom and said, &quot;You pay this.&quot; I explained to her that my reservation would have been prepaid by hotwire. She checked with her collegue who explained to her that I was correct. She made no apologies and finished checking me in. When I asked for help with my bags, she looked at me like I was an idiot and said, &quot;We don't do that here.&quot; Imgaine that! A self-proclaimed 3 star hotel that expects a 100 lb woman to lug 3 bags totaling 150 lbs to her room without assistance! I asked the man who looked like he was the manager if there was any assistance he could offer me. He said no. A guest in the lobby actually helped me to my room.Allow me to note that it was October 2, 2007 and it was around 50 degrees outside when I checked in. My room window was open and the room was freezing! I closed the window and looked for a thermostat. There was none; just a radiator with the knob that adjusts the temperature taken off. The radiator was completely cold. I called and asked for a space heater, waited 2 hours for it, then called the front desk. At that point I was informed that they only have central heating and they don't have space heaters. They offered a blanket. Looking at the soiled and threadbare one on my bed, I declined. I wouldn't get under that thing if my life depended on it!The room is tiny, with a twin bed. The linens were flithy, with black scuff marks and hair on them. I eventually elected to sleep on top of the blanket, fully clothed. The furniture was made of press board/cork board and is full of holes, scratches and water/rot stains. There were black scuff marks all along the walls, particularly on the wall up against which the bed is placed and in the hallway area. The bathroom was tiny and didn't look like it had been cleaned. The towels were thin, stained and worn. The foot towel that you throw down on the floor when you take a shower was thrown in the bottom of the shower stall and had black hair on it. More hair in the sink and on the toilet. The shower stall area was thick with black mold.In general it was awful and the staff was rude and unwilling to help. Would never stay at this place again!	
Sep 18 2007 	Lot of Liars!	Stayed here out of desperation after discovering the first hotel I booked was in the middle of nowhere and cancelled before even arriving there. Found this at reasonable price in central location read reviews butas as i say I was desperate! Booked a double/twin was given room on 5th floor and it was late. Opened the door to what looked like a walk in wardrobe though apparently that was the room with a single bed. Dutifully went downstairs to inform them of mistake and was told that WAS a double room but it was just 'small'! Partner had to sleep on the floor after trying to sleep in bed unsuccessfully. Again went to complain and was once again told it WAS a double! asked to see single in that case, none available! 3 people told me it was a double although they only had one pillow and one cup for a twin double room? Not great.	
Sep 7 2007	GOOD DEAL!	Other reviews left us feeling nervous! Room was smallish but clean and well set out. For the price we paid (about £50 per night) I thought it was a really good deal. What do people expect?	
Jul 20 2007 	TERRIBLE	The rooms are very tiny with thin walls!. All the bathroom doors creak. We had hot water but others (we heard) didn't. After asking on day 1 to fix the TV aerial (which was broken) they didn't so for 3 days we had a tv but couldn't see it. Not that we wanted to watch it that much but the fact that they couldn't be bothered to repair it is a very bad sign.Don't ask at reception to call a taxi. They use their chauffeur (unlicensed) friends and we ended up paying £15 to Victoria (10 minutes drive) instead of the £8 we'd paid for a black cab when we arrived.No i would NOT recomment it at all.	
Jun 25 2007 	When a 'family room' is NOT a family room!	Firstly, the pictures of the rooms on hotel website are very deceiving, not anything like the spacious, bright and airy rooms you see . We were in a 'family' room, i had to climb over one bed to get to the wardrobe, there was no chair to sit down in the room, the bed clothes had cigarette burns in them , there was no smoke alarm in room, mould and rust all over the tiles and shower in the bathroom. The room we requested was non-smoking, but on first entering the room the stench of stale cigarettte smoke was dreadful.Overall once you left the reception area, the rest of the hotel was very shabby!	
Jun 25 2007 	Worse than a hostel - marketed and priced as 3 star ... Avoid like the plague	We stayed in this hotel on 23 June and booked it due to its central location and apparently good value '3-star' priceTo cut to the chase, this hotel is extremely poor in standards, service and in quality. From our initial check-in attempts to our eventual check-out the hotel never failed to disappoint.I would question the reviews on this site that give it a positive rating.The 'Star' system (3-star, 4-star, 5-star, etc.) is generally trustedand implies certain standards, and should be applied correctly to hotels advertised on a site to give an honest interpretation of the level of facility and service that can be expected from an establishment.This hotel claims to be 3-star. This is clearly a mark it has given itself, as it does not measure up to the level I would expect from a 1-star establishment or a hostel for that matter. I hope this review might help to prevent another traveller from being misled in such a manner and might eventually lead to a tightening of the descriptive language used for a hotel on the site to ensure that a traveller is fully aware of what value.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Upon arrival when advising that we have a reservation and would like to check in, we were immediately told that check in is not until two pm. The man at reception did not even wait to ask our names and then proceeded to (very rudely) insist that we go away until two o'clock. At which point he returned to stapling papers and ignored us. We were not the only guests subjected to this treatment. One guest arrived at 1.54pm and was told to go off and sit somewhere until 2 o'clock.  When we eventually checked in, we went up in the elevator (with carpet on all the walls) to a dark, musty corridor that smelled of water damage and the effects of age and neglect. Our room was small, and had a similar sense of age about it - many of the wooden laminatesurfaces had water damage and discoloration. The stale smell was not so pungent here, but was still in the background. We left our bags in the room and went out for the day to a prior appointment for which we were late because our check-in must not take place before 2pm. When we arrived back to the hotel later that evening, the bathroom floor was covered in water. The pipes in the sink leaked. It was too late to do anything about it and we went to bed. In the morning, the leak was worse and the bathroom floor was flooded. Drying the floor with our towels we went about showering - only to discover that the shower was covered in mould and dampness. Upon starting the shower we discovered why - the extractor fan was not working.  This meant that anything left in the bathroom was covered in steam and condensation - absolutely everything, from towels to the walls and floors (that were flooded) to the toilet paper.This hotel is far from the standard that anyone should expect, and I would vehemently recommend that people be discouraged from using it. I understand that certain hotels are aimed at a specific price point,but certain things should not be excused in the search for this pricepoint. It should be expected that staff at a hotel would be courteousand helpful.  This hotel was lacking in so many of the basics and the simple thingsthat it should not be recommended to others until some of the fundamental flaws are removed from it. I also think that it is very misleading to label it a three star hotel is extremely misleading.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Lesson learned for me ... check with TripAdvisor before booking a bargain.	
Jun 18 2007 	Please Stay Away	Please please stay away from this hotel. I booked this hotel at a very busy weekend for London and struggled to find some where to stay. Having spent a weekend there I now know why they had rooms left when every body else was full. I have stayed at plenty of budget hotels in London over the years and the fact that it is low budget is no excuse at all. The room itself was tiny, we cold not get past the bottom of the bed without catching our legs. I would say that made it difficult to clean, but having located the strange smell in our room as cigar butts and ash under the bed ( no smoking in the rooms???) I would say that it wasn't cleaned at all. The units were thick with dust and dirt. There was no bath in our room only a shower which only dribbled water, the shower head would go no higher than my shoulder hieght ( I'm 5ft 9in). There was plenty of hot water but in truth I was reluctant to stand in the shower at all. The bottom of the shower curtain had some seriously disgusting stain on it. There was no extractor in the bathroom which left it smelling very damp and unpleasant. The bathroom door banged into the toilet so it would not open fully.The window would not open properly, the curtain rail was hanging off the wall, the reception on the TV was bad. We had to constantly go to reception to sort out our key card. The pillow on the beds were so flat that I had to roll up bedding to put underneath it. The hotel as a whole was tatty and very well worn. The corrodors and rooms were belting hot which is not funny when you are stood for half an hour with sweat dripping off the end of your nose waiting for your key card sorting out. There was only one small lift which bounced disconcertingly and had grafitti scratched on it.Breakfast was standard fare, but the tables were stacked so close to each other you could not get up without sticking your backside in some poor unfortuates face.Even the staff were rude and off hand( especially I noticed with poeple who had a language barrier). One member of staff burst into our room without knocking and waiting for an answer in the morning whilst we were changing. The thing that summed up the staff for me was when we were finally called to breakfast from the seating area by a young man who shouted 'Hey you, you and you' at us and then pointed at the dinning area.I know this sounds like a long winded whining session but I truly feel badly done to by the staff and the hotel. Both me and my partner were left no wanting to go back to the hotel during our stay. Please please do not stay here unless you have no chice. There are much better places in London for less pennies.	
Jun 15 2007	Don't be fooled: take flip flops	Word of advice: DON'T end your vacation in this hotel, it could ruin the experience of London. Granted we are in a large city with limited space, but this hotel could create space by losing the plywood, stained, unstable furniture. But then what would hide the light bulb that flickers on and off when ever it wants. Maybe the electrical should be inspected. I will give create to the clean bathroom daily, however the carpet could use a cleaning and possibly the cobwebs in the ceiling, by the way don't expect air conditioning.Maybe I am just being harsh because they did NOT have a lounge to have a cocktail to unwind after a full day of touring.The staff seem to be unpleasent but it most likely is because of the enviroment of their work place.Anyhow England is amazing and I will not let this ruin the experience I had	
Jun 15 2007 	Radiators full blast in hot humid weather	When we got to our hotel we were given room 606, and when we got there there were still dust sheets on the floor and wet paint on the walls...after informing the reception staff we were moved to a family room which was far too cramped. I can understand that not all hotels have air conditioning but during the month of june in london when the air is hot and sticky why on earth would anyone want radiators on full blast??!!!!! it was VERY difficult to sleep. The lift was rather dodgy and i would advise that if there are allready two people in there DON'T GET IN IT - it wouldn't line up properly with the floor..and it was so slow you may as well walk ( not easy if you are pregnant). The room was clean but there was little privacy as the blinds didn't work properly and the cleaners insist on letting themselves into your room at 8 30 am ( now that is a little early). The rooms were clean, the shower was nice, no bugs, but i really wouldn't recomend pregnant women or asthma sufferers to stay there.	
Jun 10 2007 	Overpriced 1-star dump cheated as 3-star	I stayed at the Ambassadors Earls Court in London in May 2007. For the price of $130 a night you wouldn't expect hostel quality from a hotel. But that's exactly what this &quot;hotel&quot; is. I've seen student hostels for better value.I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their money on this place. They call themselves '3 star' which clearly is a self-invented title to charge more. Fact is they are more comparative to a 1 star.First, the hotels own photos are highly retouched in photoshop. The lobby itself seem clean and spacious on first appearance but the rooms are several notches below (the hotel seemt to be decorated with the cheapest, second-hand Ikea furniture in each room, including the lobby).On my arrival I was given the key to a room that simply left me baffled; carpets were dingy, very old and stained, and the bed was elevated with steps like an old bunkbed. It had an old, dingy mattress that was in such bad shape it was completely lumpy even when 'made'. $130 a night is not $30, and I simply could not accept this for the price. I then got what they described as a 'good room'. It was a 1000 time improvement to the first option, but still hostel-like. The mattress at least looked fine but was so uncomfortable I did not sleep properly a single night staying there. The bathroom was small, but the shower took the price: it had a total actual square area of 1.5 feet surrounded by a shower curtain that you were suppose to comfortably take your shower in... The shower had been elevated, meaning all water was flowing onto the floor whenever you tried to take a shower. The tiny space made the showercurtain stick to your body like scotchtape! The layout made no sense since the elevated step could have provided ample space for a good sized shower.To add to the list of ridicules from this English &quot;hotel&quot;, the soaps were so small they lasted about one day.After the first day, the elevator went out of service. Luckily, they at least had a smelly service elevator in the back that one could use. There was no baggage service and when on the last day both elevators were kept unavailable and I asked for assistance with my luggage, and was refused, I think I had enough. Again, I had not paid $30 a night here!I can live in simplicity if I want to save money and don't mind. But this was not cheap for the rate they charge and by cheating people to call it 3-star when it is clearly not. Of all cities in the world I have visited, and that includes third world countries, London has shown to be the most difficult place for accommodation whether I pay from $100-400 a night. That's why I nowadays select a lower range rate since too frequent it had made little difference. Often these hotels are owned by immigrants that have no standard of quality according to a western nation and simply don't care to adapt to the culture of their host country. They want only money and don't feel obligated to have a certain level of quality, even if basic. Second, often the descriptions of facilities are so off they don't even seem to be the same hotel. They don't seem to fall under any kind of regulations or control but can be advertised anyway the owner please. And third, you feel insulted as a client as you know you are being ripped off and treated demeaning from the moment you see what you paid for and what you get.And this don't necessarily change if you pay double than at this dump, called Ambassadors Earls Court.In London I talked with other travelers and was recommended another hotel which they said was of great standard for the price and located in central Knightsbridge; $60 a night.	
May 29 2007	Excellent stay in Ambassadors	We have just returned from our holidays.I have to say it was magnificent! The hotel has got excellent location, very clean room, nice,professional and helpful staff,who did not mind t o help us with every single request we had. And i have to admit we had a lot!In general very very pleasant stay and good value for money.	
May 27 2007 	Never again!	This hotel is awful. The rooms are miniscule, a twin room has two single beds pushed together, so you may as well be sleeping in a double bed.There is only about 14&quot; beween the bed and the wall too, making it very cramped. Storage space is very, very limited, no drawers, just open shelves - there would be no room to open a drawer anyway! The 'furniture' is poor quality, shabby and old, mattresses are very thin and uncomfortable, bed bugs abound and I have a bites all over. The carpets look dirty throughout the hotel, and there was no way I was walking on the bedroom carpet in bare feet.The bathroom stank of urine when we arrived, and the towels athough freshly laundered are grey, rather than white.The area is not quiet, it's very noisy, both traffic noise and the area seems to populated with drunks talking and shouting at night, The rooms were extremely hot and stuffy, and the blinds are indequate to block out the light in the summer mornings, all together making it difficult to get a decent nights sleep.The continental breakfast was OK, but we saw cockroaches in the dining room (thankfully on our last morning). There is chaos, however when it's busy, leading to a wait of 15 minutes to be seated. The staff do their best, keeping the buffet well stocked and clearing tables.The hotel was not cheap at £90 per night, and far below the standards I would expect.However the staff were pleasant and helpful, and the faulty light bulb in the bathroom was replaced very promptly.I wouldn't stay there again even if desparate, there are much better hotels in the area for the same price.	
May 16 2007 	Most awful ever!	The room was in the basement and was no bigger than a box room and the double bed was just big enough to fit in. But it was livable for the 2 dayz until the morning when we was woken up at 6.30 in the freezin cold by a load of clattering and bangin which was to do with breakfast. The bathroom was ok though with hot water and a decent shower. Furniture and general presentation was very,very poor. We insisted on moving to another room and when we moved was bigger but was a grade mankier but after 10mins after ringin reception, we got a tv brought into the room cos it was missin' and after fiddling got the kettle to work. Furniture and carpets look liked they and been outside for a week and the room was grubby. Still water was hot, no bugs to report and the shower worked. Staff were ok and so was breakfast. Overall, if you like to spend a bit of time in your room apart from sleeping then would avoid at all costs. After reading all the other reviews, me and the wife are gonna take a shower. Expect a better room in down town iraq.	
May 12 2007 	OK for the price	I dont quite understand the hassle about this hotel.The room was small but not tiny. We had enough space for our bags and to move around.The bathroom and the room itself were clean; the maid cleaned it every day. There were no stains on the sheets or towels whatsoever.The only thing that didnt work was the blinds, they were kind of stuck. But that was no big deal after all. The staff was friendly and helpful.A bonus was the good location of the hotel. 5 minutes walk to the tube and a huge 24 hours open Sainsburys nearby. The only thing that wasnt the best was the breakfast. They provided a good choice of fruits, juices, jams, honey, cereals, yogurt, cheese, rolls, croissants and Danish pastries but the latter werent very fresh. The yogurt was expired for days and was kept unchilled for the whole breakfast time (7  10am) like the milk for the cereals. All in all it was a reasonable 2 star hotel with a good location and friendly staff.	
Apr 12 2007 	Well Located Budget Hotel	If you are looking for a budget hotel in a really central location of London (such as Earl's Court), then this hotel has a chance. But otherwise find another alternative.The first night we were given a basement room - even though I booked the room 3 days before via internet. The front desk just kept saying that they had no other room available at the time. The basement was warm (on 2nd April) and when I inquired about any air conditioning, I was told that I should have booked one of the pricey suites (rude).We were ultimately moved to a 2nd floor room the next day, which was much better.The Tube station is just 5 minutes walk. and you are in Zone 1, so its pretty easy and quick to get anywhere within London.If one is on a touristy visit, the hotel should only be cozy enough for a nice sleep. The rest of the day should be spent exploring London, where exploration just never ceases to end.	
Apr 12 2007 	An awful night.	When I booked this hotel for one night at Easter I was pleased with the internet deal I had managed to get, but a little worried when I read the reviews. Still, my husband said &quot;we only have to sleep there the one night&quot;. Sleep would have been nice!After quite a long wait to book in we managed to find our basement room. It was quite small but adequate for one night. Although the rest of the hotel was overheated, our room was distinctly cool when we walked in as the radiator wasn't working. Also, being in the basement, it was quite gloomy and one of the lightbulbs wasn't working either.Although we had reported the heating and lighting faults to reception, nothing was done that evening and we came back to a chilly gloomy room. Fortunately the bathroom was well lit, allowing me to spot the cockroach trying to hide behind the loo. Sadly, for cockroach lovers, we killed it. That night was a cold night, there would have been enough covers for a superheated room, but not enough without heating. By 5am I was reaching for my clothes to wear in bed to keep warm (after carefully shaking them first). Finally when checking out I asked for a complaint form and was given a blank sheetof paper on which to write my complaint. The man at reception said he would pass it on, I'm still waiting for a reply.	
Feb 26 2007	OK but problems with key card	Basement room was quiet and adequate if a little small. Well heated for February but could imagine it being overpoweringly hot in summer.Included continental breakfast was reasonable, plenty of choice.Disappointed no bar (coffee bar serving snacks in foyer but no alcohol)- went to Holiday Inn round the corner (pleasant bar here, expensive but not desperately so!)Main problem - card key for room didn't work properly. Had to go to reception to let us in room on most occasions which became extremely irritating. Only finally fixed the morning we were leaving.Overall, preferred Comfort Inn on other side of Cromwell Road where we stayed previous year.Not the best hotel we have stayed in in London and wouldn't be rushing to return but wouldn't rule it out completely if there was a cheap deal available .	
Feb 8 2007 	Biggest dump Ive ever been unlucky enough to stay in	AVOID this hotel - its similar to Picadilly Backpackers Hostel which is one third the cost of this FAKE 3 STAR RATED hotel. The only decent hotels to stay in in London if you have a budget are - Comfort Inn Victoria or Comfort Inn Buckingham Palace. Dont dare to saty in any other 3 star hotel cause they are as bad as any hostel. The Ambassador is one of the worst. Dont be fooled by pictures on the internet - that is wat mislead us.	
Jan 13 2007 	Fine for the Price	My friend and I stayed in the Ambassador's Hotel during our vacation to London. Our room was VERY small but everything worked and was clean. The maid service was good and quick and breakfast was a decent variety of foods. The location was great, it's pretty close to two different Tube station's and lots of grocery stores, internet cafes, etc. I always felt safe walking back in the evening.	
Dec 11 2006 	Service was really disappointing.	We checked into a small triple room and the toilet couldn't flush at first. It worked after trying many times.What's worse was when we were sleeping, they woke us up at around 2am to tell us that we have to check out!? We just checked in that morning and had the reservation for 5 nights. The hotel staff then asked us why we had gone to that particular room since it was booked by somone else. How were we to know considering they were the ones who gave us the keys in the first place!!So anyway, they realised something went wrong with their administration and they let us stayed in our room. Next morning, we went to ask them about it and they tried to shrug it off. Terrible terrible service. Could do better staying at a youth hostel.	
Nov 24 2006 	Great Location Not So Great Hotel	My girlfriend and I stayed at the Ambassadors Hotel in late May of 2006. I already did my research and understood that we were not staying at a fancy hotel-basically I already knew what we were in for. This was fine since we were in London to be out all day and night to explore the city. The location is great- it's in a nice and safe area. We walked about very late at night and never felt threatend or in danger. The hotel is about two blocks from the Earls Court Station (less then10 min walk) and you can get everywhere with ease from this station. This was a huge bonus for us. When we first checked in we were suprised since it was not bad at all (for the price)- the people behind the desk were friendly and willing to help. When we got to our room the problems arised. The room was very small but was not a problem since this is what we expected- again, we weren't in London to stay in our room. The lights in our Bedroom did not work- the only lights we had was from the bathroom. I went to the front desk and they could not move us to another room since they were all booked up. It was late in the evening and they assured that it would be taken care of by the next day. We stayed at the hotel for a total of 4 nights and we finally got working lights in our room on the fourth night. Everynight I would complain but nothing would happen- this was very frustrating for us. Luckily, we would not come back to our rooms till very late in the evening so it did not affect us greatly but still- we had no working lights!!! The breakfast in the morning was OK- nothing to brag about. The only saving grace for this hotel was the location.	
Nov 16 2006 	Worst hotel ever	I stay in hotels in London most weeks as for business so it is with some experience that I say my stay at this hotel was the worst stay I have encountered in any hotel. For leisure travel I always consult trip advisor but regret at great cost that I did not do the same on this occassion having just read other reviews.The problems started when I reached my room which was is an unacceptable state of repair for a 3 star establishment. It was my first visit to your hotel having found it on the Late rooms website described as comfortable accommodation .recently undergone major refurbishment. It was evident that the room had not had any refurbishment for about 20 years  the carpets were filthy, bedcovers stained, furniture was in a bad state of repair covered in stains. The bathroom was also full of stains and silver fish were crawling over the floor. I immediately returned to the desk (the staff were very helpful) and I was shown another room which was slightly better but still very old and shabby and finally I decided on a basement room which at least had been modernised in the recent past despite being very hot and facing a brick wall.Even with the air conditioning unit on the room was unbearable and it was difficult to leave the window open being at ground level. I finally managed to get used to the noise of the air conditioning unit and fell asleep. I was woken up at about 220am with a strange vibrating noise which sounded like the fridge was malfunctioning. I got up and explored the appliances in the room and could not find where the fault was, tried phoning reception but no answer and finally decided to go outside into the corridor to investigate. You can imagine my shock when I went into the corridor and heard the fire alarm going in the next corridor. In panic I left the room to go outside with the rest of the residents while the fire brigade investigated.As you can imagine I was very concerned that had that been a real fire I could have lost my life as was unable to hear the alarm in my room. I phoned the reception to express my concern and finally the person on duty understood my concerns (he initially thought I was worried about the alarm) and I asked him to make a note that the alarm could not be heard in my room as I was concerned to sleep incase there was an emergency I would not hear. Eventually I managed to get about 2 hours sleep before having to get up for work.I left around 8am in the morning and went to the reception to ask to speak to the manager and was told that there was no one I could speak to until after 9am which was too late as I needed to be in work. I have written a complaint to the hotel and website but I would warn others to avoid this hotel at all costs.	
Sep 27 2006 	gross hotel!	Hard to imagine that a travel agent actually booked us into this place! It smells, it's dirty, it's threadbare, it's cramped beyond belief (couldn't open two suitcases at the same time!), it's noisy, it has crawly things in the beds, the bathroom is moldy, and some of the lights in the room didn't work. Frankly it looks like a place where drunks go to dry out. Stay absolutely away from this hotel!!!	
Aug 17 2006 	Moldy and gross	We stayed here for 1 night and I refused to stay for any more. We got stranded in London after the terrorist scare so we picked this hotel last minute. We stayed were assigned a basement level room. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows looked dirty. The bathroom walls were covered with mold. Everytime anyone flushed a toilet or closed a door we heard it all through the night. I took a shower in the morning and water covered the entire floor since the shower curtain didn't go all the way around the bathtub - I can see why there is a mold problem. The hotel staff was fairly nice about letting us out of our reservations for the additional nights we were going to stay. The phone and internet service were a decent price compared to other London hotels. I wouldn't stay here again.	
Aug 10 2006	The Ambassador Hotel - Insect Infested	LONDON, ENGLAND: THE AMBASSADOR HOTELDon't believe the website!! The hotel is bug infested!!!August 10, 2006I have just returned from a much anticipated trip to London, as a graduation present to myself with my Sister and her family. Upon return to the U.S.A. I noticed a bump-like rash on my one arm. I called my doctor and made an appointment yesterday (8/9/2006). Upon inspection my doctor concluded the problem was due insect bites. I checked with My sister and her daughters (who were in different rooms) to find that have also been bitten, and unfortunately, both their arms, necks, etc. I believe I am blessed because for most of the trip I slept in a sleeping sack I purchased from Travelsmith---.I am now taking Zyrtec to help curb the itching, applying calamine lotion and taking prednisone for the inflammation!!! And I don't feel too good about having had to pay for the doctor visit and the subsequent medications. I will be contacting the travel agency to let them know - not to book the Ambassador and will be contacting the Ambassador about my problem.	
Jul 14 2006	Stay away! This place will destroy your trip	My wife and I expected a basic room, considering we were paying $122 a night in Knightsbridge for what we were told was a 2.5 star hotel. What we got was a room where we could barely fit in two bags. The single window opened about 3 inches -- and it was a hot night. The two twin beds were nailed down, so we couldn't move them to squeeze out an extra few inches. This appears to be a former SRO. It is dilapidated. The shower doesn't have stalll, just a curtain, so it's bound to flood. The staff was helpful. But this palce really needs a complete makeover. Until then, I wouldn't stay here again if it was free.	
Jul 13 2006 	Do Not Stay Here	This hotel is DIRTY, my room honestly looked like it had never been cleaned. The bedding had stains all over it. I slept fully clothed on top of the bed. The rooms are not big enough to swing a mouse in, let alone a cat. There are no proper beds, they are simlpy MDF shelves with mattresses on.They charged me for services i didn't use and refused to refund the costs. Do not let them swipe your credit card.The lift was permanently out of order. There is a premier travel inn about 5 mins walk from the hotel. We moved there and it was cheaper, nicer and above all was CLEAN. Stay there.	
Jun 30 2006	Perfectly acceptable	We just got home after spending 5 nights at the Ambassadors. It was a bit of a shock at first. This was our first time abroad and, compared to US hotels for this price range Ambassadors was a disappointment. However, the location was wonderful, the rooms were clean if small, the mattress was adequate and the room cooled quickly with the window open. Linens and towels were worn but clean, and the bathroom was adequate (although the ceiling was quite low in the shower!). Plenty of hot water. They also forgot our wakeup call, but the alarm clock worked so it wasn't a problem. Didn't notice any particularly bad smells. We were on the top floor, so had a great view of the church down the street. Our breakfast wasn't complimentary and 5 pounds per person was too much for us, but Sainsbury's (grocery) was just down the street. They have the best yogurt! There are many restaurants nearby that are not too expensive. The Tube and bus routes are close by. The staff was helpful, if not particularly friendly compared to US average, but I've run into poor staff at US hotels too.The Ambassadors needs some upgrading but all in all it's not a bad little hotel.	
Jun 21 2006	BAD HOTEL	- No A/C or fan - the room was very stuffy- Very bad smell in hotel and room- Room card did not work- A lot of people unhappy with their room- TV did not work- We requested a wake-up call in the morning and never got one!- Hotel is very noisey - you can hear everything that is going on in the hallway and neighboring rooms- Staff not very friedly- Rooms not too clean: stains on carpet, stains on pillows and bedWould only recommend this hotel for students backpacking or those that are traveling on a budget. Yet, I think for the same price you can get a better deal if you look hard enough. If your just looking for a place to sleep and shower then maybe its not that bad, but don't expect anything too luxurious. And don't count on a timely wake-up call. The benefits:- Complimentary breakfest- Pretty decent location - although not the best	
Jun 4 2006	Nice hotel in great area	We arrived in London several hours before check-in. The hotel staff allowed us to leave our luggage behind the desk as we toured London. The room, a standard double (twin) was teeny tiny, but quite clean. The en suite bathroom was large with a tub/shower, and also clean. The maid cleaned the room daily. The staff was friendly and helpful. It is a good hotel for the price and location. The only complaint I can think of is that the room doors are right next to each other, so if you have an inconsiderate neighbor that comes and goes late in the night, you will likely hear it. So bring some ear plugs and enjoy your stay.	
May 19 2006	Dishing the dirt	This was the dirtiest hotel we have ever stayed in and there was an unpleasant smell in our corridor. I cannot imagine what the kitchens were like although the breakfast was acceptable. I woder what the many foreign visitors thought of our hotels. As a British national I was ashamed.	
Apr 27 2006	This hotel is correct we can't complain!	We don't understand why so much criticism: the rooms were clean (and small, but not as much other users said) the breakfast was quite good and there is no reason to complain about it. Lastly the staff was very kind and polite. Maybe it was chance, but we found no bug, no out-of-date food, no cold water instead of hot water,no broken window or bed, and we had no problem with heat... Don't forget it is a ** class hotel, so it is absurd to ask for perfection!	
Apr 27 2006	Great location even if the room was a little small	My wife and I stayed here on our 2nd trip to London. We love the location which is why we pick the Ambassador.Contrary to many of the reviews, we had quite a positive experience. OK, the rooms are a little small but you have to remember this is South Kensington and you are paying only £70 or so for a double room.Our room was clean as was the bathroom. We had a room in the basement so it lacked a little natural light but we could still see the street above through the window.We have little to complain about. It is in a great location, close to the tube and very easy to get around. Felt safe walking back to the hotel from the tube station even after dark.	
Mar 7 2006	Stay Away!!	Stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of March. The hotel bedroom was tiny and the carpet looked like it hadn't been hovered all week, sheets were clean on the bed but the one blanket and throw were filthy, came up in a terrible rash when i got home all on my legs. The breakfast was the one good point about this hotel. How it got a 3 star rating i will never know. Stay away at all costs	
Mar 1 2006	THIS IS LONDON!	Great budget hotel! For this price, we cannot find any reason to complain. Dont forget this is London, and a decent BUDGET hotel is not easy to find.Our first impression from outside was that it looked good. The reception and welcoming bar just inside the entrance was also very nice. The staff were friendly and polite at all times. We had room 102 on the first floor, which is a standard 3 bedded room. Must admit that there was not much space, but it served its purpose perfectly. We were in London to do some sight-seeing, so it was really nice to have a lovely big hot BATH (and not just a shower) in our en-suite room. Water was really hot at all times, and the water pressure was also good. Room was clean, and was also KEPT clean by daily room service.We were almost put off going here by reading other reveiws before we went, but now realise that any bad reviews must have been written by people from other countries,(e.g. from USA,) who are used to a higher standard hotel for their money and had probably not visited London before... This hotel is perhaps slightly &quot;older&quot;, but that does not mean that just because it may have a couple of slightly cracked bathroonm tiles that it is not clean. AS A BUDGET HOTEL, WE WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE! If you want perfection, then book into the RITZ!	
Feb 26 2006	Worst ever.	My wife and I booked to see a show at the Albert Hall - the show was great - but the hotel very poor.The receptionist didn't know what was going on when the fire alarm went off at 6am in the morning - he thought it was the breakfast alarm, whatever that is we still don't know.We were told nothing at all after the fire brigade arrived. Went back to our room - a couple of hours later decided to have a shower - water was tepid - receptioist told us we would have to wait for the maintenance man ! Perhaps he should fix the tiles hanging off the walls before attending to the water.To finish the job off - the receptionist couldn't get my service card to accept payment - the card has never been a problem before or after.Telephoned to complain once we were home - managment said they would reply to my complaint - 5 weeks on - nothing.The only good thing was the breakfast - fair play it was good - but the rest is not to be recommended - the bedroom was tacky too - holes in the blanket. I apologised to my wife for taking her to this place -the worst in 35 years of marriage and travelling in many countries. You have been warned!	
Feb 21 2006	Not As Bad as some reviews made out	The hotel is conveniently situated about 350 metres from the Earls Court Road Tube Station. The reception area is bright and looks like it was recently refurbished. There are a couple of internet terminals (pay) there.The breakfast area is small and is not able to cope with the rush at peak breakfast times when the hotel is busy. The complimentary breakfast is reasonable and you can upgrade to a cooked breakfast for £2.50.The room (306 - Double) is small but that is not unusual for this standard of accomodation. It would not suit a long term stay as the luggage storage is poor. The furnishings in the room are old and show a great deal of wear but the room was clean on arrival and the house keeping was faultless.The bathroom was fine although the shower head kept slipping. There was hot water on demand during our stay.I found the staff polite and friendly.There was obvious ongoing work (painting, replacement of carpets etc) in the area of our room during our stay so standard of the decor might improve.Overall a fine hotel for a short stay.	
Feb 8 2006	Could have been worse...	The main reception areas are nicely decorated, and the staff were pleasant enough.My single room was tiny, even by London standards, but clean. I had a few small niggles though. For example, there were no blinds on the window and I could see across the road into the flats across the road; the room was roasting and I had to either be too hot, or listen to the traffic all night (I used to live in central London so I chose the noise!); and the bathroom flooded no matter how carefully I arranged the shower curtain, plus the water temperature wildly fluctuated whilst having a shower. But for £35 a night I wasn't expecting the earth, and there were no major problems. What I got was a clean, basic room in a good location with decent facilities nearby such as the 24-hour Tesco.	
Jan 30 2006	Do Not Stay Here	No Heat and no hot water, asked for a double bed got a single bed pushed together. The breakfast was not good either, if you need to stay in a cheap hotel, this is the place to go. I would pay the extra money to stay away from here.	
Nov 26 2005 	Worst Ever	Public areas looked good - breakfast was passable - room was grubby and cold - for 3 nights the radiator did not heat at all despite complaints to reception - this was during a period when the forecast was minus 6 degrees centigrade - would not recommend to my worst enemy.	
Sep 18 2005	Ambassador Hotel - average	We booked a room at the Ambassador Hotel and then happened to read the Trip Advisor reviews. After reading the comments made by some of the reviewers, we were a little concerned. However, our stay at the hotel was quite pleasant. The staff at the front desk were quite helpful. The rooms are very small, especially when compared to hotel rooms in the US. My husband and I being overseas travellers, travelling for two weeks in Europe, we had two fairly large suitcases. We had to leave the suitcases lying on the floor - there was no closet big enough to hold the two of them. And with the suitcases on the floor, there was barely enough room for us to walk. The bathroom was also quite small; however the shower was good. Hot water and a good showerhead. The blinds also did not function well - we had to take them down just to open the window. On our very first day, the blinds had not been attached properly and landed on our heads as we tried to detach them.The breakfast was quite good, though the price was a bit on the higher side. It was a continental breakfast buffet and the wait staff did an excellent job of treating customers politely and keeping the trays well-stocked.The hotel is a 5 - 7 minute walk from the Earls Court tube station - very convenient. Gloucester station may have been closer - but we did not explore. There is also an internet place near the tube which was very convenient for us.Overall, a pleasant experience. I would however stay at a different hotel the next time only because of the size of the room.	
Jul 17 2005	sauna room	was moved here from another hotel due to a problem looked very nice in lobby staff friendly got to our room bathroom clean beds seemed clean but the room was very very warm couldnt sleep in the bed sweat poured from us window was opened slighty but nailed shut at bottom. would not stay again there so beware if you get room 520 .cant fault breakfast excellent	
Jul 17 2005	If only I knew before - DO NOT STAY HERE	Fortunately, I had found this website before our stay at Ambassadors for June 26 thru July 1, 2005. Unfortunately, it was after I booked/prepaid (penalty to cancel). So my 17 year old and I took all the comments in stride and decided to go ahead and give it a try. How bad could it be, I thought. Well, I wasn't disappointed as the room met the low expectation I had set based upon the comments from this website. However, I thought the bed bug comments from some guests were blown out of proportion. Little did I know ... The last day I was there, I found 4 bugs on my pillow when I awoke. These were the same bugs I had previously discovered on the wall behind the bedpost. Not realizing what they were, I &quot;removed&quot; them and went on with life (so what's a little bug I thought). I am now undergoing steriod treatment in an attempt to rid my reaction to the bed bug bites on my arms, legs, hands, feet and back (10 days later, the reaction to these bites still persists... every morning I have new bumps to brag about). We just finished bagging of all of our belongings to kill anything that may have hitched a ride from their London breeding grounds - the Ambassadors Hotel. If only I had listened to my gut instinct after reading the reviews. Please don't make the same mistake I did - stay elsewhere and check this site before you book anything.	
Jun 9 2005	Best Dog Kennel We've Ever Stayed In !	The website we saw (still on-line to early June 2005 but now changed) said the hotel had been recently refurbished - well the foyer had been! Also the picture of the front of the hotel on that website was not of the building at Collingham Road.On arrival we found they had lost our booking (which had been made about four or five months previously).Our room was not a double as ordered but a twin room, and that given pretty grudgingly, staff a bit grumpy.Dirty carpet, beds not properly made up in the morning - just the top sheet pulled up, and the bottom sheet left wrinkled and the pillow was left on the floor. Blankets were thin and obviously very old. Bedspread didn't appear to be very clean. Cheap cardboard type furniture.Inadequate lighting for applying make-up or for seeing anything. Bathroom fittings were very dirty. However, the shower was good and hot.No room to swing a mouse let alone a cat! No storage space - might be fine for locals with an overnight bag but overseas travellers who may be away from home for weeks need space to store luggage.Of the items advertised on the website we did have private facilities and there was a hair dryer. There were none of the other advertised features, e.g., refrigerator, mini-bar, safety deposit boxes, laundry facilities, iron, etc. and no book in the room advising of any facilities or nearby attractions.The breakfast wasn't bad but the cutlery didn't appear to be very clean.Definitely would not recommend to anyone. Budget accommodation should be budget in price - not budget in quality.	
Apr 20 2005	We cancelled our reservation after seeing the room	My wife and I booked for a 9-12 Apr 2005 stay at this hotel thru hotels. We arrived in the early morning of 9 Apr 2005, hoping that we will be accommodated, despite the very early check-in. Of course, we expected that we will be charged extra for the early check-in, but never thought that we will be asked to pay an arm and a leg for it!My wife's first impression was not quite great due to a fact that what greeted us at the front door we girls smoking and blocking the door, whom my wife thought are hookers!During the negotation with the front-desk personnel, who was a tad haugthy, he told us that we have no choice but to take his price because, he thought, we have no where else to stay, especially at that time. He also told us that the room he will give us that early morning may or may not be the same room that we will get for the entire stay. Regardless, he told us, we will have to check-out later that day and will have to check back in to &quot;officially&quot; start our stay based on our booked dates. What a hussle! Nonetheless, my wife and I decided to see the room first since it was getting very late. He gave us a room key and was very surprised to learn that it was one of their few basement rooms. We have never been to a hotel with basement rooms before! After briefly seeing the state of that room, my wife vehemently told me that we leave at once. So, we decided to wake-up my wife's friend who lives in London to stay there for the night. Afterwards, we arranged a stay in another friend's house for the rest of our brief stay in London.We called hotels the next morning to cancel our reservation and file our reasons for cancelling. Yet, hotels deemed it necessary, as policy, to still charge us with a 1 night stay. Since we abosulutely did not want to be there, we had to sacrifice and lose money to hotels for a hotel that is so terrible, we walked out of there as soon as we got a taste of the impolite staff and the crappy basement hotel room that they have!	
Feb 4 2005	Lovely	I stayed in the Ambassador Hotel from 01/02/05 - 03/02/05. I found the staff very friendly, the breakfast was tasty and my room was cosy. I did not find any nasty surprises and my room was kept very clean. Very good location and very close to Earls Court station. It is easy to get to places in London. Highly recommended.	
Nov 28 2004	Having read the previous reviews I feel obligated to report	I booked the Ambassadors Hotel for 4 nights on laterooms for Nov. 13-16, 2004. After doing so, and right before departure, I stumbled across this website and arrived at the hotel with fear and trepidation. However, my fears were certainly unwarranted! I can only speak for room #608, but, though small, it was clean; everything worked; no bed bugs! No urine on toilet seats! The window opened and provided fresh air. It was more than adequately warm. The cold breakfast was included free with the room, and was so good we didn't want or need to eat anything till dinner. A hot breakfast was available, but we didn't feel the need to order it for only about $5 extra. My roomate said the coffee was the best she had ever had--anywhere! The personnel were nice and extremely accomodating. It was two blocks walk from Earls Court tube station; a bit more from Gloucester. Extremely convenient location. I will definitely stay there again! All budget rooms in London are small. If you can manage small quarters, you could not go wrong if you could get the rate we got: 4 nights for 209 GBP. The price was that low because the 4th night was free. What's to complain about? Though obviously some people have had bad experiences, I think the hotel more than deserves my feed-back. I could not have been more satisfied!	
Oct 29 2004	Rotten Hotel	Rotten Hotel. Would rate as a one star.On arrivalDried urine all over toilet seatOnly cold tap working in sinkPubic hair in my bed (gross)No undersheetsStained mattressChipboard furniture, very scabbyNo curtains, just venetian blindsHorrible condensation problemOne office chair in triple room3 beds squashed togetherand yes.........I was bitten by something too!!!Breakfast was fine, staff pleasant, couldn't wait to get out of there.	
Oct 25 2004	it's not so bad!	I read the reviews here after I'd booked the hotel on another site so I was a little worried about what I'd find at the hotel. I'm pleased to say that I was surprised by the quality of the hotel. It's not the most luxurious hotel in the world but it's clean and comfortable and in an excellent location (close to tube station, bars and restaurants but in a leafy street with no traffic noise).The breakfast was adequate - mostly cereals and toast but as it was included in our room rate I did not mind. If I had paid the £5 extra however I'd have expected better. The rooms were a little worn and scruffy and our blinds did not work. If you want somewhere cheap to crash after a hard day enjoying all London has to offer then I would have no hesitation in recommending the Ambassadors. I'd definitely stay there again. If you are looking for luxury then you might need to pay a bit more and go elsewhere!	
Oct 22 2004	Not good!	When walking into the room for the first time there was an awful smell of damp and this was noticable on the walls. Had to keep window open to try and get rid of the smell. Paint flaking off the walls, especially in the bathroom and the room badly needed redecorating. Apart from the awful room the staff were friendly and the breakfast was fine.	
Sep 14 2004	Stay out of the basement rooms!	My husband and I were given a basement room and we kept the window open during the night because the weather was warm and the rooms are not air conditioned. On the second night, someone climbed in through the window and stole 250 British pounds and a credit card while we slept. The police responded to our call promptly and professionally, but the response from the hotel was appalling. Apart from allowing us to move to a room on an upper floor, the hotel staff and manager seemed unconcerned with the theft and our welfare. Perhaps this is a common occurrence at the Ambassadors hotel? Our new room did not have a phone, so we had to place calls at a pay phone in the lobby and go to the reception desk to report any problems. We feel fortunate that we were unharmed and that the thief did not get our passports or wallets, but we will definitely not stay in this hotel again.	
Jul 6 2004	Did these people stay at the same place I did?!	Feel badly for the other critics here, but I thought the hotel was totally fine for the price! My room (a double) was clean, albeit very small. No curtains either to really block the light (just blinds), but certainly no insects to speak of. Safe didn't work in the room either and yes, the hotel room card took a few times to work. Thought the staff were pretty friendly too? Decent breakfast. I've travelled extensively too so I know what I'm talking about. It was ok!	
Jun 26 2004	More Bed Bugs	Like another of your contributors we also experienced the bed bugs in Ambassadors Hotel. Waking up on the first morning we noticed that we had been bitten and then found bed bugs crawling on the bed. Left two samples with the Receptionist and got moved to another room. Noticed one live bed bug clinging to clothing later when we were out and about. After returning home the following week I found another live one in my suitcase. Research revealed that these were &quot;Cimex Lectularius.&quot; Not a pleasant experience!	
Jun 16 2004	One of worsed hotels Iv ever stayed at	we booked though a traifinders in Australia on octomber 03 for a booking in 04, we requested a double room and got a twin, then on entering the room this is what we found.......Mould on the bathroom roofBare light globe in bathroom Two empty light fittings in bedroomNo sink plugNo bath plugHair on shower fittingCracked unstable shower headBathroom floor not cleanVery heavy, constant dripping coming from the bath tap (we had to put a towel under the tap to allow us to sleep)Bedroom floor not vacumed (very dirty)The single beds were very very uncomfortable and very smallWe had two plastic glasses in the bathroom on arrival, when one split (after two days) I asked for a replacement and was told I could not have one, but I could take a coffee cup from the breakfast room if I liked,I have emailed the hotel and the owners with my complaints and have not to date recieved reply.
