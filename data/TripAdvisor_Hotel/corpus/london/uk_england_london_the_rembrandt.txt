	Scammed by the Front Desk	When we asked at the front desk for a restaurant recommendation we were sent to a place that overcharged us and was completely shady. When we told the manager what had happened he was not apologetic or sympathetic. There was some kind of kick back or connection going on.	
	excellent location	Stayed for one night only. Location is perfect, just 300 meters from Harrods and all the nice restaurants and shops nearby. It is also close to the underground so it is easy to get around.Breakfast is superb, only complain is the elevator. We had to wait for a very long time, so we used the stairs. The bed is nice because of the matress and duvet. Woud definately go back.	
Nov 10 2009 	Good location and good breakfast	Good location, close to South Kensingston tube station and directly opposite the V&amp;A museum. Breakfast very good. Had evening meal on our first night, which was a carvery, no other choice offered on any evening. Stayed for 6 nights, after 2 sleepless nights due to noise from the airconditioning we asked to be moved from Room 645. Still heard noise in Room 668 but was acceptable. Would stay in this hotel again but not on the 6 Floor.	
Nov 1 2009 	wonderful room and great location	This was our first stay here and we found the room to be excellent, bath spacious and clean. The full English breakfast was wonderful. I would certainly stay again and recommend it to all others!	
Nov 1 2009 	Fantastic in places	Room was beautiful and there was a even a surprise in the room. Check in was swift so was check out.Breakfast head of tables is arrogant and the waiting staff rushed off their feet, when I asked for a pot of coffee i got a cup full slopped in front of me, when I asked for an actual pot of coffee and some cutlery I was given a how dare you look which made me &amp; my friend uncomfortable. Would recomend the hotel to friends but they need to sort their staff out as their customer service is shocking...	
Oct 31 2009 	Could do better	I have stayed several times at the Rembrandt over the years and its a bit hit and miss with the rooms. This time it was a bit of both, the room was OK with the exception of the bed it was just too small and neither my wife or myself are large people. She slept fine but I felt like I was on the edge of a cliff and kept waking up. They also do not seem to be able to fix the heating its either on full or not at all, this time we had to have the air conditioning on in October. Service was good but would help if the staff could try to smile. Food was OK. I do like the bar/lounge area it does have a comfy feel to it. My tip is if you are staying ask for a room with a large queen the double beds or at least in my room were too small. The location is ideal with South Kensington tube station only a five minute walk away and the V&amp;A museum across the road.	
Oct 15 2009 	Good Value Excellent Location	I was searching for a hotel that was well placed for business and lesiure as I was travelleing with my partner. I find it impossible to find a hotel on TripAdvisor that has great reviews all the way and is still inexpensive. But, the Rembrandt is different. True, the rooms are not enormous, but that is the case with London hotels. I had room 474 at the back and it was very quiet - if noise bothers you, make sure you ask for the rear/central facing rooms. The bathroom was new and in excellent condition - Grohe taps/shower and Roco fittings all make for a luxury feel. The location is perfect - RIGHT opposite the V&amp;A, close to shops like Harrods/Harvey Nicks etc and 5 mins from the tube and Natural History/Science Museums and access to the park sof London less than 15 mins walk. The room was £130 including breakfast. We ate breakfast which was a buffet and had a wide range of options. I also had lunch which was well attended too. Internet access is now included for most bookings - so the hotel is listening to the comments of the past.Really, no complaints and I'd return again.	
Oct 12 2009 	An excellent hotel great location very good price for London	I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend for three nights as part of a sight seeing trip to London. We booked an Executive Room on Expedia for £135 per night including breakfast. Upon arrival we were checked in quickly and then went to our room which was very nice indeed. I had stayed at this hotel a few years earlier and can honestly say that the refurbishment has transformed the rooms to being very modern and very cosy. Some of the Executive rooms have jacuzzi bath so if you want one, drop them an email and they'll do all they can to reserve one for you (they did with me!)Breakfast was a solid affair with everything under the sun you could possibly want! We never went hungry and food was of a high quality. Overall, highly recommended and a one that I shall definately return to.	
Oct 10 2009 	Good Hotel in a Great Location	This hotel has a great location in South Kensington. It is a 5 min walk to the Tube and to Harrods.The updated bathroom was the highlight of the room. Good breakfast buffet, but coffee was a little slow in coming in the morning.A 1 am fire alarm provided a bit of an unwelcome distraction one evening, but they had us back in our rooms within 30 min.	
Oct 6 2009 	good value	stayed here for some downtime although i live in london great hotel good location staff great and the food i had was excellent will stay again	
Oct 5 2009 	Great Location	Stayed here 4 nights. Very quiet, room updated, clean, comfortable. The rooms were large and spacious---a big bonus in Europe. Breakfast was excellent---good variety and the food was fresh. Staff was helpful and attentive. The location was perfect for touring London---a few minutes walking distance from the Tube station. Directly across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum. We enjoyed our stay and would chose to stay here again.	
Oct 1 2009 	Great location and good hotel	Good destination in knightsbridge. Hotel well presented - stayed here many years ago and the whole place has been upgraded substantially.	
Sep 29 2009 	What a pleasant surprise-it was just as advertised and more	What a pleasant surprise-it was just as advertised, and moreWe spent 7 nights at the Rembrandt was loved it. Our upgraded room was comfortable, stylish and spotless. We were in the front on the 5th floor and there was almost no street noise and NO hotel noises-was amazingly quiet. The bed was fantastic, linens quality and the bathroom (with Jacuzzi) was a wonderful place to return to after a long day of urban hiking. The breakfast was of excellent quality and plentiful. This was important since the exchange rate in the UK was not in our favor and we ate so well for breakfast that lunch was a smaller affair. Everything at this hotel was with a full hand from the apples in the lobby, to the breakfast waiter to watched to make sure I poured from the correct (decaf) carafe to the concierge who printed our boarding passes. We felt taken care of-it was truly a vacation.What a surprise, something that not only looks like it does on the internet, but is even better. This is only the second time that's happened to us.	
Sep 24 2009 	Great hotel	We found The Rembrandt an excellent hotel. The buffet breakfast (included in the price of the room even though we had the lower priced room) was outstanding. The staff was very cordial and efficient. The concierge was helpful with directions and with scheduling tours. The room was clean, comfortable, bright and ideal. The location was convenient to The Tube (about a 10 minute walk), bus stops across the street, and other sites we planned to visit. We would recommend this hotel for a business stay or vacation.	
Sep 23 2009 	Excellent Hotel with Great Location	This is an outstanding hotel within easy walking distance to Harrods Department store and Bunch of Grapes Pub, one of the best Pubs in London. The staff is friendly and helpful. The place rates four stars. The breakfast buffet was excellent with multiple choices from lite to full (sausage was wonderful:) ) The bar area and lite eating area was spacious although the service was spotty. The cold draft beer was excellent (try the blonde 1664). The room we had was small and the definition of queen defines the American double bed with little room to roll around without bumping into your partner. I would ask to see the available rooms,but this hotel was fully booked when we were there and this may not be possible. This was originally Harrods luxury hotel. I recommend this for a delightful stay in London	
Sep 15 2009 	Convenient and comfortable	Across the Road from the Victoria and Albert Museum, and close to the other South Kensington Museums and Knightsbridge shopping, this hotel is 5 minutes walk west to South Kensington underground station and then 20-30 minutes to the centre of London and the City. Rooms are comfortable and air conditioned, but the bathrooms are tiny. Rooms at the back are quiet. A good breakfast buffet is offered. For dinner, it is close to a range of restaurants around South Kensington, or - going east - Knightsbridge. Somewhat pricey, like most London hotels.	
Sep 12 2009 	London Visit	The rooms are really not very clean looking although the bathrooms are not bad. But it is really small. It is a hotel only good for a night if you are just passing by London or last minute reservations.The carpet is really dirty makes you feel not comfortable in the room. They have a pool but they have a charge for the hotel guest. This really suprised me because there is no mention of it in the internet.	
Sep 8 2009 	A very good choice	We stayed at the Rembrandt one night between coming off a cruise ship and flying home to Atlanta the next day, The location is excellent, across the street from the V&amp;A, and a short walk to the Natural History Museum, the Albert Hall, and South Kensington Tube. Good restaurants within 5 minutes walk are too many to count. Check-in was easy, and the concierge arranged for our transportation to Heathrow the next day before we went up to our room.We had splurged and booked a Grand room, with a nice advance booking discount: The room was immense by London standards, with a king-sized bed, a seating area with a a sofa, 2 armchairs and a coffee table, a full-sized desk, and large wardrobe. Immense bathroom, fully appointed, including very thick terry bathrobes. Bed extremely comfortable. Rooms at the front of the hotel may have traffic noise from Thurloe Pl/Cromwell Rd, but our room at the back of the hotel did not. There wasn't much of a view, but we prefer quiet to a nice view. Internet access worked fine in the room, and the hotel had satellite television in at least six languages.The Rembrandt's Palette restaurant serves an excellent buffet breakfast in the mornings, which is included in the room tariff, and operates as a carvery for lunch and supper. While we did not eat supper there on this trip, another couple we met during the cruise are quite familiar with the Rembrant and cited the Palette as offering excellent value for lunch or supper in London. The quality of the food and service at breakfast was high, and I would expect something similar obtains at lunch and supper. While we did not make use of the Rembrandt's lounge bar, it is elegant and roomy and would be a good place for a comfortable round of cocktails with friends.On the whole, we were quite satisfied with our stay at the Rembrandt, and will almost certainly stay at this hotel again on future trips to London.	
Aug 15 2009 	Something of a dump	Through a BA deal, stayed here for two nights free. The hotel was worth what we paid for it. Rooms are rather small, though not tiny, but badly in need of renovation. Carpet looked like it hadn't been replaced in 40 years, very dirty at the base of the walls where a vacuum cleaner couldn't reach, and the furniture was battered by similar decades of use. The room was airless -- no a/c and a window that could be opened a couple of inches kept the room unpleasantly hot at night even when the outside temperature was in the 60's. The breakfast was poor to mediocre. Most people staying at the hotel appeared to be young or with small children, tourists looking for relatively inexpensive accomodations. On the plus side, the hotel offers free internet which worked very well, and it is well located directly across the street from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and only a couple of blocks from the South Kensington tube stop. To be fair, we probably got a bad room because of the BA deal but I have to assume that many other rooms are in similarly poor condition. Wouldn't stay again even for free.	
Aug 13 2009 	perfect location	I had a nice stay in this hotel with my wife + children (11,12) at the start of August and found the hotel a perfect location. Within a 15 minutes walk of the hotel you have the science museum, Victoria and Albert museum, National history museum and Hyde Park which are all great and free (kids loved them all). The Royal Albert Hall is also in this radius and is £5 for a tour per head also good value. Harrods and Harvey Nichols are also a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction. Nearest tube station is South Kensington which is a 5 minute walk.The rooms are very clean and tidy with all modern features &amp; flat screen televisions. The rooms that we were in 669 + 671 were adjoining and both had whirlpool baths which great for relaxing in after pounding the streets.Breakfast was also very good with more than enough for selection. only small fault was cereal; area was hidden away with no signs to show where it was.Staff were excellent as was the manager - sylwester - who we had to see about a small problem with our room which he dealt with very well.This Hotel is excellent value and we will definitely be staying there on our next visit to London.We actually stayed in another hotel which was more Central and expensive for 2 Nights but it wasn't as good as the Rembrandt.. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in London for all age groups	
Aug 10 2009 	Good value excellent location not so great breakfast	The Rembrandt is a nice hotel, in a great location in South Kensington close to Harrod's and Knightbrige and with a tube stop nearby for everything else. The rooms are large, with nice beds, toiletries and free w-fi. The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. It is impossible to book a service at the spa . The pool is next door but you have to pay to use it. The hotel does not have enough tables at breakfast and we often had to wait, whatever time we came down. Staff did not replenish breakfast food regularly and seemed overwhelmed with serving tea/coffee.	
Aug 9 2009	Wonderful Location Great Stay	To reiterate what has already been written, the location is wonderful. Close to the underground (about 10 min walk with my mother) and a 15 minutes walk to Harrods. Many restaurants, shops, museums, grocery, and chemist within a short walking distance. Plus for those taking the double-decker tour bus (Big Red Bus) stops very close to the hotel. The room was comfortable, Executive Twin. The view was terrible, but we didn't travel to London to look out the window - correct? There's tea/coffee service in room and an iron and pant press. There is also an in-room safe and free internet service in the rooms. Our plane arrived at 7:30am and we were at the hotel at 8:30am. They graciously held our luggage and told us to come back at noon for a room. When we walked back in at 12 the room was ready. Great! The breakfast was nice, a lot of selection (meat, eggs, potatoes, fruit, bread, cereals, and vegetables). It was a nice way to start each morning off touring. Overall, the friendliness of the front desk was good - not overly nice but not rude. The hotel felt comfortable and extremely safe - which is important when traveling with your mother. I will defiantly stay at here on my next visit to London!	
Jul 31 2009 	Excellent value for money for central hotel clean with pleasant staff	This hotel was excellent value for money. Situated opposite the Victoria and Albert Museum. We stayed for one night whilst attending the Proms, walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall. Executive room was very large and clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Were able to leave our bags after we checked out for safe keeping which enabled us to visit other places the next day.Would definately stay there again and recommend it to others. Only hope they manage to keep it the way it is and do not start putting the prices up due to the excellent ratings it appears to be getting!!	
Jul 24 2009 	Brilliant hotel and good location !	Room clean and tidy. plenty of sockets and iron plus ironing board in large wardrobe.Bathroom had whirlpool bath! (great!) and the usual shampoos and soaps. We only ate the buffet breakfast which was okay as well although the toasting machine was a weird contraption, cereal hidden by the entrance. Staff attentive even when breakfast room was busy. Didnt dine in Palette Restaurant but asked staff if i could view the menu and i was taken into dining room where the chef happend to come out and told me about the carvery which was roast beef or pork. Looked lovely although we decided to eat elsewhere.The bar served a wide variety of drinks and cocktails, a good few of the cocktails were sampled and all good!The location was the best if you wanted to shop or even just window shop.5 min stroll to Harrods and a couple more to Harvey nichols. Harrods is lit up at night - nice pictures. We ate at Khans near S.kensingtion tube and a small italian near the hotel - cant remember its name but next to an old dusty bookshop.Also, theres lots of museums near-by the Natural History Museum is free .Next to that is the Science Museum and the V&amp;A is practically opposite the hotel. For the money we paid this was a definate winner .	
Jul 22 2009 	clean courteous staff and worth a return visit.	we had this booked for three nights including breakfast in a superior double. on arrival we were informed we had been upgraded to executive at no extra charge. the hotel was 5 -7 mins walk away from south kensington tube station (with luggage) and about 5 mins walk from harrods and directly opposite the V&amp;A. the staff were always very friendly and courteous. the room, although a small executive, was clean and quiet and the bed was comfortable. the usual selection of beverages but water was extra from the minibar in the room. also in the room was an iron and ironing board, room safe, freeview tv (with the usual pay channels) strangely no radio, that was in the bathroom which was well appointed with bathrobes and good quality toilet paper and toiletries. breakfast was a buffet affair and a slight let down, toast you did yourself, thin bread which had to be put in twice to give it any colour despite my wife fiddling with the controls. the fried eggs were either underdone or over done and the porridge tasted as if it had been made using water instead of milk, however, there was a good selection of fruit, yoghurts, bread rolls and croissants as well as fruit juices and cereals. you could help yourself to as much or as little as you liked and coffee or tea was served to you at your table. the hotel has an adjoining health spa and fitness suite. the bar serves a good menu up until 11 pm after which there are just sandwiches and for some strange reason chicken tikka masalla and rice. food and beer is a little pricey (beer £3.90 a pint and a portion of chips £3.50) but no worse than any other reasonable London hotel.	
Jul 7 2009 	Couldn't Ask for More	My husband and I stayed at the Rembrandt for 6 nights from June 29 to July 5 and we were totally pleased. The staff at reception were very friendly and most helpful. Our room was always spotless. Just know that to make the lights work in the room that you have to put your room card into a small slot right by the door. Then all the switches work. That was new to us. Breakfast each morning was included and almost everything you would want to eat in the morning was there. We ate enough to keep us going to a late lunch. The staff were right there to offer tea or coffee as soon as you sat down and cleared away used plates when you got up to help yourself a secondtime. They have excellent croissants and pastries. The location is great - right across the street from the V &amp; A, and about a 5 minute walk to the South Kensington tube station. Buses 74, 14, and two others stop right nearby. #74 takes you to Oxford Street and #14 takes you to Piccadilly Circus. The prices on their own website are probably the best you will find. They supply soap, shampoo and shower gel. You cannot go wrong by staying at this hotel and we will be back next time we are in London.	
Jul 5 2009 	Very Nice Place to Stay	Trip to Wimbledon tennis matches London was full of tennis fans, hotels quite full. This was a Very great Hotel . Front Desk personnel very professional and helpful. Great location for Tube stations, Restaurants, Shopping. The included English breakfast was great best we ever had in Europe or in the USA . The room was large compaired to some 4 star hotels in Europe. Very clean. Everything in the room worked. Bar and Lounge were great. Would go here again without a second thought. Try it.you wont be disappointed.	
Jun 20 2009 	Excellent Hotel!	Stayed at the Rembrandt with my wife from 6 - 9 june 09, and i must say i was pleasantly surprised as we booked a standard double but were upgraded on arrival to a superior double room. We found the hotel to be very nice and clean with exceptionally helpful staff especially Tina at reception and celio at concierge. Its in a Perfect Location, offers excellent Service and its a very clean Hotel!	
Jun 18 2009 	No bells and whistles but worth coming back to ...	Nice service from the get-go. Not British based staff, but very welcoming and well spoken. Judging from their accents you would be able to communicate in multiple languages. Hotel should advertise that. They were very responsive, and even printed some reservations for me, free of charge.If you arrive early, they will look after your luggage, while you go explore around Kensington. Room was TINY for what I am used to, but comfortably fit 2 adults and we didn't have to fight for space. Room had all basic amenities, plus &quot;trouser press&quot; :-) Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing missing. Free internet was great. Mind that Wi-Fi is only available in the lobby, and in your room you have RJ-45 network cable provided in the desk area. US T-Mobile users, your uma service WILL NOT work on your Wi-Fi enabled devices!Location was great, just minutes from South Kensington tube station, and great shopping area. If you turn right from the hotel, you can find ATM within 100 feet and nice stores until Knightsbridge tube station. Chef Ramsey's Boxwood Cafe is only 2 minute walk from Knightsbrige station - delicious food, great ambiance and terrific dining experience for $150 for 2 people 3 course meal. There is nice, French brasserie &quot;Paul&quot; across the street from S. Kensington Tube Station - I recommend it!McD's is only 3 blocks to the right from the hotel. Cab to soho will run you ~ 9L and to Victoria Coach station ~ 5.5L Get Oyster card in the tube, and don't forget to return it before you leave, to get your deposit back. You will save loads of money on transportation. I liked the hotel, and the staff. Nice price for a nice hotel in London. AC tends to make room a little wet, but 5 minutes of open window fixes the issue. if you get the street room, opening the window will give you a headache. Shower head was broken when we got there. I used theproblem envelope from the desk, and gave it to the staff. When came back from my meal, everything was fixed. I recommend this hotel for you London stay.	
Jun 18 2009 	Fourth Stay - Each One Gets Better	This was a two-part stay. Part 1Spent three days here before heading off for a couple of days in Paris via Eurostar. Room booked through a great deal from British Airways. Room was small, clean and you gotta love the free internet connection and air conditioning. They held our bags for us until our return three days later.The return room was booked through Hotel and NOT BA. Upon return we were happy to get a free upgrade to a Grand Room. (Photos attached). Lots of space, also very clean. Not much to add to what everybody else including myself has posted. The staff is excellent. One of the concierge's (sp) has been there 17 years. I think that says something about the way the hotel is run. In fact we saw quite a few people that we have recognized over the past 5 years or so. Hotel is close to V&amp;A (Yaaa we finally went..it was starting to be a bad joke.) Also went to the science museum to see Wallace and Grommit. There is a ton of cool stuff in there; and it is a short walk from the hotel. And you dont have to be a kid to enjoy.Breakfast had large variety and large crowds at times. You could eat healthy or go for the full English. I do not know what they put in the scrambled eggs but both the wife and I have spent hours speculating. I need that recipe. Plenty of places to eat n the area. We went to the pub (Bunch of Grapes) right down the road. Go upstairs for a better selection. We ate at two places twice. Both near the south Ken Tube station. First was Pirienos Italian. Service is indifferent however haven never been disappointed in a meal here. The second and more interesting is the Polish Resto called Daquise. Atmosphere is fascinating. I lioked the food. Home style comfort food. Nothing fancy. MY wife was worried she would get &quot;yelled at&quot; for not eating her vegetables. I loved this food. Let's summarize: Good clean rooms. Free internet (hardwired) in every room. Great staff. The Concierge printed last minue event tickets for us as well as boarding passes...Don't forget to &quot;thank them&quot;. I maybe could find a cheaper place or a newer place, or a more upscale place,,,but I like it here and here I shall return. Oh and yes I have recommended to friends and foe alike.Thanks,Jeff	
Jun 10 2009 	Excellent Service 	Stayed at the Rembrandt with a friend to celebrate her birthday and had a very enjoyable experience from the time we checked in, which was swift and efficient (also parked our car - which was a major plus and its discounted) the rooms were imaculate, not huge but very good for London and had a whirlpool bath which was fab, flat screen tv and robes - not a great view but you dont spend your time looking out of the window. The lounge bar was very good for a snack and a drink mid afternoon and service there was excellent - breakfast was very good and even though very busy when we went down the service was exceptional and a great buffet with everything you could want for a great breakfast - could not fault the Rembrandt and will definitely return when next in London...Very close to Harrods and lots of shops and bars - also the Spa which adjoins the hotel looks very good and had a tour - well worth the money and you get a discount on treatments.Look forward to going back..	
Jun 9 2009 	Pretty much as stated here	Walls are somewhat thin, a bit of street noise that drowns out nicely with the a/c. Big LCD TV, but gave me problems. Clean, comfortable, well appointed. Free internet is very nice.	
May 28 2009 	Excellent Location - Excellent Value for Money	After ringing round a number of hotels in London, we were struggling to find a reasonable hotel with a pool, a good location, and room for two adults and our five year old daughter, at a reasonable price. The Rembrant was showing a price on the tinterweb of £250 for a double room including breakfast for two nights, which was pretty reasonable for a 4 start hotel in such a good location. When we rang them to ask if they had a room for the three of us they offered a family room at the same price, which I thought was fantastic value.Room was easily big enough for the three of us, very clean, facilities excellent. Although we didn't eat in the hotel in the evening, we did have breakfast which was very nice. The bar prices were not at all expensive for London. My only gripe is that the staff were generally not that warm, although they were efficient. Maybe I am being picky here, but in a 4 star hotel bar when I am in a group I expect the waiter to come and take a drinks order, whereas everytime we had to go to the bar and then wait 10 to 20 minutes for our drinks, but heh it kept me sober. A nice smile and a hello is free and goes a long way!All in all would really recommend this place and we will definately use it for our family weekends in London again.	
May 14 2009 	Good Value and more	In my never ending quest for value for money hotels in London I believe I have found a Gem.On my way from Brussels to London by train I found an offer for the Rembrandt at 95 pounds which I tried to book. Before it happened my Laptop ran out of battery so on arrival at the station I called them and spoke to reservations who surprisingly offered the same room rate. On arrival at the hotel I found out that for 20 pounds extra I could get a superior room which I opted to do. Front desk staff are friendly in that mechanical have a nice day fashion. Location is fantastic and the Lobby is good looking and well laid out.Room was great spacious with large warmly decorated bathroom with a pretty good Jacuzzi. Lots of towels soaps shampoo's. Furnishings looked good no worn corners on wall paper linen on bed was great and nice pillows. My room was at the back of the hotel so quiet and I had 2 windows that fully opened which I loved. Room for London standards was large. In addition all usual extras i.e. iron minibar internet connection. Could not really have asked for more.Breakfast buffet which was included was very nice and staff friendly and efficient even though the place was packed with 15 people waiting to get in. Could not fault it.The Bar located just before the restaurant looks very good and for someone who spends as many days a year in hotels as I do feels right.Now heres the downside. Room service (cleaning) during my 3 days never made up my room until very late afternoon except one morning when they came in without knocking at 08:00. Chap who refreshes the minibar came in twice at 15:00 in the afternoon without knocking. He claims due to the please make up my room sign on the door.Staff in the bar are friendly in as much as they feel they have to. This is reflected at reception too. Tried to get a coffee at 09:45 in the bar and was told in no uncertain terms we are closed even though staff where standing around. I was advised to go to the restaurant where breakfast was still being served. As I was having a meeting didn't feel that was the right place.Bottom line very nice place good value for money and with a little staff encouragement -v- customer satisfaction could be a great place.This Hotel in it's amazing location with fresh decor would I believe be in the top 10 if staff would go that extra 10 percent and take the mechanics out of trying to be nice. Saying that there where some exceptions. Both concierges I dealt with where 5 star.	
May 13 2009 	Excellent stay location and service	We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location is excellent as it is down the street from Harrods, accross the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum and really close to the South Kensington subway station. We were in a large executive room with a lovely view from our window. The room had self coffee and tea service and an iron and pants press. Excellent and generous English breakfast buffet in the mornings. The roast beef sandwiches available in the lounge were wonderful as well. The concierge was very helpful in providing directions, information and booking us transportation to the airport. I highly recommend this hotel.	
May 7 2009 	We would stay here again and recommend it to others without hesitation.	I chose this hotel specifically for its closeness to the V&amp;A, Natural History and Science museums, to the tube/Picadilly Line and good reviews on Trip Advisor, but of of all the hotels I've stayed in, I found this to be one of the most efficient. All staff were friendly and helpful, and were quick to respond to any queries we had. The only drawbacks were that the bed was a double rather than a king which meant that my partner's feet were hanging off the end of the bed (he being 6 foot 4!). They were willing to move us for a charge, but it was a small issue. The view from the room was also nothing to write home about (a roof), but I guess that's the luck of the draw! A few touches we noticed - free internet access in the foyer, prompt servicing of rooms in the morning, proper hairdryers, magazines in the room, fresh flowers by the lifts, robes, big mugs for coffee at breakfast and real scambled eggs!The hotel in general was very well maintained - we didn't spot anything which looked tired or 'out of order'. The ambiance was relaxed and positive. We didn't hear anyone complaining at reception which is a rare event in some of the hotels I've stayed in! A good indicator we thought.Good value for money given the high standards the hotel clearly has. We would stay here again and recommend it to others without hesitation.	
Apr 30 2009 	Pleasant hotel needs to upgrade rooms	Excellent location and typical London hotel. Good reception and bar. Room was spacious and comfortable but could do with some paint and brighter colours. Free Internet in room. The bathroom was small and could do with a new tub/shower. Breakfast was a good and traditional buffet in their rather small restaurant. The atmosphere throughout is good and I would gladly stay at his hotel again.	
Apr 27 2009 	Very good choice-would definitely return to this hotel.	Recently stayed at The Rembrandt with my wife for 3 nights.Reception staff were very friendly and hospitable. We were given an upgrade when we booked in without any request by us.Room was very comfortable and clean.Plenty of room for a london hotel.Great location right in heart of london and right near South Kensington Tube station.Bus stop right outside front door was also a big help.Breakfast was excellent and typically British with all the trimmings and as much as you liked.All good quality and fresh.The hotel lounge is a great spot for afternoon tea or a drink after a day sightseeing. Very comfortable and inexpensive. Also try the small Italian restaurant, Orsini, just 100 metres down from the hotel.Turn right as you exit the hotel.Terrific quality and value italian food. Salvatore, the owner, will probably give you some of his home made limoncella with dessert.	
Apr 23 2009 	Great hotel! *****	I loved this hotel - it was clean,spacious and the location was amazing.It's located near the underground,and its only about a 10 minute walk to Harrods.The V&amp;A and natural history museum is literally right across the road.We had a small room as only 2 of us were staying but it was lovely - big TV, clean bathroom and extremely comfortable beds! I didnt really want to come home to be honest!We never had dinner or lunch in the hotels restaurant but breakfast was very good. Staff were helpful and pleasant. The bar and lounge was stylish and comfortable with an overall nice enviroment.I couldnt fault anything at the Rembrandt and i would definitely stay there again.	
Apr 23 2009 	The Rembrandt - THANKS BRIT AIR!!!!	We stayed here for two free days on the Brit Air promotion, and must say we were very happy. The room was HUGE, and SPOTLESS. The bathroom (sink/toilet/shower) all worked very well. Elevators in good working condition. As others mention, you can't beat the tube stop - it is really close by and is the direct line to the airport. Breakfast had a huge spread (we are vegetarians), and very delicious. The lobby is beautiful, but more importantly we were HAPPY with our room. The bed and the pillows were very comfortable as well. I've already recommended it to friends. Nice view outside, but no problem with noise. We usually stay in budget hotels, so it was a real treat.	
Apr 22 2009 	A real surprise	I booked a trip to London in January with BA - which included one night free in a London hotel. I chose the Rembrandt - and a very good choice at that. My room was not ready when I arrived so they let me use the facilities at the adjoining fitness center, where I was able to shower and change. My room was clean -- 2 twin beds -- and not too small. Easy access to the the South Ken underground - and across the street from the V&amp;A. A good choice for the free breakfast as well. The room was clean with amenties ... a working, strong shower, for example. I stayed only one night as I moved to my usual hotel. However, I would consider this a good choice as a backup hotel. It was a good and pleasant surprise for an overnight stay.	
Apr 21 2009 	A nice hotel well located.	We found this a good hotel, at least the lobby, dining room and the rooms. The hallways were a disaster, dirty, stained carpet, marred doors. It was a relief to get into the nice room. The staff was great, food good, and this place is incredibly well located, right across from the V&amp;A Museum and about 3 blocks from a tube station. We got a deal through British Airways, otherwise, I think the prices are high. It's considered 4 star but that's a European 4 star, not a North American rating. I'd place this as a good 3 star by NA standards.	
Apr 20 2009 	Nice hotel in lovely area	I stayed here with my mother for four days and thoroughly enjoyed it. We paid extra for early check-in after an overnight flight, which was worth it. We had a single executive room, which was perfect. The room had a loveseat, desk with chair, and a chair with end table. The bathroom was spacious with plenty of water pressure and hot water. The buffet breakfast, which was included with our room, was filling and had a large variety from cereal to eggs to fruit. The hotel bar is nice, but the service could be slow. Overall though, the staff was very friendly and we would go back again.Also close to the South Kensington tube stop, which is a direct line from the airport.	
Mar 25 2009 	BA Special Deal trip	We just returned from a special offer trip from British Airlines, including two nights at The Rembrandt, in Knightsbridge (closer to South Kensington). We had other options (staying with friends) for our other nights, but planned our last 2 nights here - partly for easy access to Heathrow the final morning as well as a good sightseeing location. We had seen some &quot;not so good&quot; reviews for the hotel, but we felt that this hotel was quite nice - the deal included a continental breakfast, which was actually a full breakfast buffet with hot &quot;English Breakfast&quot; items included. I'd definitely stay here again with a good deal came up.	
Mar 23 2009 	A pleasant FREE surprise	We took advantage of the British Airways cheap airfare plus 2 free nights of hotel and chose the Rembrandt after researching all of the options. We read some negative trip advisor ratings, but we really liked the location, so we went for it. At 9:30 a.m. upon check-in, they had a room ready for us - total surprise! Not only was it clean, but it was spacious and modern - also a surprise! The bathroom was large for Euro hotels. It is literally across the street from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, and a 8-10 min. walk to Harrod's. The South Kensington tube stop is 5 min. away. The staff was super nice. The breakfast buffet was lovely - beautiful room, lots of offerings, fresh. The bar was also nice for a nightcap. Great neighborhood - cheese shop (Cave au Fromage), Indian restaurant, etc.	
Mar 19 2009 	We'd stay here again	We stayed here for 3 nights. Were lucky to have a large end-of-corridor room at rear of hotel which was quiet, clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly. Particularly appreciated the comfortable lounge bar, but not the spirits prices they charged - way over the top, even for London. Excellent position near the museums, tube and good choice of local restaurants in the nearby streets.	
Mar 5 2009 	4 Star Hotel - I think not.	We stayed at The Rembrandt as an incentive with flying with British Airways. The bonus of this hotel is that its close to the Natural History Museum, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Science Museum, Harrods. The local pub is Hoop &amp; Toy and shi shi frou frou member's only nightclub Boujis. Apparently the stars and the royals go there. The rejects go to Hoop &amp; Toy. lolThe hotel lobby and dining area is renovated and modern though does not reflect the rest of the hotel. The rooms were quite the disappointment.The corridors were dim and dated and the wallpaper was coming off in some areas.Our hotel room would have been spectacular if we were still living in the 70's. Not sure how to explain - it had everything that a hotel should have including the high end amenities, however we could not get over the outdated decor. You could feel the spring in the bed and you could hear your neighbours flushing the toilet or walking above your head. The room had a safe as well as a trouser press! Overall our hotel experience was bizarre. I would expect more from this hotel as it is located in South Kensington....	
Feb 25 2009 	large clean room but slightly overpriced.	we stayed in the grand room (supposed to be the best room in the hotel) which had a really huge, comfortable bed, the bathroom was okay but wasnt impressed with the 'jacuzzi' bath and rusty shower head?!?! The view from our room was dark, bleak and depressing! expected a little more for our money. The room service was good but the food took a rather long time to be delivered and didnt meet expectations. The food and the drinks in the minibar were highly overpriced.overall the room was lovely but we wouldnt pay to there again	
Feb 24 2009 	Fantastic location	We stayed 2 nights here free as part of a British Airways deal. It's right across from the Victoria and Albert Museum and a short walk to wonderful restaurants in South Kensington (Bibendum, Racine, Kwality India). The staff was very friendly, there was free internet access, a terrific breakfast and a health club adjoining (available for a slight fee.) Our room wasn't huge or fancy but had a powerful shower and was quite clean if somewhat dowdy and worn. (The mattresses were firm, though) We then paid for some additional nights because our daughter is living nearby and the location was so convenient. Again, we booked through British Airways and got a wonderful promotional deal - I think it amounted to about $145 a night! In London!! This isn't a &quot;romantic&quot; getaway but if you don't plan on being in the room much and just want a nice place to stay with lovely staff, I would highly recommend The Rembrandt.	
Jan 7 2009 	Never again!	Myself and my son stayed over the christmas, it was only a two night break. I find the staff overall quite rude, Maids knocked at your room and shouting through the door to come in and clean on boxing day morning at 9am, they also refused to let me use the toilet the day before as they were cleaning when I entered my room. A booked wake up call was not given so I missed the serpentine swim at hyde park . The kettle in the room was filthy and full of limescale. They promised a gift (which was also advertised in their brouchure) for children, my son did not get one!! Overall quite sharp toned, perhaps because I was a women travelling alone with my son? Food on christmas day average nothing exceptional, all in all a complete waste of £450 and a ruined christmas, Bad show rembrandt, only good thing about the hotel, is the location.	
Jan 2 2009	Great Location	I have stayed at this hotel 3 times. The location is good, central but not noisy. It is very close to South Kensington tube station, probably less than 5 minutes walk, there is also a bus stop opposite. It is within walking distance of the Knightsbridge shops, and to the galleries/museums in the area and it is opposite the V&amp;A. The rooms are comfortable and spacious, I was once given a small room but was moved after I told reception it was far too small for the price I had paid. It was handled quickly and efficiently. The breakfast is a choice of continental or cooked, with a wide selection. I have not dined in the evening although did have a light lunch upon arrival once which was very nice. The bar area, and restaurant, foyer etc, are well furnished.	
Dec 17 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location	I stayed at this hotel from 11/29-12/13/2008. This is the third time I have stayed here. I discovered the hotel 2 years ago loved it and have come back. The staff is great from the front desk to Housekeeping and the restaurant staff. Polite and helpful at every turn. The room was a good size and had everything you could possibly need. The TV even had American Football on Sunday night. The breakfast is standard hotel buffet fare, but, plentifull and anything you could possibly want. The location is great. Five minute walk to South Kensington Tube station and lots of buses stop across the street. Pleasant walk to Kensington Palace and of course just 10 minutes to Harrods. All in all, a very nice hotel that I will be visiting again. (Economy permitting)	
Dec 5 2008 	Good location great breakfast average room very expensive stay	The hotel is located near the south kensington tube station and very close to the museum area. The access is easy by tube and bus (bus no 14). The room was small, the heating system made some weird noises during our stay. Breakfast is rich and covers a wide variety of dishes. You have to pay 7 pounds in order to use the swimming pool. All in all, an average london hotel, easy accessible but very expensive.	
Nov 24 2008 	Comfortable but not luxurious	I stayed at the Rembrandt from the 7th through the 17th of November, 2008, in a superior queen room. Rooms at the Rembrandt are not large, but are newly refurbished, and have a fair amount of storage space, and the usual amenities (iron, ironing board, safe, minibar). The bathroom was small, but quite functional, with good water pressure for the shower (and a rubber anti-skid mat for the tub bottom - a necessary amenity, as the tub surface itself was rather slick, and is elevated several inches above the level of the bathroom floor, as is common in European hotels). The climate control worked well - I was able to cool the room, even though it was November (but quite mild). Conversely, the heating unit worked well when needed. The buffet breakfast downstairs was standard hotel fare (steam table with eggs/sausages/potatoes, etc. and stations for cold cereal, toast, pastries, juice, and some fruit). Service was variable, depending on the number of guests being served. At peak times, there were short waits for available space. I had few dealings with the front desk, after check-in, but those dealings were fine.	
Nov 12 2008 	Good Location	This hotel is across the street from the museum and close to Kensington Palace and Harrods. I only stayed one night so I did not get to go to the museum or see the whole neighborhood but how can you go wrong in Knightsbridge/South Kensington. The room was okay but I agree with the other reviewers that the breakfast is not that good. I enjoyed the Kensington Palace Tour and the gardens are beautiful.	
Nov 8 2008 	Hotel great food awful!	My daughter and I stayed at the Rembrandt for a 4 day break a couple of weeks ago. The hotel was very nice, pleasant surroundings, friendly staff, clean rooms but the food was pretty awful! We only had one evening meal. There was very little choice of all of the courses and the staff had no idea what the choice of two sweets were! The meal cost us over £100 including one drink each. Fortunately there was a nice pub near by that we ate at the other three nights. The breakfasts had an average choice BUT they were not hot! The cooked breakfast was actually quite cold hence I had just toast and marmalade for two days. Summing up, I would not stay at the Rembrandt again.	
Oct 2 2008 	Peace and tranquility in Kensington	I spent six nights in an Executive Room (a step above &quot;Superior&quot;) during September. Initial contact with the hotel was plagued with self-inflicted problems - mainly because I was in a different timezone and work demands meant the dates of my stay kept changing - but staff handled my contacts so well that I felt in safe hands before I had even arrived in the country. My first impressions of the competence and friendliness of staff only improved through-out the visit. I had asked for a quiet room and found myself in a back room without much of a view. It was exceptionally quiet though. The only noise annoyance came from the air-conditioning - which I eventually turned off at night despite the warm weather.The room was not spacious, but I never felt cramped despite the length of my stay. It was also clean, modern and the facilities all worked like they are supposed to.I had breakfast at the hotel each morning and found it to be fine - although the coffee was truly dire (like it is in most of London). Stick to the tea! I also had dinner twice. Dinner was a help-yourself cavery and certainly wasn't bad, in fact it was much better than most of the over-priced restaurants nearby, but it wasn't outstanding. One place I really can recommend is the creperie near the South Kensington tube station - the food there was excellent and pretty cheap given the location.The only real problem I experienced on my whole visit was with my laundry. As far as I could discover, there was only one laundrette within walking distance - and that was never open. I ended up having to use the hotel laundry which was stingingly expensive.Overall my experience at the Rembrandt was really positive. The facilities are excellent, the location is brilliant and the staff were genuine and helpful. I will definitely stay there again.	
Sep 13 2008	Great Location very clean and excellent service	Stayed at the Rembrandt for five nights last week. Overall, the stay was excellent.We were on the sixth floor, generous sized room and fantastic bath.Room very clean and the housekeeping service fantastic.Our rate included a continental breakfast which was fine, I'm not a big breakfast eater but I did notice that some packages included a full english breakfast if that's of interest to anyone.Very close to the tube, buses and taxis were parked directly in front of the hotel.Will definitely stay there again in the future.	
Aug 20 2008	Eat Breakfast somewhere else	it had been a few years since I stayed at the Rembrandt Hotel. The location is convenient, but you pay the price for the location. The room came with breakfast. I use to look forward to their food, but the breakfast has gone very downhill. Watery scrambled eggs, canned fruit, fatty bacon and little else worth eating except for the cereal. For such an expensive hotel, they sure have let their food go to the dogs.	
Aug 3 2008	Locaton great everything else needs work	Good - Location of hotel is brilliant, close to south kensington station and Harrods. Bad - Rooms are old and in need of refurbishment but then again we got what we paid for, prices are cheap for london and we were out all day sightseeing so it suited us. Breakfast is nice. Overall, don't expect much from the hotel but then again locaton makes up for it	
Jul 30 2008 	A comfortable reasonable well-located hotel	The Rembrandt is reasonably-priced, quiet and centrally located. The breakfast which is included in the room price is good with a large choice. I didn't try the restaurant for other meals. The hotel is furnished in a very conservative style, not very contemporary or very luxurious, but very comfortable. My bedroom was air-conditioned with double-glazed windows so that I didn't hear the heavy traffic on the street outside. My only criticism is that when i checked in, they took a £50 deposit charge on my credit card to cover any possible expenses. This deposit was cancelled when I left, but even so I found it very unpleasant to be treated as a potential thief. Except for this, i recommend this hotel very highly to people who want an agreeable stay in London.	
Jul 28 2008 	Poor for a 4 Star Hotel	This hotel should not be listed as a 4 Star ! I was booked into a Superior room which is rated as a &quot;posher room&quot;.The bed linen was dirty and smelt of body odour, even the curtains smelt stale ! The carpets where thread bare, the bathrooms old, rusty the overall room was like a 1 star travel lodge ! I would have been happy to pay £45 per night to stay at this hotel but paying £191-00 to stay in a tarted up DUMP is a joke ! The wallpaper, doors and just the general look of the hotel is tired and unkept ! The leasure club attached to the hotel was in a very poor state, the jacuzzi didnt work, the pool was slimey, there as plasters floating in the pool and to top it all off there was chewing gum on the steps.DONT STAY THERE IF YOUR AFTER A DECENT NIGHTS SLEEP IN A LUXURY ROOM - IT WONT HAPPEN	
Jul 17 2008 	GOOD LOCATION BUT TINY ROOMS	My husband and I stayed 1 night at this hotel on business. On first impressions the reception and lobby area was small and not as plush as some other hotels. We were allocated a room on the 5th floor. The corridor carpet was shabby in places and the wall scuffed. The room and bathroom were tiny.. The small queen size bed was in an alcove so to get out of bed you virtually had to climb over the bed. The room was noisy. The decor and furniture were ok and the breakfast was fine. The location was very good and we had no issues with staff. Overall I think the hotel was ok, but it was the smallest bedroom I have encounted in London and the hotel did not feel like a luxury hotel.	
Jul 17 2008 	Pleasant Stay at the Rembrandt	Spent 5 nights in early July. I found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant (if somewhat difficult to understand with heavy accents for most personnel). Our group was made up of 1 couple and a grandmother/grandaughter - so we had the opportunity to see both a twin bedded room and a gueen size room. The twin room was beautiful, on the second floor facing the V&amp;A museum. It had the most delightful little balcony. It had been updated fairly recently, I would say, with a very nice bathroom. The queen room was towards the back of the hotel, nowhere near as nice and cost more - substantially more! However, the room towards the rear was very quiet while the room facing the museum had a lot of street noise.Breakfast buffet was quite good with a nice selection and the best scrambled eggs we encountered on a 14 day trip that included Paris and parts of Scotland. Our breakfasts were included in our room rates, but we did eat there for dinner one night as well. They offer a 25% discount for early dinners, so we gave them a try. Dinner is also a buffet and while acceptable, was not anything great. Rather limited choices. Beware if you are paying by credit card and are from the States....they will attempt to do the conversion for you, running the charge in dollars and not pounds, and won't bother to ask you first. I had repeatedly read that if asked, you should always have the charges run in pounds as it will be a higher conversion fee, if run in dollars, than your own credit card company would charge you. There are 2 computers in the lobby for internet. At check in, I was told that you could purchase a password to allow you to access the internet. However, if you just sat down to use the computers, you could get right online without any password. Not sure what was going on, but was able to check weather and email with no problem and at no cost! As other posters have pointed out, the location is superb. I would certainly consider staying here on future trips to London	
Jul 15 2008 	Very good all things considered	OK. So twice a year my wife and I treat ourselves to an overnighter in London without the kids and this was one of thise nights.Great room at a great rate, the only problem was no air-con, so waking up sweating in teh night after several drinks may be the norm, but in 25 degrees, yuck.The restaurant doesn't really do much if you're on a special occasion, we made the right choice to eat out and just take breakfast. That said, we had a beautiful cheeseburger in the bar on arrival. One of the best ever...I'd recommend this place to anyone wanting a bit more space for under £200.00. The Westbury in Mayfair and Le Meridien in Piccadily were our last two venues, but The Rembrandt wins it. DOes anyone know if there's cheaper parking nearby as the car park behind the hotel was £30 for 24 hours...	
Jul 15 2008 	Fab location for this hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 1 night (saturday) in July. Check in staff were really helpful. We arrived early and had a lunch appointment to go to. We really wanted to check into our room before lunch but thought it wouldn't be possible. They called housekeeping and asked for the room to be finished ASAP so we could refresh ourselves and head off to lunch. We'd booked a Superior room also which was very spacious and had a sofa so you don't have to sit around on the beds. Location is great. Right opposite the Victoria and Albert museum. Great for exploring the west end. Also close enough on picadilly/district lines if you want to park outside of london and come in by Tube. You would think that the rooms would be noisy too - because of being in such a busy area, but we didn't hear a sound all night. Must have great triple-glazing!!Breakfast was very nice, lots of choice...and they even had soya milk for me, which can be difficult to find in hotels!	
Jul 8 2008 	So Much Potential	I'll start with what was good about this hotel. The location is terrific. The South Kensington tube station is a block and a half away, Harrods, etc. are about 3-4 blocks the other direction. The V&amp;A museum is literally across the street, so it was nice to walk over for the day. Knightsbridge / Kensington are two of the nicest areas in the Center of London. The music academy is a block away, so there are always great performances to attend without having to travel very far. It's a great neighborhood.From the moment we checked into the Rembrandt, it seemed as though the desk staff had something more important to do (and we had just spent the previous 3 weeks in Italy, so our tolerance for 'abrupt' treatment from hotel staff was pretty high). Aside from one nice man who loaned us an extension cord and some of his tools to fix a suitcase, the staff was just plain rude.Our room had once been beautiful. It was large and had a nice sitting area that overlooked the V&amp;A Museum. The condition of the room, however was a far cry from 'shabby chic'. The carpet was worn and stained, the furniture was worn nearly through in many places, and both the furniture and the feather mattress pad and duvet had a musty smell. There was so much deferred maintenance that I can't list it all, but the main thing that stands out in my mind is that the mini-bar fridge hadn't been cleaned in a long time, and with the key-card system the hotel uses to shut down electricity in the room having turned off the power, smelled slightly of wet cat. The bathroom sink drain was slow, the ironing board wouldn't stand up. You get the idea. Once a hotel experience turns, as this one did, the list of things one notices gets longer and longer :)After the first breakfast, we vowed to walk to other food. The buffet reflected the same lack of care as the rest of the presentation. We just kept asking ourselves, &quot;does anybody care that things are like this?&quot;. The answer is that if someone did, they wouldn't be. When we went to the front desk to express a few concerns, the young lady (without realizing that I could see what she was writing) while listening to my partner describe our concern, smiled and wrote down a completely different number (while repeating it back). When I repeated the number, she realized I was standing where I could see her notepad, blushed, scribbled it out and wrote the number down. It spoke to the lack of concern for us or any customer, and we weren't going on like I am right now, it was something as simple as a request for a room key because housekeeping had taken ours out of the key-card slot.This hotel could be a great find, with just a little TLC and a tightening of the managerial reigns. Location is one thing, but an absence of pride is another. While it wasn't the worst hotel room we have seen, we will definitely seek other accommodations in the future.	
Jul 1 2008 	Location location location	Location wise the hotel is situated around 10 minutes walking distance from the famous harrods shopping centre and knightsbridge. the single room was pretty compact and small but clean. nice and affordable hotel for short term business stays. friendly front desk staff. do not expect a five star ammenities though.	
Jun 29 2008 	Bed with a duvet!	Stayed at this hotel four nights in the end of June. Having read good reviews at this page, I was looking very much forward to my stay. And I was nor disappointed.Check-in was friendly and efficient. Luggage brought up to my room, which was at a quiet street at the back of the hotel.Queen bed with a light duvet! What a treat for one that cannot stand those sheets and blankets that tend to end up in a mix in the morning. The best bed ever in a London hotel!The size of the room plenty for me, and room and bath had all I needed. The door to the corridor could, however, been more soundproof. You could hear every single person walking by, so one of the nights I woke up by someone passing by talking. Normal talking, but it was almost as they were in the room!The breakfast was very good, with a good selection of warm and cold food. I always turned up at 7, and there was always plenty of tables available until I had finished at 8. I did not feel that I had to leave the table for others. One had to get through The Daily Telegraph provided, and enjoy the meal. (Good choice of newspaper!)The concierges were very helpful, and always recogniced you. The location is very convinient for the tube. 5 min. walk from South Kensington Station, and about 10 from Kensington.I had a very nice stay, felt very welcome, and would definitely stay again.	
Jun 18 2008 	A pleasant experience	I stayed at the Rembrandt for 2 very pleasant nights.The room was nicely furnished, comfortable bed &amp; had a nice bathroom. I was at the rear of the hotel so it was very quiet. The location was convenient, a short walk from the tube station, bus stop right outside &amp; tour bus stop just done the street.The staff were friendly and arranged everything requested without any problems.	
Jun 13 2008	Tried to stay at Rembrandt but ........	I booked a stay at the Rembrandt for one night (12 June) through the British Airways website, at the same time as booking my flight. There was a good room rate, comparatively speaking (£130 B&amp;B), and the reviews of the hotel seemed good. This was a brief business trip to London.Anyway when I arrived at the hotel around 2.30 pm, the hotel manager told me that they had had problems, apparently of their own making, which had meant the hotel was heavily overbooked and that they didn't have a room for me. He had booked me in a hotel close by (&quot;also a 4 star&quot;, he stated) and they would pay for a taxi to take me straight there. Given that I had a meeting to attend at 4 pm I didn't make a fuss and accepted mistakes can happen. So I was then despatched to the Regency Hotel close by. It is pretty tired it has to be said, not a four star but rather a three star, and while the basics of my stay were delivered i.e. I managed to get a decent night's sleep in a comfy bed, it was not a four star experience.So while the hotel manager at the Rembrandt was very apologetic and assured me I'd get an upgrade if I returned , I don't think I'll be going back. If I was to go again, I would certainly make a point of calling a day or two before arriving to receive an assurance there was no problem. The thing which irritated me was the misrepresentation, which I accept may have been innocent, that the hotel I was being offered in substitution was equivalent class or standard . So this may have been a complete one-off for them, never to be repeated, but be careful........	
Jun 4 2008 	Excellent Service	I have stayed at this hotel for years and usually stay there 4 times a year. My last trip was last month and I will be returning in September. The staff are cordial and helpful and very welcoming. I am always given the same room and everything is in perfect order. I have stayed in both the remodelled rooms and the more traditional. They seem to remember from one trip to another how you like your coffee at breakfast, which I find amazing. The breakfast is excellent and the concierge staff and front desk staff, maintenance and cleaning staff are very helpful. The area is so convenient and safe and so easy to get around on the bus outside the door and the various restaurants around the South Kensington Tube station are very good. It is a very comfortable hotel for woman travelling on their own. I would definately refer this hotel to anything wishing to visti London. Everyone is so helpful. I look foward to my next visit in September/08.	
May 25 2008 	Great City Break	We selected the Rembrandt primarily on location. We wanted to be able to reach the main areas easily and was a good choiceThe reception and public areas were clean and brightly appointed, the room we had was on the 1st floor and was very pleasant, all the features you would expectOur friends were on a higher floor and their room was much smaller, but adequate.I was also impressed with the cleanlinessWe took in a show and dined out on each evening.Breakfast was a bit of a &quot;Cattle Market&quot; to begin with, but the food quality was ok.Some of the staff were a bit indifferent, but overall the service was goodA good visit and will be back	
May 23 2008 	Wonderful Hotel	We booked our first three night stay in an executive twin room through the on-line hotel website as they did have the best prices. We were allocated Room 375 one of the refurbished rooms on a quiet back street. Check in was quick enough and the reception staff were polite and efficient. A swipe of our credit card was taken to cover any minibar items that we would use but there was no amount charged as such and we paid by travelers cheques when we checked out.On our second day of stay we decided to book another three night stay which we booked through reception  we would be coming back in 10 days time and we were able to leave a suitcase with them free of charge until we returned.When we arrived back for our second three night stay we were told that our credit card would be charged 50GBP for each night of our stay as well as the price of our three night stay - 540GBP, a total of 690GBP (even though I was going to be paying with travelers cheques), oh the receptionist said, well your credit card will be reimbursed with the whole amount when you pay with travelers cheques on check-out. Needless to say I paid there and then up-front with travelers cheques for the whole stay. I was told that it was hotel policy to charge this way because I had NOT booked through the internet !!!!!! Anyway our room was wonderful, quite large and we had a lovely outlook to a back street with terrace houses. There were two large full length windows which opened onto a tiny balcony as well as another double window, these windows had wonderful blackout curtains. Our room had two very comfortable beds, a small sitting area, a desk area and plasma/lcd tv, a safe, hairdryer and airconditioning. We had 25 degree celcius and 27 degree celcius days so the airconditioner was used and was very efficient. The bathroom was very modern with a shower over the spa bath. The only complaints I would have are the very thin walls and extremely creaky floor boards, meaning we could hear the people in the next rooms conversation and people walking in the room above us. We did have noisy neighbours who were yelling and screaming at 11.30 p.m. so we moved the next day for our last nights stay to Room 546. This was an unfurbished room right next to the lifts but we didnt hear the lifts at all. We really liked this room, it was much bigger and had a wonderful couch and two chairs, plasma/lcd tv, pull down hatch with tea and coffe making facilities, minibar, safe and hairdryer. This room must have had concrete floors covered by carpet as there was no 'creaking'. I think we were extremely lucky to have this room as it was so much nicer than the refurbished room and we appreciated the reception staff organizing the move for us. The bathroom was older but we didnt mind at all. I have attached photos of both rooms to my review.The breakfast was fabulous with everything imaginable on offer. There was fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereals, juices, muffins, croissants, toast, cheese, scrambled eggs, poached eggs, sausages, bacon, black pudding and baked beans. We were offered tea or coffee and my daughter asked for and was given hot chocolate every morning. The male waiters in the restaurant were wonderful, very attentive and extremely pleasant to talk to.We enjoyed our stay at the Rembrandt but the creaky floorboards did really annoy us.A couple of tips: If you come out the South Kensington Station and up the steps, turn right and you come out at Thurloe Square where there are loads of restaurants  Pizza/Pasta, Japanese, Asian, Pancakes and lots of small convenience type stores. To your left just on the corner is a great internet/phone store which charge 1GHP for ½ hour internet use and 1GBP for a 5 minute telephone call to Australia.	
Apr 24 2008	Highly recommend this hotel	This was a repeat visit to the hotel after initially staying on a friend's recommendation last autumn. The hotel is well placed for the various museums - the V&amp;A, the Natural History, the Science Museum. It is a short walk to Hyde Park, the Albert Hall and down to Harrods and a good 30 mins walk along to Oxford Street. The rooms are all being refurbished and are well presented with excellent bathroom facilities and flat screen TV's, tea/coffee trays and the quiet rooms at the back overlook some gardens and some small mews houses/Embassy buildings.We have stayed in a both a 'standard' room and an 'Executive King', and both were really good sizes. Breakfast is a serve-yourself buffet with the usual choices. We ate in one evening (25% discount for meals in the restaurant before 6.30pm) and it was an excellent 'as much as you want' carvery. £18.50 for two courses - before discount- and for London hotel prices, and the quality of the food - excellent value. However, there are many options for eating out just 4/5 minutes walking up to the underground station. I had been arranging a surprise honeymoon package for a relative before my own March stay with the Rembrandt - and the hotel's guests service manager has been tremendous. Nothing was too much trouble and the hotel even upgraded their room and provided complimentary wine on arrival.In my experience, sadly, it is becoming rarer and rarer to find an hotel that offers VFM, clean and good quality furniture and fittings, quiet rooms with good soundproofing and comfortable beds, and that has staff who are friendly and competent these days - and the Rembrandt offers all this.	
Apr 24 2008 	Linda Campbell Alabama USA	We traveled to London for a girl trip this month 04/08. We were very pleased with The Rembrandt..the breakfast was good and the staff friendly. We plan to stay at this hotel again in the future. The location is excellent. The area is very safe. The hotel was very helpful in helping us with directions. It is easy to find your way around London. Finding a place to eat around the hotel is not a problem. Check out all the pastries. We are looking forward to our next trip.	
Apr 11 2008 	Perfect location and nice hotel	I wanted to spend a few days in London before I came back to the States and got a great deal from British Airways. The hotel is in just a perfect location, just across from the V&amp;A and Museum of Natural History. The neighborhood is kinda upscale, but there were plenty of affordable restaurants, bistros, and cafes to choose from. The room was small, but this is London! Comfortable bed, quiet, plenty of space for my stuff. Breakfast was included and it was quite filling enough each day so that I could lighten up on lunch. Friendly staff, very helpful.	
Mar 30 2008 	Much better than expected	London hotel rooms are well known to be small and overpriced, but we were pleasantly surprised during our week long visit recently. The room was nicely sized with comfortable beds and pillows. Our room faced the rear courtyard and was very quiet. If traveling from the US, request a room with US outlets which means you won't require voltage adapters. The outlet is by the desk and there was a master switch behind the desk that needed to be turned on for the outlet to have power. It took the concierge a few minutes to figure out why the outlet had no power. Bring an ethernet cable if you want to use your computer in your room. Wireless access is available in the lounge only. Breakfast was very adequate and dining room staff was pleasant and helpful. The location was excellent if you want to see the museums and shop in Knightsbridge. The South Kensington tube station is a short walk away. We didn't find the wonderful array of cafes near Thurloe Square until our trip was almost over. Harrods is a 10 minute walk away, very convenient. The hotel has two lifts, fantastic shower and bathroom facilities which include a US outlet in the bathroom. The hairdryer was in the desk drawer. Room also had a mini fridge and electric tea pot with everything you need to brew a spot of tea in your room. I will stay here again when I return to London.	
Mar 24 2008 	Well placed for Museums	Stayed here for a long weekend when visiting London. Well placed for Nat. Hist. and Vic and Al Museums. The indoor poll is nice, but a bit pricey (you pay £16 extra per day) considering the Hotel was'nt cheap!	
Mar 23 2008 	Very Nice	The hotel is nice , located in knights bridge walking distance from harrods an upscale area , very freindly good breakfast and rooms are very small but adequate excellent Interaactive TV	
Mar 21 2008 	great hotel	Hotel reception very friendly and helpful, room was decent size and very clean. breakfast was great. Couldn't fault the hotel at all.location was good - approx 10 minute walk to harrods, 5 minutes from south kensington tube and a stones throw from the natural history museum. recommended.	
Jan 21 2008 	Good Value	We stayed from December 28th to January 3rd. British Airways had a hotel and airfare package, which was a terrific value. A full English breakfast is included. Our room was nicely decorated and clean. The towels were oversized with a nice quality. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The location was excellent with a short walk to So. Kensington tube on the Picadilly line so we had an easy commute from Heathrow. You can catch the Big Bus city tour right outside the hotel. And, if you are so inclined, the bartender makes a very dirty martini.	
Jan 20 2008 	Noisy tatty room but decent breakfast	We were expecting a kingsize bed and a fridge - but the room had a std double bed and no fridge. The hotel was vey busy, &amp; when we checked-in we heard another guest being told he could not have the grand room he had booked and he was offered a smaller room instead, so it suggests you may not get the room you have booked. The room was OK, but very noisy as it overlooked the main road, and the windows did not fit properly. The flush on the toilet frequently did not work - it had to be pumped up &amp; down. The room was small and the TV was fixed on the wall at the bottom of the bed. And, as there was only about 2ft between the bottom of the bed and the wall, the TV stuck out - with the result that I banged my head on the TV, when I got up in the night!The breakfast was very good - apart from the coffee, which was very stewed and weak- don't be fooled by the wonderful aroma of freshly roast coffee, as you walk into the dining room at breakfast-time.The hotel was very convenient for the V&amp;A, Science Museum etc - or for Harrods and the shops of Knightsbridge.	
Jan 5 2008 	Good hotel but shame about the food	I stayed at the Rembrandt for four nights last month. I was travelling on business and wanted to choose a hotel that was close to Kensington. In terms of the location of this hotel, it is excellent. You are close to Harrods, Kensington and Knightsbridge, and Victoria is only a short taxi ride or a couple of tube stops away. As such, I was perfectly located for business and could walk to all meetings. The room itself was on the small side, but it was perfectly comfortable. There was a good internet/communications package in the room, and it was decorated quite tastefully and had the usual features you would expect from a corporate hotel. While there was no &quot;wow&quot; factor about the place, it was perfectly fine. The aspect which lets this hotel down is the restaurant. While breakfasts were excellent, the restaurant only puts on basic pub grub at lunch and in the evening. This is expensive for what it is and should really be avoided. I arrived late on my first evening and did not want to venture out as it was nearly 10pm. Dinner was served until 10, but I was the only person in the dining room. The staff were surly and unhelpful as if by ordering close to finishing time I was giving them too much work....I ordered a simple pasta dish which came back cold, mushy and worse than I ever cooked as a student. One glass of wine took 15 minutes to arrive, and that too was tasteless and expensive. Suffice it to say that I never went back to the restaurant, and nor did anyone else by the look of the place on subsequent nights. Would I return to this hotel? Possibly, but only if I needed to be around Kensington and everywhere else was full.....	
Jan 4 2008 	Deceptive Website	When booking with this Hotel, do not expect to get what you see on their website. The room we were expecting was a spacious room with modern luxuries, the room we got was barely big enough for the bed.The bathroom was also rather dated and not particularly clean, especially around the taps.We were also the only English people in the Hotel (including staff), which can lead to misunderstandings. Such as prices.We were told repeatedly by Hotel staff that car parking would cost us £27 for 24 hours, instead it was £37 for 24 hours. Also, if you want a hot breakfast, you will have to pay an extra £5 per head.The location of the hotel is ok though (near South Kensington Tube) and the Bar in the hotel looks nice.Overal, this hotel was a bit disappointing and not worth it's price-tag, unless you can get a room last minute for about £40.	
Jan 3 2008 	Wonderful hotel	Enjoyed an excellent stay in The Rembrandt between Christmas and New Year. Hotel was first class. Absolutely no complaints. Well appointed, spacious bedrooms, friendly, helpful staff and splendid breakfasts. The location is ideal being less than 5 minutes walk to South Kensington Underground Station and the same distance from Harrods and surrounding shops. If you're looking for a top class hotel in London look no further.	
Dec 30 2007 	Lovely Hotel for under 100 GBP	The Rembrandt, Knightsbridge, a Savora Hotel, was recommended to me by a colleague for a centrally located hotel for a reasonable price, not that many of those exist in London if you are American and the dollar is in the toilet. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Kensington Station and about 5-10 minutes from Harrod's on the same major roadway. The hotel web site says they've undergone renovations recently; the lobby, hallways and rooms were very elegant, contemporary and clean. I booked a single room bed (twin bed) since I was traveling solo on business; the room was still very large with a big desk, flat screen TV, internet access, armoire for clothes, large bath and tub. Tough to find hairdryer in desk drawer but finally did. Also hard to find the safety switch on the clothes iron but did. Very comfortable bed and bed linens. It did seem like a high price in terms of U.S. dollars at almost $200, but this is London, and the dollar is crap. If I go to London again for business, I would definitely stay here. Great front desk and bell stand service too. The taxi driver recommended going over to the green building in the middle of the road in front of the hotel and ordering a bacon sandwhich. I never got the chance, but the little green sandwich shop (TO GO orders only) looked fun.	
Dec 15 2007 	Fabulous Value	Stayed for 7 nights in October '07. Room was European small but well laid out and efficient. Newly decorated and immaculate. Good bed and linens. Buffet meals were very good. Room service was great and on time. Bar was inviting and friendly. Concierge was over the top helpful. Location close to Harrod's and walk-to Chelsea shopping. Also very close to So Kens Tube. Bus stop and taxi ranks immediately outside. Excellent value.	
Dec 4 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location	I booked this hotel as a package through british airways along with my flight and got a very reasonable price for it. We travelled on the gatwick express to Victoria Station which is a 5 minute taxi or tube ride from the hotel - great way to beat the traffic! On arrival at the hotel we were checked in very quickly. Allocated a room on the second floor. Room was clean and new looking (must be one of the upgraded ones) plasma tv, jacuzzi bath and plenty of room for two woman with lots of shopping and two suitcases. Safe easy to work. Room view was disappointing but isn't high on my priorities list, it was very quiet and didn't feel like you were sleeping in the middle of a city! Didn't use minibar but well stocked. Breakfast is served in a gorgeous room, plently to eat and well stocked, it's a buffett so you can have as much or as little as you like. Staff are helpful. My advise is to buy a daily railcard for the tube and walk to south kensington tube station (two minutesto the right of the hotel on leaving) which has trains running on 3 main lines. Only £5 a day and you can pretty much travel anywhere. Harrods is very close (you can see if from the hotel) along with many of the museums. At the back of the hotel you can walk to sloane street and lots of independent chelsea shops - worth a browse! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay again.	
Nov 19 2007 	One more noteworthy hotel in London	Spacious and clean room. Furniture and decor not very new. Stuff tried to be helpfull, but not always could manage to do it.Breakfast was nothing special, but enough to fill full.Great location, between South Kensington and Knightsbridge tube stations. Traditional pab and chinese restaurant near the hotel.Sure, 170 GBP (340 USD) per night is very expensice, but it's London...	
Nov 9 2007	Loved the hotel	Okay after reading the other reviews I wonder if I was in the same hotel!! I loved the Rembrandt... My room was brand new and wonderful. I had a huge room, whirlpool tub and was on the 6th floor. I really think all the rooms on the 6th floor are renovated so maybe ask for one of the rooms on that floor.I was in room #674. I found the front desk to be very nice and helpful and always spoke to us. But I am always nice to everyone and maybe they sense that , After England we went to Italy and I had the same good luck with all the rooms I checked into.The breakfast at the Rembrandt was great I thought, I did not not try the dining room in the evening but I can tell you there is a great Italian place right next door. Don't miss it.Rembrandt is in a great location to everything, Tube is 1 block away. I love the tube so east to travel everywhere. Be sure and get a oyster card just put 20 pounds on it that should be enough for 5 t0 7days.Please see my other reviews of my trip to hotels in Italy Hotel Minerva in Florence, Grand Hotel Continental in Siena and Hotel Metropole in Venice. If you want to ask any questions please e-mail me at donatravel@aol.com	
Nov 3 2007 	Average hotel--high price	This hotel was in a great location, but the carpet was tattered, bed linens were a bit scary and staff kept giving me conflicting information. I was there for 3 nights in an old room with very little natural light. The breakfast was nice and the dining area was obviously updated a couple of decades after my room. On the plus side, it was in a good neighborhood and I felt comfortable walking around by myself at night. The front desk personnel would tell me one thing and the consierge would tell me the opposite, so they were not very helpful. For the price I expected much better. I would probably check around for another hotel on my next stay in London.	
Oct 29 2007 	Great Location Fawlty Towers uncaring staff - over priced Room 453	Stayed here for two nights during a business trip in room 453. Room ok - tattered carpeting, beat up woodwork and frayed bathrobe aside, once I called the general manager's office (after three calls with no response to hotel front desk) to get the TV and in room safe fixed. Also front desk gave me a key that never worked in the first place. Request to have contents removed from mini bar was never responded to. Towels were brand new (never washed) so ended up covered with white lint for two days - thankfully my business associates had a sense of humor. Meals - buffet breakfast competent, but lounge area meals were dull and service was appalling. Eastern European waiter's reply was a Soviet-surly &quot;I have no idea&quot; regarding availability of wines, cider and how the fish and chips dish was. The bar man stood in plain view of guests picking his nose and his teeth - GROSS. Requests for towels that had been washed and extra toilet paper were met with rolls placed on bathroom counter (I had to install them myself, and towels placed on side of tub, with dirty towels on floor left there in place. Only bright spot were concierge team members who were harried but at least helpful regarding maps, directions, etc.To sum it up - even the location cannot overcome sullen, uncaring staff to justify the prices. Stay over at the Thistle Charring Cross instead and take the bus/tube where you are going (three tube lines underneath).F&amp;B - the Moti Mahal has good and reasonable Indian a few blocks away toward the South Kensington Tube Stop on Glendowner Place. Great Lamb Bhuna, rice, poppa dums and a lager for under 20 pounds for dinner.	
Oct 23 2007 	mini bar police	Wonderful location,staff very unhelpful,we left a deposit of fifty pounds at check in during the following day we were summoned to reception to be told we had over exceeded that limit so we paid the outstanding amount only to find the mini bar police arriving at our door to take out the minibar.The whole experiance of a weekend away with my wife(first time in god knows how many years)was completly ruined thanks to the stupid person that thinks procedure is correct and treats paying customers like potential thiefs.Great hotel pathetic staff.	
Oct 6 2007 	Practically perfect ...	Having stayed in many different hotels in Central London over the past decade or so, unless there are strong reasons to do otherwise, the Kensington area is always my place of choice from which to use as my base. With this in mind &amp; having looked at everything on offer, The Rembrandt looked a good option at £120 mid-week using a friend's discount &amp; it turned out to be an excellent choice.The location is perfect. Sure, some may prefer to stay right within the bustle of Piccadily &amp; it's immediate vicinity but you just know room sizes and rates wont make it worthwhile so for somewhere that's just a few tube stops away but has plenty of top-class amenities I think the Rembrandt is superb. It's directly across from the V&amp;A Museum which means its a 2 minute walk to the Natural History &amp; Science Museums, 5 minutes to Harrods &amp; 10 minutes to the Royal Albert Hall &amp; Hyde Park. The second you step out of the lobby you can see 3 of the above-mentioned landmarks depending on whether you look left, straigh-ahead or right.The public areas are clean, tasteful &amp; classy, nothing huge but perfectly sized to enjoy a quiet drink or meal &amp; the check-in desk was pleasant &amp; adequately staffed. Our rate included Continental Breakfast although several of us took Full English as there didn't seem to be any policy to differentiate between the two, in all honesty I wish I hadn't bothered as it was probably the only negative of our stay - the food was below average, I've had much nicer in Holiday Inn's, Jury's, etc this year in London. The pastries, juices, etc that would be classed as Continental were fine however - should have stuck to what we'd paid for !Our party contained six people staying in three rooms and of these one room was compact but modern, comfortable &amp; very well equipped, another of the same style &amp; decor but quite a bit more spacey &amp; one &quot;older&quot; room that was easily the best of the three. When asked if the hotel had any more rooms of this style available I was told it was due for refurbishment and classed as a standard room. It's a good sign of any hotel when a room is due for a refurb when it really doesn't need it. It was easily the nicest and largest &quot;standard&quot; hotel room I've seen in Central London, in fact far nicer than any of the times I've stayed in upgraded rooms.All 3 rooms had very new Samsung flat-panel tv's with a full selection of Sky TV channels (including Sports !), superb bathrooms with high-quality fittings &amp; everything else you could ask for. One room had a great view overlooking the V&amp;A Museum whilst the largest room overlooked a scene straight ouf ot &quot;Mary Poppins or Peter Pan&quot;. Very niceTo summarise, the Rembrandt will be the first place I will look for future stays in London. It goes without saying that the price of a night's stay is paramount to any decision when it come to hotel choice but I'd happily pay approx £20/£30 per night more to stay here than many of the other chain hotels nearby.	
Oct 2 2007 	Great Hotel	Check in and out very swift. Very spacious and modern room - very airy and light with 3 windows. The bed was very comfortable and the large flat screen TV, whirlpool bath and heated towel rails were 'nice' touches. The room facilities were excellent overall, although I did find the aircon a little noisy, but not enough to bother to work out how to switch it off! Lots of choice for breakfast, which was tasty. The Hotel Bar had a real sense of ambience. All in all, a great hotel - would definitely stay again.	
Sep 29 2007 	A great hotel and an even greater location	Do not let the negative reviews scare you away. Unless your expecting a five star hotel, this hotel is wonderful. It's not the Ritz but it's not a Motel6 either. First , my background. We are a midwest working class couple in our early 40's. No kids, first time in London. The location of this hotel cannot be beat. We stayed here for 12 nights. Flying into Heathrow you take the tube( Piccadilly line ) to the South Kensington stop, walk 5 minutes and your there.It is a direct train with no changes. It takes about 45 minutes to get from the airport to the hotel. Simple and very, very convenient! The only problem we had was we booked the airfare and hotel thru British Airways about 3 months before we left home and requested a early check in. When we arrived at the hotel around 10am they told us they had no room available yet. Fortunately there is so much to see in this area. We headed RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET to the Victoria and Albert museum. This place is great and we spent our time there until a room became available. Also across the street is the Natural History museum, the Science museum and a great old Catholic church called the Brompton Oratory. About 5 blocks behind the museums are Hyde Park, the Albert memorial, Kensington Palace and Albert Hall. The neighborhood is great. Safe and close to Harrods and tons of restaurants and pubs, We even walked to the Hard Rock Cafe from the hotel which is about 1 easy mile away. We had a UN-REFURBISHED room at the hotel. Well the room was perfect. It was warm and inviting. It had two twin beds pushed together which made it like a king bed. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were perfect.The sheets were crisp and clean. In fact sometimes I didn't even want to get out of bed in the morning. The room was not cramped whatsoever and it even had doors that opened to a balcony that overlooked the museums across the street. The a/c was a digital thermostat and worked great everyday. The room also included a hair dryer,a 27 inch flat screen television, coffee and tea,an in room safe and even a pants press. It didn't have a mini fridge which would of been nice. The were plenty of drawers for clothes. The bathroom had plenty of counter space and upscale toiletries. The shower was very powerful, even better then my home shower. The shower/tub did have a straight curtain rod instead of the newer curved ones to keep the curtain off of you. Breakfast was included everyday in their restaurant from 7am until 10am. It was a full buffet breakfast which just some of the items were eggs ( two different ways ) two kinds of sausage, ham, assorted cereals, juices, toast, etc. It kept us full most of the day and saved us money. We didn't try the bar or restaurant since there are so many choices in this neighborhood to choose from. They also have a pool in their lower floor but it cost's an extra 7 1/2 pounds a day, plus who goes swimming in London? The staff was friendly and helpful and our room was kept spotless everyday. What we want in a hotel is a clean room with a comfortable bed. We got it here and even more. If you looking for the same with a great location to explore London from, then this is it. If you are looking for door greeters, bellhops, room service, spas to be pampered and like to nit pick then the Ritz might be better for you. Hope this info helps you decide if this place is for you.	
Sep 25 2007 	Loved this location	We stayed at this hotel three times over 5 weeks as we came and went from London as a base. We found this hotel to be in an excellent location, easy to get to from Heathrow as you just stay on the Picadilly line and don't need to change and as this was our first time in London it made things easier. Just have to lug suitcases up stairs though at the South Kensington Station. Rembrandt is very close to the station, a mere five minute walk. Also close to many wonderful museums, the lovely Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Close to lovely restaurants and a lovely old pub called The Bunch of Grapes where we had a couple of great nights.The beds were comfy, nice fresh linen and towels. We had an executive room, I saw the superior rooms which were quite small which would be ok for one night but for longer as we had 7 days, then 3 days and then 4 days I am glad we had the larger room. We also had one of the refurbished rooms, I believe you have to request one of these, the refurbishment of the hotel is not complete.Breakfast was nice enough,plenty of choices. The area of Knightsbridge and South Kensington is really nice,many beautiful buildings. I would recommend this hotel very highly.	
Sep 23 2007 	wonderful location	We couldnt have wished for a better location , room very average but bed comfortable enough, breakfast very nice but little things like table clothes wouldnt go a miss! On the whole would recommend for its location alone , walking in kensington gardens after breakfast was wonderful.	
Sep 9 2007 	Loved The Rembrandt	We have a 10 yr old and like to stay in kid-friendly hotels. This hotel not only has exellent location but has very friendly staff. We arrived about 6 hours before the check-in time. They found us a room and put our luggage in there and then when our assigned room was avaialble they moved the luggage. This hotel is probably has one of the most convenient locations for a tourist. This hotel is close to the tube station, bus-stop that can take right away to the theater district and on and on...... We had the option of free breakfast and free dinner at the hotel. Short walk to Harrods is nice. Overall a great experience!!!!!	
Aug 26 2007 	A great find	My husband and I typically prefer smaller hotels, but travelling with two teens(15 &amp; 18), we picked the Rembrandt for it's very competitive price, location and amenities. Location is wonderful. As others have mentioned, it is 5 minutes from the S. Kensington tube station, 8-10 minutes from the Albert memorial, Albert Hall, Science museum, Victoria and Albert museum and Harrods(although why anyone would want to battle the Harrods' crowds I can't imagine!). In front of the hotel are bus stops for buses that can take you anywhere in central London. You can also pick up one of the &quot;Big Bus&quot; open-top buses that provide narrated tours around the city. We stayed at the Rembrandt for 6 days. We enjoyed it thoroughly. We had one executive double room and one standard. Both were clean, comfortable and attractively arrranged. The bathrooms were modern, with upscale fixtures. The executive was larger and more luxurious. Both rooms were air conditioned adequately (remember this is Europe, a/c is rarely like the states). The hotel staff was polite and helpful. Service was consistent with a three-star hotel. A malfunctioning a/c was fixed while we were out one day. A broken door lock proved a little more of a challenge, but was eventually resolved. The desk staff were happy to be able to accomodate our early check-in request. In answer to those reviewers who complained about small shabby rooms, we noticed that there is rennovation going on in the hotel, so I would reccommend requesting a recently updated room. Also, make sure breakfast is included in your rate, we paid for the breakfast buffet the morning we arrived and it was well over $100 for 4 of us!! Breakfast buffet was fine although hot food was quite greasy and overcooked. We would definately return to the Rembrandt.	
Jul 18 2007 	Good but could improve	Stayed for 4 nights with wife, 2 yr old and another couple for sightseeing and visiting in London. First the bad - the hotel is right in downtown London but not really close to sights - a long 5 blocks to Harrods, or 4 blocks to a tube station with a toddler in a stroller - not that easy. We took taxis everywhere which worked fine for us and there are always some going by the front door. Our room was in the front of the hotel - the old origional part of the hotel and had a very squeaky floor under the carpets which was very annoying and a hassle trying to walk lightly enough to not wake up our little one. Our companions had a room in the rear of the hotel - newer part of hotel that had no such problem. No internet connection or wireless in our room but they do have two computer stations in the lobby with internet access that worked very well. Now the good - service from all the personnel was excellent and all were very friendly and eagar to help. The included breakast buffet was very nice but ends a 10:00am a little early for us, but OK. The rooms were clean and functional and the baths were very nice. Overall a pretty good value in downtown London and we would recommend.	
Jul 8 2007 	Favorite London Hotel	Given a choice and enough advance notice, this is my favorite place to stay in London on business and even when I am in town to sightsee. It is close to Harrods, a huge plus in my mind. It also has a great health club located in the hotel that lets me keep up my daily routine of exercise, including swimming and a great spa area to end the day in.The rooms aren't exceptional, but they are highly functional and the beds are great. This is one hotel I never have a hard time falling asleep in.There is only one restaurant here, but given that it is in Knightsbridge, that hardly matters, there are many great ones within a half mile of walking.	
Jul 5 2007 	Smallest room we have ever stayed in	The staff provided no assistance and were very offhanded.We were not given the type of room we were guaranteed even though I personally visited the hotel 2 weeks before to confirm our reservation.Four times the check in staff provided wrong advice and we were put in the smallest room that we have ever stayed in-anywhere.Definitely not 4 star.Would not stay there again.	
Jun 30 2007 	Anadequate Knightsbridge hotel!	Our stay was quite comfortable and we enjoyed the large spacious ' deluxe room' with bathroom. The hotel is well located within walking distance of Harrods and the Underground. It is surrounded by many good restaurants of all price ranges.Hotel service is best described as off hand for a hotel of this professed standard and assistance on the sidewalk on arrival and with baggage is missing. There is no doorman.Breakfast is institutional and disappointing. Better value is available outside the hotel.Decor and ambience is aged and some new colours and modernisation would be appropriate to lift what could be a fine property.	
Jun 24 2007 	Not a 4star!	We have just returned from our stay at the Rembrandt and have to say that I was vey disappointed.The reviews on Tripadvisor gave me the impression this would be a great place to take my girlfriend for her birthday. What we did discover was a very basic hotel, our room was very basic and in desperate need of decoration. The bathroon was even worse, looking like it was last re-fitted in the late 70's!To add insult to injury we booked a queen room and ended up with a twin!Location is great, yes. The Victoria and Albert museum is just across the road and the Royal Albert Hall a short taxi ride away.Not worth £150 a night, more like £70,	
Jun 21 2007	Perfect location	An earlier reviewer mentioned his shabby room and questioned if other rooms had been renovated. I believe indeed they had. My wife and I stayed at the Rembrandt for three nights and booked an &quot;Executive&quot; room. After a long oversees flight, we were assigned to a first floor room, which was very cramped, dark, and dingy . Worst of all, it was a smoking room and smelled the part. We then requested another room and you'd think we stepped into another hotel. The new room on the 4th floor was was absolutely beautiful and spacious. In fact, another room on our floor was being renovated during our stay (not noisy). SO YES! Make sure you get a renovated room. Once we were settled, we loved this hotel. Very good staff. Excellent health club facility. Clean. Great breakfast buffet each morning. Guests include a lot of business travelers.But best of all, I think, is the location. Situated in a very nice ,leafy part of London, it's close to beautiful parks, shopping (Harrods!) , museums, and the tube for convenient travel anywhere in London. We will definitely stay at the Rembrandt next time in London.	
Jun 17 2007 	A nice surprise	The Rembrandt turned out to be a nice surprise. Had some concerns initially but a very good experience. Very close to S Kensington Tube Station. Oyster Card easy to purchase and useHotel staff all helpful, though not terribly knowledgable. They get high marks for good attitude. The room was comfortable and clean...with safe and minibar. Good breakfast buffet..something for everyone. Several restaurant choices nearby...but Racine (french) an excellent choice.	
Jun 17 2007 	Slightly disappointing	In 2000 I stayed at this hotel and, at the time, it was fabulous. It was well maintained; the breakfast buffet was excellent; and the overall appearance of the hotel was impressive. I was slightly disappointed when I arrived there with three colleagues and found that, although the lobby had been remodeled and there was free internet service there, things just weren't the same. Upon my arrival, I was placed in a first-floor room with no air conditioning. (I asked to be moved to a higher floor the next day.) The decor hadn't changed since the early 1990s, I think. I was looking forward to the breakfast buffet and found only a skimpy, low-quality assortment of English breakfast standards. The rooms were clean. But the linens and the furniture are in need of an update. I'm assuming that the hotel chain just bank s on the fact that the hotel is in a prime spot in Knightsbridge (across from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum).	
Jun 5 2007 	grim	Did we stay in a different hotel... the name and address are the same so perhaps not, but I cannot believe the good reviews. We stayed one night in April, the room and bathroom was so dated, shabby, grubby, dingy and depressing that we asked to be moved before we unpacked. The dirty window overlooked a dank shaft containing various plant/pipes/cigarette butts etc. We were willing to pay more to change rooms but none were available and it was too late to arrange another hotel. I felt robbed and had to complain but nothing could be done. I have stayed in four London hotels so far this year and this is the only one I am dissatisfied with.I imagine - from reading other reviews - some of the hotel rooms must have been refurbished, so my advice is if you do choose to stay here, you must check you will have an updated room. Or check in early enough to check out again before you have to sleep there.	
Jun 2 2007 	Pleasant convenient reasonable--what else can you want?	We stayed five nights at the Rembrandt and we were well pleased with every element of our stay. Although not large (it's London, after all), the room was well arranged and had everything clean, comfortable, and in working order. (Hair dryer is in a desk drawer, but luckily I found it before I needed to use it.) The staff were all pleasant and helpful. We did not find one who could not speak English and understand our Southern American accents. The concierge was especially capable.The full English breakfast was quite good. We ate one dinner in the restaurant and enjoyed that, too. Like most English food, and also like food from a buffet, none of it is amazing, but it met our expectations.Location can't be beat. Taxis are plentiful, perhaps because a cute little green house in the middle of the street directly in front of the hotel serves as a tea-and-snack stand for taxi drivers.We want to stay at the Rembrandt again. Just hope all these nice reviews won't cause them to push up the prices!	
Jun 2 2007 	The Rembrandt superb location at Thurloe Place beside Brompton Road	We stayed here for 3 nights in June. £145 per night for 2 people with breakfast.The location is perfect, it is right across the road from the front of the V&amp;A Musuem and only 5 mins walk from South Kensington Tube Station. The Brompton Road is 1 minute away, Harrods is 10 mins very pleasant stroll and Hyde Park is about 15 mins lovely walk. Our trip included a concert at Royal Albert Hall, and this hotel is a very pleasant 15 minutes also.Check in was easy, friendly and efficient. We had requested a room on a high floor (there are 5 floors), we got a room on the second floor, but as it turned out it was perfect so we were not disappointed that our request was not met. However I do think that on check in we should have been given a reason why it was not met. The foyer is stylish and welcoming.We had room 267 - perfect for a great nights sleep as it overlooks a private mews with no through traffic. Two full length french doors overlook this mews and allow access onto a narrow balcony (which we only found out about on our last day!) I slept like a baby. The room is a nice size, has everything you will need for a pleasant stay. The Bathroom in this room, while well appointed (including Jacuzzi bath) and spotlessly clean is small but perfectly adequate. The mini bar was annoying from the point of view that we never purchase from a mini bar and there was no room for our shop bought bottled water which we needed in the warm weather. The hotel should provide some space in their mini bar for this. In fact a mini bar should be an option for residents.Breakfast in the Masters restaurant was very well presented. My travelling partner was not impressed but I tucked into the generous helpings of fruit, juices, hot food, pastries etc. It is self service, so there is a lot of to'ing and fro'ing. The tea came in a pot while the coffee came by the cup which meant you had to keep beckoning the waiting staff for refills, that was annoying for someone who likes at least two cups in the morning. I would suggest the hotel also serve the coffee in individual pots.We dined one night in the Conservatory Lounge bar which is spacious and very comfortable. The staff there were attentive. Two mains and 4 beers cost £46 including tip. The food was very pleasant and I would recommend it.One slight disappointment was the leisure centre (Aquilla Health club) which was charging £7.50 for a swim. This is described by the hotel as a nominal fee. Not so. The pool is not designed for lane swimming, so I went to the nearby Chelsea Leisure Centre where a proper swim cost me £3.30. Checkout was as efficient as Check in but there was a mini bar charge which I asked them to remove and they did so without question. We did not use the mini bar, or so we thought until we had a think about it later on and realised that in fact we might well have, but that's another story altogether.The Rembrandt comes well recommended if it is in your price range. I would definitely return.	
May 29 2007 	Very nice hotel in a great location.	We booked this hotel as it is walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall. With mixed reviews from previous visitors we really didn't know what to expect. I must say I was very impressed with this place!! The desk staff were particulary attentive and nothing was to much trouble, the rooms were large and clean and the breakfast was more than adequate. Saying that we had it included and would not have been happy to pay £17 on top.All in all a good hotel in a good location, clean &amp; friendly.	
May 4 2007 	Great choice!	My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Rembrandt and thouroughly enjoyed it. The location was fantastic. The underground was across the street and the restaurants were excellent. The hotel was clean and the room was exactly what we had asked for. The staff dealt with any problems immediately and the concierge was very helpful. The breakfast was good, but the wait staff were not very friendly or helpful. Otherwise, a good experience and would definitely stay there again.	
May 3 2007 	You won't be disappointed at the Rembrandt	We spent one full week here. and because of a nightmare 2 day flight from CA, we checked in at 2:00 am with no problems at all. My sister and I chose this hotel because of it's wonderful location; directly across from the V&amp;A museum; a stone's throw to Harrod's food halls; many choices for casual restaurants and pubs a block or two away; and a lovely 5 minute stroll on tree lined streets to the tube (which sits in the middle of one might think is a small village with grocery, drug, and boutique stores). Rooms were perfectly fine for a European room, clean, nicely furnished, super clean baths with tub and showers. Front desk and concierge especially helpful when Eurostar cancelled all travel for 24 hours to Paris. The concierge spent at least one hour on two different telephones trying to find us a flight out - unbelievable! They couldn't have been more accommodating. The breakfast room was unlike any I had been in before - not some dark corner room, but a sun filled large dining room with plenty of tables, no waiting ever, serving a large buffet of hot and cold items with table service for beverages. The lounge was quite large, with a full bar serving light fare or anything from the dinner menu. It also had a woodburning fireplace with comfy sofas and chairs. All of these amenities came at a price that I would have expected to pay almost double for. You won't be disappointed in London with this hotel.	
Apr 17 2007 	Very good hotel. Superb location.	We stayed for one night only. The hotel is situated right opposite the V &amp; A museum and very close to the Science Museums, Harrods and the Albert Hall. Very friendly staff, quick check-in and out and nice clean bedroom. Double room was on the fourth floor with views over the rooftops of London, interesting but not to everybody's taste (see photo).Reasonably priced (£125) which included full English breakfast for both of us. Drinks are not cheap, typical London prices. You can park under the hotel, with £10 off for staying there (Congestion charge applies).We had a very pleasant stay, and I recommend this hotel most highly.	
Apr 10 2007 	Average hotel great location	We spent two nights at the Rembrandt at the beginning of April. We had booked a 'superior' room, but the room was smaller than expected. However, it was clean and everything worked including the jacuzzi bath. It was around the corner from the lift and although this concerned me we were not disturbed by any noise from it.The breakfast room is lovely and bright. The hot and cold breakfast selection is good but a number of items were not 'fresh' e.g. the fruit selection included tinned pears, plums as well as the usual grapefruit. Juices were all from concentrates and even some of the breads seemed to be of the 'long life' variety. Only the sliced melon was actually fresh apart from a bowl of apples.Service in the hotel was friendly and efficient. It is really the hotel's location that makes it worth returning to. It is across the road from the V&amp;A museum, convenient to the South Kensington tube station, a few blocks from Harrods and surrounded by nice coffee shops and interesting looking pubs.	
Apr 6 2007 	Great location Good not perfect hotel	We were at The Rembrandt for five nights in late March. I booked this hotel based mostly on location, but splurged for the &quot;double executive&quot; room. We arrived at the hotel at 9:30 am after a redeye, planning on stowing luggage until check-in. But the desk clerk called housekeeping and they readied our room in about 25 minutes while we decompressed in the lounge. The room was lovely, tho' the view out the window was the drab air and light shaft down the middle of the building. That wasn't a big deal--the room was probably quieter as a result. Huge, comfy bed with nice linens and comforter. Separate seating area with sofa, two chairs and writing desk. Credenza dividing the two areas, with TV on a lazy susan (with limited channels and pay movies). Hot pot and teas, and a small (not stocked) refrigerator in the credenza. Large, clean bath has jetted tub with a good-pressure, wall-mounted shower head. Full range of toiletries provided. Housekeeping was attentive on weekdays. We noticed the weekend staff didn't seem as meticulous. Not much noise through the walls or ceiling. Our biggest complaint regards noise from the hall. Voices carry. The doors are on automatic closers, and when they bang shut the noise is loud! At all hours, the banging doors were jarring and even woke us up. It's my biggest reservation about recommending this hotel.The breakfast buffet did have a decent selection for both the continental and English options, tho there was no variation day to day. Find a booking site that includes breakfast. Many don't, and you won't want to spend 14.95 Continental or 17.95 English--that's pounds sterling--for this buffet. The breakfast staff was basically efficient, but at busy times getting a pot of tea was difficult, and one morning never arrived. The lounge is very attractive, but the smoking and non-smoking areas are separate in name only. The haze and odor drift throughout.The front desk clerks and concierges were always friendly and helpful. The 14 bus out front goes straight through Picadilly and near Leicester Square. The Victoria &amp; Albert across the street is free, so when the spouse needs a nap but you don't, pop in there for an hour or so. Definitely get an Oyster card for travel. Our 7 day pass cost about 23(?) pounds each, and covered buses, Tube and the Docklands light rail, plus a third off a Thames boat trip.	
Apr 2 2007 	Very nice hotel!	My family and I stayed in the Rembrandt for 9 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. We booked three rooms and the staff was able to get all the rooms near each other so I didn't have to worry too much about the kids. The location of the hotel is great. It is a short walk away from the South Kensington underground station and three different buses lines stop almost in front of the hotel doors. Harrods is right down the street and there are many small local shops nearby. A short walk from the hotel (in the direction of Harrods) is a very nice pastry shop with wonderful pastries and tea for an evening snack.The staff was very nice and helpful, especially Celio and Pablo. They were able to give us directions to all the sights we visited and even made last minute dinner reservations at a local restaurant. Breakfast was nice and there was something for everyone, even my three kids. Usually my kids are picky eaters but they managed to eat a full breakfast from the choices on the buffet. My only complaint about the hotel is the pool. Yes, there is a charge to use the pool and we did use it three nights. But children cannot be in the pool after 7 pm on weeknights. We spent most of the day out in the city visiting the tourist sights and by the time we returned back to the hotel after having dinner it was usually past 6 pm and it wasn't worth spending all that money to use the pool for only 30-45 minutes. I did take the kids to the pool one night at 6:30 pm only because they were very good all day and really wanted to go swimming. They got to spend 30 minutes swimming and were very disappointed having to get out.All in all, if I were to ever go back to London, I would stay at the Rembrandt again. I feel that the hotel was worth the price and my family had a great time.	
Mar 31 2007 	great location big room good value	My husband and I stayed here 4 nights in late March 07 for vacation. The location is excellent--right across the street from Victoria and Albert museum, two minute walk from the South Kensington tube station (the underground is VERY easy to figure out and use, especially with an Oyster card), and on excellent bus routes. Pleasant walk to Harrod's, plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby, very safe, not overly busy neighborhood. Of course, we weren't visiting in high season. The room was large by European standards, clean, with a brand new and quite nice bathroom-excellent water pressure. Other rooms were being renovated in the hotel but we never heard construction--probably because we were out and about as much as possible! The A/C is loud if you turn it up (good for drowning out noise if you want to sleep in), but can be adjusted. The excellent breakfast buffet, with all kinds of hot and cold options, was included. Nice bar/lounge area where you can get a late drink in front of the fire, served with 'biscuits' (cookies). Staff was professional, but we didn't have much interaction with them. I would stay here again, and hope to next year with our 3 children. Connecting rooms are available. Never even looked at the spa and pool, but I'd go to Arizona for that sort of thing, not London. Got good rate through aboutrooms.com linked through tripadvisor.	
Mar 27 2007 	OK except for noisy aircon pay extra to use Spa and Internet	I booked this hotel for a one night stay prior to a course in London. I was drawn by the pool facility and the area. It was an OK enough stay but, like so many UK hotels, I thought it was little more than average and I was dissappointed that one had to pay extra to use the Spa and pool as well as the internet.The reader may wish to take note that I do not generally like hotels in the UK anyway, especially London hotels, but why should one not expect that bit more for the price you pay?I booked over the internet, by the hotel website, the day before but got to the hotel to find there was no record of my booking. The reception staff were efficient enough to find me a room anyway but I could not help think that this could have been disasterous at a very busy time of year. I did have my laptop with me with the relavent email proving my booking.The first room I was shown was quite spacious and very clean but it had a lovely view into the centre of the hotel and the workings of the hotel heating system (why do hotels do this or why do they charge the same for rooms with a poor view?). It was a bit dark but would have stood for one night. However, I could not find the socket to attach the cable for internet connection (no wireless internet connection here) and so I asked for a change of room. The second room, the one I settled on, had a lovely westerly view over the V and A and across the rooftops of Kensington. It was smaller but better appointed. It was also very clean. There was an impressive size safe big enough to take a laptop.I used room service to order a salad with tuna mayonaise. The sald was very freshly cut although did arrive without the dressing that was stated on the menu; I was a bit pushed for time so I did not pursue this. The person whom I ordered from did not understand what a bitter beer was; he only thought that the hotel had lager and Guiness. He did phone me back though to say they had Tetleys and was that OK!I though I would have more time than I did and so I would have used the pool. I was put off, however, at having to pay £7-50 (&quot;reduced rate for hotel guests for 24 hour access&quot;) for what would have been less than an hour's use. WHY ON EARTH should hotel customers have to pay extra for the pool? I was dissappointed not to be able to book a massage as the bookings were full; this is an experience that I have had elsewhere. Hotels advertise such facilities but pitch up and the bookings are full; what's the point?Internet access was by Mycloud and so I had to pay, again, for that. I think that The Rembrandt Hotel should catch up with other simular hotels in London and UK and offer complimentary wireless internet access in ALL rooms.Staff were friendly and helpful.The aircon was very noisy but I was very tired and so slept well (I should have taken notice of this from another review. It would have been very tryng for more than one or two nights.In summary, if The Rembrandt Hotel 1. Had complimentary wireless internet access2. Did not charge extra for the pool or Spa.3. Sorted out the noisy heating,it would be great, otherwise I doubt that I would stay there again.The area is lovely and better than the very centre of London.I was amused to see the Kazakhstan embassy next door but I did not see Borat hanging around!	
Mar 5 2007 	Fantastic value for area - No complaints.	A perfectly located 4 star hotel.ROOM: We booked a 'Grand Room' directly with the hotel for the weekend (Fri - Sun) for 2 adults, 1 child. Breakfast and access to Leisure centre was included in our rate. The room was quite spacious &amp; the bed enormous (so enormous that our 11 year old decided to get into our very comfy bed to sleep and still left loads of room for us... consequently the made up sofabed was returned to its sofa status. See pics) Room facilities included a standard tv (not plasma in this room, though I believe some have) with the usual selection of English speaking TV channels + some pay per view movies etc. There's a minibar, stocked at your request, so you can use it as a private fridge (very handy!, I DO hope they keep on this facility), tea/coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board, room safe and hairdryer. Decor was reasonable &amp; a nice note welcomed us with a selection of fresh fruit on our arrival.AIRCON: Bit noisy. You may need to mess around with it to make sure you're getting cold air and not warm as it's not clear from the dials which way to turn it!. We boiled initially, but worked it out in the end.BATHROOM: The bathroom was huge with a large frosted window giving lots of natural light. The spa bath looked fine, though we didn't actually switch it on as we used the leisure centre instead, and showered in room after. The shower is over the bath.. Supplies incude dental kit, shaving kit and Gilchrist and Soames toiletries. The floor was marble effect. It's all nice and clean. Plenty of towels, 2 bathrobes and slippers included. VIEW: The view was poor from our sleeping room (366) - The window in this room is smallish and the natural light was further reduced as we faced an interior square showing the rather drab back of buildings - when we go again, I'll be a bit more picky about which side of the hotel I'm on... the front of the hotel definitely gets lots of sun, but there's lots of traffic that side. However, in the scheme of things it didn't really matter.BREAKFAST: Fine... buffet selection of Full English Breakfast, stewed fruits/yoghurts, breads, continental style hams/cheese, juices, cereals, pastries. Tea/coffee. Tea wasn't great, but I think that's the London water, coffee I was told was good.STAFF: Excellent - no complaints at all. Helpful and pleasant. This is not a 'snobbish' hotel, and has a relaxing balance between formal and casual. You'll feel at ease.BAR AREA: Nice and comfy. Can't wait till they ban public area smoking in England though!. They do have non-smoking areas.LEISURE CENTRE: Good facility - Pool is smallish with 1.5m depth, so don't expect to do laps - but after a long day walking it's all very welcome, and there's a hot jacuzzi off the pool - Kids are most welcome with unlimited access time on Sat/Sun and up till 7pm in the week. Sauna and Steam rooms are in the changing rooms (not mixed sex). There's also a Gym, with the usual selection of machines, plus normal array of spa treatments on offer. Take a £1 coin with you for the lockers. LOCATION: This area is just the best in my view. Located where Thurloe Place meets Cromwell Gardens. Having lived in London for many years, I'd actually choose this area to live in if I return. Hotel is just PERFECTLY placed for visiting the museums (great for rainy day/kids...!)... simply cross the road to enter the V&amp;A Museum, &amp; when you've had your fill, go out the side door, straight over the road into the Natural History Museum and on from there it's a teeny walk into the Science Museum. 5 -8 mins sees you to Harrods, Armani and Hyde Park.... For your snack supply, there's a small M&amp;S and Sainsbury's on opposite sides of the road just before you hit Harrods. It's also not too far from the Kings Road either - easily walkable - we ate at the Big Easy on Kings Road, which has a live band and great crab shack style food, but whatever your tastes are there's a huge choice of restaurants at hand.TRANSPORT: Excellent. It's a 4 - 5 mins walk to South Kensington Tube Station from/to the hotel, which gives you access to the District, Circle and Piccadilly Lines. Whatever London airport you use (we came in from Stanstead this time) you can get to the hotel fairly simply. It's only a short direct tube trip to the West End (4 stops to Piccadilly Circus).EXTRA INFO: We did a great walking trip from hotel which I recommend on a nice day - Walk down to Harrods - do a bit of shopping - then continue on a short while until you see the Mandarin Oriental Hotel opposite, cross over to Hyde Park behind this hotel, and take a right through Hyde Park. When you get to the end of the park, you reach Wellington arch, buy an Ice-cream under the arch, and then cross the road continuing on to Buckingham Palace. Opposite the palace, follow the lake towards Horse Guards Parade through St James' Park (bring some monkey nuts with you for the squirrels - they'll take them out your hand, and bread for the birds), let the kids play in the small playground whilst you have a coffee from the stand. At Horse Guards, follow on left and round the corner to Trafalgar Square and finally up into Piccadilly Circus - get the tube back to hotel. There are so many points of interest to stop off at on this walk. Look it up on mapquest or multimap.* Small warning * When we arrived, there was fairly constant banging from the 4th floor (apparently they were putting in more spa baths) - which I was not informed of when booking - When I asked about the noise, they thought it was going to go on from 9am - 5pm over the whole weekend - but thank heavens it actually it didn't and only lasted until 5pm Friday! They did offer to move us to an 'Executive room' at reduced cost as they had no more Grands available - but when I went to see the room its size was a good bit smaller, so we decided to stay put. Whatever happened, we probably wouldn't be in for most of the 'building/banging' time anyway.I just love London... so much to see and do... can't wait to go back!!. My Favourite City.	
Mar 5 2007	Too expensive for Travel Lodge quality	My partner and I stayed at the Rembrandt Hotel on March 3rd for one night. To start with I am not one to complain but was thoroughly dissapointed with so many aspect of my stay. We checked in and went to our room, we opened the door and the room stunk of smoke...after requesting a non-smoking room, the room was a real dissapointment, it was no better than a Travel Lodge. We requested a spa bath when we booked which we did have in our room on arrival but one of the function knobs was broken and it didn't really work properly. Also, the radio in the bathroom did not work. The only good aspect about the room was the huge bed which was comfortable. After a dissapointing start, later that evening we wanted to use the pool, which was the main reason I chose that hotel, we found out that the use of the pool was not included in the price of our stay (£170.00) and it would cost £15 to use the pool for one day! That evening we went down to eat in the resturant to find that we were unable to due to a wedding reception being held in there. We were so angry that we had not been informed of this when booking or on arrival to the hotel. In the morning the brekfast was cold and not what you would expect from a suposed luxury hotel. This is just some of the many things that made our stay at the hotel an awful one. To top it all off the staff were rude and not helpful at all. I won't be recommending this hotel that's for sure!	
Mar 3 2007 	Perfect Location	We stayed for two nights at the Rembrandt - booking directly with them after shopping around in the internet.When we arrived at lunchtime, we were seen to immediately and asked if we would like a room at the front or the back. We chose a room at the front and this was immeditely across from the beautiful V and A Museum. The room (superior twin) was absolutely lovely and fnished to perfection. The bath was a jacuzzi bath which was very nice and also had a powerful shower if you preferred. It was very clean and modern with nothing out of place or in need of repair - unusual for most hotel rooms really.The hotel is approx 300 metres from Harrods and when you come out of the entrance on an evening, you can see it all lit up in its glory! It's also across the road from the Science and History Museums - faultless for its location. Used both the Sth Kensington and Knightsbridge Tube Stations.Really, it is what one expect from a 4 star hotel - the only meal we had was breakfast but there was lots to chose from - from cooked english to fresh fruit, muffins, pastries, cereals etc etc.Would definitely stay here again, there are some lovely restaurants and shops nearby - you could walk to most places. The Patisserie Valerie just between the hotel and Harrods is fab with amazing food and pastries and not expensive for a treat!! The hotel bar is also excellent if you want a glass of wine and a few nibbles before going out and again, pretty reasonable to say it is a hotel bar - same prices as a pub.All in all, very happy and pleasantly surprised by our stay at The Rembrandt.	
Mar 1 2007 	fine hotel	Stayed three nights Feb 2007 in one of the executive doubles. Room was spacious,clean and quiet (we had a room at the back of the hotel). Breakfast was a bit chaotic at times but the food was fine.All in all a decent four star hotel - in an excellent location.	
Feb 26 2007	watch the phone charges!!!!	We stayed for several days last summer. The property was fine, and the location great, but we were intensely dissatisfied with the service. On checking out, we found a charge of over 33 pounds (!) for a 13 minute call to a local mobile phone. The hotel manager told us that the card in our room warned us calls to mobiles might be very expensive, and would go no farther than to reduce the charge by half-- still around $30 for a short local call!! As it turned out, the card in the room said 1 pound is typical for a 3 minute local call, and said NOTHING about higher rates for calls to mobile phones.The moral: even in these days of nearly free phone calls, hotel calls can still be unbelievably expensive, and if you are staying at the Rembrandt, don't expect to be treated honestly or fairly about the charges!	
Feb 25 2007 	Loved the rembrandt	Stayed for five nights.booked through BA holidays for £88 GPB per night + continental breakfast.Very good hotel in excellent location! Bus stop right outside. Bus 74 to Marble Arch + baker street.Bus 14 to Picadilly circus and Charring cross road (very near to covent garden!) Night buses also.500 m from south kensington station (Picadilly line to Heathrow terminals) and also district and circle lines.Hotel staff very helpfulRooms very clean and spacious.Breakfast very good both continental and EnglishWhat else can we sayWill try and stay there again!Philip &amp; Irsa Cyprus	
Feb 24 2007 	Really Liked the Rembrandt	We just came back from a 5 night stay in London at the Rembrandt. We booked through BA and got a pretty good deal. We found the hotel to be excellent in most ways; Clean, comfortable, warm and modernized rooms. Efficient, helpful and friendly staffs at the front desk and for the cleaning . Within 5 minute walk to the South Kensington Tube station and the wonderful and some reasonable restaurants near there. Our stay came with a continental breakfast - which was upgraded to full English for free, although we didn't realize it was free until checkout. The food was uninspired, but since eating out in London is exorbitant, any meal for free was more than welcome. Our only complaint was with the restaurant staff, they were uniformly unhelpful and slow. We would stay at the Rembrandt again.	
Feb 20 2007	Exceeded expectations - June 16-18 2006	I had a wonderful stay at the Rembrandt Hotel on June 16-18. The two-night stay at the hotel was free with airfare on British Airways and so I didnt expect much, but was really pleasantly surprised. The hotel is located across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum in the stylish South Kensington/Knightsbridge area close to Harrods. It is convenient to two Tube stations  South Kensington and Knightsbridge. I only used the South Kensington station. For those arriving from Heathrow, the Piccadily line travels from Heathrow to the South Kensington station. Unfortunately, to exit the station, one must go up a flight of stairs to get to street level. There are very few Tube stations which are truly accessible, so as with the rest of Europe, its probably a good idea to pack light. The exits from the South Kensington station are a bit confusing as the streets around the station are not in a grid pattern. To get to the Underground exit closest to the hotel, go past the turnstiles and then head to the sign Subway to Museums. This subway (underpass) has limited hours  roughly open when the museums are open. The first exit from the subway is Brompton Rd. and this is the exit that is just a few steps away from the hotel. Other attractions close to the hotel include the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. I had emailed the hotel in advance, informing them that I was staying on my honeymoon and asked for a newer executive room. Upon check-in, I was told that the room was pre-paid and that I had been upgraded to a newer executive room. Breakfast was daily in the restaurant until 9:30am, except on Sundays when it was extended to 10:00am. One could use the Aquilla spa facilities next door to the hotel but there would be an additional charge. At one end of the check-in counter, there were apples every morning, which was great to take away as a nutritious snack. The concierge was helpful in providing me with a good map.Room 363 was in the newer wing and looked extremely new. It was facing the back street and was quiet with the windows closed. It was tiny, though, with a small double bed and just enough room to walk around it. When the bathroom door was open, there was practically no way to move around. The bathroom itself had Gilchrest and Soames conditioning shampoo and bath gel. There was only one bar of soap for the bathroom. There was one face cloth, two fluffy bath towels and two hand towels. There was a nice towel warmer which was activated by turning on the taps that resultedin hot water running through the rack. The countertops and flooring were made of granite. The tub was a Jacuzzi tub with strong jets. Inside the room, the television was the standard small European size. It had very limited channels and about four pay-per-view channels. It did have guest services features (such as checking ones bill) but the checkout feature was not working when I tried it. The television also had a convenient digital clock, and served also as an alarm. In the closet was an electronic safe, small ironing board, and iron. The desk, which had a small mirror, had the hairdryer (with excellent power) in the top drawer. Underneath the television were a mini-fridge (empty, with instructions to call the front desk to have it stocked if required) and an electric tea kettle with teabags and instant coffee. All drawers and cupboards were clearly marked with labels. The air conditioning worked extremely well. There was no ice machine as far as I could tell, although there was a tiny ice cube tray in the mini-fridge.There was a letter on the desk from the hotel management indicating that the hotel was undergoing some renovations and to expect some noise from 8:00am  6:00pm. The renovations include adding air conditioning to all rooms, changing CRT televisions to plasma televisions and adding video-on-demand, and adding wireless Internet to all areas of the hotel. These changes will undoubtedly make the hotel all that much better! Speaking of Internet, as the back of the hotel faces residential dwellings, I was able to find an unsecured Linksys and Belkin network with adequate signal to use the Internet from the room. WiFi access is currently available in the hotel lobby, but at a charge.The breakfast buffet can be either Continental or American. Continental (cold) items included hard-boiled eggs, two varieties of cold cuts, yogurt (fruit or plain), fresh fruits (whole apples, plums, oranges or sliced up oranges or grapefruits), some canned and dried fruits, cereals, pastries (croissants, mini-muffins, danishes, turnovers), toasted breads, and juices (apple, orange, or grapefruit). Hot items for the American breakfast included scrambled eggs, fried eggs, sausages, back bacon, beans, sautéed mushrooms, broiled tomatoes, and an odd deep-fried toast. The manager asked for our room number at the entrance and he crossed out our room number of a printed list in his hand each morning. There were about eight rooms with Continental breakfasts and about two pages of rooms with American breakfasts. In all honesty, there is no clear demarcation of what is considered Continental and what is considered American as all the items are more or less mixed together on the buffet line. As other reviewers have posted, the employees didnt explain what items were included in your breakfast and simply said to help yourself to the buffet. Check-out was smooth and there were no surprise charges. In summary, I really enjoyed my stay at the Rembrandt Hotel and would not hesitate to recommend this London hotel to others wishing to stay in the Kensington area.	
Feb 4 2007	Excellent quality hotel in a great location.	Great location. 5 mins walk from South Kensington tube station. Opposite the V&amp;A museum. 10 minutes walk to Harrods and the Royal Albert Hall. Plenty of buses.Lovely room. On the top floor at the rear of the hotel. Nice and quiet and full sun all day. Excellent air con and heating. Room was of a good size and the amenities and draperies were excellent. Some noise from late night revllers, but that's not unusual in any hotel.Staff.Didn't see much of them - as it should be. When we did see them they were courteopus, attentive and polite.Eating.Only had the breakfasts. These were excellent - a very large choice suitable for most tastes. The sausuages wer excellent.Recommendation.We only stayed 2 nights and wished we had stayed longer. Will definitely go back as it was excellent value for money in a quality hotel.	
Feb 1 2007	Loved the hotel!	We stayed at the Rembrandt for 2 nights in Dec 06. Loved the hotel! Location. The location cannot be beat. It is located right across from the Victoria-Alberts museum. The London tour bus stop is in a short walking distance. Harrods is a few blocks away. Next door to the hotel, there is an awesome sports club/spa that gives the hotel guests a discount. In a walking distance, there is a cool area with Creperie, japanese restaurant, chinese restaurant and a tea room. Rooms. Room was very large (for London standards) and well appointed (beatiful drapes and wallpaper, comfortable bed). Our room was facing the quiet back side of the building. Service.Service was great from bellman services to a concierge who helped us a great deal. Breakfast was deliscious and plentiful. There was a little glitch with the Internet connection. The hotel's server was down and the Internet was unavailable, so we couldn't do an online check-in for our international flight. We had to go to an Internet cafe nearby to do that. Overall, staying at the Rembrant was a delight and we highly recommend this hotel.	
Jan 24 2007 	A+ Location and Room	I stayed at the Rembrandt for 10 nights (January 12-22nd) and found my stay to be most enjoyable. The location is perfect--directly across the street from the V&amp;A and a short walk from Harrods and Harvey Nichols. The South Kensington and Knightsbridge tube stations are a short walk away and bus #14 (which will take you by Picadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and a few blocks from Trafalgar Square) stops virtually right outside the hotel. I had a double ensuite room and found the size to be perfect. Plenty of space to move around with places for my two suitcases. Great hairdryer. Lots of closet and drawer space. I think the bathroom must have been a refurbished one as the tub had all sorts of jets, which feel so good on tired and sore feet. There were two downsides to my room (#232)--it was right next to the stairwell, so I'd hear the doors slam every time someone used the stairs, and there was some sort of vent outside the window that was noisy at times. To be fair, I didn't ask them to change my room when I realized the situation as I was already comfortably ensconsced in my room. I'd stay here again but in a different room--perhaps on a higher floor as that would have solved both problems. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful whenever I had a query. The person who helped me with my luggage didn't even stay around long enough for me to give him a tip. The only part of the stay I wished had been better were the eggs. On the plus side the scrambled eggs weren't greasy, but on the downside they tasted as though they were powdered eggs. There was plenty of other food to choose from though. All in all, my favorite hotel of the 4 hotels I've stayed in when I've been to London.	
Jan 19 2007 	No Oil Painting	This is not a good hotel, not even up to 3 star. On arrival we, a couple, were allocated a smoking room with 2 single beds although we had specified double on booking and non-smoking. The re-allocated room was below Travelodge standard and in need of upgrade with broken bed frame and depressing colour scheme.We tried the bar meal and chose the steak. The wrong order was delivered and I had to send mine back as not cooked to request. The food was awful and service poor. the breakfast was also cold.We hastily re-arranged our 2nd night in london to stay elsehwre, it was that bad.	
Jan 17 2007	Really good value	Stayed one night whilst visiting London to see a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Could not have been more convenient (walking distance). But also very convenient for Tube (Circle Line for main-line connections, Piccadily for central areas) and for the V&amp;A and Museums; all a couple of minutes walk. And not forgetting Harrods of course, also walking distance.We found the staff to be extremely pleasant and helpful, and the room was very smart, refurbished and with a first-rate bathroom including jetted tub, and very comfortable bed.The rate we paid via Otel.com was £115 which included breakfast; for London this is very good value, and the breakfast quality was excellent.They were advertising a 'special' evening buffet at a discounted rate before 6.30pm (25% off) which was good value. On arrival at the restaurant we discovered that the buffet was not operating that evening. Not happy with that - but the meal they did provide was still good, and at the same price as the buffet - and also discounted before 6.30!Only complaint was the room was very warm, and the aircon system did not really want to cool it down, even on lowest cool setting.But overall, a very good hotel - we will definitely use again when visiting London.	
Jan 4 2007	As convenient as you would want in London	We stayed at the Rembrandt in 2004 for a week. The room was clean, serviced thoroughly, comfortable and had nice views. Staff were friendly and breakfast was superb. The real plus with this hotel is location. Close to Harrods, V&amp;A and museums and round the corner from a number of reswtaurants and the tube.We enjoyed our stay and will go back again.	
Jan 3 2007 	Unhelpful Staff	I stayed in the Rembrandt with my partner for 5 nights in December and was extremely disappointed with the attitude of the hotel staff. We arrived in the hotel at 12 midday and were told our room was not ready. We were asked to come back between 12.30 - 1pm. When we returned at 1pm our room was STILL not ready. The staff made no apologies nor did they offer us an alternative room to change in. This was fairly inconvenient for us as we were attending an event in North London which started at 3pm and we would have liked to check in our bags &amp; freshen up before we left. When we arrived back at the hotel at 7pm that evening we eventually got to check in to what was the smallest hotel room i have ever seen. It was literally smaller than a regular house bedroom. There was a small double bed pushed against the wall at one side so my partner &amp; I had to get in &amp; out of the same side of the bed. The bed was also right next to the door so we could reluctantly hear everyones comings &amp; goings. Our room was directly across the hall from the inventory room where the cleaning equipment &amp; vaccum cleaners were kept so we were woken up at the crack of dawn every morning by the extremely loud maids. Maybe it was just bad luck that we happened to be placed in the worst room in the hotel, but seriously, they need to stop placing two people in what is very obviously a single room. Anyway we tried not to let it bother us too much and had a lovely stay in London. Good points about the hotel are its location, down the street from Harrods &amp; some other great stores, a short walk from South Kensington tube station, the buffet breakfast is quite good and the bar area is very comfortable. The next time i travel to London i will not book the Rembrandt. Its a nice enough hotel but the staff really need some customer service training and also need to learn how to smile.	
Dec 2 2006 	Our London Base by Helen 	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Rembrandt for one night on Nov 29th 2006. This was our 3rd stay at this hotel. I was surprised to read reviews about unfriendly staff, as we found everyone to be very pleasant. I guess if you are nice to people, they are nice back! I have certainly seen some guests treating staff like something on the bottom of their shoe!We had a room on the 4th floor; I was hoping for an upgrade (we got one when we stayed in December 2004) but it was not to be. I'm surprised that the hotel still has smoking rooms, in light of the modern thinking &amp; bans. The only gripes I have about the room are the rather hard bed &amp; the fact that there wasn't much milk provided with the tea-making things. It was quite warm in the room, but the weather was unseasonably mild. Next time we will ask for a room away from the lifts, as we were disturbed by guests returning at unearthly hours! The room &amp; bathroom were spotlessly clean. We didn't use the lounge or bar, but I'm sure they would be well - kept. Full English breakfast was very good. Being picky, I would have preferred fresh mushrooms to tinned. Contrary to another review, I thought the fried eggs were spot on! There was also fried bread, which often gets missed out. The tea was very weak, but that was the first time we've had a problem. We didn't eat at any other time during our stay, but have previously had sandwiches in the lounge &amp; were very impressed, both with the presentation &amp; price. The evening meal in 2004 was good quality but very ordinary; that could be different now, of course.Everyone says this, but the Rembrandt's location is pretty hard to beat! I also think it's pretty good value for money - we paid £135 for the room. We are already planning our next trip to London for Spring 2007 &amp; will definitely return to this hotel.	
Dec 1 2006 	Eureka!	I travel to London once or twice a year and am always looking for just the right hotel: well-located for my interests and pleasantly comfortable without being overly expensive. I've finally found it! The Rembrandt is very close to the South Kensington Tube, in an area of nice shops and restaurants, and just across the street from one of my favorite museums--the Victoria and Albert. The staff was very courteous, the public areas are quite nice, and the dining room and breakfast rate an excellent. The size of the room--by London standards--was adequate, and the wonderfully comfortable bed was made up with quality linens. Although the hotel is on a busy street, the double paned windows made it perfectly quiet. All that keeps the Rembrandt from earning an &quot;excellent&quot; rating is that the room's furnishings were a little tired; but the hotel was undergoing renovation, and I expect that negative will be remedied when I stay there again. I've recommended this hotel to an acquaintance--something I'm hesitant to do--and she agreed with my assessment.	
Nov 25 2006 	Mixed bag...but I would stay here again	This is just one of those places where there in nothing specifically deficient, but you can't help but think, if the front desk just went the extra mile, or if they fixed up the lobby, etc., it could be so much nicer. Check in was a nightmare even though we had booked months in advance. It is always dissappointing when you have to insist on a hotel providing you with the level of room that you booked and paid for. Eventually we nearly got we had booked and requested, but frankly, we were worn down after being directed to yet a third room. Maybe that was the strategy. During the whole stay we found the front desk staff completely indefferent. Lack of eye contact, and generally made us feel uncomfortable in requesting anything, especially after the check in fiasco. This is really meant to be constructive criticism.Having said that, Yes I would still stay there again and think all in all it is still a great value. The room we ended up in was very nice though it had a dismal view. I also saw a refurbished room during our involuntary tour of the hotel and it was very nice as well.The location was great for transportation and attractions. Easy tube access and walking to shopping, tourist sites and restaurants. The hotel has a spa/gym attached to it which may or may not be inculded in your room rate depending the package that you choose. If you are a workout junkie, there should be enough to keep you occupied even if it is not what you are used to at home. Nice pool and spa as well.The dining area is beautiful and the buffet breakfast more than adequate. The lobby and hallways could use some updating but then again i didnt hang out in the lobby. I could not get a strong enough signal for the wireless internet in my room, even if i was willing to pay for it. They have 2 terminals for internet access in the lobby but they should post time limits as there were several people who I observed litrerally spending hours monopolizing those 2 computers even though other people were clearly waiting for them.So, if you feel the price is right, I would not feel worried about booking here. The location is great. Unfortunately, for not a whole lot of effort, the hotel could really make this an even better experience.	
Nov 24 2006 	Perfectly fine...	I just got back from London, and The Rembrandt was a great choice for a five-day stay for both business and pleasure. Location was perfect -- right across the street from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and only five minutes walk from the South Kensington tube station. I asked for a quiet room and early check-in and got both. In fact, the room was one of the quietest I've ever had -- the only sounds were the occasional closing of other doors (and I am very, very noise-sensitive). The room overlooked a charming garden so there were no cars, motorcycles, or garbage trucks below. My friend and I shared a twin room which was small but larger than many I have had in Europe, and perfectly fine. We both had enough room for our clothes and suitcases and weren't tripping over each other. The shower was strong and the water temperature also just fine. The room was neither too hot nor too cold since we learned from housekeeping how to control the heat. My friend loved the soft featherbed, but it was too much for me and , when I asked, the maid gave me a normal sheet and blanket right away. We were pleased to find that a full English breakfast was included (unlike many other hotels we had considered) and It was a good or better than what I've had in other English and European hotels. (I thoroughly enjoyed the fried eggs, sausages, tomatoes and slices of bacon. Skip the scrambled eggs.) Also, in contrast to some of the comments I've read about the Rembrandt, the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous, albeit somewhat reserved. (You just have to understand that English is not their first language. ) A few cautionary remarks: 1) Our room (445) was perfectly fine, but I don't think it was one of the renovated rooms. The decor was quaint and old-fashioned (which is what I want in London). 2) The &quot;hair dryer&quot; was hooked into the desk in the room and the outlet in the bathroom could only handle a razor. Bring a good hair dryer and plan on using it in the room, not the bathroom. 3) There was no Internet connection in our room. When we got to the hotel, we learned that the only Internet connections are in the Executive rooms, and that if you want to connect to the Internet, you have to go to the lobby and pay for a connection either on your computer or their machines. By the way, the &quot;business center&quot; is two computers and a printer in the lobby. 4)The only other drawback was the false fire alarm at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, but I blame some thoughtless guests for triggering it, not the hotel.	
Nov 21 2006 	decent hotel-wonderful location	Hotel was built at turn of the century for Harrods-it is about 4 blocks away. It had the Victorian charm--but needed some updating. The continental breakfast was very good. The staff was friendly and attentive. I would definitely stay there again-especially for the location. Several blocks from South Kensington Tube, across the street from VIctoria and Albert Museum, Also near Natural History museum and Kensington Palace. All in all my London experience was perfect.	
Nov 2 2006 	Good and Bad	This is the third hotel I have stayed at in London in the past few months. This was the least favorite.Good points: We were able to get an early check-in and the front desk attendant was friendly. The Concierge was very helpful. The room was immaculate, probably the cleanest hotel room I have been in for years. The location is good.Negatives: We asked three days in a row for our refrigerator to be fixed with no luck. The hotel is so hot we had to have the a/c on constantly. It was incredibly noisy and very ineffectual. The breakfast was awful. The first day the eggs were so hard that they could not be pierced with a fork. All remaining days, the eggs were raw on top. The sausage had some sort of mystery substance in it, the fruit was nasty etc. etc. In five days we were offered coffee only once. We had a room with a 'garden view'. Anyone who has been in one of these rooms can attest that the 'garden' is like something out of a Monty Python skit. We howled.	
Oct 31 2006 	Really Good value/choice location	Located halfway between the South Kensington and Knightsbridge tube stop, and a short walk to Harrods, can't imagine a better location. Despite being on busy Brompton Road, room was always quiet for sleeping. Very spacious room by American standards, and umongous by European standards, we had a top floor room, away from elevators (our request, nicely granted) for what appears to be affordable London rates. Bed appeared to be actually larger then a traditional king, and pillows were plentiful and very comfortable. Bathtub very narrow; would not have even attempted a bath, and shower curtain was affixed to body during showers (Yuck!), but a very comfortable room, all in all. Value enhanced even further when wife informed me that breakfast buffet (hot, extensive, with really top quality bangers) was included in price. At least I hope so, cause I certainly didn't pay. As good as the breakfast was, I would steer clear of the evening carvery buffet. Mundane roast beef, not prime rib,and equally mundane sides, even if you qualify for the early bird discount price. For a great value pasta meal, and great ambiance, check out Frankies, a few blocks east of the hotel.Only real negative was the KGB attitude of the front desk. Although focused on ruthless efficiency, they all exhibited the warmth, friendliness, and helpfulness of a Siberian gulag. We met many Eastern European servers in area restaurants who were fluent in cordiality, so I refuse to allow this as an excuse. The 4.95 pounds per hour charge to use the internet is a rip off, and you can probably sneak your use on the computers with leftover minutes from previous users. British staff in the dining room appropriately charming and pleasant.Would definitely stay here again without blinking, if similar rates were available.	
Oct 23 2006 	The Rembrandt was great	The Rembrandt was great. It was immaculate. The breakfast was sumptous. The staff was very helpful. The location is so convenient, right on the Picadilly line. It's a 50 minute trip to Heathrow. We had a very short stay - only two nights, so the convenience was very important to us. I would definitely stay again. Cathy	
Oct 17 2006	Average Hotel...	Probably when you are on a business trip you become more demanding, but this hotel is just avrage. The Rooms are big, but noisy and cold, at least mine one. The bathroom is small and not fancy at all, the breakfast is not what you're looking for in a 4 stars hotel in knitsbridge.I'll not come back, or at least not during my business trip!	
Oct 15 2006 	WONDERFUL hotel	Hi...This is the third time I've stayed at The Rembrandt and reading a few of the reviews below I just don't get it...this hotel is tremendous...if you had a bad stay here, it's probably your fault...reviewers below complained that they had stayed in 'friendlier' hotels...then why didn't you stay in them this time? You probably got a cheap package deal from British Air...The staff at The Rembrandt, as seen in a bunch of other reviews, is teriffic...yes, they're renovating, but you know what? ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU BOOK. A bunch of earlier reviews talked of renovation, so having read them, why didn't you call and ask where the renovation would be and request a room elsewhere? They'll accomodate you, same as they did us, and same as they did you when you brought it ti thier attention.And this is Europe, so if you get a cheap package deal for a standard room it's not going to be like the US. Air Conditioning is not a standard feature in almost all of Europe. ASK FIRST.And if you're cleaning bill was high, that's your fault. The prices are right there...it cost over $100, which means 50L...the Hilton in Houston charged $22 for a pair of jeans and $18 for a shirt, right on par with most hotels, and we didn't use them either...Call and ask...do some legwork. This hotel does not deserve bad reviews by high maintenance, spoiled vacationers. What right do I have to say this? We stayed on our honeymoon, and I knew the hotel was under renovation. But I called, and asked to be placed away from the renovation work, and they, in a VERY friendly manner, accomdated us. And we spent the extra $50 a night and got a superior room and the view of the V&amp;A was spectacular.I cannot thank the hotel and staff for how good they were to us during our stay. We were delayed, got in 3 hours late, the GSM phone I rented didn't work and I was pretty wound up when I got there...no problem...our room was ready, perfect, and a nice card from the staff congratulating us...at 11 at night they had suggestions on where to grab a good bite...Pizza and a live band in a basement on Brompton Road...the food was great, the band was lousy but we had fun with all the people there...and it cost $100!!!!! Because the pound is so strong...you have to know you can't stay in London as an American and not go broke...but so what, skimp when you get back...have some fun...And The Rembrandt is fun, and the people are friendly, and if your rooms not ready at 7 in the morning, well, how many hotels have rooms that are??? Mostly one's held for big corporate clients...I know they have a baggage room and then you can explore till 2...ok, enough preaching...the honest review...This is a good hotel, in a great spot, at a teriffic price, with a friendly and attentive staff...for this price, in this neighborhood, there is no better...stay in Bayswater next time for the same price and see what you get...and then wander around that neighborhood at two in the morning after the bell rings...I will stay in The Rembrandt every time. But I will call and ask questions and be certain we all know what I'm looking for. Lastly...thanks to all the staff who signed the lovely card in our room, it was a great way to begin our European honeymoon. And the Bunch of Grapes is still great too...Thanks again for everything, we'll see you next time...travellors...stay at this lovely hotel, but ask questions FIRST!!!!!!!!	
Oct 13 2006	Unfriendly staff and worst service in London	I had stayed at the Rembrandt some years ago and though I didn't find the hotel superb, I found it nice and with a good location. That's why I decided to book it again in my recent trip to London. I had booked a standard double room for 130 GBP with breakfast.When I arrived at the hotel I was told there was no smoking room available in rude and unfriendly manners by the girl at the front desk whose name was Juliane. I told here I had booked a smoking room but she returned I had requsted one, it didn't mean I would get one. After much conversation and no help from her to attend my request I told her I would pay for an executive room if she had one. There was one available which would be more 40 GPB, that is 170 GBP. I accepted to pay it convinced I would get a great room.In the meantime no one came to collect my luggage, 2 large suitcases, so me and my daughter took them to the room.The executive room was tiny, dated and was no different from the standard room I had stayed some years before. I was also told we had wireless conection but the internet wasn't wireless, we had to ask the concierge for a cable and leave a deposit of 10GBP for it! Anyway we weren't able to get conection and no one made any effort to help us! Every time I went to the concierge or the front desk I was treated with ice cold unfriendly manners, as if they were doing me a favour.The buffet breakfast was dull, the choices weren't plenty and the quality was bad, the croissants were dry, they seemed to have a few days already. The only good thing about the hotel was its location but I will never stay in this place again nor do I recommend it to anyone. It's expensive, dated and unfriendly with the worst service you can get in London. Stay away from here!	
Oct 2 2006 	Good Location	The best thing about the Rembrandt was the location. Just around the corner from the South Kensington tube station and a few blocks from Harrod's. Several good cafes are nearby too...we especially liked the Creperie where main dish and dessert crepes are to die for! Good shopping nearby too on Brompton Road.The room was small and, as others have noted, the hotel is under renovation. We heard banging &amp; other noises from our room on the fifth floor but always after a decent time in the morning. The weather was warmer than the 60 degrees we expected and was more like 80 degrees and our room was not air-conditioned. Open windows to traffic and a fan going made sleeping a challenge...not to mention showering in the heat. The room was clean and the bath was too.The breakfast buffet was fine;plenty of choices and good. We did not eat lunch or dinner there opting for the local cafes.Would we stay there again? Doubtful...but the location may bring us back.Staff was not super friendly...we arrived at 7am but absolutely could not check-in until 2pm even with several requests made.Staff got us a car to Heathrow and told us it would be 30GBP...but the driver charged us 50GBP at the airport. Beware.We've stayed at hotels in London that were far more friendly than the Rembrandt. If location and price are important then this hotel is fine.	
Sep 28 2006 	Very Comfortable	Trip Advisor review led us to The Rembrandt as we wanted to be in the Knightsbridge-Kensington area. We upgraded to a superior room @ 96GBP and were very pleased with that decision.The room was very ample as was the bath. It was clean and in good condition. We faced the V&amp;A and the very busy Brompton Rd. Despite the traffic, the room noise was non-existent.Best feature? THE BED. It was huge and piled with 6 pillows of varying firmness. Heavenly!Worse feature? One of those light-weight cloth shower curtains that attacks you. Aaaahhh!The hotel is under renovation in the lobby and bar areas but the disruptions were handled well and not a problem. It's likely completed by now. The buffet breakfast (included) was typical English and ample, however not particularly distinguished.Buffet lunch was average at best.Harrod's up the street, V&amp;A across the street, S Kensington tube station about 50 yds away. Very convenient location with some good pubs nearby. Victoria Station was about a 10 min cab ride.	
Sep 27 2006 	The Rembrandt; A Roll Of The Dice Really	If you are like me, you have spent a ridiculous amount of hours poring over hotel reviews in an effort to pick the right hotel to ensure that your inevitabaly expensive stay in London will be a pleasant one. I would love to give The Rembrandt a completely glowing review, but my experience would seem to indicate that it's not necessarily which hotel you stay in, but which room you are assigned in any given hotel. When I first got to my fifth floor room of the Rembrandt, I would say that my feeling was of resigned, but mild disappointment. The room was badly dated, a bit tattered, smelled weird, and had unsightly stains on the ceiling. I was ok with it though, because despite all that, the bathroom and the sheets seemed reasonably clean and the hotel is in a good location. Then, on my first morning there, I was woken up at about 7:00 am by loud, jocular conversation in the room next to mine. I figured that this was just a couple of guys packing up to leave, but then there were more voices, and louder talking. At about 8:00 am, someone started a circular saw that sounded like it was literally inches from my head. A few moments later there was hammering so loud that it really sounded as though they were coming through the wall. This was obviously intolerable. I sometimes like to stay out a bit late when I am on vacation and I occasionally like to have the luxury of sleeping until 10:00. When I complained at the front desk, the staff couldn't have been any more accommodating. They offered a genuine apology, and upgraded me to a Superior room. This room was fresh, clean, quiet and comfortable.Although I must say that if I had been paying the Superior price I may have been a bit disappointed. They describe these rooms as &quot;garden view&quot;, but they really look out on the back of the hotel. So if you are considering a stay at this hotel in the near future, I would recommend that you insist on a room that has already been rennovated, which probably means a room on one of the lower floors. If you have a decent room, this hotel is a pretty good value: good location , professional staff, nice breakfast buffet, and reasonably priced by London standards. You should be aware that the hotel attracts an older crowd. I am forty, and seemed to be one of the younger guests. Also, unless you are independently wealthy, do not use the hotel dry cleaning service- 2 pairs of jeans, four dress shirts and a pair of socks were over $100.00 !!!!!!!- a somewhat unpleasant surprise on my departure.	
Sep 15 2006	great hotel	Based on the reviews from others, we booked our room at the The Rembrandt between Sep 2 to 5 for 3 nights. we booked through shortbreak direct (based in England i believe). 99 pounds per night. it was a great deal. we got upgraded to the executive room. bathroom was huge compared to London Bridge hotel where we also stayed later in our trip. Great location. less than 5 minutes walk from South Kingsington Station. We took the Tube from the airport and no problem at all. (we were a little confused on which exit to get out in the subway) When we checked in, we were also told that we have been upgraded to full English breakfast. we ate very well each morning. the room size was adequate (we had a double) and very comfortable. the staff were very courteous. we had some problem with the room safe but they were able to fix it right away. i highly recommend it. The supermarket Marks and Spencer is about 5 minutes walk east of the hotel. there is a mini fridge in our room and is not stocked with mini bar stuff which was great to store our water and fruit,etc.We took the Tube everywhere. got the day pass and went to Covent Garden every night. the only thing is that the Tube station close at 10 pm. so we had to take a taxi one night that costed about 12 pounds.highly recommend it. if we go back to London, we would stay there again.	
Aug 7 2006	safe and comfortable	Have stayed there twice and my college age sons also twice by themselves. Safe for solo women travelers; staff very helpful; rooms comfortable but if you want a city view, request it. Food and bar good.Excellent location; easy to get to from Heathrow; a bit of a trek to Covent Garden but tube is easily accessible.	
Aug 5 2006	A Great Hotel	We stayed at the Rembrandt in early July for two nights as part of a promotion put on by British Airways. We had a fully airconditioned, large, and nicely decorated room for two nights. The breakfasts were excellent and included in our rate. The location is wonderful and you can easily get to any major attraction with a quick ride on the tube. I would stay here again!	
Aug 3 2006	Very nice hotel	Our travel agent chose this hotel for us, and we were not disappointed. We went in the middle of summer and so we had to upgrade to an air-conditioned room, but the whole hotel will have this upgrade in the future. The room was very nice, clean, and modern. The bathroom was spectacular with a whirlpool tub. The location was great- 2 short blocks to the South Kensington tube stop. We would definitely return to this hotel.	
Jul 23 2006	Our favorite hotel	This was our fourth time staying at the Rembrandt., We love the location, across from the Victoria and Albert museum, a short walk to Harrods, the tube station is a short walk around the corner, and lots of restaurants and shopping in the area. The staff are always very freindly and helpful. We stayed in an executive king room on the 5th floor. The executive rooms have a/c which was needed during the recent heat wave. A lot of the rooms are under renovation at this time, but that was not a problem on our floor. The room had tv, small fridge which we had requested, and a safe in the closet. Our room included the full english breakfast which is served buffet style, Very plentiful and good. We enjoyed a drink in the evening in the lounge area where they have a big screen, and we watched Wimbleton and highlights of the World Cup Soccer games. It is still our favorite home away from home when we visit London! Just a hint: if you don't like your room, just tell them, they will be happy to show you others.	
Jul 19 2006	Good Room/Bad Food	Last minute booking with shortbreaksdirect, first choice not available, Rembrandt was offered via telephone call. Email confirmation backed up by postal confirmation. It was here we notice that we had a room upgrade. Rather sceptical at £99 per night for 2 with breakfast in Knightsbridge over the road from the V&amp;A. Arrived in a heat wave, the hotel was cool, reception was efficient and the room was an upgrade. At the back with nice views over some splendid Georgian houses, very very quiet. Fanstastic air con, very comfortable bed, splendid bathroom with jacuzzi bath, very clean and fairly spacious.Although the restaurant was a nice place to be (and totally non smoking as was the room) the food was really terrible. We had the Sunday night (and every night I think) carvery which was either a really dried out Turkey or Beef. Hardly any vegatables and the Yorkshire pudding was like, well! All the food was tepid apart from the hot satly gravy.Breakfast was passable, had worse but also had much much better. Rubber eggs and hard bacon terrible tea and awful coffee. Having said, would return again and again, for the hotel and the location, plenty of good cafes nearby, Harrods (foodhall!) 5 mins away, South Ken station 5 mins away and museums on the doorstep. A very nice historic hotel.	
Jul 7 2006	You should stay at this hotel	We stayed at The Rembrandt Hotel in the Knightsbridge section of London 5/21 - 5/28/2006. We reserved an Executive Room at 170 British pounds which is around $300 USD. The room faced the back of the hotel which is the back of flats with no balconies so there was no street noise, no noise at all. The room was very large and the bathroom was huge. It was extremely clean, coffee/tea maker. The room rate included a Full English Breakfast which is not all that tasty but you can get orange juice, croissants and rice crispies to fill your stomach! This hotel is 1 1/2 blocks from the South Kensington tube and about 3 blocks from Harrods and the Knightsbridge tube, it is directly across from the Victoria &amp; Albert museum. Many restaurants and &quot;7-11&quot; or convenience stores nearby for you to get snacks, liquor, newspapers, etc. I made our reservation on the internet and all was as agreed upon when we arrived. There are no ice machines for us Americans but room service delivered at no charge. The room rate also included the 17.5% Value Added Tax and some hotels added this on as an extra charge. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. You won't go wrong in this neighborhood.	
Jun 27 2006	Another Rembrandt fan	Came as a freebie with a British Air flight special so we were a little suspicious. To our surprise, the hotel was charming. our room was a good size, with a nice sitting area. we enjoyed the lounge and bar and breakfast was impressive. best of all, the location was spectacular. we were stopping in London for only two days, to visit friends, and continuing on to France and we spent one of our precious days simply crossing the street and enjoying the fabulous V &amp; A museum. While you can't beat &quot;free&quot; we'd actually pay to stay here.	
Jun 27 2006	Loved the Rembrandt	My daughter and I stayed at the Rembrandt for six nights and loved it. We had the king executive room with air conditioning and it was great. We were right by the elevators and there was never any noise at all. Room service was great food and great service. The conceirge was wonderful, the gave directions, helped with taxis and helped with all my tour needs. The location was wonderul, a short walk to Harrods and across the street from the Victoria and Albert museum. We would stay there over and over again.Travelers from Houston, Texas	
Jun 13 2006	Would highly recommend	As first time travelers to London, we were extremely pleased with the Rembrandt Hotel and give it an enthusiastic &quot;thumbs up&quot;. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious (however, regulating the room temperature was very tricky), and the location was convenient and in a FABULOUS part of town. We'll definitely return.	
Jun 5 2006	Good hotel with charm	I stayed with my wife and 9 year old son a week here and were satisfyed. Very good location, large room for London. Our room on upper floor had old fashioned window, which we could open to get fresh air and nice view.	
Jun 5 2006	Fantastic Location	If you're looking for a decent hotel with access to museums and shopping, the Rembrandt Hotel is perfect! I just got back from staying there for 6 days and had a great time. The standard double room is spacious and a view of the V&amp;A museum right across the street. The superior double room is a bit bigger, and has more posh decorations. more comfortable chairs, bigger closet and desk.The breakfast is a generous buffet with either an English breakfast or continental options. (Get there before 10am, it gets a bit hectic) The concierge and staff were helpful, but don't expect them to help much in terms of the Internet access. Internet Access is only available in the Lounge/Lobby area. You really want to use the wireless internet from the Lounge near the bar. Much better signal. If you login from near the front lobby, the signal will drop and your session cannot be used for 3 hours. We ended up having to purchase two 24-hour tickets because the signal dropped a couple times. My biggest gripe is that the internet access is not available in each room and isn't Free. I thought that was the standard nowadays.Besides my picky-ness on the internet access, the Rembrandt was a great hotel to stay in and has some great restaurants near the South Kensington tube station.	
Jun 4 2006	a very nice stay at the Rembrandt	My husband, college-aged daughter &amp; I stayed at the Rembrandt for two nights in March 2006. The staff was friendly and very helpful and helped book several tours as well as line up transportation for us. The bathroom was very spacious and the double bed was comfortable. There were no rooms available for 3 so they brought in a sofa bed which was not all that comfortable. We enjoyed the wonderful breakfast buffet in their lovely dining room.	
May 30 2006	Terrific Location!	We stayed at the Rembrandt for two days at the end of May. Travelled with my husband, two children (ages 5 and7) and my mother-in-law. Due to a BA promotion offering two free nights at the hotel when flights booked with them, we decided to splurge and upgrade our free &quot;standard&quot; rooms to &quot;executive&quot; rooms (after hearing that the hotel is located on a main road and that standard rooms do not come with air-conditioning). That was a very good move since the weather was quite humid and we were able to sleep comfortably without traffic noise.Our rooms were on the 4th floor, nicely appointed, with a king size bed and a small sitting room which converted a sofa to a bed for the boys. Grandma was next door. The view wasn't all that nice : roof air conditoining compressors etc, and the back of other buildings. But for 40 pounds upgrade per night, one can't really complain.Breakfast was nice enough. Cold continental breakfast (meats, cheeses, yoghurt, granola, cereals, coffe and tea) or a hot breakfast for an additoinal 5 or 6 pounds offering bacon, eggs, fried toast, mushrooms, baked beans (God help us all at that hour . . .) and the like. With both of my children having severe food allergies, I was pleasantly surprised that the breakfast staff were really very helpful - some even went to find the original boxes that items came in so I could read the ingredient labels.The Hotel is conveniently located about 3 or 4 blocks from Harrods, a 5 minute walk from South Kensignton tube station, across from the V&amp;A Musuem, and down the street from the Natural Hsitory Musuem. BEST OF ALL: they are conveniently located on the BIG BUS COMPANY route. With a ticket that is valid for 24 hours (buses run from about 9:00 and the last stop ends at 8:00 p.m.) we were able to see all of London on the double decker tour the first afternoon. Then the following morning we used the bus route to plan where we would get off and back on to go inside and explore some the sights. The price of the bus ticket included a lovely River Thames cruise that we took from the Tower of London and dropped us back at the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, and the London Eye. We then got back on the bus and took it to Buckingham Palace and then back to the Hotel. We could never have seen as much as we did had we not taken the bus (I was born and bred in London and saw more in 2 days with my family than I had ever seen in the 20 years I lived there).I spoke with Concierge and they were able to arrange for a mini van to pick us all up from the airport for about 65 pounds (we would have needed 2 black taxis and it would have been far more than that) and again arranged for another car service to take us all to another destination after that. The concierge staff was friendly and knowledgable. We also bought the Big Bus Company tickets from the Concierge desk.However, if you plan to visit more than 1 or two of the paying sights (lots of the musuems are free) then look into the &quot;London Pass&quot; which for a flat fee will get you into many of the sights and will be cheaper than shelling money out at each of the places (there's express entry with it too)Overall, I would go back. The hotel was certainly comfortable and clean and the staff went out of their way to accommodate and assist my family during our stay.	
May 30 2006	Superb location comfortable room!	Like many others, we booked the Rembrandt as part of a British Airways promotion but extended our stay by one extra night to emcompass our anniversary. The hotel thoughtfully had a bottle of red wine and two glasses in our executive room upon arrival. The room itself was on the top floor, in the back of the hotel with a stellar view of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the adjacent private green space. It was quiet, had windows that opened out and was generally roomy and comfortable.The hotel also featured wonderful common rooms. The lobby and adjacent sitting area as well as the breakfast room were all open and welcoming. Thurloe is great street adjacent to much of South Ken's best features and a quick walk into the parks. The nearby Oratory restaurant is one to check out.The staff at the Rembrandt were very helpful during our stay, the breakfast was a nice bonus in the morning. All in all, we had a splendid stay and would recommend this hotel for it's tidy rooms and wonderful London location.	
May 20 2006	Excellent value for money opposite the V 	We chose the Rembrandt on the recommendation of a British Air clerk which airline had it on special. If you are fans of the V &amp; A, directly across the street, you cannot be better located. It's convenient to the Knightsbridge tube stop and a quick taxi ride from the theater district [outside of rush hour.] Harrods is a few blocks away but we found it much reduced in quality.The hotel is large but well run; it does not have an institutional feel. The staff was especially helpful. We were able to discuss room alternatives with a desk clerk who took us on a tour of rooms available. We requested and were given a room in the rear away from the very busy street. Our first choice was in the lower area in the process of re-decoration and had a tricky level change. We moved the next night, our second of three, further up which was quieter albeit smaller requiring some adjustments for accessing our luggage. We would have preferred fewer chairs  we werent going to entertain guests  and more floor space. Our room was clean and comfortable. A continental breakfast was included with our package but the maitre d told us to go ahead and eat what we wished. The food was tasty and ample, from cereals and fresh fruits through the customary pork products, baked beans, eggs, baked tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese Enough to last until dinner. An excellent value for money.	
May 15 2006	Fair deal but noisy	I've spent a couple of nights in a first floor room on the back. The room was quite spacious (compared to London's standards) and fairly decorated,but the only window was facing the air conditioning compressors and kitchen's air outlet. This made quite impossible to open the window because of the noise &amp; smell. Moreover the room was really noisy all night long (air conditioning, bathrooms, doors slammed etc.).	
May 4 2006	Boutique Hotel feeling	My husband, 12 year old son and I stayed at the Rembrandt over Easter this year and were thrilled with the Hotel. Our executive sized triple room was large and airy, with all the amenities one would expect from a 4 star hotel, (in London, anyway). It was superbly located, friendly and felt like a little boutique hotel. The public rooms were charming and breakfast was excellent. The only gripe I have is the swimming pool advertised on their web site actually belongs to the health club next door and you have to pay a health club fee to use it.	
May 1 2006	I would definitely stay here again	My wife and I spent eight nights here, and I can recommend the Rembrandt highly. We stayed in an executive room on the fourth floor with a king-size bed, and were pleasantly suprised by the size of the room for the price we paid (we got a special deal from the website because we stayed more than six nights). The location is perfect -- a great neighbohood for exploring, and also quite convenient to the Tube for getting around to the rest of London. We had a couple of minor glitches (the tea kettle stopped working and our key cards did not work one time), but the staff promptly fixed these minor problems. The staff was friendly and helpful (particularly the Concierage desk), and the breakfast (included in our room rate) was more than sufficient. In sum, I would recommend it highly to tourists (I cannot speak to the convenience of its location for business travelers).	
Apr 30 2006	Nice if you want to visit the museums and Harrods	My daughter and I stayed at The Rembrandt Hotel April 26-28 during a short stay in London. The room was free due to a British Air promotion, and included continental breakfast. I paid a grand total of £1.40 for my entire stay (cost of the morning newspapers). We had requested two twin beds in a non-smoking room. We received our choice of beds but had to make do with a smoking room - a minor inconvenience for a free stay.If you are interested in visiting a couple of museums and Harrods, then this is a good location. The hotel was located across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is next to the Natural History Museum. Harrods is just a four block walk down the street. There are loads of shops, restaurants, and small markets nearby. The South Kensington tube stop was a few minutes' walk from the hotel, and the Green Line service (to Windsor) was about a 10 minute walk.We were greeted at the door, promptly and courteously checked in, and offered help with our bags. The room was very clean, with an in-room safe and small terrace. They are refurbishing all of the rooms, and will be adding air conditioning. This is definitely to their advantage, since our room faced the very busy street and is very loud with the windows open. The room was a bit warm, but we couldn't keep the windows open for any length of time due to the street noise. The bathroom was clean, but the toilet took several attempts each time to flush it. The shower had just one very flimsy curtain, so that it clung to me during my shower. Hopefully they'll replace this with a glass partition during the refurbishment.The complimentary continental breakfast was adequate - a selection of cereals, breads, fruit, juices, ham, cheese, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. For an extra £5 or £6 we could've upgraded to the hot breakfast, which included about 6 or 8 different items.We enjoyed our stay the The Rembrandt, and would recommend it with one caveat - if your room has not yet been refurbished, you will need a good pair of earplugs if you enjoy sleeping with the windows open.	
Apr 23 2006	Fantastic Rooms Even Better Location!	Our family spent 10 days at the Rembrandt and had a wonderful experience. The hotel was recommended by a friend who takes his family there regularly. We also read the reviews on tripadvisor.com. After much thought, we booked ajoining Executive Rooms (hotel has several different types of rooms, the executive being the most expensive). These are some of the nicest hotel rooms we've stayed in. The Executive rooms and bathrooms were huge. The bathrooms had marble and granite throughout. The tubs were deep and the shower pressure strong. Everything was exceptionally clean. The rooms also have a mini-fridge which came in handy. Our rooms were recently upgraded and the hotel was in the process of doing other rooms during our stay. As we were a family travelling, we enjoyed having the two rooms ajoining. We were on the 6th floor, facing away from the street, so we heard almost no noise whatsoever. The rooms were a bit warm, but we could open the windows which adjusted the temperature just fine. I must mention the location--the Rembrandt is situated between two tube stops and within walking distance of parks, museums, and Harrods! We often would stop at Harrods on the way home just to pick up some snack at the Food Court. The South Ken. neighborhood is posh, to say the least, and we had a lot of fun just walking around the neighborhoods. We found the hotel staff very nice and helpful. Our breakfast was included and was more than adequate. The breakfast room is large, with tall windows looking out onto the beautiful S. Ken neighborhood. The buffet offered many choices for US and european travelers. Hot tea and coffee were offered immediately and we leisurely ate our breakfast every morning while planning our daily activities. We only had a few minor issues during our 10 day stay. Our check-in didn't go as smoothly as we had hoped--our original rooms were not available when we we arrived (11:30am), nor at checked in (3:00), as a guest decided to stay an extra day. So for the first night we stayed in different rooms (Superior room-- nice, but smaller than the Executive) and then we moved to our Executive rooms the next night. The hotel compensated us for this inconvenience. Also, it was important to put the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door if you wished to sleep past 8:00 am, as the maids were anxious to clean rooms as soon as possible (maids were very sweet &amp; nice). We did not rely upon hotel staff for travel information, reservations, etc. so we cannot report on their abilities in these areas. We can't wait to go back &amp; stay in our same rooms. Really beautiful, comfortable, huge, lots of storage, etc.	
Apr 11 2006	Not what it used to be	My family and I stayed at the Rembrandt hotel many times in the late 1980's and early 90's and were delighted with the hotel at the time. We expected to experience the same good service and lovely rooms that we had once experienced when we visited in December 2005.It was however one problem after another from the moment we arrived. We experienced several problems checking in, mostly due to a lack of knowledge of the hotel rooms by the desk staff as well an inability to understand and communicate efficiently in English. We were shown into a room that was already occupied, had to switch rooms due to construction that the front desk was unaware of and then were given a master key to the hotel (we found out when we accidentally opened the wrong room). We also did not receive phone messages for several days and were given incorrect information by the concierge. We were also treated rudely by a maid who was annoyed that she could not make up our room at 9:00am. We received a response to our complaints after our visit by the head of Sarova hotels which contained many careless spelling mistakes and only offered us a VERY slight upgrade for a future stay. Very disappointing and indicative of the sloppy manner in which this hotel is managed! The only plus is the great location.	
Mar 22 2006	Wonderful Experience	We just returned from a family Spring Break Vacation in London. We found the Rembrandt and the staff highly accommodating. The hotel is in a great location, not only centralized but safe. You are in walking distance to Harrods (very important to teenage shoppers)as well as across the street from 2 museums that are free! I was concerned about having a connecting, non-smoking room, because of our children. Even though I booked this through British Airways, I called the hotel myself to be sure we could work this out. (Which I suggest for anyone to do if you have questions, do not rely totally on British Airways). The rooms were clean and neat and had everything we needed. I found the Concierge service to be quite helpful. We had an issue with a tour we booked and they are working on trying to help us get our money back. The continental breakfast was in our package and I felt it was quite adequate.The rooms have 3 locks on the door as well as a safe for money and passports. I really liked this hotel and knowing that they are renovating their rooms I can't wait to take my family back!!!!!!	
Mar 20 2006	Unfriendly atmosphere	The hotel itself is very impressive, however the actual rooms are not as special as I was hoping! We did actually ask to move rooms once as the first room we were put in was two single beds pushed together, had a really noisey air conditioning unit and had no bath. The second room was much better although I think the bed was broken and sloped down at the bottom as every morning we woke up half way down the bed!The Rembrandt is full of business types and I found that the atmosphere was quite unfriendly. None of the staff made an effort to get to know us and I did feel a little bit out of place. We were told we would get free access to the fitness suite but when we tried to get in were turned away and left feeling a little embarrassed. The venue of the hotel is very good right in the centre of Knightsbridge in close proximity to a lot of the famous London landmarks and in walking distance to Leicester Square.I personally wouldn't go again and didn't think that it was worth the high prices.	
Mar 9 2006 	Mixed	Basically this hotel was OK.On the positive side the public rooms are bright and very spacious and the staff were nice, polite and tried to be helpful. The rooom was a very good size for London, clean and comfortable. Maid service was first class.Breakfast was a fairly standard affair. Room Service was a little slow but the food was excellent and cheap for the area - despite what others have said in reviews.Location is ideal, directly opposite the Victoria and Albert Museum and near the Natural History Museum. It is also 5 - 10 Mins level walk from South Kensington Tube station. The downside is that it is on the main route to/from the M4 Motorway so expect 4 lanes of commuter traffic past the hotel from around 7am each morning - noisy if you have a room at the frontSo why didnt I really like it? Well, it was the little things. The decor in the corridors on my floor looked tired (they are about to refurbish it). On the first night my room smelled of fried food as the windows were open and I was at the back of the building- I assume over the kitchens. Great view. awful smell.In booking an early morning call, there was the member of staff who could not understand the term '6.15am'....and I mean could not understand it. I had to repeat it 5 times before he understoodAbove all, perhaps it was the copy of Saga Magazine on the bedside table that made me feel it really wasn't for me!If you want a comfortable reasonably priced hotel as a good base for exploring London this one should be OK - but I doubt that it will inspire you.	
Mar 7 2006	im lovin it lovin it lovin it!!	We stayed here for one night, booked off the hotel website which included breakfast. The breakfast was yummy! good selection of hot food, as well as cereals, fruit, muffins etc. We stayed in the executive double and the room was nice and big, bathroom was spotless with jacuzzi bath, nice huge comfy bed. The view from our room wasn't all that great but that wasn't so much of a problem. The staff were decent and very helpful when we realised that my boyfriend had left his Ipod in the room after we had checked out. All in all... a BRILLIANT hotel, cant wait to stay there again!	
Feb 28 2006	A wonderful stay	We (3 women) stayed here for 5 nights from Feb 15-20 and found the hotel very friendly with excellent service. When we arrived at 9am our room was not ready but they gave us another room to stay in and rest after the long flight until our room was ready. Our room was spacious and very clean. The location is great, near many different restaurants, shopping including Harrods and the tube station. There is even a Spa next door. We never had a problem with security and felt very safe at all times. The concierge got us great seats to Mary Poppins, a must-see musical. It was a very enjoyable stay.	
Feb 17 2006	Very Nice Stay	My wife and I stayed at the Rembrant Hotel Feb 4-11, 2006. We were in London for vacation and got a very favorable rate on airfare and hotel through British Air.Because it was low season, we were given an upgrade on the room. The first couple of rooms we were shown were in need of updating. The last room (#463) was recently redone in bright colors and was quite nice. We were very happy in that room. However, there are some things to keep in mind. The room had no a/c. This was not a problem for us being wintertime but the weather during our stay was unseasonably warm. We didn't use the heater and on several occasions had to open the window at night. So, if you are there in the warmer times of year, insist on a room with a/c.The staff was overall warm and helpful. The public spaces in the hotel were attractive and accomodating. The breakfast (included with the package) was very nice. We liked the location very much. The neighborhood is upscale. The buses to &quot;town&quot; were across the street, in front of the V&amp;A (also a real plus) and the tube was 5 minutes away.We would certainly stay there again.	
Feb 13 2006 	Guest Safety and Security At Risk	Someone entered our room between 12 am and 3.30 am and stole our passport and credit cards. The hotel's response was minimal. They would not even provide us an extended check-out so that we could go to the Embassy and get things in order. There was no concern for guest welfare. There are no CCTV's within the hotel. The hotel manager declined to meet with us and didn't even give the courtesy to check-in with us. Stay AWAY!	
Feb 7 2006	please be careful before booking this hotel	We had the fright of our lives in the middle of the night as we found our hotel room door propped open with our clothes, and my wallet, passport and credit cards were stolen while we slept.Clothing was recovered on back steps though all documents were gone.The police were called and ascertained that this was probably an inside job as there was no sign of forced entry and there was no sign that the thief entered or exited through the back entrences. Naturally the hotel management disagreed. The final insult came as we didn't receive the courtesy of a phone call from the hotel's management after to see if there was anything they could do to make us more comfortable. Unbelievably, We weren't even offered a late check-out time to arrange ourselves after our morning at the embassy.Please be carefull before booking this hotel.	
Feb 4 2006	Good choice of hotel	For our honeymoon, we went to London for five days this January. We really were plesanantly surprised with the Rembrandt. Through the British Airways website, we were able to get 2 direction flights from Atlanta and 5 nights at the Rembrandt for $2000 - and that's with us upgrading from coach to their &quot;World Traveller Plus&quot; seats that give you more room, a foot rest, etc. We would not have been able to afford a hotel like the Rembrandt without the BA deal. The hotel was in a great location - a couple easy walking blocks to Harrod's, the Tube Stop, a Boots Pharmacy, and across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum. There are restaurants and Pubs all along the street for you to eat at also.From all that we read about London hotels, we were expecting to find a microscopic room and bathroom - we found a very nice sized room as well as a good sized bathroom. My only warning is for those of you are mobility challenged: the Rembrandts tub wall is at least 3 inches higher than normal American tubs and it may be a challenge for you to step in the tub. The heated towel bar was a nice bonus. The hotel has a free continental breakfast that is decent - cereals, toasts, muffins, croissants, or you can upgrade to the hot breakfast for 5 pounds (we tried it once - wasn't really worth it). Skip having the dinner buffet in the hotel's restaurant - it was just OK. The room was a little hot and no thermostat to turn down the heat - but it was also decently mild the days we were there. We just cracked the window a bit to let the room cool off when returning from a day of sight-seeing. Pros: great location, nice sized rooms (with hairdryers)Cons: hot room, hotel food just average, wait staff very slowHope this helps! And definitely look into package deals through Airlines - that's how we were able to save a ton of money!	
Dec 27 2005	Lived up to Good Reviews	I selected this hotel based on the reviews - and they were right! Best hotel I've stayed in within London. Our room was quite large (for London), with tall windows and classic curtains framing the room. There was a tea service to make tea in our room - which we loved. The bathroom was clean, modern and my 6'3'' hubby could fit in it. The included breakfast was delicious and was provided in an elegant dinning room. (Hot breakfast was extra for our package) We booked through BA and the room was part of a promotion. V&amp;A is right across the street, and the Natural Science museum next door a plus for us. I switch between budget and nicer traveling; this was a treat.	
Dec 16 2005	fab location	stayed one night prior to taking a day trip on the orient express.Booked two days prior to visit direct with hotel ,we had a superior room with full breakfast for 114 pounds which for london is pretty good.Hotel clean,staff helpful and food plentiful.Location is fab,right opposite is the V and A museum and harrods is less than five minutes away.The whole area is suberb ,with little classy shops,pubs and restaurants.By the way,if you ever get the chance take a xmas lunch trip on the orient express ,it is the best!.	
Nov 8 2005	Pleasant Stay	My husband and I stayed at the Rembrant on the recommendation of friends who had stayed there previously. The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to Harrods, museums and Hyde Park and the tube station is just a couple of blocks away. I felt very safe in the neighborhood. The hotel staff is very accommodating and the lobby and public areas were comfortable and welcoming. Our room was an &quot;executive room&quot; with king bed (two beds put together) and was clean and comfortable but on the small side. We had a lovely view of a home garden from our window. The bathroom was marble and large enough to manage. I found the tub slightly on the small side especially if you are a large person but the shower was great. The only complaint we had was we could never get the air conditioner to work and it got rather stuffy in the room at night even with the windows open. The breakfast was included and was plentiful and the wait staff was excellent. All in all a very pleasant experience and I would probably return.	
Oct 20 2005	Very Average	My husband and I recently stayed in the hotel for 3 nights.First Impression - The lobby, bar and public areas are in excellent shape, but small. Staff - I cannot say enough about how wonderful the staff was. Definitely the highlight of this hotel. Restaurant - Breakfast is a buffet each morning with a very wide selection. Everything was very good. We never had lunch or dinner there. Location - We felt the neighborhood was very safe. We were within walking distance to Harrods, a few museums and many restaurants. The tube station is a 5 minute walk and the stop for the &quot;Big Bus&quot; is a 2 minute walk. However, for the sights that we wanted to see this was not the most ideal location. Rooms - Unfortunately we were very disappointed in our room. The rooms are small and dark. The furnishings and bedding are very worn. We booked the Executive Level and I am honestly not sure whether or not we actually received it as the rooms we saw looked nothing like the picture on the website. After check-in and seeing our room we did go back to the front desk to see if we had been given the right room and 3 rooms later we were still in the same type of room. The room was kept clean, but I found it disappointing compared to the rest of the hotel.	
Oct 3 2005	Loved the Rembrandt!	We stayed here 4 times and absolutely loved the Rembrandt. I found the staff courteous even before we arrived with prompt return of emails and they answered all of my questions quickly.Our first stay was in an executive room. The room was reasonably sized with plenty of space around the beds, and a desk area and table and chairs. A mini fridge was set up for us upon request and was great to store snacks and those things that I didn't want to stop eating because I was away from home. Beds were comfortable, pillows flat but we found that everywhere and an extra one sorted that out easily. The airconditioner was well used as London was pretty hot when we arrived in early September. The bathroom was marble, great tub with jacuzzi settings (excellent after a long day out). We loved the choices at breakfast which was a buffet with cold cheeses and meats, yogurts and tin fruits, and a hot section with various egg dishes, bacon, sausages, mushrooms tomatoes etc.Our second stay was upgraded from a superior room to another one- but I dont know what it was called. This room was much much bigger than the executive! It had enough space for a settee to watch telly from. All the finishings were as above- no problems at all, and they even set up the mini fridge again with out asking! Each time I love this place even more!Finally, my last 2 stays at this hotel were in standard rooms, which didnt have as much space but enough room to house 3 medium suitcases etc. No aircon, but a fan provided but by the end of Sept we didnt really need it. The bathrooms were more compact, both rooms had the toilet sandwiched between the bath tub and counter, but it was perfectly fine. No jacuzzi though :)What really made our stays here lovely was the staff, every one from the reception to concierge were simply lovely and helpful, remembered our names from previous stays and were quick to do anything to make our stay a great one. Upon checking in after our short break in Italy I had the embarrassment of all of my credit cards being declined at reception (my bank froze my linked accounts after suspicious activity in Italy). I only had a few notes on me as I dont carry alot of cash and was having visions of sleeping outside---when the management kindly accepted my only 50 pounds as a guarantee and checked us in without delay and suggested that we phoned the bank the next day to find out what happened. The hotel normally takes out the entire amount of your stay plus extra for any items you might purchase- so I think we were very lucky that they accepted this.The location is great- only a few minutes to Harrods, great Italian cafe Orsini next door and the museums across the road. The website has good deals and I would try to book a room that states that an upgrade will be offered in available- it made a difference. Will definitely return! Will post some photos later if I can.	
Sep 13 2005	Good Hotel: Great Location	Arrived at the Rembrandt on July 8 for a three week stay and had an executive room with a great view, clean, air conditioning, large bathroom, and mini-refrigerator. The staff was helpful and as friendly as I needed them to be. The breakfast had a wide variety of choices and there are several nice restaurants in the area, O'Fado (Portuguese), Daquise (Polish), The Oratory (English), and Bunch of Grapes (Pub). Great location and the South Kennsington tube station is just around the corner. My wife and I had a great stay in the Rembrandt and would return again.	
Aug 25 2005	Definitely a good choice when staying in London	My flight arrived at Heathrow at 4am and it was only 6am when we arrived at the Rembrandt. As I was travelling with my wife and a 3-yr old kid, I had asked for the earliest possible check-in when I made the booking thru' ba. Actually I did not expect my room to be ready until at least 10 or 11am. I was really grateful to the staff because they had a triple room ready for us by 8am. Also from 6 to 8am they allowed us to use another double room free of charge; so we could get some rest without the need of sitting in the lobby. For the triple room we only paid the price of a double room, and free continental breakfast was provided also for my kid. The rooms are rather spacious for the standard in London, both for our triple room and also the double room that we stayed for a couple of hours. The furniture is a bit worn out but overall the rooms are clean and beds are comfortable. The washroom is not big but adequate. Water pressure with temperature control for the shower is good. However, I don't think there is any air-conditioning in the room. It can be fairly hot if you are staying in London in June/July. Also there is no mini-bar or fridge in the room, which is rather inconvenient to us.Overall we were quite happy with the Rembrandt and would definitely consider staying there if we visited London again.	
Aug 15 2005	Perfect	Have just spent 6 days at the Rembrandt and it was absolutely perfect. I couldn't find a bad word to say about the place.We had a superior room which was huge, about 3 times the size of any other room I have stayed in in London before. There was even a radio, phone and heated towel rail in the bathroom which was also spotlessly clean. Room had fridge and tea-making facilities, hairdryer and phone and a bed big enough for four people!! Most of the staff were very nice but the girls on reception could have done with being a bit more pleasant. On checkout our room cards were taken from us and not a word was said to us, like 'hello' or 'did you enjoy your stay'. The breakfast was quite nice as well with plenty to choose from and the room was lovely as well. Harrods is a 4 minute walk away and the V&amp;A, Natural History Museum and Science Museum. Theres a McDonalds and M&amp;S Food on the way to Harrods as well which are very handy for bits and pieces. Loved the Pizza Express as well which is on the way to Harrods and just turn down the street to the right which has all the shops on it (its the only non-residential street on the way). Also highly reccomend the Bunch of Grapes pub on the corner nearby. Can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!	
Aug 9 2005	Appalled	I can't even begin to tell you how appalled I am with the customer service in this hotel. My son and his girlfriend stayed here in July of this year and were dealt with by the staff with a lack of concern and consideration which left them in London, on the 21st July (day of second wave of bombings) with no money, their train out of London cancelled and nowhere to stay. I have written to the General Manager and emailed every member of the management team asking for an explanation but haven't had a single reply. When staying at this hotel make sure you know exactly how they are going to take payment and how long it will be before you get your deposit back as they will not offer this information without prompting.In addition to the above the rooms were tiny and the hotel generally very shabby and in need of updating.	
Jul 14 2005	Great hotel and neighborhood	After much research on here and other places, we chose The Rembrandt and we were very happy with all aspects of it. We arrived in Heathrow the moment the Underground/bus bombs occurred so we were pretty freaked out. We made our way into London via 2 buses and a 3 mile walk from Hammersmith. Our room was ready for us and what a welcome sight it was. Spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, great bathroom with a shower that had better water pressure than at home! The breakfast was great with a huge selection of food. We could find no fault with this hotel. Our room looked out on the V&amp;A and although we only used the Underground to go back to Heathrow, it was a short walk. We ate at Orsini's next door twice, Pizza Express a few blocks away and the delicious Oratory around the corner. Very nice experience considering London was not quite as relaxed as usual.	
Jun 23 2005	Small rooms	We stayed here in May 2005 Rooms tiny had to climb over bed to get in - we had 2 suitcases and hardly had room to put them down anywhere.Great Location though 5 minutes to Harrods and also good restaurants.The hotel lost our laundry - but eventually at 11.15pm found it in another room	
Jun 8 2005	Good Hotel - Great Location!	We stayed at The Rembrant in May of this year and loved the location and the friendliness of the staff. We booked directly with the hotel and the reservationist was more than helpful in answering all of my questions. We requested a smoking room and got a choice of rooms either in the front of the hotel or in the back overlooking a wonderful garden. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms could use some redecoration but otherwise the hotel had a unique charm. We got breakfast included in our room rate and had a wonderful choice of a buffet breakfast each morning. We will stay at this hotel the next time we are in London!	
Apr 7 2005	Make sure you call!!!	The hotel and room was lovely. We got a great rate, however, I had to book through their website (----) and could not book a triple. Called the hotel and had a verbal arrangement, confirmed twice. Arrived and the triple king I booked was not available. We got a triple twin which was fine but disappointing. The clerk offer to throw in the child breakfast for free, we gladly accepted. Well, we never got the free breakfast for the third. We explained to the restaurant host, and the desk clerk 3 times the situation and finally gave up. The hotel is worth staying in but please call a few days before your arrival to confirm again all that you understand you are getting for your hard earned money. Again, the hotel is lovely and the rooms a very spacious. The staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurant was beautiful, English breakfast was wonderful (came with the room for two of us!). The bathrooms were big with big, deep tubs and a shower. They supply washcloths. 4 blocks from Harrods, across the street from V&amp;A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Royal Albert Hall. Two blocks from South Kensington tube stop (3 lines; Circle,District, &amp; Picadilly) tons of restaurants.We would stay there again!!!	
Mar 22 2005	Liked our stay	We have stayed in the Rembrandt for the first time. All the others times we were in London we always had to complain about the hotels. This time we did not have to. The hotel has a great location, a very friendly staff, a good breakfast and a normal price. This hotel excells also in cleanlyness, both for the room and for the restaurant and lounges. For us a good reason to come back when we visit Londen again. Nevertheless we advise the management of the hotel to refurbish some of the rooms. Not a problem yet, but within a couple of years this might be nessesary.	
Mar 17 2005	We loved the Rembrandt	We just returned from a 6 night stay at the Rembrandt. I can't say enough about the staff. Everyone was polite and more than helpful. Everyone was always friendly. The housekeeping staff was great. You couldn't ask for a better concierge staff. Book through British airways or somewhere that will include the breakfast. The conntinental breakfast is more than enough, but it is expensive if you would have to pay for it. Some people have said they could stand to remodel, I agree some things could be replaced or updated, but everything was very clean.  The neighborhood is great. The tube station is very close. Don't hesitate to use the tube, it couldn't be simpler.  There are so many restaurants within just minutes walk. The cuisine and prices vary greatly, so you can find one to match your wallet and tastes. Might I suggest a great little Italian place just 2 bolcks up to the west, called Pierino Pizza &amp; Pasta. It was our favorite, we ate there more than once. The Victoriea &amp; Albert Museum is right across the street. The Natural History Museum is right next to that. Harrods is also right down the street in the other direction.  I would definately stay there again, and hopefully I will.	
Feb 5 2005	very co-operative as to face flannels	I like the Rembrandt. I like it because the staff is excellent; the location great; the rooms better than some hotels given a higher rating. The location is in an excellent shopping/residential mix with easy access to the subway. I really liked it because I could get a wash cloth. I knew I needed to bring my own wash cloths to England, but, forgot them, anyway. After 1 week of improvisation I found the Rembrandt had my beloved face flannels, wash cloths! I hate to recommend it too highly everyone will want to stay there and no room for me. RJW	
Feb 4 2005	Worth the Upgrade	Stayed at this hotel a few times when the agent i used stopped offering the Grange Holborn. Fortunately back to using the Holborn now as i prefer the location and standard rooms there but this is a reasonable hotel.The public areas of this hotel are lovely. The bar is particularly cosy on a cold winter night and the windows of the restaurant look out onto a cute looking, traditional, residential street. Definitely one of the best inclusive breakfasts i've had in London.We've only ever stayed in the standard twin room and though clean these rooms are small, unimpressive and a bit dated. We took my parents and booked them into an executive king room - well worth the extra! The room was huge, king size bed, pleasant sitting area with sofa, large dressing table, a bigger bathroom with jacuzzi bathtub and shower and generally better decor.I would recommend anyone staying here to pay that bit extra for a much better room - i'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as my old dears!You get what u pay for and i found this to be a fairly decent hotel for the price.	
Jan 18 2005	A bit worn - but good location 	The room was on the small side of average and the bed/bedding seemed a bit old. The tub was also rather slippery and tall. Otherwise just a standard hotel with very very good breakfast which was included in our rate. The hotel is across the street from the Victoria and Albert museum and near several places to eat and a subway stop. We found it convenient and the staff were helpful.	
Jan 3 2005	Great time over Christmas at the Rembrandt	My husband and I stayed here for nine nights in December of 2004. We were thrilled with the location - it is one of the nicest areas in all of London, very safe, close to the S. Kensington tube stop and Hyde Park. We got a $160 USD rate (including tax) through British Air, which included breakfast.The negatives first: The staff is mostly E. European and very surly; at least it will seem that way to Americans. They will not offer you anything or offer to help you unless you flag them down. But I think this is just par for the course in London. (This excludes the housekeeping staff, who kept our room spotless and were always very nice). Also, the rooms are VERY small by American standards. (We had a double bed and requested non-smoking, which was honored at check-in with no problem) I was prepared for this but my husband is tall and was annoyed at first. Again, this is just typical of London, and it actually forces you to keep your stuff neat. We weren't in the room much anyway, so this was not a big deal to us. The Positives: Everything else. Yes, the hallways and furniture are a little worn, but you can't expect the Dorchester at these prices. The room had a closet with a programmable safe (no extra charge) and tea-making things. It was spotless. CNN etc. on TV. I am very picky about the cleanliness of bathrooms and this one looked brand new, with plenty of counter space. It is still small, but better than I expected. As I've said, the location can't be beat. We felt very safe at all hours, and there are enough shops open close by for snacks and water etc. I even went running in Hyde park a few times by myself very early in the morning and never felt unsafe. This is a great area to stay - the S. Kensington tube stop has three different lines and from there you will be able to get anywhere in London with a minimum of train-changing. This is huge. Breakfast will run about $24 USD, $30 if you get the hot &quot;English&quot; breakfast, which is not worth it unless you have it included in your room rate. We just had the &quot;cold&quot; breakfast included, and it was fine for us. It was a huge buffet assortment of breads and pastries, juices, cheeses, fruits and cereals. We chowed every morning. Also, it goes from 7am to 10 am, which is nice since a lot of museums don't open until 9:30. The hot breakfast is assorted fatty garbage and not worth the damage to your arteries or wallet! As I've said, you do have to wave down the staff for your coffee, but we are ex-New Yorkers and not shy about doing this.The Gym next door is about $12 USD per day; we didn't use it, so I can't comment except to say don't expect it to be free! The hotel has a nice large lounge area with couches and a fireplace - people smoke a lot, which is a bummer, but they have a full bar and food, and free newspapers every morning. It's a good option for dinner if you have theatre tickets and don't need the hassle of finding a restaurant after a long day of sightseeing. The final MAJOR plus is that you can get from Heathrow airport to the S. Kensington tube stop! It is really easy if you can deal with schlepping your stuff, and takes 1 hr door-to-door. Considering that a taxi will easily cost $100 USD from Heathrow, the $5 USD or so tube ticket is a steal.We were there over Christmas (when NOTHING is open on Christmas Day), so we ponied up for their $75 USD Christmas Day feast in the dining room. It was awesome and, like the rest of the hotel, far exceeded our expectations.In summary, we would stay here again in a second. I have stayed in a lot of completely awful places in London, so I know how bad it can get if you're on a tight budget. Just be aware that the room will be small and the staff isn't as cheesy-happy as we're used to in the States, and you should really enjoy your stay!	
Dec 19 2004	wonderful hotel	We had three rooms for three different families over Thanksgiving, and the Rembrandt was an ideal location for our reunion. Comfortable lobby and bar/tea area to gather. Very accommodating for the 2 year old and for jet lag recovery, including holding the restaurant open for us very late. Fabulous breakfast. The public areas were smokey, but that's Europe. Rooms were quiet and spacious. Internet access and CNN made my husband happy. Please note that Children can only swim 9 am- 5 pm, no matter how much they and you beg.Don't forget that the Victoria/Albert Museum directly across the street stays open till 10 pm on Wedn.	
Dec 9 2004	Noisy noisy noisy	Room was noisy, bathrobe smelt of smoke. Won't return	
Dec 7 2004	Thoroughly enjoyed my stay	Reserved my twin room through baholidays and neither my 80-year old mother nor I were ever disappointed with the service, our room, the continental breakfast, nor the location. I've stayed in no fewer than 15 hotels in London and for the price ($144.00) I would definitely return here. I always try to shop for hotels in neighborhoods that are safe after dark, that won't break the bank, and whose amenities satisfy my needs. I am sorry that others submitting their reviews were not pleased with this hotel. Our continental breakfast included 4 juices, a variety of breads, cold cuts, cheese, fresh sliced watermelon and casaba melon (this was mid-November), other stewed/canned fruits, hard-boiled eggs, fresh whole tomatoes, coffee, or tea. We ate heartily each morning and compared our offerings to continental breakfasts elsewhere in the world--a step up!	
Dec 5 2004	Good location worn pricey	I stayed in a single room, November 12-14. The room was about the size of a dorm room single and kind of spartan, but it and the bathroom were clean. What disappointed me were the common areas, the staff, and the breakfast. At check-in you had to get someone's attention as nobody seemed to want to take the next person in line. It was hard to understand the staff - English must be their second or third language. The elevators were grubby, the lobby smelled of stale smoke and really needed vacuuming the whole time I was there. Do yourself a favor and pass on the breakfast. There are so many other places to eat it doesn't make any sense to pay 12 pounds for coffee, toast, and a yogurt, which were the only halfway appetizing items they had. The hot breakfast looked nasty. By the way, the V&amp;A across the street has a great cafeteria with tasty sandwiches, hot meals, desserts... I wish I had found it sooner. The Rembrandt is an okay place, but I am trying somewhere else next time.	
Dec 4 2004	Terrible Staff nice location	We booked a room here for £179 (room 666) and it smelled of stale smoke and looked out onto the air conditioning vents. The room was large with a good sized bed but had air conditioning humming all night. The bathroom was very large with a b-day and toiletries. Breakfast was self-service, undercooked (sausages were pink and the fried eggs were runny) and bitter undrinkable coffee was served by half asleep waiters who kept trying to take your plates away when you weren't finished. It was not up to the standard of a greasy spoon, never mind a London hotel. When checking out we had a slight problem with the bill but instead of being polite the manager used words to us such as &quot;anyone with half a brain&quot; and &quot;tough&quot; which made us leave the hotel feeling cheated by the whole experience. The location is great and if you don't have to interact with any of the staff and smoke like a chimney, you will be fine.	
Dec 4 2004	Good family hotel	Just returned from a 5-day stay with our kid. We booked a triple and therefore got a fairly large room with a single-sized sofa bed. Hotels here generally count kids as room occupants, unlike U.S. where kids stay free. The hotel is older and has a classic, but somewhat worn feel to it. They have floors of non-smoking rooms. Our queen-sized bed was quite springy - but turned out to be comfortable. Sheets are medium/good quality. The fold-out sofa bed was one of those awful, uneven springy kinds, but any kid will be happy with it (mine was). The bathroom was tiny - tight for even one person. But it was recently fully tiled and therefore felt antiseptically clean. Fixtures (faucets, shower head) were high quality Friedriche Grohe, much better than you get in U.S. hotels. It had a large, deep bathtub. Room furniture was cheap, light-weight quality. No drawer space. Ours had trousers press, iron/board, hot water kettle with tea bags and instant coffee, large electronic in-room safe; no mini-bar but we just put drinks out on the balcony to chill! We were on the back side overlooking a small residential street so there wasn't much noise - however, it was clear that the double-paned windows provide virtually no soundproofing. I would stay away from the front of the hotel which overlooks a busy street. One nice thing about the rooms is that they have large floor-to-ceiling windows in high-ceiling rooms, so you get lots of light. Rooms were well cleaned while we were away during the day but the maid usually forgot to replenish some small item like the coffee or washcloth. The staff is entirely comprised of immigrants - friendly but not well trained. The concierges were not only incompetent but misleading. Both concierges had not only never heard about the Golden Hinde sailing ship of the 16th century, but they also had no clue who Sir Francis Drake was. He got a phone number and called but there was no answer so he said it was closed. I got the number from him and when I called later, it was the Golden Hinde Restaurant. The actual ship had been open all day. They also said the swimming pool at the adjacent health club was open 7am-5pm for kids but when we showed up they said it was closed until 12:30 due to classes. By the way, the pool is fantastic, like a Roman spa; the water is very warm, and the dressing rooms/showers are clean, friendly and during midday you get them all to yourself. But as is typical for London, there is an additional charge: pounds 7.5/2.5 for adult/kid per day. Breakfast is pretty basic quality. No unusually good items, except maybe the fresh melons. The scrambled eggs appear to be from a powder mix, the hash browns are in breaded patties like you get frozen and the fruits are from cans (like canned peaches). Get it? The coffee is reasonable - strong. I thought the service was fairly good. The hotel restaurant holds about a third of the guests so if you're late getting there on a crowded weekend there might be a wait. There is a large lounge with fireplace that is comfortable but usually people are smoking. The hotel charges 35p per minute for local calls but you should buy a phone card from a nearby store and dial out to the 0800 number - there's no hotel phone charge for that. We bought America 1st cards - calls to the U.S. were only 5p per minute! There's supposed to be wireless internet in the common areas but it costs a lot. Local internet cafes charge a pound for 15-20 minutes - I recommend the one next to the Lamborghini auto dealership (does this say something about the neighborhood?) across the street from the tube station which has a fast connection and LCD monitors (open 9am-9pm).The Rembrandt is across the street from the V&amp;A Museum, which is convenient to pop over just for an hour browse. Next door are the Natural History and Science Museums - the latter has an IMAX. All have free admission and interactive activities for the kiddies - my kid even liked the V&amp;A (go to the British Rooms). The South Kensington tube stop is about 3 blocks away. This is a very convenient station since it's on the green/yellow lines as well as the Piccadilly line which takes you direct to the theater district around Covent Garden. Families can get family day passes from the ticket vending machine - one of the few good values in town. The station's in a neighborhood with shops, covenience stores, internet cafes and restaurants. I recommend Carluccio's (Italian - informal, friendly, great food, not expensive - for desert try the affagato or vanilla gelato with thick Fiorentina chocolate), Crepes de Hampstead for a late night snack, or the Thai Square. Harrod's is a 5-minute walk down the street from the hotel. The surrounding neighborhood is very upscale. We felt safe walking the streets at night. In general, this is not the well-run luxury hotel but it's a good value (by London's expensive standards) especially for families.	
Nov 29 2004	Thumbs Down	Pros: The lobby and reading rooms were very spacious and nice. The concierge was very kind in holding our luggage for a couple of days while we flew to Scotland. The location was AWESOME, with so much to do within walking distance.Cons: The room was too small to hold our luggage and us comfortably (two of us w/one suitcase a piece). The prices of food were outrageously high. Innapropriate materials were being advertised in the room, especially if you were to have a family staying there. The swimming pool was in the NEXT building, you had to go outside to access it, and you had to pay extra. On the website it appeared to be very much a part of the hotel. It was March when we went, so no way we were going outside wet to get back to our room. Very dissapointing. Overall, I would not stay here again.	
Nov 29 2004	rembrant	I thought the location was great. The museum across the street is top notch, and Harrods is just up the street. The tube is about a half a mile away, and there's a handy little tea stand out front. But, the rooms are pitifully small, and expensive, for what you get, which is basically a balcony overlooking the street. We had to put half ouf our suitcases on the floor for lack of room, and we only had two suitcases. The breakfast is so outrageously priced it's not even a consideration. It's about 30 dollars per person American money. Um. . . no thanks. The staff is freindly enough, and held our bags for a few days while we ran off to Scotland. That was nice. The lobby is nice.Overall it's a nice place, if you don't plan to spend much time in your walk in closet. . . er. . . room.It's just a bit pricey. I ordered a pizza and two beers from room service and it was over 40 pounds.It won't be my first choice when I go back to London.	
Nov 6 2004	loved it!	I have just returned from a two night stay in The Rembrandt. We were in a superior double room which was spacious and comfortable. The bed was huge! The bathroom was on the small side but then we did not go to spend time in the bathroom! We found it to be a great location within easy walking distance to Harrods and Sloane St and for reasonable cab fares to many other places.(even though the South Kensington and Knightsbridge tube stations are close by,we were being lazy!)The English breakfast was tasty and more than adequate to 'set you up' for the day and the staff were polite and attentive. I would definitely stay at The Rembrandt again and I would recommend to others.	
Nov 1 2004	Great Hotel! Great Location!	I stayed in room 349 on October 23, 2004. Unfortunately, I only had one night in London, but when I go back, I would definitely stay at this hotel. The hotel couldn't be in a better location. Very posh London neighborhood and less than 5 minutes walk to Harrods.The hotel was extremely clean! There was even a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. The staff could have been friendlier and more knowledgeable about the area and the attractions and tours, but the overall experience of the hotel is what counts. The breakfast had plenty to choose from and the room service was delicious!When I got back to London, I will definitely stay at The Rembrandt Hotel again! :-)	
Oct 28 2004 	The worst hotel experience ever	I am a Front Office Manager in a 5 diamond establishment and this hotel is just dreadful. We arrived at 5pm and had to wait for our room which wasn't ready!! We arrive in the room - standard of cleanliness disgusting. Service at breakfast was a joke, we had to ask for tea and coffee (which was tepid in temperature) and toast. The most ridiculous thing of all is that you have to pay to use the leisure facilities!!!!! Over all this hotel is the worst that I have ever stayed in and I would not recommend it to anyone...quite shocking really!	
Oct 5 2004	We shall return!	We stayed 10 days in late September, having received an excellent deal through British Airways. We had heard all kinds of horror stories about lousy but expensive hotels in London, but I must say the Rembrandt put our fears to rest. Everything about this hotel met or exceeded our expectations. The included continental breakfast was sumptuous and the wait staff very attentive and friendly. Our room was clean and large. We would recommend this hotel unreservedly and will stay there again the next time we come to London.	
Sep 27 2004	2nd time there and we'll go back	My wife and I recently completed our second stay at the Rembrandt in London; 9-6-04 to 9-10-04. The rooms are above average, with the usual amenities, room safe, hairdryer, but also a trouser press, a small tea and coffee locker, as well as a whirlpool tub.Service and concierge are top notch, they quickly booked us a Tower of London tour at a reasonable price. The location is outstanding, walking close to Harrods, the V&amp;A museum, Natural History musum, and Buckingham Palace. Kensington Square and Tube stops are literally outside the door.Best of all the full breakfast in the dining room, with eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, etc, included with the room was super. We got a great promotional rate from their website. This place is a winner.	
Aug 30 2004	A Favorite- For the Money that is.	I stay in standard rooms when I stay here; it is affordable and a free huge great full english makes it a bargain. It's not as charming or english feeling as hotels in the same area/star range (raddisson edwardian vanderbilt for example) But you can't beat it at this price range. Honestly, I've stayed in blander dirtier louder places at the same price. If you are looking for something special in London, pay extra. But if you can handle a little dingy but clean decor, good for you:) Ask for extra pillows as they are thin! the staff is friendly enough to handle requests like this. The neighborhood is nice and quiet too. and the rooms arn't as small as some london hotels; you can easily have friends over.	
Aug 10 2004	The Rembrandt is a very good value	I just returned from a week at The Rembrandt. Previous notes on this site convinced me that it had many more positive than negative points and my mother and I really did enjoy our stay (thanks to all!!!).Our room was a little small, but totally charming -- with two floor-to-ceiling windows that do open along with nice, white, guauzy curtains. We did not have A/C in our room either, but the fan (combined with low humidity outside) largely made up for the loss. But I love getting lots of sun and the hotel was full of it, from our room, to the large lobby,and the lovely and very spacious dining area. We had continental buffet breakfast included with our British Airways package and it is more than enough and quite tasty! Another pleasant surprise is that management-looking people checked on the cleanliness of the rooms and public spaces EVERY day!True, service at in the bar/lounge area outside of the dining room was spotty at best (a &quot;twist of lemon&quot; might as well have been a long, lost language phrase to the bartenders and I could have served myself much quicker), and the concierge assistance quality depended upon who was manning the desk. But the excellent front desk help, the convenience of two tube stations, a 10-minute walk to Harrod's, and a delightful neighborhood more than make up for the few short-comings. If you want a good deal for your money, don't hesitate to consider The Rembrandt.	
Jul 20 2004	We are going back	My wife and I stayed at the Rembrandt in August 2002 for four nights. The location is superb, across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum, very close to Harrods, Buckingham Palace, and tube stops.The rooms are nicely done, older, but well cared for. The staff is very attentive, and the breakfasts are great in a very comfortable dining room.We are going back in September for four more nights. Highly recommended.	
Jul 19 2004 	Thumbs up for The Rembrandt Hotel!	I recently spent two weeks at the Rembrandt Hotel in Knightsbridge. I shared a spacious standard double room with a friend and we enjoyed being walking distance from Harrods, Hyde Park, and Piccadily--never mind being minutes from two tube stations (South Kensington and Knightsbridge). The staff was friendly and the breakfast included was great. I especially enjoyed having discounted fees at the adjoining fitness center which provided salon and spa services (swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room). My only complaint would be that the bathroom pipes were a bit noisy at times and the room decor could use some minor upgrading. Beyond this, it was a great place to stay and I would definitely stay there again.	
Jul 17 2004	Choose another Hotel! Don't Bother with the Rembrandt	Stayed in the Rembrandt in Sept of 03. Weather was unseasonably warm and beautiful and my room had no A/C-although they provided a standing fan (can you believe it?). In addition to this my room was on the sunny side of the street which would heat the room! I think that some rooms have AC and others don't b/c my travel partner had A/C!The breakfast was less than mediocre so I would suggest a local McDonalds instead! The proximity to shopping is the ONLY thing that that this hotel can offer! Try another!	
Jun 30 2004	Lovely Hotel	We loved the Rembrandt! Excellent location, across from the V&amp;A, many delightful restaurants nearby. Our room was clean and large (esp. by London standards) and our marvelous bathroom had a tub in which I could sink up to my neck in bubbles. The staff was friendly and helpful. Only a couple blocks to Harrod's and the neighborhood is wonderful. The only downfall was the street noise. It was a beautiful summer day so we wanted our big huge windows open, but the noise and fumes from the vehicles below was both deafening and nauseating. However, it was well worth the view of a beautiful London street. We loved it and plan to return next spring.	
Jun 14 2004	I dont recommend this hotel	I dont recommend this hotel for 161+ a night. It should have A/C and the room where never clean properly. Would you believe that if you leave a dirty glass it would be pickup? I have to call management because for two days we had 4 dirty glasses and two buckets of ice not pickup. I guess for a hotel that they charge 5+ pounds to upgrade your breakfast of scramble eggs and hot links and that they charge 25+ pounds for cleaning a dress, it should have better rooms. Find another hotel. We stay from June 5 to June 10 and we where not able to get a phone service card in order to have room service, I had to call operator for everything, Even the room service never show up. I had to go to the bar to get ice myself and clean glasses. They even refuse to give you a bill at the end of your stay if you pre-paid your hotel. So you dont have any record you stay there, they have your credit card number......	
Jun 8 2004	A Very Comfortable stay	This hotel is easy to find, being almost opposite the V&amp;A museum. It is on a busy road, so ask for a quiet room not facing the front of the hotel (we could see the V&amp;A side on from our window). We had an Executive room, which had a huge bed, pillows which have seen better days, but were usable, tv/ironing board/trouser press etc. The bathroom was adequate, with a whirl pool bath to relax you after a hard days sightseeing. Air conditioning was efficient, but noticed a constant &quot;humming&quot; noise even when turned off in the room (this could be just the room we stayed in (room 653). Staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is self service, even down to the toast, which is unusual for a 4* in London, but it does set you up nicely for the day. 10 minutes walk from Harrods/Harvey Nicholls. All in all, a nice stay!	
May 13 2004	Lovely Hotel	Loved this Hotel! First trip to England and found our best location in The Rembrandt. Walk to the Big Bus Tour, Harrods and the V&amp;A. Friendly staff, fantastic concierge. Loved the breakfast room. Only one word of warning, the fire doors are so loud at night. Try to get a room far away from the other guests slamming these doors. 	
Apr 29 2004	Quiet location. Very nice hotel	We used to stay at the Rembrandt all the time and only switched when the Airport bus no longer stopped in front. Ask for a room overlooking the Victoria and Albert Museum...fabulous!Very cozy lounge and good food. Very good value.If you are going to the West End theatres, you'll have to take the Underground or a cab. You can walk to Harrod's though and you might be able to see it all lit up at night from your room if you stick your head out the window!I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet location who is interested in the museums. The hop-on-off tour bus also stops right near it which is a plus!	
Apr 14 2004	What a delight!!	Let me preface my comments by saying the only other time I have stayed in London was in a private residence that you rent by the week (found thru 'In The English Manner') and it was dynamite. So this is a first for hotel living and I found it extremely pleasant. Stayed from March 30 thru April 2. Found the price per night of $144.00 US to be a great price. The hotel upgraded us (without charge)from a 'standard twin room' to an 'executive twin room' that had a sitting area and whirlpool tub. The hotel is charming, has character, is located in a favorable area...near Harrods, across from V&amp;A close to South Kennsington tube station. The staff is helpful, congenial, welcoming. I plan to stay their again.	
Apr 13 2004	Rembrandt	I found this to be an excellent small hotel in a great location. The lounge is very inviting, the rooms were just what a weary tourist needs &amp; it is located close to a great restaurant &amp; other facilities. The staff is excellent. A suburb bargain &amp; will probably always make it my London headquarters.	
Mar 5 2004	Rembrandt Relaxation	We returned March 2 from 6 nights at Rembrandt Hotel. Excellent Knightsbridge location, about 3 blocks from Harrod's and Harvey Nichols. 5 minute walk to South Kensington underground. Nicely decorated, some redone rooms. We started with a smallish twin but were allowed to transfer at no charge to double bed room, a bit larger. All very quiet and clean. Excellent staff members, friendly and knowledgable. Great concierges. Good breakfasts, excellent quality dinner buffets, also alacarte items and cozy bar with fireplace. Free newspapers daily. Adjacent to a health spa with discounts for Hotel guests. Can't rate as &quot;excellent&quot; as compared to very high-end properties ie Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park which is 4 blocks away, but a wonderful price value esp. if booked through BritishAirways. We would return gladly!	
Feb 3 2004	Traditional and Excellent	I went to Rembrandt for my second trip to London, and my stay was as enjoyable as the first! The food was fantastic, the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotels decor was lovely! It was very warm and cosy and a joy to stay here!	
Jan 30 2004	Disappointing experience	Our 3-night stay at the Rembrandt was a bit disappointing.Disturbed by the guests next to our room due to poorly soundproved wall, we didn't sleep well as they watched TV until midnight and set their TV timer to wake up at 5:45am! Although we asked them to turn down the volume, we could still hear their TV distinctly.At the checkout, the cashier charged my credit card directly in USD instead of Pound using the hotel exchange rate (3% higher than the bank rate) without notifying me in advance. I noticed it afterwards on my way to the airport but it was too late.Their English breakfast is not worth spending your money. It only offers very limited variety of food.For the price I paid, I won't stay there again.	
Jan 5 2004	Convenient location	We stayed at the Rembrandt between Christmas &amp; New Year's as part of a British Airways package. The location was fantastic but the hotel itself a bit worn around the edges.Save for one charming and helpful desk person, most staff were not particularly welcoming. It might have been the effect of the holidays and associated increased visitor volume.The hotel is quite adequate but nothing to rave about.	
Nov 28 2003	Found Our London Home!	I found this hotel through a lot of internet searching because I was looking for a very central location, close to tubes and busses and near museums, stores and restaurants. This was perfect. When we had a London friend scope it out for us, she said that she thought it was excellent but she didn't realize that we wanted something so &quot;upscale&quot;. She was staggered at the price we were offered. We visited in November so we got upgraded; a little larger than other rooms we saw being cleaned. But the beds were good, armoire, tea cabinet, luggage rack, desk with chair, in room safe, table with two chairs and a sofa! Plenty of light which is unusual in English hotels and B&amp;B's. Bathroom had terry robes, usual amenities, marble floors and a Jacuzzi. Public rooms are nice and the staff is very friendly and anxious to serve. Amazing full English breakfast. Ambience is a little shabby around the edges (which we liked) but the brass was polished brightly and we felt warm and welcomed. And, did I mention, they have non-smoking floors! No real view because we asked for a very quiet room, but the windows opened. Can't wait to go back!	
Nov 14 2003	Rembrandt Hotel	I booked a room at the Rembrandt through a great website called wotif, which I discovered through recommendations by some mates from Oz, and the website offered discounted hotels all over the world, all quite cheap...and I chose the Rembrandt as it was central and close to Knightsbridge shops and the Natural History Museum. The room I had was clean and had all the necessary amenities and room service if you were feeling particulary flush! Service was good and staff were helpful, and the breakfast was nice and fresh. Overall, a great stay at a bargain price, and I would definately recommend you all to use wotif for last minute rooms on the cheap!	
Nov 14 2003	Everything it advertised	I stayed at the Rembrandt for 3 nights in July, 2003 and was very pleased. My room was large and clean. I loved the location; quiet enough but a block away from a metro stop and walking distance to shoppping and Buckingham Palace (it was a 20 minute walk to the Palace). The weather was gorgeous while I was there so I was very comfortable with the room temperature. It was nice to have a spa next door, although I was too busy seeing the sites to use it! I'd stay here again.	
Nov 5 2003	Just perfect and good value too	A friend and I spent 4 nights in the Rembrandt just now (November, 2003) in a Twin Executive room, and we'd go back in a heartbeat. The room was a decent size, the bathroom very fresh and up-to-date; we loved the location right near the V &amp; A &amp; the South Kensington tube station. I was delighted with the availability of the heatlh club and spa in the building, and had a wonderful and restorative massage that improved my whole experience of London. The breakfast room is large and bright, the breakfast a standard English breakfast (hot, plentiful, with the usual weird sausages &amp; nice grilled tomatoes, and imitaiton coffe) -- we were very happy with it, and with its being included in the price. There is also a lovely lounge in the lobby, with lots of sofas and a fireplace, which we liked for a nightcap. We booked through hotel-assist for L139 in a fairly busy week in London.	
Sep 29 2003	Staff is wonderful	The Rembrandt staff was friendly and helpful and the room was very nice and had a warm ambience to it. We had an executive king room with AC and I would recommend the rooms with AC. Heard several complain about the heat and stuffy feeling in the rooms with no AC. The upper portion of our room windows opened for fresh air. The included breakfast was generous but somewhat plain. Housekeeping was excellent. Ice had to be ordered from room service, somewhat inconvenient. Overall, a wonderful hotel and I would stay again.	
Sep 17 2003	Would stay again	Went to London with 2 friends over Labor Day weekend. We had an executive room, the only ones with air conditioning. We were a little skeptical due to the price to stay, which included breakfast. But, thankfully, everything was great. The hotel is in a great location, close to a few tube and bus stops. The staff was nice and friendly. I would recommend this hotel for your stay.	
Sep 16 2003	Location is great--except we may not return there	We were unfortunately in London during the great HOT spell in early August. The location for the Rembrandt is great, just a short walk from Harrods with the subway and bus stops conveniently located. BUT, the hotel is not all air-conditioned and the first night we spent in a miserably hot room with just a circulating fan which just proved to be impossible for both myself and my husband.The next day we requested and was moved UP to an air-conditioned room but the manager initially would not honor the rate we had been quoted when we reserved on the Internet. When we were ready to check out and I had the confirmation at the Internet rate, the manager on board credited me with the additional 20 pounds we had paid. Imagine my chagrin and disappointment when the credit card bill arrived and The Rembrandt had again billed us the additional 20 pounds! With management like that, we would not readily return to The Rembrandt but would look probably at Harrington Hall. We had a chance to go there during our trip and was impressed, the rate was cheaper and the rooms were air-conditioned. signed me disappointed with The Rembrandt
