Nov 22 2009 	Not worth the money - run down - stay at another Hilton Property	I stayed here for two nights. I got a deal on Priceline but a deal in London is different from a deal in the US. I would not classify this as a 4-star hotel, but I had to remind myself that hotels are generally smaller all over Europe. It was dingy and only worth around USD 50 per night. When I complained to the hotel, all I got was some discount or deal to stay again this year. Sorry, but it is not as if I jump on a plane to London for leisure several times a year. I would recommend the Hilton at Paddington, at least from what I could tell from the photos.	
Nov 20 2009	Excellent hotel staff very helpful and friendly food great.	Stayed with my daughter for 3 nights in November (for shopping). Booked this hotel before reading the reviews. Was rather worried that I had made a big mistake after reading them! Couldnt have been more wrong. The staff at the hotel were exceedingly helpful and friendly. The rooms were were very clean and well stocked with complimentary coffee / tea and toiletries (which were all replenished daily). Cannot fault any of the service front of of house, restaurant or cleaning staff. The food was really good especially the breakfast. Would have no worries about recommending this hotel and would definately stay there again.	
Nov 9 2009 	Bearable but a lot left to be desired.	We stayed at the hotel when we were in London for one night, and after staying at the Hilton Kensington, had slightly high expectations. The hotel is incredibly close to Kensington Olympia station, and easy to find. Check in was prompt, and after being given our room keys went in the lift to find our room on the 6th floor. The layout of the hotel, or at least of the 6th floor is completely confusing. After wandering around trying to find our rooms, taking a few wrong turns and very poor signposts to direct us, we finally found our room. First impressions were good, a cool but slightly odd system to turn the various lights on, but not bad. However, the bathroom was one that we would not expect from a supposedly 4 star hotel. With the slightly rusty looking shower, peeling paintwork, and a rather rotten looking door aside, the hair in the bath complete with green splodges and a dingy fabric shower curtain alone were disgusting and disappointing. There was also no light in the bedroom area, so we had to suffice with the rather dim table lights. If it had been a 2 star hotel, I doubt we would have complaints but with the expectations that the 4 star Hilton Brings - we were left utterly disappointed.	
Oct 12 2009 	Decent hotel	We stayed here in November of 2008 after getting the hotel through an on-line deal. Once you get the hang of the Tube, having the Olympia stop just 5 minutes walk makes it easy, and it's a nice leisurely stroll down High Street to the Kensington stop. Rooms were small, but clean, as was the whole hotel. Staff was very accommodating.	
Oct 12 2009 	Four Star - you are joking??	This hotel often appears as a secret hotel on Lastminute.com, so don't be fooled as there is no way it is a 4* hotel. The 'discount' price tends to be the same as a full price for a travelodge room, and to be honest, all the travelodge bedrooms I have stayed in have been better furnished and better decorated than this hotel. The twin room we were in was tiny - just wider than the length of the bed! The restaurant is much more glamorous, and the buffet breakfast options were extensive, and well cooked, but it was a trifle odd to be served soya milk in a tiny tea pot, and tea in a coffee pot with a paper drink mat for a lid!Would I stay there again? Hard one, £90 for B &amp;B on the outskirts of Kensington is good value, but if you feel queasy looking at 1970's baby poo coloured geometric designed carpets, you are probably better off looking elsewhere!	
Oct 8 2009 	Enjoyed our 3 night stay in Hilton Olympia	After reading negative reviews about this hotel we were concerned about staying there but since we got it thru priceline there was no option of not staying anymore. We were pleasantly surprised with the room size, it was a very decent size for London. Olympia station, like others said, is closest but trains don't go there often, so we walked to a busier &quot;Earl's court&quot; station every day. It was not a problem at all even with our almost 4 yr old child. It is about 10 minute of a brisk walk or 15 minutes of walking slowly. There is also Tesco supermarket on the way which we liked a lot - great prices and great variety. Staff in the hotel was useful - answered all questions about the sightseeing and brought us new towels and tea when our child accidentally enabled DND button for the room service. Overall we liked our stay. Don't expect it to be the same as 4 star hotel somewhere in US and don't pay way too much, then you should enjoy your stay too :)	
Sep 27 2009 	shabby and basic wouldn't stay again	I picked this hotel because it was close to olympia, but I would certainly not stay here again. The hotel reception staff were miserable and unhelpful, the lifts to the rooms, were very hit and miss if they were working or not and the overall decor was really shabby and out dated, very disappointing for a Hilton. My single room had terrible lighting, no extra pillows or blankets and the air con system didn't work. The in room info was very poor as was the TV which had no information at all. The bathroom was really quite grim, and silly things like only having one towel, no shaving mirror and dirty grouting all added to the overall air of neglect. I was very disappointed with the whole experiance at this hotel and I think it is very over priced, I think they should be charging no more than £80 per room certainly not £114 for a single.	
Sep 24 2009 	Horrific experience - DO NOT STAY HERE	One of the worst experiences at a hotel. I traveled here for a conference and though it is close to the Olympia convention center it is definitely far from everything, but again that is something they can not do. What they can do is seriously renovate the entire hotel!! When I checked in the room the receptionist was rude and seemed annoyed. I got to my room with no one helping, and long and behold the room has a terrible odor. It smelled as though mildew had accumulated in the vent. The furniture was peeling, the bed was very uncomfortable, it was solely springs hardly a mattress. I went to complain to the manager who said he was sorry and gave me a different room. The second room, the AC did not work and there was no ventilation with the window opened because it was facing the other wall. The carpet had stains all over it, as though someone put bleach every where and again the bed was all springs. I decided to just deal with it because it seems this hotel was crappy all together.I recommend you not staying here at all!!! If you are going to the Olympia convention center there are alternatives, there is the hotel alternative THINK, I saw it on the long route to the tube station.I would rather stay 1 hour away then stay at this hilton.	
Sep 9 2009 	Nice enough for 2 for 1 price.	Stay only if you get the 2 for 1 price, otherwise it is too overpriced. Make sure you get the free breakfast buffet with your price. The hotel is far (if you're walking) from any attractions. But a short train ride will take you anywhere. The room was clean and the staff attentive. We were offered a crib at no extra charge. The concierge was very helpful.The Plum Lounge/Restaurant is comfortable but expensive.The free breakfast buffet was very good. Internet access was very expensive.	
Aug 27 2009 	This was a nice hotel fine location  better then what i expected.	Ater reading review, this place seemed out of the way. Nothing but the truth, there is a subway that runs sporadically next door, but bus service right in front of the hotel takes you to the Kensington high street in a couple of minutes. The room was big and clean, maybe a little dated but who cares. Overall the room for value (booked on priceline) was good. Shower was low for a tall person.	
Aug 26 2009	Hilton Olympia	Great Location Some good restaurants up the road.Hotel Breakfasts very goodExpensive for DinnerTake a look at your mattress though They replaced TV's with flat screen . But my mattress had more DNA then a morgue.No mattress cover very unhealthy Pillows flat no point in having them. Traflagar Bus tours using this hotel Hilton SHOULD have better beds pillows etc. That is What their business is.	
Aug 17 2009 	Stay somewhere else glad to leave here. Old shabby dusty ...	We booked this hotel based upon the information given on the internet... well it could not have been further from the truth. I informed the receptionist about my dissatisfaction with the room and was informed that he would try to get us moved. The room we stayed in was absolutely nothing like those shown on the internet. It was old, shabby, dusty and extremely dated, nothing like we were hoping for. Eventually i was told that to be frank there were no rooms left and there was nothing they could do. I later spoke to the Consiege who said that the rooms were due to be renovated shortly and so they should be!! The location is a little out of the way if you are wanting to explore the whole of London as there is limited service to the nearby tube station.Restaurant was ok but a little chaotic due to it being busy and one of the waitresses had a bad case of B.O. ! Lovely, just what you need first thing in the morning !.	
Aug 10 2009 	old and shabby	I stayed on Friday Aug 8th , and on arrival first impression was not good was given room 672 on the 6th floor, long walk down many narrow shabby corridors finally reaches tiny room with a single bed and small window. Returned to reception and complained and was given another small dingy room but the bathroom was clean. I would have checked out only I had an appointment and did not have the time, the bed was uncomfortable.Had breakfast the next morning in a restaurant on the first floor, the entrance from the lift through a dingy corridor with no natural light or pictures.The choice for breakfast was adequate but the sausages were uncooked and I thought I would become ill at the table and had to make a rapid exit to the bathroom. Never again will I stay in a Hilton Hotel , This hotels best before date was about 20 years ago.	
Aug 7 2009 	Dreadful and glad to leave	I echo all other bad reviews. A 4 star hotel should be much better than this, The room was very old fashioned and dirty. Staff were not very helpful. I'd be writing all day if I mentioned all the bad points. My advice is not to stay here.	
Aug 6 2009 	Never again	I stayed in the Hilton Olympia for no other reason that it was close to the Olympia fair and being a Hilton expected some degeree of comfort and service. My room /Rooms were the principal complaint. Located on the second floor #231 I think, it faced onto the bottom of a shaft where all the pipes from the bathrooms above decended. Simply described a dark grotty room with a dirty restroom like odour. I asked to be moved and asked the manager to look at the room, more akin to a Hostel. He declined and offered the only room he had available a smoking room on the 1st floor. This while the room was OK, stank of stale smoke, and upon opening the window to get fresh air was greeted with all the air conditioning units outside my window. No salvation there either and no option of another room... I have the photos of both rooms and would like to forward them to you so as you see that I am not being in the slightest bit unreasonable. At £262 for two nights there were much better hotels in the area like the K&amp;K hotel the K West and NH Hotel offering better rates for a far superior accommodation.A second minor point was that on arrival for Breakfast on the Monday morning I waited for 22 minutes before being seated. You ran out of plates for the cooked breakfast and suggested we use a bowl or wait further.Simply put it is the kind of experience one would expect from a hostel not a Hilton hotel.	
Jul 30 2009 	never again	stayed for a couple of days and really wouldnt bother again, small room, small window which made it so dark you needed the lights on all the time and this only revealed the grubbiness of the room, I can only describe it as dirty, shabby and run down in need of a refurbishment . The bathroom door had blood (we think - didnt want to get that close to find out) smeared around and near the handle, the bathroom itself was nasty, all the grouting around the bath and shower was filthy - not just mouldy - but dirt that could have been removed with a good clean, it was all round the sink and toilet too. The bed was ok, quite comfortable and the bedding was clean as were the towels so a plus on that side.Stopped for a drink in the bar and got charged £1.85 each for a splash of lemonade ! by bar staff who couldnt have looked more bored if they tried, so used the pub just over the road instead (and found an amazing persian restaurant next door) Breakfast ok, busy, but the restaurant staff were all very nice so you couldnt fault them at all.Shame really, we have stayed at quite a few hiltons around the country and abroad and never really had a bad experience, if the hotel is being refurbished then they really should close down and do it all at once or not book people into the rooms that need doing and advertise themselves as a 4 star hotel when its really nothing more than a 1 star b&amp;b !	
Jul 28 2009 	Only worth the 2 for 1 offer price	Hello,my husband and I just returned from our two night stay in London. The hotel all over was alright.The reception staff didn't make a good impression on us at all. Eventhough most of the staff there are friendly, the nightshift manager was not really so and he didn't even try to be.There was a slight mix up with our reservation, were the reception clerk offered us something entirely diffrent to what we booked. I even thought there was no such thing as a smokers room anymore in the UK, since it is forbiden to smoke in any public place.The room looked worn and oldfashioned as others have already mentioned before. However I was pleased with the bathroom, yet I wouldn't recomend this hotel for people above 1.75 m you might have to sit down to shower. The room was clean, but the kettle on the hospitality tray was not. It was replaced swiftly by housekeeping though once I called them and mentioned it.The breakfast that was already included in the price was really nice and the entire staff at breakfast was friendly and doing there job really well. The hotel is being refurbised. However at the moment it isn't worth fullprice and it is a bit out of the way. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel, but if you are using the tube you should take longer waiting times in account. I hope this review is helpful to you in making a decision.Sylvia	
Jul 25 2009 	A very pleasant stay.	We really enjoyed staying at this hotel and were very pleased with our stay. We got an internet offer of 3nights for the price of 2 and therefore was well worth the money. The staff were very friendlly and extremely helpful from the front desk to breakfast time staff. The breakfast was brilliant; from continental to fully cooked english and made to order omelettes! The room was well furnished and the bed and bathroom were good. Great air conditioning , big tele and powershower! The nearest station is Kensington Olympia - above ground train, a 5 minute walk, although from Earl's Court it infrequently runs, so we walked from High Street Kensington or Earls Court and it took about 15 - 20 minutes. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would reccomend it to others.	
Jul 22 2009 	Excellent hotel and staff	My wife and I enjoyed a weekend break at this hotel and everything was perfect. The room was clean spacious and quiet. The staff were helpful and friendly and the buffet breakfast was good value. Although the Breakfast room can get quite busy there is an option to have breakfast in the bar area which is just as convenient. Although it's not central there are excellent transport links into the city by the number 9 or 10 bus just outside the hotel or the tube a short walk away. The only downside are the bar prices in the hotel, but there are plenty of local pubs/restaurants in the area.	
Jul 22 2009 	Honest view of what was called a 4* hotel in 'Posh' area! NO frills more like!!	Recently visisted the hilton in kensington olympia...right first of all if your not familiar with the area of Kensington and want to stay at this hotel because you think its a nice area then yes it is. However, i booked this holiday with lasminute.com and it was one of their 'Top Secret hotels' basically that means they say there too posh to own up to having cheap rooms on sale. I payed £100 for the night (room only) which was quite alot i thought but lastminute went on about this hotel like it was the dorcherster or something so i was happy to pay. We came into London from surrey and started our journey to the hotel from Waterloo. it is such a mission to get to this hotel. its not on kensington high street where u wud expect the hotel to be. its about a 20 minute walk the opposite end of the street heading out to earls court and hammersmith. there is a bus stop outside the hotel but the hotel is so nothing special from the outside we nealry didnt see it! it was only because there was a car garage next to it that we noticed it. the road it is in is busy all throughtout the night but thats to be expected in london.So the hotel itself....when I went to book in the hotel staff were all foreign. not an english person insight. they didnt have a booking for us which was annoying. the lady on reception wasnt particulary nice about it. after all i had the paper work what more did she want? the lobby was dated and not welcoming at all. as soon as i stepped in i actually thought 'uh oh'... the lifts...well im not one to moan alot...(honestly im only 21 and this is the first review ive wrote) but the lifts took about 10 minutes to get to our floor even though there was four of them!! we went to the 8th floor...the lift stopped on every bloody floor even though there wasnt anyone there! the lift was shabby too. when we (eventually) got out of the lift our landing was also shabby! the capret looked like it had been there for the past 20 years and the paintwork was just shoddy work. we stayed in room 801 and it was basic and boring. totally uninspiring. we could have been staying in a holiday inn or something...i thought the hiltons were meant to be top quality?? er noo....the bed was hard an bumpy...nice big windows tho, curtrains were rubbish. the bathroom was ok but the shower was so stupid it wasnt powered enought. the room was clean though...during the early hours of the morning next door (bless them) had their TV on so loud we could hear everything....and unfortunaly we could hear upstairs partaking in a little 'sexy time' gross!! the price of the drinks in the fridge was rediculous!! £4 for a coke!!!anyway thats enought of me moaning on but i wanted to give people a view from two young 20ish year olds who thought that 4* actually meant 4*!!!dont go here unless there is nowhere better to stay or have low expectations. there are some lovely hotels nearer the local attractions...it took 40 minutes to get to covent garden....an travelling is not cheap as you know.thanks for listeningps dont go here :P	
Jul 21 2009 	Good location tiny sad room	I was in London for a conference at the Olympia Convention Centre and Hilton Olympia is ideally located: 2 min from the conference 10 min from shopping in Kensington. But my room was tiny and not very well renovated. Decent breakfast and good service, though.	
Jul 20 2009 	Shabby hotel tiny uncomfortable rooms and poor service	The Hilton Olympia was by far my worst stay at an American chain--and I've been to my share of Motel 6, Super 8, and Econolodges.London is not a good hotel town. Like Rome and NY, a combination of high rent and the lack of a need to attract tourists mean you pay more than double for a fraction of the quality that you would get at a different kind of city like Philadelphia or LA. Knowing this, I booked at the Hilton rather than taking a chance on an unknown affordable hotel. I thought I could trust the Hilton name--turns out I was wrong.The hotel is shabby and service ranges from indifferent to rude. My room was a shoebox, the smallest room I've stayed in outside of a French hostel. It held one twin bed (I didn't even know it was possible to get a twin bed at a hotel) and didn't even have a bedside table or lamp. The décor was particle board circa 1981. The headboard was a freestanding box, which I learned while trying to fix some screwy wiring behind it. Seriously, Motel 6 offers more amenities--I didn't even get a towel for the bathroom floor. Forget about a hairdryer.The air conditioner wasn't cold, although I was told my air conditioner was, in fact, functioning. You might not think you'd need air conditioning in England even in the summer, but it beats warm, damp air. Oh, and I also discovered while opening my balcony door (don't get excited--it was a tiny concrete thing), that the door didn't actually lock, which seems unsafe. My room stayed warm enough that I slept on top of the comforter--that also helped with the mattress springs. Perhaps instead of investing in mini bars with sensors, the Hilton needs to invest in a mattress without springs poking through. Or at least a decent mattress pad. Oh, and my linens weren't changed until my final day when I left a note asking that they be changed.To cap off my experience, I got stuck in the elevator. It took 15 minutes and a second call asking for help for me to get let out. When I got out, I told the maintenance man that I'd been stuck there for 15 minutes before anyone came. He responded, &quot;not our problem.&quot; I don't know, maybe it was Otis's fault, and if it was, I thought the hotel should know that there's some sort of breakdown in communication in the process. So I went to reception and said I'd like to lodge a complaint and told her about the problems with the elevator. The woman at reception said, &quot;So? What do you want?&quot; Okay. I asked if there was a procedure to make a complaint. She shrugged and suggested a comment card. Fortunately, her supervisor, Stephanie, who is really very helpful and friendly, got the assistant manager, who was nice at least, if not helpful. Meanwhile, I heard a couple complain in the background to reception that all three elevators were down.I used to trust the Hilton name to be at least acceptable. Not anymore.	
Jul 20 2009 	Not That Bad Has It's Good Points	I spent 7 nights at this hotel as part of an Air Transat package in early June and to be honest it really isn't as bad as some of the reviews make it sound. The room was fine, about what I expected, not huge but not tiny either. The bed was comfortable although the foam pillows go very flat when you lie on them. The washroom and shower were just fine, no issues with ceiling height although I'm 6'2. I've stayed at many European hotels and this one is about average.The staff were pleasant and took care of requests in a timely manner. Check-in at 3:00pm was a bit of a pain considering that our flight arrived at 8am (getting us to the hotel by noon), however we hopped on the #10 bus that ran right past the hotel and spent some time getting our bearings and visiting a pub for some lunch and a pint.Things I didn't like were the fact that the air conditioning wasn't on despite the fact that it was quite warm that week, and the fact that the fridge wasn't available to put food and drinks in. The hotel provided a fan for the room upon request that made the temperature more pleasant, and brought an ice bucket whenever we requested it to keep drinks cool overnight.Regarding the Tube and transit in general. The hotel is very close (2-3 min walk) to the Kensington Olympia station that is on a spur line from Earl's Court. Trains run every 20 minutes to and from Earl's Court daily during normal hours. If you prefer not to wait, you can either walk to Earl's Court (about 20 min) or take one of the buses that run regularly along Kensington High Street to the Kensington High Street tube station (about 5 min) which is on the Circle and District lines. If you are planning to be in London for several days I would highly recommend purchasing a multi-day Travelcard from the rail station at the airport (either Heathrow or Gatwick) and using that to get around. They are valid for travel on the Tube, Bus, and Overground in the zones your pass is valid for. Note that the hotel is in Zone 2, so most people will need to get a Zone 1 &amp; 2 pass. Having the pass makes getting to and from the Tube station a simple task, and as there are 3 buses that run past the hotel that stop at Kensington High Street station you should never find yourself waiting more than a few minutes. I personally did not find the location of the hotel caused any issues from a transit perspective, and actually found the fact that it was on a major bus route rather convenient. Hop on the #10 bus and get a 50 min tour of some of the most popular shopping streets in London! When you want to come back, just get on the #10 going the other way.All in all the hotel was just fine. Yes it's a bit old (they are in the process of renovating), but certainly not in a way that makes staying at the hotel unpleasant. It doesn't smell funny and is generally clean. If you are used to 5 star hotels in the US this is going to be a letdown, but if you are used to staying in something alone the lines of a Day's Inn or Rodeway Inn you should find it similar.	
Jul 20 2009 	Excellent choice for London	Stayed for two nights after taking advantage of a two nights for one offer. Was slightly concerned about some negative feedback on here but ended up very impressed.Check in was effortless.Room was large for London and was very clean. Comfortable bed and decent sized bathroom.Breakfast was very efficient with plenty of staff and food was great.Used the olympia station and only has to wait maximum 10mins for a tube train. Buses seem to be plentiful outside.Large bar and its staff were great for leisurely tipple.Hotel to Victoria is about 25 mins on tube.Better value than other, more modern, Hiltons that i've stayed in.Recommend.	
Jul 19 2009 	Great Value for money	Having already booked I read the reviews with some trepidation.However, I found the negative reviews bore no resemblance to the actual facts.Our room was a reasonable size and spotlessly clean.Breakfast was excellent altough we did have to queue for a short while.Only downside was that it was a good distance away from central London. The Underground station is nearby but infrequent.Our party took the advice from this site and took the bus . We seemed to see much more and the numbers 9 and 10 stop virtually outside the hotel.For the money we paid the hotel was great value.	
Jul 18 2009 	Well worth the price	I stayed here in mid June for a 3 day weekend stay. The hotel was very clean, quite and just a few blocks from the tube station. There is lots of buses outside the door that takes you to the main area of London.I walked from the hotel to Hyde Park each day.The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.There is a great moring buffet that kept me full till supper time :-)The staff were very friendly and helpful.There is a laundrymate about 7 min walk incase you have to do some laundry during your stay.*** I booked my stay during the Hilton's 50% off weekend deal they had***	
Jul 16 2009 	Very unimpressed !	Booked this room through Hilton website and requested connecting room as we have a daughter with a mild disability. When we got there the rooms were across the hall from each other and the double room was for a physically disabled person! There wasn't any bottled water in the room, there wasn't a bar fridge, the bed was rock hard and the hotel (except for public areas!) was like something out of the sixties (and smelt like it too!) The lifts were so tiny, that checkout time was an absolute nightmare! When I complained to the front desk staff, they were less than helpful! I feel extremely sorry for any handicapped person that is paying for this room, because I would rate in very, very low on the standard scale! You have to pay for wireless internet ten pound for 24 hours!	
Jul 14 2009 	wait until the refurbishment has finished	My partner and i have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel. Upon check in we were upgraded to a suite (having booked a standard double) which was obviously a nice surprise. The room was on the 7th Floor (735) had a separate lounge and bedroom, had two 42&quot; plasma TVs and the usual mini bar, tea/coffee maker etc. The decor was old and tatty and in desperate need of modernising. The bathroom was small but functional or so we thort! After showering we seemed to have a flood in the bathroom despite insuring the shower certain was inside the bath and properly closed, It would appear that the certain is so thin that water passed straight through it!On first use of the toilet it appeared to be blocked from previous guests.I reported this to reception and they insisted that they would send someone straight up to fix it! some 8 hours later it had still not been fixed so i again called reception and explained. Still no one appeared to fix it! it wasn't until the next day when i when down and asked for a manager that about 20 minutes later someone came to fix it! so we had spend 1 of the 2 days without a unusable loo! It wasn't until the day we were leaving that the biggest problem accerd though, on our way to breakfast we got stuck in the lift! after pressing the emergency alarm twice a gentleman who barely spoke English came on the intercom and from what i could make out said he was trying to get us out! then he disappeared off the intercom! after waiting 10 minutes i again pressed the alarm button but this time it did not even connect to the person! after another 5 minutes of nothing i decided enough was enough and forced the door open my self lucky we ere almost in line with a floor! and managed to get out! we found a member of staff and explained what had happened and although she was apologetic she didn't seem to take any action to close that lift down or report it to anyone! needless to say this shook my partner and i up for some time and really did finish our weekend on a horrible note! On check out i spoke to the Head of the front desk who again was apologetic but didn't take any action! He explained that beginning on the 23rd of this month (July) the hotel was starting a major refurbishment of all areas!including lifts etc!My advise is stay clear until the refurbishment is complete! the location is good if you want to be in kensington, westfields or the olympia centerbut not that close to the tourist attractions although buses are easy to use.	
Jul 9 2009 	Room excellent but poor service	Was fairly concerned about the hotel having read some of the reviews on TripAdviser, however the room I was given (deluxe twin) at the front of the hotel was excellent. However, I had to wait 20 mins to be checked in - even though there were only 2 people in front me of checking in! Room service menu was excellent as was the service. However, the service a breakfast left a lot to be desired - and one of the staff was quite rude! Overall I felt it was a good place to stay - but you needed to let your standards slip on the service front	
Jul 7 2009 	Good Budget Hotel in great part of London	I was somewhat concerned about the Hilton Olympia after having read reviews. It was with some relief that I found it to be better than expected. The location is brilliant with the Olympia and Kensington underground in close proximity. There is a bus station immediately outside the Hotel. The rooms are a bit tired but are comfitable and well serviced. Breakfast was great and well catered. The staff helpful and friendly. Being South African and spolied with excellent hospitality facilities South Africa offers I found the 95 pound a night a bit high but then London has a way of charging a lot for little. Food and beverage prices in the hotel were shockingly high and should be avoid. There is a brilliant Noodle bar across the road and the Indian Resturant Miran Masala also just diagonally across the street from the hotel should not be missed. The Hilton Olympia is a three star hotel loacted in a really lovely part of London.	
Jul 6 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	We got a room for a really good price so expected nothing much. Our room was nothing special but it was good enough for us. We stayed 2 nights and had a fold out couch for our daughter in the room but even when the bed was down we had enough room to get around (just). The location was great. We caught the tube from Heathrow and found our way quite easily. It is only a 5 minute walk from Olympia tube station, even with luggage. Buses also right ouside the door, and lots of shops and restaurants closeby. The foyer and restaurants of the hotel are quite stylish, better looking than the rooms. Breakfast was included in our price and it was fabulous. Would come back again.	
Jul 4 2009 	Nothing special but nothing bad	After reading poor reviews of this hotel, I was a bit anxious about what state we'd find our room in.The room was a bit tired, but fine. Unfortunately, our view from the window was of a brick wall, but since we were only staying for one night, this wasn't a problem.The good points about the room was that it was clean, the bathroom was well-stocked with complimentary toiletries (Crabtree and Evelyn) and that the bed was very comfortable.We found the hotel staff pleasant and helpful - particularly the concierge, who were very helpful in finding us the best public transport routes to where we needed to go.The breakfast is highly recommended. A nice selection of hot and cold buffets, with a pot of tea and fresh orange juice brought to the table.We'd definitely be happy to stay here again, but only at a good rate.	
Jul 4 2009 	did the job for me!	we booked the hotel well in advance and got a half price deal for two rooms. all we needed the hotel for was a base camp while we went to the blur gig in hyde park. i found its location great. right next to the olympia line providing access to hyde park and kings. room was good. slightly hot but then again its been a hot summer. great shower. enjoyed the breakfast. would reccommend if you can get a similar deal	
Jun 28 2009 	Noisy hotel	The rooms are quite cold. Smells damp throughout. We were upgraded to an executive/presidential suite. We ended up making up the sofa bed and sleeping in the lounge as the sound of the person snoring in the other room was unbearable. Some suites are on the corner of the hotel which are slightly quieter from the aspect of other guests but traffic noise is a problem as this hotel is situated on the junction of two very busy roads.The bar is quite nice but get s very busy and often there is no where to sit. Breakfast is a very disorganised affair and again gets very busy, consequently people are sometimes sitting on high bar stools in the bar area eating breakfast. The evening meal is served in the same room poor quality food and highly priced. Service is sketchy from brilliant to abysmal. Overall its handy for the Olympia exhibition centre which is why it gets so busy. Otherwise there are dozens of better hotels in the area to choose from. A word of warning if you want to check out quickly forget it, this is the slowest check out experience in the world. And check your bill closely we have had errors every time.	
Jun 24 2009 	Poor even for Olympia visitors	I stayed at Hilton Olympia because me and colleague were doing an exhbition at the Olympia. The web site promised 4-star accommodation so it seemed like a nice treat!In reality, this hotel is so dated that its 4-star rating is almost an insult.To start with, the hotel couldn't advise me on where to park our exhibition van. I read on TripAdvisor that there is a pay-per-hour car park underneath. Be warned that to park here costs the earth (around £32/day). Instead, we ended up parking at the Motorail car park which is just down the street (£24/day and easier access).The hotel is in a good location for Olympia, but a short walk from Earl's Court. The Kensington tube/rail station is only 2 minutes from the hotel, so you can get around London quickly from here if needed.Although clean and comfortable, the rooms are well passed their sell-by date. My room was far too warm, and the air-con is centrally controlled so when you turn it up to full is just blows out luke-warm air. The room was also noisy because of the main road outside, but I guess its London so I'm not too bothered about that.To get access to the hotels network they charge £15/day, which is a joke considering most other hotels for less money provide it free for guests. Whats more, the network is not wireless, so you have to use the network cable kindly provided in the desk drawer.Then comes the state of the room. Everything looked really shabby. The hot/cold symbol on the bathroom taps had falled off leaving a big unsightly piece of metal. The television was an old analogue signal split down for every room, meaning the signal quality was terrible. The remote also had flat batteries. The corridors were small and dark, like a rabbit warren, and rediculously hot. When we went down for breakfast there was a 15 minute queue for cooked food, and no spare tables. We ended up grabbing some cereals and sitting in the bar area instead (at the request of the staff) to avoid the hassle. In the evening the restaurant prices are pretty expensive (£15 for basic pizza), so I advise to turn left out of the front door and walk down the high street until you get to the restaurant area.So perhaps these are all small problems, but they do add up. The last 4-star hotel I stayed at was immaculate, and at the same price this hotel just does not compete.	
Jun 23 2009 	Don't even think about it......!	This hotel is way off the beaten track - especially when there is a tube strike! The staff were disillusioned and the hotel is very tired. Our room had a window to a kind of internal chimney. The best thing about the hotel is the Costa which is annexed to it - where there is a BT Openzone.	
Jun 16 2009 	Good hotel but staff is not helpful at all	My gf and I spent 4 days in this hotel. I was worried about the review in trip advisor, but turn out the hotel and the room is not that bad. The hotel is not near any big attraction, but the Number 9 and 10 buses will take you to whereever you want in central london.One bad thing about this hotel is the staff. They are not helpful at all.	
Jun 9 2009 	Brilliant!!!!!! Beautiful!!!!!!	My partner booked this hotel for Valentines Day. Can you believe we got a Double Room with breakfast included for £27 as a HotelClub deal. The check in was really quick, staff throughout stay were excellent at breakfast and checking in. The food quality was really good at breakfast aswell. The room is a decent size. Could be bigger and the bathroom could be a bit more spacious but overall Id say people who complain about this hotel just want something to complain about. The hotel and reception area are really nice. When you walk out of the station you do have to walk down a random road as its one of those overhead stations that has an exit on a side road but the road isnt too long. If you come the underground way then a bus stops right infront of the hotel. I would definitely come back but Im not sure if Id stay too long as theres no pool or sauna or anything of the sort.	
Jun 6 2009 	Fine hotel a bit of a challenge for train	I was really excited to find a train on the tube line, but it's an auxillary line and not the most convenient. Still, comfortable hotel and worked out fine for a friend and I rooming together.	
Jun 3 2009 	An old old Hilton without charm	This is not a real Hilton hotel, and absolutely not a 4 star hotel.Bad location (the tube station near the hotel is a secondary one that does not serve the center of London very well). The hotel is located in a non charmy very busy street.Rooms were old and in bad condition (door and window broken).Breakfast was a really good suprise as it was really good.Considering that, price was way too high.I would NOT recommand this hotel.	
Jun 1 2009 	Hilton Olympia London - Fab central hotel!!!	We booked this hotel on lastminute.com (through top secret location) and got a really good deal. After booking i checked out trip advisor and saw the mix off comments so was unsure what was waiting for us. BUT as soon as we walked in the door are minds were at rest, the hotel was lovely, great location (round the corner from Olympia tube), staff were friendly and helpful, and the room (standard double at back) was perfect. We were only there two nights so room was perfect, only issue i had was the hair dryer (after i found it in the drawer) i wish i had brought my own lol!!! We ate one night in the hotel although pricey the food was to die for so worth the money. Would use this hotel again for sure and recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice safe area to stay in.	
May 22 2009 	hiltons in general are lacklustre.	The staff here were nice and friendly, but the room seemed old and ready for a refit. Lamps were falling apart, the TV seemed to have missing parts, and is it me or does anyone find the 'THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC FRIDGE, EVERYTHING YOU REMOVE WILL BE BILLED, TO AVOID INCONVENIENCE, YOU CAN USE A PERSONAL FRIDGE FOR A SMALL FEE' thing a very customer unfriendly move? I dont think any decent 4 star hotel should even charge you for using a mini fridge! This is my second time staying at a hilton and this would be my last. Not worth the money.	
May 13 2009 	Average rooms but good breakfast. Wouldn't recommend for the tall!	Check in was nice and easy, but the staff weren't very knowledgable on the local transport and getting back to the hotel after the tubes finished running.The room was average. Average size, clean but my partner had to crouch to use the shower. His head would have gone through the roof if he stood up straight! He's 6&quot;1. The hotel is very dated and in need of a refit. The only part of it I would rate as 4 star is the restaurant. It has been modernised and the variety of food available was good and fresh. The waitresses were very friendly too.Although it's close to the Kensington Olympia tube station we felt like we were out of it a bit.	
May 4 2009 	Back to the 80"s	What to say? Another Hilton hotel far below the Hilton standards!! Back to the 80's !! Breakfast and dinner ware ok the staff was friendly. I booked including dinner for a remarkable low price.	
May 3 2009 	A great dealcomfortable roomsfriendly staff and unbeatable breakfast	I went there with my friend for a 4 day London trip as a found a great offer on the internet. We were really positively surprised by the Hotel,spacious,nice and clean room, the friendly staff and the brilliant and various breakfast buffet.Enjoy it it is amazing!	
May 3 2009 	Shockingly Bad	What a terrible hotel, I am surprised the name &quot;Hilton&quot; is allowed to be on it. Rooms are small, cramped, and not modern at all. Staff was unpleasant. Food was terrible. Never stay here.	
Apr 28 2009 	old property	Old property. needs renovation. food not proper.	
Apr 28 2009 	Comfortable and convenient	I stayed here for 3 nights and can only complement it. The staff were very helpful and polite, the rooms were clean and comfortable and the food was good.Our business was in Earls Court and it only took 15 minutes to walk there so the location was perfect.	
Apr 28 2009 	Far too hot	I have stayed at this hotel twice. Last year in june we had a large spacious room and I did not notice the temperature being an issue. This year the room was small and the window was directly on to the extractor/air con outside. The room was dark and hot. if you opened the window you had the air con extractors making a noise and during the night the room was unbearably hot. I would prefer not to stay here again!	
Apr 19 2009 	I wouldn't stay here again	Not what I expected from a 4* Hilton. The whole place was too hot and our room was like an oven (in April!). The air conditioning made no difference even when we left it on it's lowest setting for hours. Opening the window wasn't an option either as this hotel is on the junction of 2 very busy main roads - ear plugs definitely required if you want to get any sleep. The room was small and cooked breakfast wasn't good either. Be aware that the nearest underground station (olympia) has an infrequent service.	
Apr 9 2009 	a nightmare in london	We booked the hotel due to the location. After checking in and seeing our room we checked out immediately. This hotel is due for renovation - the reception manager confirmed when asked. The hotel feels like a fire trap. There are holes in the wall trims, the floor in the bathroom had floor stains, the double glazed windows didn't stop the traffic noise. The place is very tired, the staff were excellent but that could not make up for the state of the place. We were in London with a car and although there is a car park beside the hotel the entrance from the car park was disgusting. Do not stay in this hotel if you can help it.	
Apr 7 2009 	Avoid if at all possible	We (a couple) stayed March 27th-30th, and April 4th-5th. This was booked as part of a tour of the UK with Trafalgar tours - it is their hotel of choice. In short - the hotel is old and tired, the Pub restaurant is overpriced. The location is good, given the excellent London bus and Tube service, and local restaurants. The hotel staff were excellent - very courteous and helpful - but that does not compensate for the quality of the hotel itself. Our first room was replete with lots of mold - the staff did find a cleaner room for us. The hotel was extremely hot - heat was on constantly and the air conditioning was not turned on. One had to leave a window open to endure the room, and put up with the noise from the street, or from the mechanical services behind the hotel. Avoid !!!!	
Apr 7 2009 	I'd like to return	I can say it short; spacious rooms, bathtub in the bathroom, big beds and a nice breakfast with a large choice.	
Apr 1 2009 	Hotel OK - but did not sleep much	Stayed here for 2 nights, weekend of 20 and 21 March. The hotel is located at the western end of Kensington High Street. Olympia tube station is just around the corner and plenty of buses stop outside the hotel, e.g. no 10 to Oxford St and no 9 to Piccadilly. We arrived at about 3 in the afternoon, check-in was prompt and efficient.The room was a decent enough size if a little dated. However, it was stifling hot inside despite the outside temperature being about 10 centigrade and near to freezing at night. We left the window open and when we returned that evening the room was still very hot with a fan making a constant whirring noise. I reported this to reception. They did send someone up and fixed the noise but the room was still very warm. This might not be an issue for many travellers but we both like our bedroom to be at best room temperature and preferably much cooler than that (at home, we would never have the heating on in our room unless it was extremely cold outside). As a result we both had two very restless nights sleep.I fail to understand why hotels insist on having rooms so hot, surely it would make sense to leave the heat off and allow the guests to turn it on themselves if necessary. I have heard that U.S. visitors like their heat so maybe its to please them that its done but from both a comfort and environmental perspective, I feel it just does not make sense.There was a good choice of breakfast both hot and cold. If you have no problem with a very warm bedroom, then I would say this hotel is ok but it would put us off staying here again.	
Mar 24 2009 	Okay but a little remote	I didn't choose this hotel. I stayed here with a tour group. The room was fine, nothing special. Don't expect anything really nice. I thought the location was okay, but a little remote. I didn't pay for the hotel, so I can't speak to the value, but if I was returning to London I'd definitely do some research on other options before booking this hotel.	
Mar 24 2009	Ended up staying elsewhere	I stayed at this hotel in January 2009 and was horrified by the state of my accommodation. To put it simply this is the worst hotel that I have stayed at ever. Ripped bed skirts, dirty marks on the wallpaper, filthy dirty carpet (about 20 years old) not good if you suffer from asthma or allergies. Toilet coming away from the wall. Water pressure in shower non-existent and dirty corridors. I did not stay the full week and ENDED UP ESCAPING TO ST. MARTINS LANE HOTEL WHICH WAS FABULOUS.	
Mar 14 2009 	Perfect city escape	I booked this hotel because of a discount offer, for one night and I wasn't expecting too much based on the price to be honest. But the room we got was amazing. It was very big, with a very big and comfortable bed. Bathroom and other facilities were in good condition and clean. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and the environment was very warm and friendly. We had a great stay in Hilton Olympia and although I am not sure if all the rooms are same size; I would definately recommend this hotel.	
Mar 10 2009 	Never Again!	Now I know why this hotel is cheap! Bad service, small rooms, terrible carpet...I could go on. The lights in my room wouldn't work and the only answer that I got was, &quot;Sir you have to wait till 8a.m&quot;!!!	
Mar 9 2009 	Comfortable and convenient	We booked due to the 1/2 price Hilton offer as we were planning to attend an event at Olympia. After reading some of the reviews, we were pleasantly suprised with this hotel. The rooms are small and are not suitable for more than a couple of nights but we found them to be clean and comfortable. We were very impressed at all the staff we spoke to as all were friendly and helpful beyond expectations. The location is excellent for Olympia and convenient for London sightseeing too.	
Mar 6 2009 	Ready for a re-fit but perfectly OK	Ours was a one night stay and the Hilton Olympia was in the perfect location for us. I'd requested a refurbished room, and whilst this wasn't available I was allocated a good sized room overlooking High Street Kensington. The room was perfectly OK, had signs of wear and tear and seemed to be due for a substantial refit rather than a simple lick of paint. It's worth noting that rooms seem to vary considerably in size and shape and this may well be a factor when people rate this hotel. Staff were all lovely and breakfast was good. We paid £75 B&amp;B via Lastminute and consider that good value for money.Rated 'average' overall as the hotel doesn't enjoy the best transport links to central London and is in need of an overhaul. Refurbishment of the bedrooms would probably result in a 'very good' rating.	
Mar 2 2009 	Ok but only just!	I recently stayed at the Hilton Olympia during a business trip. Travelling from Heathrow Airport my advice would be to take the tube, however, please note that the Olympia line is only open if there is an event on at the adjacent Olympia centre. Otherwise a taxi or bus ride is required from the city centre.Upon arrival the lobby is clean and tidy, bar and restaurant is relaxing and inviting. Unfortunately this is let down by the standard of service. The waiting staff never seemed to know what the specials were, and seemed completly bemused if you asked for a variation to teh standard menu. The bar food prices seemed to be a bit on the steep side for wat you actually got, and ALWAYS check you bill as there seems to be alot of mysterious additions if your not careful.The room was adequate but very tired looking. mould around the bath and tiling no the cleanest. The room temperature was also on teh cold side and the thermostat didnt work. TV reception is very poor and pay-per-view tv is not reliable. Adult movies always seemed to be playing, which might be a bonus for some, but if you were staying with children, this would be of great concern as they would be able to access them easily.The corridors were in poor condirion, with carpet being held down with black tape and food trays and used bedding lying about constantly.All in all a dissapointing stay.	
Mar 1 2009 	Good if you get a good price	I stayed at two Hiltons during my last trip and was really surprised at the difference in quality, despite both being 4 stars. But I have to say, this hotel isn't bad or anything at all. Standard rooms with what you would expect, but I don't think I would rate it above 3 stars.There is a nearby tube stop, Olympia, but I was told by the staff that it is very infrequent and that it was better to walk to High Street Kensington.It is a good choice if you get a good price, but if you want a real four star hotel and can get another one, do that.	
Feb 21 2009 	Much better than expected	After reading the reviews I expected shabby, grimy and somewhere far from everything but the room I got (at a substantial discount) was really nice: clean, spacious and a very good bed. The bathroom was in need of a minor make-over, but everything worked just fine. Breakfast was good the first morning but stale and tired the next - I wonder what had happened? The hotel is not located near the touristic parts of London but in a more local area.	
Feb 2 2009 	Never again	I thought this would be a good hotel, since it was a Hilton. Sadly, &quot;good&quot; began and ended with the lobby. My room was extremely small - the one bed barely fit. The bathroom was small as well, with a VERY low ceiling. Luckily, I'm short, so I did not have to crouch as I showered (some of my colleagues had to). The fans in the room were noisy, which made it hard to sleep. The water in the shower alternated between freezing cold and scalding hot.There are a couple of very nice restaurants close to the hotel. My recommendation is to avoid the Plum Bar and Grill in the hotel. The food is uninspired and the staff isn't very helpful. They are slow (30 minutes for a sandwich) and often forget about orders. The breakfast is standard hotel fare, but very expensive considering how basic it was. (Continental was £14.)There is no tube station in the immediate area. 10 minutes walk will take you to the Olympia, but there are very few subway trains there, as it is a commuter train station. 15-20 minutes will take you to a &quot;real&quot; tube station.	
Feb 2 2009 	OK for half price!	My opinion is very biased as I had just checked out of the Paddington Hilton,but the Olympia Hilton is disappointing.1. The room was large but very,very cold &amp; the heating was inefficient2. upper floorsare quite shabby compared to the lobby, carpets are worn,walls are marked - a bit run down3. staff kept trying to bring us things that had been 'forgotten' &amp; then hanging about for tips. Never did get enough towels.4. Breakfast is OK, but there are so many people that it is like a bad canteen -huge queues!5. No problems with the road noise but a dispiriting view of a tax office!More importantly I could not find any disabled access to the restaurant and the staff watched me struggle up the four or five steps from the escalator, then tried to show us to the table furthest from the buffet which meant threading between several tables - hardly feasible with my limited mobility!I did book at a bargain price,certainly not worth the rack rate!	
Feb 2 2009 	Better than expectations!	We have just returned from a weekend in London to see our children who live all over the capital. We decided to stay at the Hilton Olympia as they were offering a really good deal - £54 a night for a double room including breakfast.I can't tell you what a pleasant surprise the hotel was and I would wholeheartedly recommend it. Check in was a breeze. Our room was large with a king sized bed and full bathroom. Breakfast was unbeatable and I've stayed at the Banyan Tree in Bangkok! But what made it even better was the staff. They are the most friendly and helpful staff I've ever encountered in a London hotel.Some other reviews complained about the location - get a life! The Kensington Olympia station is a 2 minute walk away and trains leave for Earls Court every 15 minutes and it's quiet so you're guaranteed a seat. I would definitely return and hope to do so soon.	
Jan 30 2009 	Average Hotel inconvenient to tube	Hotel was clean enough, although some of the other people on our trip didn't find it so. We were looking for a hotel near Earl's Court because of a convention and decided to stay at this one. Earl's Court was about a 10 to 15 min walk from the hotel. Not bad if it wasn't raining, but a pain to walk in the rain. We would have been better off getting a hotel near the district or picadilly lines and taking the underground to get to Earl's Court. Not surprisingly, the Earl's Court underground station is directly across the street from Earl's Court exhibition stadium.Hotel was old and showing its age, breakfast was good. I love that the windows open in the hotel room. Although there was considerable road noise, the fresh air was worth it. It would have been a rating of 2 if the windows would not have opened. Look for a cheap rate, not worth premium pricing.	
Jan 28 2009 	Good value	We got a reduced rate for the room for a Saturday night stay. We were quite disappointed with the room (small and dated) but perhaps had too high an expectation. We arrived early and were told there was no chance of an early check in (before 3pm) but eventually managed to get into a room at 1pm. 3pm is a ridiculous time at the weekend. The original staff member who said no early check in threw us filthy looks when we tried again which was very off putting. The shower was only luke warm which would be my biggest complaint and there were long queues for breakfast too.Overall, due to the low rate paid (£62) and convenience to the train station (Ken Olympia) it was reasonable and I would stay there again for a similar trip and a similar rate. I would not be happy with full price rates however.	
Jan 27 2009	Friendly staff but the rest disappointing!	Since our room was reduced from £116 a night and was rated 4* we expected a nice room and an enjoyable stay.Although the staff were nice, our stay was disappointing since we couldn't get anything warmer than tepid water, we spent an hour in a queue before we could sit down for breakfast and there was a noisy generator outside which got louder at around 8am. Another family were also complaining since there was a gone-off milk left in their room when they first checked in.I think for the price, and the fact that it's a London hotel the price is reasonable, we just got our hopes up a little too much since the room was on offer.	
Jan 19 2009 	Needs Renovation. Far from Central London	I booked the hotel for just one night because I had one extra day left of my holiday and decided to spend it in London. Booked a Rewards Point stay. The hotel is probably category 3 or maybe 4 so the amount of points spent were well reasonable.The hotel is well out of the way from any Central London location and travel point. You have to change 3 to 4 underground stations to get there. But once you do arrive, the hotel from outside looks well in need of a facelift. The lobby however is modern but a bit small area though. Escalators take you to a floor above where restaurants are aplenty. The room was was spacious but was in a desperate need of change. The beds, curtains and the sofa was just like it was bought from a second-hand furniture shop. The bathroom was O.K . Good enough room with a clean shower, floor and evrything else that you would expect now. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly and good at their job. Overall a standard sort of experience but I would not stay here again purely for the reasons that because it is very hard to get to and from central London, from London Hilton Olympia. Very hard. Although quite reasonable rates.	
Jan 15 2009 	Interesting!	I got a good deal at this hotel through the Hilton 'New Year sale' and thought £54 for a single room including breakfast was fine.Room pleasant although heating not very efficient and, strangely, no cold water in the bath.The breakfast buffet was plentiful and good quality but very canteen-like with little charm.I'd agree with previous reviewers about the conciege - very dismissive of Olympia tube station right next door - even claiming wrongly that trains only run every half hour ( they run four times an hour and you can call Transport for London to get the times....)Nearby Persian restaurant Yas is worth investigating - and it's open 'til 5am!	
Jan 10 2009 	Acceptable if the price is right.	Booked through Priceline for $80/night ($196.86 for two nights including all taxes and fees). Considering the hotel is in London, I thought the rate was more than reasonable. I did read the review on TripAdvisor ahead of time and viewed the photos, so I was ready for what was to come.My son and I arrived from our North American flight at 11:30 a.m. so we were checking in at around 1:30 p.m. I did show my Hilton Honours card at check-in as many reviewers have suggested that they sometimes get a better room even though they booked through Priceline. We were given a room immediately with two twin beds, even though we had arrived before the check-in time.As we walked to our room I commented that it felt like we had just boarded a cruise ship. The hall is narrow as is the entry door to each room.Room was standard and similar to what other reviewers have stated: outdated, small; although our view of the courtyard was unobstructed and with our window open, suprisingly quiet throughout the night. Bed was not that comfortable.As other reviewers have mentioned the Olympia station is adjacent to the hotel (go out the front door, turn right, cross the bridge, the tracks for the tube are directly underneath, take another right and walk to the station enterance). A better option is to take the bus which is directly in front of the hotel. (go out the front door, turn left, walk straight crossing a street on the way to bus stop &quot;L&quot;). When the bus arrives either the number 10 or 9 will take you towards the High Park-Kensington station. Bus #9 (direction on the front of the bus says &quot;Aldwych&quot;) will take you directly to Picadilly Circus. Bus #10 goes up to Oxford street which has some great shopping opportunities. My son and I purchased an &quot;Oyster&quot; card, which are available at any tube station. It is essentially a credit-travel card. You load money onto it and then swipe it each time you get on a bus. When taking the tube you swipe the card when you enter and when you exit. The card automatically deducts the fare required. The card will always charge you the cheapest overall fare for the entire day. For example, if a day pass is 7 GBP (pounds) once you reach this daily maximum, every time you enter a bus or the tube the fare charged is &quot;zero&quot;. We found this the best option instead of trying to figure out the fares each time. The best thing is that the card readers can read the Oyster card through clothing or even your wallet. All you have to do is place your wallet on the reader or your coat pocket, no need to even take the card out of your pocket.The only valid complaint I have about this hotel is about the conceriege. On the night prior to our early morning departure to Victoria Station, I had asked if I should pre-order a taxi. I was told to call down next morning 10 minutes before I left, which I did. When I arrived in the lobby the same conceirge introduced me to our cab driver. When we walked out of the hotel's front enterance there was no taxi. We were escorted to a side street where an unmarked Lexus awaited. My son and I got in and were taken to Victoria station. Upon arrival I looked to see what the meter read and realized there was no meter. I'm not sure what we were riding in, but I do know that when I asked for the fare amount the driver shrugged his shoulders and said &quot;22 pounds?&quot; I should have know something was wrong when our &quot;cab&quot; driver paid the conceriege prior to taking us outside to the &quot;cab&quot;, but really the Hilton should discourage this practice by its' staff. Live and learn, I guess.If you are able to get this hotel at a reasonable (read &quot;cheap&quot;) rate is is more than satisfactory. The rooms are fairly clean, fairly comfortable and the location is adequate. It certainly made for an affordable stay in London.	
Jan 2 2009 	OK Hotel	From the outside this looks like a nice Hilton. When I checked in at 1pm my room was ready. We were in one of the two newly renovated rooms. It was very contemporary. I had not been to London in 15 years and my wife had never been. So, I needed some help with transportation around the city, so I went to the Concierge-BIG MISTAKE. I asked for the nearest tube station and they instructed me to go to a station 10-15 min. away. They did not bother to tell me that the Kensington Olympia station was next door. It does only run every 15 min, but it is a much shorter walk. That night we asked for some places to eat in the area. They said that they did not know of any. I thought that part of their job was to know this. I also asked about tours and he handed me a brochure and told me to call them. NOT GOOD!I figured that the next night I wanted Indian to eat....once again they did not know of any (including the one accross the street). So, I found on on my own.I spoke with the Head Concierge and he was surprised. he said &quot;I trained them myself, and I am very surprised&quot; obviously he did not do a great job of training them. The bed in our room did not have a sheet on it, only a comforter. I asked for three days to have one placed on my bed. It never came. The room was clean but overall the property needs updating and maybe new management.	
Dec 6 2008 	Old Hilton cold rooms	The hotel is quite old and a refurbishment project should be decided to renew the rooms. Our room is quite noisy and really cold despite we tried to get some hot air from the airco. The room itself is small, the cupboard was even broken, the bathroom is also tiny and the beds are quite small. The breakfast is OK. Also, another 'problem' of this hotel is that there are some stairs in the lobby to the rooms because the hotel is on different levels. Not very easy with a heavy suitcase ...The hotel is conveniently located if you have to go to the Olympia hall. Otherwise, the metro station there is not really the best one (only 1 metro every 15 minutes and it runs only to Earl's Court and High Street Kensington) Probably not the best Hilton in town but the rate paid was so cheap that we don't have to complain too much.	
Dec 6 2008 	Outdated hotel in an inconvenient location	This hotel offers good rates such as less than $100 per day but as the saying goes you get what you pay for. The hotel is located off a branch of the district line (London tube), however you must change at Earls court to reach the Olympia station. This station requires changing since it is the only stop off this branch, it often takes 15 minutes before the train arrives. The hotel is located next to the station which looked convenient until you have to listen to the trains all day and night. (This tube station is above ground). The hotel is outdated and the rooms are worn with fllthy carpeting and horrible beds. The walls are paper thin so plan on listening to your neighbors tv or the sound of doors slamming. I would not stay at this hotel again even for the good rate. I am really surprised its a Hilton especially since the other Hiltons in town are pretty good. I can put up with the noise and outdated rooms and carpet but the beds were abysmal.	
Nov 30 2008 	Its OK	we booked via the hotel website it was cheaper than anywhere else, we had single rooms, breakfast and buffet evening meal for £210 for 2 nights, as the brakfast is £16.and the buffett £24, good value.the staff were friendly, single rooms good, breakfast very good and the evening buffett good with plenty of choice.a good hotel for the money and right next door to olympia exibitions.its not 5 star but its very good value for money if you can get a deal	
Nov 20 2008 	tiny room and tiny bed	i will not stay at this hotel again base on my own experience.The room is so small and have dark interior, old and dirty carpet.Bathroom is just small and to use the toilet i have to close the door.	
Nov 20 2008 	Great Night's Sleep!	I stayed at the Hilton London Olympia while visiting friends who live nearby, next to the exhibition centre. First impressions were actually quite good, unlike some previous reviewers. My room was ready to check in early, around 12noon, with which I was pleased. The receptionist was pleasant and efficient. I booked last minute, the night before, and ended up paying £159 for a single room which I thought was a bit extortionate considering the room was TINY.The room - I had a single room and it was really VERY small (even for a single). However, it did have everything you would need in it and that you would expect. The furnishings were very tired in the room but the bed was very comfortable. I had an excellent night's sleep, despite a loud noise coming from what I assume was air conditioning above the room. The bathroom space was ample, but I don't think it was very clean. There was a lot of rust around the plughole in the bathroom - and I agree with the previous reviewer, I had to bend down in order to get my head under the shower to wash my hair, and I'm only 5' 6&quot; !!!I cannot comment on the food and beverage areas of the hotel as I didn't consume anything apart from some water from the minibar.Location wise this hotel was perfect for me, right next to Olympia station (although the trains are infrequent), and perfect for buses into the West End. Ok, it's not located centrally for Kensington, but isn't that what the Hilton London Kensington is for?! A taxi from Kings Cross station to the hotel cost me £18.00. Overall, average hotel, good service from both front office and concierge and nicely located next to transport links to the city. Comfortable bed! I would go back.	
Nov 4 2008 	Great room 	We booked through lastminute.com it was one of their top secret hotels. We paid £80 for a double room including breakfast.The room was really quiet even though it was really close to the street and train station. Ideal location for Olympia and Shepherd's Bush and close to all Olympia train stations.Bed was big and comfy, air-con &amp; heating controls in the room all worked, very clean room &amp; bathroom, friendly and helpful staff and fab breakfast - all components of full english, fruit, cheeses, meats and all continental extras. Knowledgable and friendly concierge. Bar stayed open late so we were even able to have a cocktail to round the evening off when we got back at 1am - would def stay here again and would recommend the top secret hotel deals from www.lastminute.com too	
Nov 1 2008 	Would not recommend staying here!!!	On arriving, I was welcomed at the door, and the desk staff were generally friendly, however,... the room was not very impressive at all. It was very small to say the least and the view was of a pretty grim looking alley/back of hotel. After a long flight, from NZ, all I wanted to do was sleep, however, when I found that there was no matteress cover or top sheet on the bed... I was pretty upset. A 4 star should have a bed made correctly, including all sheets and a mattress cover. I went out to find something to eat, giving the hotel 2 hours to make my bed, however, on my return, I found that the mattress cover was just piled on my bed, as if I were to make the bed myself. I called for Housekeeping to assist make my bed, and on her arrival (Supervisor), she informed me that I was lucky I got one of the better mattresses and that most in the hotel were in worse shape. She also went on to say that the hotel was trying to cut costs by not providing full linen to each room, including sheets, etc. The hotel did apologise in form of letter with a couple of bottles of water and some wine, but it did not take the bitter feeling I have from staying at the Hilton London Kensington. The location is ok...but about 12pounds in a cab from Picc Circus. The buses are very slow...so you are best to take the Tube which is close by. I would probably stay in a backpackers next time I am in the area as this Hotel is really quite rough. I would say it's more like a 2.5 Star than a 4 Star.	
Oct 31 2008 	Could this the London's worst hotel?	This is, by far, one of the worst, most depressing, hotels that I have ever stayed in. Despite my room (double) being booked 2 months in advance and after travelling from the other side of the world I arrived to be told that all they had available was a twin  a dowdy, exceptionally hot, noisy twin. However, they did move me after the first night to a double  a dowdy, exceptionally hot, noisy double. My room was located next to some sort of store room for the hotel staff that they seemed to access at all hours, making loads of noise. However this noise was sometimes eclipsed by the sound of toilets flushing in other rooms and some strange knocking sound emanating from the ceiling. The fit out in this hotel is unbelievable. It is incredible. Is it really a Hilton? Really? The carpet looks like it was laid in the late 1960s-early 1970s and the furniture in the rooms appears to be from a similar era. Also, what hotel in the 21st Centaury doesnt have WiFi access in your room? The Hilton Olympia, thats what.The beds they are like sleeping on a door. They are so hard and uncomfortable  thats if you can even get any sleep with the oppressive heat and constant noise.The bathroom  although the bathroom was clean and the hotel did provide Crabtree and Evelyn shampoo, body wash, soap, etc. the ceiling height was so low over the shower/bath that in order to effectively wash my hair I was required to spread my legs like a giraffe drinking. The toilet also required several flushes to effectively dispatch even a modest load.All in all, this hotel looks like it only just survived the blitz of the 1940s  shame it did really.	
Oct 25 2008 	Great hotel and location	I have stayed twice at this hotel and will definitely stay again. Rooms are nice and spacious and very clean. I did look out onto the back this time, but last time i was in the top floor looking out the front and was very nice.Beds are comfortable and had a great nights sleep.The bar are is beautiful and a lovely space to have a drink. Breakfast was great too. I even met a Bee Gee there :)Location is great, only a few minutes walk to Kensington High St and Holland Park.	
Oct 21 2008 	Dismal dowdy and depressing	I booked one night at the Hilton Olympia through Late Rooms who described it as an &quot;exceptional&quot; hotel. Exceptionally bad perhaps. The hotel is completely lacking any soul or style. My room was dark and filled with what appeared to be1960s furniture from a second-hand garage sale. The decor was completely plain with no finishing touches whatsoever.The TV reception was so poor, it was virtually impossible to watch. Most good hotels these days have free internet wi-fi, but here they charge £15 per day! The bath tub was so tiny, anyone over 5 feet tall would have found it impossible to stretch out.To complete the whole experience, housekeeping came in at 8am to service the room, before I'd even got dressed. They really don't want you to feel welcome at this place. Never before have I been so glad to leave a hotel.	
Oct 19 2008	Hilton? Really?????	We booked this hotel at a discounted rate but were still very dissapointed. The location wasn't great and involved a bus or several tube journeys to get anywhere of interest. The exterior is pretty unimpressive as is the interior. Our twin bedded room was dark and very small. The view from the window was over all of the aircon units, a staff smoking area, the bins and a grotty children's playground.The bathroom was tiny and there was black mould between some of the tiles with burn marks around the edge of the bath where the room had previously been a smoking one. There were wires hanging out of the top of the lights in the vanity unit in the bedroom and the furninshings were drab and tired.We went out to eat, but did have a drink in the &quot;Plum&quot; (oh, the irony) bar which was massive, souless and had two large TV screens at one end showing two completely different programs even though they were next to eachother. This end of the bar was laughingly called &quot;The Sports Bar&quot;.The only plus was breakfast in bed which was delivered on time and was of a good standard. The pricing was not particularly clear as our rate stated breakfast was included and the in room information stated that £6 would be charged for room service breakfast if this was the case. We were charged £10, not much of a difference but annoying all the same.This hotel should be avoided. Even the staff looked as though they would rather be somewhere else. Unbelievable that it is part of the Hilton Group.	
Sep 29 2008 	Nothin special!	Stayed at the Olympia for a mini break to London with my partner.Was our first time at a Hilton and think we had expected more form a Hilton.Room was basic, nothing fancy, absolutely boiling at all times, even though room apparantly had air con!Location was fine, about a ten minute walk from Kensington High St tube station.Didnt eat at the hotel, rewfused to pay around £20 each for a breakfast when you can eat at Jamie ollivers restaurant 15 for both of us for that price!Would probably stay again as a base for seeing London as only slept and showered in room.	
Sep 29 2008 	A truly awful shabby hotel	This has got to be one of the worst hotels that I have EVER stayed in.Not one thing about it was good from start to finish. First off, we were told that they didnt have any non-smoking double rooms left even though we had booked on. In the end we had to go with a non-smoking twin.When we got to out room it was tiny! Hardly enough room to walk around the bed.  It smelled musty, there were wallpaper ripped and hanging off the walls and the carpet(!) skirting boards were all hanging off the wall. The bathroom was dirty and so tiny. Whist in the shower (which I really didnt want to use due to the poor state it was in) my head touched the extremely low ceiling. Im only 58! God know what a tall person would do.The standard of this hotel was NOT 4 star, it would (in my well travelled opinion) only pass as 2/3 star. The bathroom would not be out of place in a youth hostel.When we complained about the state of the rooms all we got was a Its being refurbished in a couple of years. Its now September 2008. Id recommend staying at another hotel until September 2010!	
Sep 23 2008 	OK hotel for the price	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights before our Baltic sea cruise as we got it (not by choice) for only $100 a night from Hotwire. For London it is definitely an awesome deal. I was quite worried after reading some of the reviews here but it turned out to be an ok property.The room is decent in size and reasonably clean, which is my number one priority. I did ask for a &quot;renovated' room upon check-in but the room did not seem that new to me.Location could be a problem. Even for the closest Olympia subway stop, it is still a reasonable walk, especially with luggage and the more popular Kensington station is a good 15 min walk. This hotel is not close to anything but if you don't mind taking the bus and take the chance of being caught in traffic, the bus stop is right outside the hotel.We did not eat at the hotel as there are many other options around the Kensington area and we would have to talk there anyway to take the tube.For $100, I probably would say it is worth it for London but definitely will not pay more than that.	
Sep 19 2008 	Unpleasant	We stayed at this hotel for two nights before a tour we were taking of the UK as this was the same hotel that the tour operator selected for the first night of the tour so we thought it would be easier to stay in the same hotel rather than switching. Overall the experience wasn't too bad until we attempted to have a drink in the Plum Sports Bar in the hotel; we ordered two martini's with a twist and got (after 30 minutes) one martini with olives. Not so bad right, but imagine expecting food from the kitchen only to be told that the chef &quot;went home early.&quot; We also attempted to take advantage of the laundry service but since we didn't read the fine print and weren't aware that unless we told housekeeping that the bag of laundry sitting outside our door needed to be picked up they would walk past it and ignore it until after the deadline for same day service had passed. When we asked later if the laundry we had sent in would be ready before we left the hotel the next day we were informed that it wouldn't be ready until 6 or 7pm the next day and though they were insincerely sorry they couldn't do anything for us but mail our laundry to us the next business day which would've been three days later. Eventually they realized that although they had picked up our laundry they had never thought to send it out so our still dirty laundry was returned to us. Overall this hotel is thread-bare to say the least, the rooms are small, the carpet is stained and the bathrooms smell badly. The internet costs about $30 per day, phone calls are expensive, food is expensive (even for London standards) and the hotel staff are really not interested in their customers.	
Sep 11 2008 	Way more than I expected	I stayed 4 nights at the Hilton Olympia. I bid for a hotel in the Earls Court/Kensington area on Priceline and won this hotel for an awesome price. I was actually quite upset at first because the reviews worried me. However, this hotel was much more than I expected. First off, it smells wonderful. I arrived at noon and even though check-in time isn't until 3pm, they had a room ready and allowed me to check in early. First they had me on the 2nd floor; I asked if there was anything available on a higher floor. There was and they moved me to the 6th floor. The room was much bigger than I expected with a king size bed, (two twin beds pushed together). The decorations were very nice; the bathroom had plenty of towels and even included two washcloths! Crabtree &amp; Evelyn bath products were also included. Room was clean and I was very comfortable here. When I first sat on the bed I thought it was the hardest bed I have ever laid on, but I never had any problems sleeping, so guess it wasnt that hard after all. The AC is noisy, but I need some kind of white noise to sleep so I welcomed it. I was facing Kensington High Street, which can be pretty noisy itself, so with the AC on it was drowned out. My only complaint would be that the in-room Internet was not working and I spent a lot of time waiting for the staff to call me with information regarding it (they never did). The night manager finally gave me a deal on Internet minutes to use in the Business Center which was nice of him. While the Kensington Olympia station is supposedly just around the corner, I only used it once and it felt like it was much further away that it was supposed to be. I always used the bus while staying here, it was much more convenient. It does feel a little out of the way, but I would definitely stay here again.	
Sep 4 2008 	Disapointing.......	We stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of September for a short break in London. We booked directly with the hotel and got a rate of £111 per night including full breakfast for two.We were allocated a very small room on the 8th floor and as soon as we got into the room, we had to complain and ask for another room. The room was very small, had a damp mould odour, had a view of a dirty brick wall located about 6' from the only room window!We were then moved to another room on the 6th floor which was a little bit bigger, didn't smell and overlooked the main road.The room either didn't have air-con or it was not working, it didn't provide any cold air! The room was 'tired' and needed an overhaul. The toilet seat was loose, there were dirty mouldy waterstained ceiling tiles in the bathroom that looked to have dried blood on some of them. Rotten woodwork in the bathroom around the doorframe, dirty carpets throughout the hotel....One window wouldn't open and the other wouldn't close properly! The only redeeming feature of the hotel was the breakfast which was all you could eat, fresh fruit, cereal, pastrys, full English, juice, tea and coffee etc. The staff in the breakfast area were all very polite and helpful.Overall, OK for a short stay, if you don't plan to spend any time in your room and if you got a cheap rate. Don't pay anywhere near full price and don't stay too long and you should be OK. This hotel is nowhere near the high standard of other Hilton Hotels elsewhere.	
Sep 1 2008 	Very good stay	Very good value for the money. Big, bright room. Neat and clean. Very near Kensington and Earls Court. I was a bit afraid when I saw som of the whining reviews, but this is a good hotel for a reasonable price. We had no problems at all and stayed there for two whole weeks.	
Aug 24 2008 	Ideal base to explore London	I chose this hotel mainly due to its location - I needed somewhere to stay close to Earls Court and found this one on lastminute.com as one of their top secret deals. Upon arrival, my room wasn't ready and I was offered the choice of taking a single room instead of the double I'd booked, or waiting a little while. I opted to wait so I could explore the area - it's situauted right at the end of Kensington High Street, just a short walk from Olympia tube station (exit the station down Olympia Way, turn left at the end of the road, go over the railway bridge, cross over a road and it's on the left), and is quite an easy walk down the High Street into Kensington itself.The room I was given was on the 2nd floor and was a little on the small side for a double, but was nevertheless well-equipped and in good order with a modern, clean and well-equipped bathroom. The lightswitches were a bit tricky to fathom (a series of push-button controls and switches for individual lights), but it didn't take long. Air-con worked very well and was quiet enough not to be intrusive to sleep... which was a pleasure as the bed was one of the most confortable I've encountered in a hotel anywhere!Can't comment on the food as I stayed room-only (there's a very nice sandwich bar/cafe called Frank's opposite - a full English with tea and toast cost me £4.50), but the bar service was excellent (watch the bill though - they automatically add a discretionary 10% service charge to it) and the bar itself had a very pleasant environment.In conclusion, I was more than happy with my stay and would have no hesitation in returning.	
Aug 14 2008 	Stuck in the 80's	Got this hotel through priceline for half the going rate but im so glad we didnt pay full price. Went to check in at 6:30pm and we were told they had to check with maid service if the room was ready (check in time was 2:00pm) we were given a drinks voucher to go and wait in the bar, when we went back we were told there was now a leaking toilet and maintenance were fixing it, we were told this was the last room when we asked if there were any others so we went and sat for another five minutes to wait, we were finally given the key on the top floor at 7:10pm making it a 40 minute check in! The reception staff were very friendly and did appear to do everything possible to help us. When we did finally get there we werent very impressed with the room - we have stayed at other 4* hotels in London and this didnt compare. The room was small and looked very aged, the dresser had a large chunk of wood missing and the carpets looked very fashionable for the 80's! We stayed for two nights and were glad we didnt plan to spend more time in our room! The location is a 15minute walk down from Kensington High street and 5 minutes from olympia tube station. The Tube service is good to Olympia for a restricted service and comes around every 15 minutes although you have to swap at earls court for this service. A 3* hotel at the best. Dont pay full price for this hotel.	
Aug 7 2008	Beward of hotel ratings...	This hotel is NOT what the rating says. Be careful if you are going to stay there. There is lots of mold, and other allergents in the hotel, so much so that my family had to move. This is an old hotel, very worn and only a value if you do not intend on staying there much and are not affected by environmental factors. Spend a few more dollars and enjoy your visit.	
Aug 6 2008 	Excellent Hotel great Location	My wife and I enjoyed a lovely five day break at this hotel and were more than impressed with the hotel room, lobby area and staff. The restaurant also provides an excellent breakfast, we ate out in the evenings but the food appeared to be good enough in the hotel as well.The bus stops just outside the door and a number 9 or 10 bus will take you straight into the centre of London and all its attractions and activities. The tube line is only a few minutes walk away as well.Overall a great hotel and excellent staff, I would gladly stay here again anytime. I have read some comments about star ratings etc but frankly I feel that star ratings are not informative at all and this hotel excells in being a good place to stay regardless of anyone's ratings. It is just a good hotel.	
Aug 4 2008 	London in Sumertime	Booked through last minutes website, great price inc breakfast2 rooms , 2 nites. (TOP SECRET HOTEL)Travelling with wife, young son and mother.Location good, short taxi ride from all main attractions.Rooms very good despite some average reviews read prev.Breakfast excellent, service good, check in/out quick.Avoids driving into congestion zone to reach the hotel.NCP car park under hotel for parking, convenient but expensive at £32 per 24 hours..Overall experience for sightseeing was good.It was very hot during the day 28/30 degThe a/c in rooms is controlled centrally so not as cold.Would use this hotel again for future London trips.	
Aug 3 2008 	Handy location	This hotel is close to supermarkets, restaurants, tube.They allowed us to check in as early as 11am, leaving the rest of the day for sightseeing. Staff were very helpful.Room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. Tea/coffee making facilities in room.Wonderful selection of food for breakfast.	
Aug 1 2008 	Disorganized and poor reception service	Due to a British Airways special deal, we got this so-called 4 star hotel at a good price. It is a bit difficult to reach from Heathrow by public transit, as it isn't near Paddington (and the Paddington Express), but otherwise it is on a busy and well-served road. We wanted a roll-away bed for our 3 year old, despite making that abundantly clear at booking and again in person at the reception desk at check in, they sent us to a room that didn't have a sofa-bed as they claimed nor could they fit a roll-away in there. 4 hours later, when we went out to dinner, they moved all of our belongings to a different room but didn't move items we had left in the fridge which was then locked and unopened despite multiple requests over 2 days (a most favored child's cup was thus lost). This new room had an extra bed, was fairly well appointed if faded, comfortable and overlooked a quiet side-street which also offered a number of free wifi signals! The room staff was very nice, helpful and altogether efficient. Other than the reception desk's slow response and frequent bumbling, it was okay.	
Aug 1 2008 	Worst Hilton ever!	Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights - and never again!!Had to move room after no sleep first night as air conditioning unit would not switch off - in November!! and room on second night had a broken window which would not shut therefore traffic noise constantly all night and no sleep again! Staff were totally disinterested!!Breakfast is a farce - no one underatands English took at least 4 attempts to get coffee.Awful Hilton and would never stay again.	
Jul 29 2008 	Value but nothing special	Booked through the hotel's reward travel. Our room should have also held a roll away bed for my son. With this bed in the room one could not move about the room at all. Getting to our suitcases was really tough and we could not even sit at the desk. We checked in late on Valentines day after a day of touring so swicthing rooms wasn't really an option as the hotel was packed. I shoudl have fussed more though!I was concerened about the furniture in the room. There were large chunks of wood missing from the dresser/desk. I was afraid that if we squeezed by these we would get splinters or a cut so I placed a towel over these. The decor could use some updating, very tired.The bathroom shower, has one of those terrble half panes of glass that you swing over the edge of the tub. I flooded the floor with water going under the pane.The plus side of the hotel was it's convience to two tubes. The conceirge was very helpful and friendly. There was a nice wine shop down the street that opned our bottle in the store for us to bring back to the room. If you are on a budget this hotel would do, but this wasn't the nicest Hilton I have stayed at. I think they cater to bus tours and the convention crowd.	
Jul 24 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	After reading the countless reviews about small rooms, with some being so small there was barely enough room for your suitcases; I was sceptical. We were also told not to expect much from London hotels. &quot;Old, small and expensive&quot; were words to describe most London hotel experiences of our friends. We opened our door to find a very spacious room with three windows overlooking a side street. There was wear and tear on the rugs, but that didn't matter because it was clean, modern and roomy. We found it easy to manoeuver around the city using the bus system. For a priceline bid of $100 USD per night, we were definitely satisfied.	
Jul 23 2008 	Nothing Special	Stayed 3 nights in July 2008. Booked through Priceline dot com for $US 100.00 per night, but friends got it for $90. Clean and serviceable; nothing special. Rather drab and worn by north american standards. Air conditioned in name only. Strange light switches. Front desk friendly and efficient. Large bath a welcome sight. Short walk to Kensington Olympia Tube, but train comes only once every 10 or 15 minutes, and must change at Earl's court. A little beyound comfortable walking distance to the Museums of South Ken. ATM in Hotel would not link to my Canadian bank account, but no problem at nearby post office ATM. Breakfast &quot;specal&quot; an outrageous 10 UK pounds! Nearby pubs and restaurants are good value; british and international cuisine. Internet access overpriced. But at $100 per night, a good value for London. Bonus benefit: Brit Rail train from nearby Kensington Olympia goes to Gatwick Airport with only 2 or 3 brief stops. Price: 14 pounds. Far more convenient and cheaper than taking Tube to Earl's Court, changing trains for Victoria, then catching the Gatwick express. Would I stay there again? Probably, if I could get that price again and I was flying in and out of Gatwick.	
Jul 23 2008 	can't fault the service or standard of room	My sister and I stayed here for two nights, room only, booked through the HiltonHonors programme. There was a dedicated check-in for the HH guests which was helpful. Our room was clean and spacious with twin beds and plenty room at the desk area. The bathroom was also v clean and modern. All staff we came into contact with were helpful and polite.Only problem we encountered was trying to get back to the hotel later at night - we discovered to our cost that the last district line tube that goes to Kensington Olympia station leaves Earls Court at 2345. We hailed a taxi from there though which cost about £6.We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel (we were about £90 a night) that we could rely on being comfortable - it didn't let us down in this area although I do think breakfast should have been included at this price.	
Jul 22 2008 	Questionable 4 star	We stayed at the Hilton London Olympia for four days in the middle of June this year. We found the reception to be pleasant and helpful upon arrival. But the overall opinion of the hotel was disappointing. I booked through Priceline, but called the hotel ahead of time to request two beds and they were able to accommodate me. The room was very small. We were not able to wheel our luggage across the room because there no room between the end of the bed and wall. There was no space what so ever for the second suitcase, so we ended up placing it on the small couch in the room for the entire visit.The bathroom looked nice (not as nice as some of the pictures I have seen on this site), but when I turned on the shower, water sprayed all over the bathroom and flooded the floor. I called the desk and was connected to the night manager. I was offered another non-smoking room but unfortunately it had just been made non-smoking the previous day. I advised him that that woud not due, so I was offered the opportunity to shower in another room. I took that offer and was surprised to find that there was a room smaller than mine. The next morning maintenance came in and repaired the shower. The other quirky thing about the bathroom was that the door would not fully close.The concierge provided us with a city map with all the bus lines and we found this very helpful, as we decided that we preferred the bus or walking to the subway. The bus stop was right outside the hotel and the busses ran on a very regular basis.	
Jul 22 2008	Good 3 Star Hotel	This is a standard hotel which you can book for some reasonable rates, a real difficulty in London. The hotel is clean, the staff are attentive and the breakfasts were very good. It is located not too far from the sights and sounds and it is not difficult to get to Heathrow from here as Earls Court is one stop away on the Underground where you can either join the Heathrow Connect or the Piccadilly Line. The rooms could do with a little updating, but they are clean and comfortable.	
Jul 21 2008 	Wheelchair rooms NOT accessible!	We recently stayed at the Olympia for four nights in Room 504. My wife is a paraplegic and we needed a wheelchair accessible room for this visit. According to the hotel's website and to the numerous people at the hotel itself and reservations center I talked to on and the phone and e-mailed prior to our arrival, we were repeatedly assured that the room would work for our needs. It did not! The bathroom is NOT wheelchair accessible thanks to a pair of portable walls installed on either side of shower. One does not fold out of the way far enough and the other could NOT fold out of the way because of a towel rack installed right next to it! We had to ask maintenance to remove on of the walls to make the situation barely useable. I asked at the front desk about changing rooms but they said that every 'accessible' room at the hotel was set up exactly the same. This room, in its' current state, is NOT accessible. To advertise it as such is VERY misleading. As a Hilton Honors member who has stated at numerous Hilton properties, I was extremely disappointed. I would not have been surprised if this was a budget hotel, but at a Hilton I expect better.	
Jul 11 2008 	Unless Your Using Hilton Honors (free) Hotwire or Priceline - Think Again	Read the many Trip Advisor Reviews of Hilton Olympia and you'll certainly notice that many reviewers stayed here though both Priceline or Hotwire, and it seems almost as many used their Hilton Honor's Points for a free stay.Its actually not such a bad hotel, but beware, as I really felt for the first time that my room was chosen based on my Hotwire Purchase. (just under $100 US, incl all taxes - a great deal for London - but you can do better !) For Americans its not really a 4 Star in my opinion, they may have some 4 Star rooms, but you're not likely to get one if you book the way I did. My stay at the nearby Holiday Inn Express (3 Star was nicer) Although I would say again that for a cheap price the Hilton is okay.My room was very dated and small, with a renovated bath. I was there early to check my bags and was told I could have my room...till she noticed I was Hotwire...then the mood changed and I was told check in was at 3:00. We got the furthest room from the elevators on the 2nd floor. (a long and twisting hall with a few series of steps to navigate along the route.Most of the room's lighting was not working... floor lamp, desk lamp, entry light... leaving mostly the bedside reading lamp. I reported this the next day and it was fixed (but why? does the maid not need to see?)The sheer curtains have been removed so its full sun or as dark as a cave....nothing in bwtween. When I am a tourist and have a good price....the view is secondary and not important....but here we had a good view of the garbage area.To those still reading..... if you want to take the bus to the High Street undergound station.....EASY AS PIE... a bus near the lobby every few minutes and often several to choose from...they all go right by that stop (15 to 20 min walk) in 5 to 10 minutes.Return you just need to eliminate a few bus #'s and its just as easy to come back via bus. The Olympia station is near but I think only 3 trains an hour.Best Reasons to stay:Price if you get it Bus if you use itAlounak (bring your own wine / Iranian Food nearby) EXCELLENT I'd go even if not staying at the HiltonIts a large hotel.. unless there is a convention or large meeting, there or nearby....I'd guess you can probably get a room at a good rate on Priceline or Hotwire.Hilton Honors members may want to weigh the point cost vs. the discount advance purchase price of Priceline or Hotwire.Oh and the room was clean, as was the bath. It was also quiet as we were in an interior room. I think all the windows are double glazed. But you might be just as happy in a 3 Staror in my case HAPPIER ( I like free breakfast buffets)Again check out the Holiday Inn Express Earls Court on Trip Advisor - its wonderful.Enjoy	
Jun 22 2008 	Three star experience	We stayed here for one Saturday night a while ago and in summary would say it was a fairly drab experience.We got the room for £50 on Priceline which is a good rate for London, and the room was decent enough for this price. It was very small, with worn, dull decor and strange matresses, but the bathroom was nice. I got the impression they gave us one of the less decent rooms because we were paying more than half as much as other guests!The location is a big drawback unless you are attending a conference at the centre along the road, which is probably why the hotel offers such cheap rooms. However, it 'only' takes 30 - 40 minutes to get into the centre if you are lucky with the trains, or walk to a main station.I would therefore NOT recommend this room for tourists or people visiting London for the nightlife/shows - unless you can get it for as good a price as we did!	
Jun 13 2008 	overpriced!	Okay, well... after trowelling the internet for hours trying to find a cheap hotel in London, I eventually succumbed to the lure of lastminute.com's 'exceptional 4* star hotel in Kensington' for £82!I was tired of reading 'WORST HOTEL EVER' and other such taglines for the £50-£70 hotels I was looking at. I couldn't afford (and wasn't really bothered about) staying in the best hotel in London, I was only there for a night as part of a 2 day trip to see some sights and watch a west end show... but... who really wants to stay in a hotel which says 'WOULDN'T WISH THIS ON MY WORST ENEMY!' (even if it is just for a night!!)So- as I say- I decided I would just have to pay (slightly begrudgingly) £82. I was nervous as I didn't know what I was getting but I thought, well 4*, Kensington, it can't be that bad!!Truth was, it wasn't bad at all. Reception was all very nice and the hotel bar was plesant enough. The room? I was surprised how spacious it was, appalled at the disgusting view (even they didn't dare open the curtains for us!!) and disappointed with the dwarf shower (my boyfriend had to bend down!!!). However, I was happy that it was clean, secure and I didn't mind laying my head there for a night.Is it 4*? I wouldn't say so. All I can say is that, if this is what you have to pay in London for a room which really I can only describe as clean and decent- what is the world coming to??Finally, a word about location. Kensington High Street itself was lovely, lots of shops, restaurants, few bars. But in terms of getting into central London, it was a bit of a pain to be honest. Nearest tube station (literally round the corner) is Kensington Olympia but you can't get anywhere from here. You always have to change trains. It wasn't that much hassle but changing tubes 2/3 times when you want to either get into London or back to your hotel can be quite time consuming- especially as only a limited service operates from this tube station. It sort of spoiled the last part of our trip as we had to trek all the way back to the hotel to get our bags and we were pancking a bit about how far it was. You can walk to the hotel from Kensington High Street station but it's a good 20-25min walk. (whereas the other one is just a few minutes)Apparently, we got a good deal paying £82 for a room at the Olympia. Personally- I think this was too expensive (by the way, didn't include breakfast)Hope this helps.	
Jun 9 2008 	Functional	We stay here regularly when we visit exhibitions as Olympia (the last was in Nov 07). It is a functional hotel which is ideally situated for Olympia. It does not have the frills other Hiltons have but if you stay here you should realise that it it targetted at the business traveller and not the tourist.The rooms are good and clean and the breakfast okay. We have eaten in the restaurant in the evening and the food was very good.Be careful when ordering wine in the bar, I was charged over £7 a glass!	
Jun 8 2008 	decent enough for price	I put a priceline bid of $150/night which the hilton accepted. After reading comments, I would have started bidding much lower. In a nutshell, the hotel is old but clean. The rooms are on the smaller side but not bad. If you intend to spend your days touring London, this hotel is a good value for the money. If your expecting new, fancy and large rooms, this hotel is not for you. We had a room on the 8th floor which was great. When we walked into our room there was a stain on the carpet at the center of the room but everything else was fine. The furniture is older but again, clean. Our room overlooked the main street but we found it to be quiet. We walked from Kensington Palace to the hotel and found many many stores, restaurants and grocery stores along the way. We walked late at night and found the area to be safe and everyone very friendly. We were satisfied overall. The staff was always kind and helpful. The concierge Kemo was exceptionally helpful and we appreciated it. If you can't walk for more than 15 minutes at a time, this hotel would not be as convienent as another might be, but if you don't mind casual walking you can really enjoy the shopping and food the area has to offer. We never ate at the hotel because there were too many other choices nearby.	
Jun 8 2008 	Disappointed	Room was tiny for a 4* had trouble getting bag in room.Still waiting on them to fix the air con was either too hot or too cold.Breakfast if didnt get down before 8 then had to q for up to 15 mins, hot breakfast was cold and fruit was off.Paid £120 a night , if had paid the £60 others had paid then wouldnt have been as bad.Room service plates not taken away still there in the morning.If getting a £60 deal go for it but dont pay much more if can be helped	
Jun 7 2008	Nice place to stay	Okay value for the money. I wished I had payed a little more and stayed closer in.	
Jun 1 2008 	A good hotel for the price.	My friend and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington because there was no availability at the Hilton London Olympia on our first night. (BTW, their hotel room was smaller..) When we arrived in our room on Sunday May 18th for our 7 night stay, we were relieved to get more space for our money. We paid the equivalent to $190+ US prior to taxes thru Expedia per night. The hotel was pretty convenient. It was a quick 5 minute walk to the Olympia tube station, the #9 and #10 buses were always running minutes of each other in front of the hotel, and there was a 24 hr. Tesco up on Earl's Court. A 1-day bus pass can be purchased for 3.50 GBP in the newspaper store next to the Hare &amp; Tortoise restaurant across the street. The pass begins immediately and is valid until 4:30am the next morning. Pretty convenient if you're on a budget. (Yes there is the tube..but crowded subways are not my cup of tea and at least you can see the city riding on a bus if you sit on the second level unlike a subway.)Please be warned, however, that your bed sheets are NOT changed on a daily basis. I was unfortunate to discovered one morning that I slept on sheets with a suspicious orange/red stain and short dark hairs. I asked the conceirge to have my sheets changed and when I came back that evening the sheets were still filthy. I called the front desk twice to have them send up housekeeping. The housekeeper not only changed my sheets, but my friend's bed sheets as well. The house keeper was saying that sheets are changed on a daily basis at a 5-star hotel and this hotel being a 4-star, it wasn't expected to be changed daily. (I don't get that reasoning because I've stayed in plenty of 4-star hotels in Thailand and every time they changed the sheets.)	
Jun 1 2008 	Very nice and enjoyable- easy access	Stayed here on May 8th-10th as our first stop on a 3 week vacation. Got a good rate via priceline and was very happy with our stay. The Hilton is very close to the tube stop and bus stops. We had 4 bags and it was an easy walk to the Hilton from the Tube with 4 bags for the 2 of us. That station also has serves trains, and as we flew out of gatwick on to our next stop, it was convenient to both Heathrow and Gatwick. There are a few restaurants and Bars, and eaen a nice park within walking distance. It is not a fancy and flashy hotel, but everything was very clean and the staff very friendly. As gold hilton members, we dont know if we would get anything because we booked via priceline. They didnt have any upgraded rooms, but did comp our breakfast both days. Their full breakfast was very good and was $20 lbs if not comped. The rooms were a descent size and very clean. The beds were not as comfortable as the Hiltons in the US though. Bathrooms were also very nice. Overall i was happy with this Hilton and would recommend it.	
May 29 2008 	Great stay!	The Hilton Olympia worked out really well for my short stay in London. It was a great deal thanks to Priceline, tho Priceline's star rating for it is a bit high so bid low! The staff was great, very pleasant and helpful. The lobby was very nice, hallways not as nice (but who really cares?!), and room was large (by European standards!), very clean and comfortable. Thanks to the previous reviews we did not even open the fridge so no problems with extra charges. If your room rate doesn't include breakfast you'll want to plan on finding it elsewhere as the hotel restaurant is WAY overpriced!The bus that runs in front of the hotel is incredibly convenient, highly recommended! It makes it a short and pleasant trip into the heart of the city.I was incredibly happy with this hotel for the price, a great deal in a very expensive city.	
May 24 2008 	Nice plce to stay if you don't mind the location	I had booked rooms in this hotel through priceline (About 55 pounds/room/day). This hotel is in Kensington Olympia. The taxi driver initially took us to another Hilton in Kensington and we had to redirect him. It is less than 5 min walk from the Kensington Olympia tube station. But you have to change to district lane in either High street Kensington or Earls Court. You could also get down at High street Kensington and walk for 10 mins. The check in was very comfortable, the room contained all necessary things you would need. Although the rooms were only of average size, it was what I had expected in London. Staffs were helpful and considerate (Though once they forgot to provide us coffee making facilities despite reminding).  If you do not have big luggage this is not a bad location as there are enough tube facilities. We took a taxi as we had few large luggages.  I had recently stayed in bed and breakfast in Kings Cross for 50 pounds. Compared to that room the size and other facilities in Hilton Kensington Olympia were definitely better. I would stay in this hotel again if I get this rate.	
May 21 2008 	Priceline Experience - it's a Hilton (careful about phone use)	Booked this through Priceline and got a very good deal in my opinion for London. London is horrendously expensive, first off. Through Priceline I secured the hotel for four nights at $115US per night (or around 60 pounds). Considering my Wife and I spent 38 pounds to get from Heathrow to the hotel this is a bargain! Yes, this isn't an ideal downtown location, but the buses are very efficient and we ended up walking to the Kensington High Street Tube station which did not take long. The room was a decent Hilton room with good linens and bed. The shower was small and short. Me as a 6'4&quot; guy had to bend to ge my head from hitting the ceiling when showering. The room was clean and comfortable otherwise. Staff was friendly and accommodated our early arrival at the hotel from a transatlantic flight (a big bonus!). For the money this served it's purpose very well and I would recommend it utilizing Priceline again. The bus-tube combination served us well in getting to see London attractions. You can walk to Kensington Palace. My only complaint here was a mini bar charge that had to be revoked (as we took nothing from it) and a daily phone usage fee for time spent on the phone using a 1-800 number of 4.50 pounds a day! Yes, $9 to use the phone on a 1-800 call, where most other hotels I have been to charge nothing for this. It was a surprise as we had used the phone for various calls of various lengths. Might I suggest using the pay phones in the lobby as opposed to those in your room for the budget conscious. Note that the pub across from Olympia station (note too that this is a Zone 2 station) charged us 17 pounds ($34) for two sandwiches and a beer. The best part was that the bread on my sandwich had mould on it. Nice. Enjoy London as there is a lot to see and do there.	
May 12 2008 	Decent stay if the location suits you	The Olympia offers a fairly typical Hilton experience. As an executive summary, I was satisfied with the quality and value of the hotel, but the location and accessibility are a bit questionable.Location: The hotel is a short walk from the Olympia tube station. After leaving the station, walk left and then turn left at the main street and walk about a block. The Olympia tube station does not get very frequent trains, and service only starts at 0700 or 0800, which can be a drawback if you're trying to get to Heathrow. There is a bus stop almost opposite the hotel which can take you to a better-served tube station.The hotel is in a largely residential area of the royal borough, not far from Holland Park. There are not many attractions within walking distance, so its value as a London sightseeing base is questionable. There are supermarkets (Tesco) nearby and a decent restaurant selection in the area.There seemed to be several tour groups staying at the hotel. For such organised coach tours, I guess location is not so important. But I suspect location would be a thumbs down for most reading this review.Room: My room was a typical London size (i.e. small). Bed was small but comfortable. My room was non-smoking and did not smell like smoke. There was a decent TV with the average British lineup. My room was clean, and had a view of the gardens. The hotel did not offer free WiFi (there seemed to only be paid wired Internet) and the BTOpenZone signal was weak. The hotel was reasonably maintained, and other than seeming a bit tired, was in decent condition.Bathroom: My bathroom was, like the room, small. It was clean, everything worked properly, and the amenities were decent.Staff: Staff were decent. Efficient check-in and check-out with no hassles. The concierge was helpful when I asked questions about the local area.Facilities: The hotel restaurant has a pretty good breakfast buffet, I was happy with the quality and variety. It was included in my room rate, so I don't know if it was overpriced or not.Summary: I had a pleasant stay at the Olympia, with no complaints - better than I can say for other name-brand London hotels I've had the dubious privilege of staying at recently. I didn't mind staying in a residential area, so the location was OK for me, but I don't think it is very good for sightseeing. I'd still much prefer the Hilton Hyde Park, which is generally a few pounds more but worth it.	
May 8 2008 	Decent hotel	I will preface this by saying I got this hotel on Hotwire for $99/night. The Hotel was clean, although the rooms were not terribly spacious or really up to date, but it was nice enough. The bed was comfy, they had a tea pot, tea &amp; biscuits in the room every day. The hallways smelled a bit of smoke, but our room did not. The location was fine. It is close to the Olympia stop on the tube, however there is only limited trains going to that location. There is a bus stop across the street with several lines that stop there &amp; I believe it is the 9 that was really useful &amp; takes you to places like Picadilly. There's a mall down the street at the Kensington High Street Tube stop. There are some restaurants in the neighborhood, the only ones I tried were near the Kensington High Street stop. (The Prince of Wales pub, across from a church on the corner of the street had fine fish &amp; chips, I highly recommend Builders Arms which was across from a restaurant called Wodka). If you go into Marks &amp; Spencer &amp; go downstairs &amp; to the counter there, they have reasonable food &amp; a better selection than the fast counter upstairs.	
May 5 2008 	Not a great hotel	Stayed at this hotel for one night whilst in London and got a reasonable deal on Priceline. Certainly would not have been happy if I had paid any more! It is not in a convenient location, with few underground trains running to it, and the area is rundown. The actual hotel needs refurbishment in my opinion. Our room was very poorly designed, with sliding doors on a very narrow wardrobe meaning you could hardly get your hands inside, and a strange window arrangement meaning that you lost a lot of floor area. The room was quite small, with a small bathroom and a less than full size bath. The mattress was old and very hard. It was all rather shabby and needed updating, with peeling veneers and wallpapers. We were given a voucher on check-in for a free drink in the bar. We put this on the table whilst we had our drink and the barman took it, then presented us with a bill. Whilst he did accept that we had a voucher, I felt awkward and as if this should not have happened in the first place. I would not return here unless I got an unbeatable deal on Priceline.	
May 3 2008 	Great for the Price!!	I booked this hotel through Lastminute.co.uk for 60 pounds and was very pleased with it. It was our first night after a sleepless transatlantic flight and I asked for a quiet room. We were put on the 8th floor at the very back of the building. I did not hear a soul the entire time. Our luggage was lost and the concierge was very helpful in delivering it to us promptly when the courier came around. The front desk was also very nice and helpful. This hotel is definitely not a 4 star but was comfortable and clean. The Olympia tube stop has service about every 15 minutes and was so close we always walked there instead of High St Kensington or Earls Court. You do have to change at Earls Court but a minor inconvenience. We had a great experience overall.	
May 1 2008 	Great place	I stayed there for 8 nights in early March 2008...The hotel was great and the staff fabulous, always pleasant and helpful no matter what time. I must say the free shortbread was a great touch... Walkers was delightful at night with coffee...It is expensive in SA rands....as it was over R1200.p.p.n and I was a single traveller..I must admit back home in SA for that kinda money you get more space and funstuff in your rooms.. Check out my room photo if you don't believe me..	
Apr 28 2008 	noisy loud unpleasant	The Hilton London Olympia is overall not worth the money. Booking a non-smoking deluxe room, I got a smoking room on the first floor in front of the central heating/climatisation station, which was noisy all night long. Asking for a less noisy room, they would have offered me a room towards the street (not better). The room smelled smoke (what would you expect in a smoking room), the carpets were dirty (as my red eyes the next morning were proofing from my dust-allergy). To compensate the non-availability of the room I got a free breakfast - but after a night with hardly sleeping this might not be a reasonable compensation. The hotel is maximum a 2 star (for the coffe and tea offered there is not even a cup available), rooms are tiny, noisy and overall unpleasant (at least on the first floor).	
Apr 28 2008 	Big rooms but poor location on underground	I usually use Marriotts as over the time I have found them to be better than any chain competitor but they can be very expensive in London.For this trip Marriotts cheapest London price was £210 per night room only inc vat, and thats far too much so looked elsewhere and got this for a competitive price of £210 for 2 nights inc b+b and dinner on 1st night. It is a roomy hotelOur room was a really good size for anywhere in the UK but outstanding for London. Bed is a bit hard but big. The hotel is clean as are the rooms, although looking a little frayed at the edges. Everything does however workthe downside however is the location in terms of transportation as it is at the end of a district line spin off which means you always have to change to get there and with only 3 trains per hour its not that convenient. Taxifare to Euston is £20 which we had to pay after we missed a tube train. This hotel is however a good idea if youre not on businessjust be sure you dont overpay, the package we got was I would say good value but I wouldnt pay more than £250 for 2 nights B+B, anything over that and there is better value to be had at better locations elsewhere	
Apr 21 2008 	Excellent Room + Excellent Staff = Excellent Time	We arrived at the Hilton Olympia after a long flight from Houston. Check-in was quick and easy. Our room was on the third floor. The hallways definitely needed some work, but they weren't horrible. The room we had was magnificent. Upon entering the room the first thing I saw was a large work table made of glass and track lighting. The queen bed was to the left of the work table and while a bit firm was comfy when I tried it. Just above the headboard was an alcove with some art deco sculpture surrounded by the walls which were painted a bright green. The closets were near the entrance to the room and were big enough for two people. The bathroom was impressive with marble walls and floor. The shower was built for two. It had two sets of controls and two magnificent large shower heads that were 6'6&quot; off the floor and were height adjustable. The sink was a modern raised bowl that had an image of green lettuce on it (it was a lettuce bowl). There were two safes in the room just above the mini bar - one of which didn't seem to work but the other held all my valuables save for my laptop. On the plane ride over I had broken my glasses. The concierge was very helpful and pointed me to a hardware store right down the block where I was able to buy some super glue. Overall the staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included in our rate. The all you can eat buffet style breakfast was very good. We had all the items you would expect in a traditional English breakfast along with many cold meats, cheeses and a wide selection of breads and muffins. Cereals and fruit were also available. While you can ask the cook to make you an omelet both times I was told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. That was my only issue the entire time I was there. I highly recommend getting the breakfast included in the rate. My wife and I filled up in the morning prior to sightseeing and we only needed a light snack in the afternoon. It probably saved us 15-20 Pounds/day in food expense.The Olympia location is very convenient to get to from Heathrow. Take the Piccadilly line to Earls Court and transfer to the District Line. The Olympia Station is above ground which is a plus when you are hauling rolling bags around. The train does shut down earlier than other trains since it is a spur off the district line, but there was bus service that we were able to find that dropped off right in front of the Hotel on the one night we got back too late. Plenty of shops and places to eat nearby - there is even a Tesco (supermarket) about 1/4 mile away from the Hotel. This was one of the best stays we've had in London. We were a bit nervous booking this hotel because of some of the reviews it had, but the Hotel was just fine.	
Apr 18 2008	Perfectly acceptable for the price good service good breakfast	I got a night at this hotel for $120 (before tax) via Priceline in early April. (A friend of mine said she got the same place for $100, so start your bidding low, people.)The location is great, right on Kensington High Street, about a ten-minute walk from the Tube station. The Royal Albert Hall and several museums (including the spectacular Victoria &amp; Albert) are about a mile away, Kensington Palace is a little bit closer, and I ate dinner at a very nice little Persian place called Apadana just down the road.I walked in and was received warmly (there's irony there, as we shall see) and was checked in immediately. My room was snug, as is normal in a British hotel, but comfy and nicely appointed. The only problem was the temperature. It was warm and stuffy in the room, so I turned the temp down and left to go hit the museum and eat dinner. When I got back it was only slightly cooler in the room. After an hour or so, I realized it wasn't going to get better and I wasn't going to be able to sleep. I tried opening the window, but my window opened onto an airshaft with a very loud machine -- probably the source of the warm air. I called the front desk and asked if I could move to another room. Instead they sent an engineer up to look at the heating/cooling system. He said that he found and fixed the problem. But two hours later it was no better. When I called the desk again, they promptly put me in another room and gave me a breakfast voucher for my trouble. The AC worked great in my new room and the breakfast buffet was very good.So overall, I'd have to say that I have no complaints. There were a couple of problems, but every hotel will have problems -- what matters is how they take care of them, and the Hilton Olympia did just fine. I'd recommend it to others traveling to London -- though maybe not for a couple, at least not for an extended stay, as the rooms really are not very big.	
Apr 14 2008 	Decent Clean Good Location	We stayed at the Hilton London Olympia after scoring a good deal on priceline - around $100USD per night. This is definitely NOT a 4-star quality hotel, but it's a pretty good deal for it's combination of location, cleanliness, and surrounding amenities. The room was indeed tiny, but pretty normal by European standards. The linens were nice and the toiletries they provided were also good, but housekeeping neglected to replace them during our three night stay. There was no in-room safe (I think that only some rooms have them) but you could ask to store valuables in the hotel safe free of charge. The room was drafty at times, but the heating system seemed to work OK. There were some pretty good restaurants in the area (Mirch Masala which was an Indian place right across the street was nice and cheap) and there was a TESCO convenience store down the street from the hotel. There was also a huge 24hr TESCO grocery store about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. The Olympia tube station is steps away, but the Earls Court station (which is about a 15-20 min walk away) is your better bet for more regular service. Also, there are multiple bus lines nearby which can take you to Notting Hill, where there are other great restaurants and shopping. In general, this is not a luxury hotel (it's more on the 3 star level) but it's perfectly fine if you plan on touring around the city for the most part and just need a clean, safe, comfortable place to sleep.	
Apr 9 2008 	Good value for London  but don't open the mini bar	Snowstorms meant I had to stay in London in order to be sure of making it to an early meeting in Hammersmith. Chose the Hilton Olympia because it was within walking distance and not ludicrously expensive and, having seen the reviews, was pleasantly surprised.Had asked for a quiet room and was given one at the back of the hotel on the 6th floor, overlooking back gardens and the air con/heating plant (of which more later). Room large, comfortable, recently decorated but incredibly hot, even with the heating turned off. Charming porter arrived to unlock the window, which restored some kind of equilibrium to the temperature (apparently the heating is either on full or off totally, no half measure possible)  and let in the sound of the heating/air con machinery. Well, I guess it would have been a quiet room, if I'd kept the window shut and sweltered.Noise was OK while watching tv and a bit disturbing when trying to sleep  but not nearly as bad as the plumbing. I think the outlet pipes from the floor above must have run through a wall of my room because the noise of water draining (which began at about 5.30am) was horrific.So I got an early start  and then discovered that the hotel had added £3 to my bill simply because I'd opened the mini bar. That's right  opened it. I wanted to see if there was room for some fruit I'd brought with me. They knocked the amount off after I complained but it's a cheeky way of making a bit of extra money  I suspect a lot of people, especially those on expenses, simply don't bother to argue for such a small amount. Staff were pleasant, though, and all in all it was good enough value.	
Apr 8 2008	It is what it is	I stayed here for 14 nights across a four week period March - April 2008. This hotel is large a little well-worn but generally pleasant. The rooms were spotlessly clean and all the staff I dealt with were exemplary. I made my bookings through lastminute.com and this made the hotel reasonable value - I have seen some very aggressive pricing on expedia and elsewhere and If i'd spent £150 a night for a room here I wouldn't have got what I expected at all. As a building the hotel has some quirks - sputtery showers, sinks that don't really drain, distinct variations in the heating from room - overall nothing serious with one notable exception; in the centre of the building is an airwell with airconditioning or heating ducts - one room I was in (831 I think) actually shook at 4:30 am when the system started in the morning - think &quot;engine room&quot;. Some other things grate too - the food is overpriced and ordinary - but across the road there is an outstanding and inexpensive Noodle/Sushi bar &quot;The Hare and Tortoise&quot;. Transport links are good but different from what may be expected - The very nearby Kensington Olympia station has a very limited service but High Street Kensington is a leisurely 10 minute stroll and more notably there is a very extensive bus service to multiple destinations outside the door of the hotel.Summary : A pleasant hotel, possibly with more &quot;character&quot; than the slick and generic branded Hilton-ness it aspires to. I liked it. Overall :4/5. Staff : 5/5 . Facilities : 3/5 . Location 4/5.	
Apr 8 2008 	Just Okay-Tired Decor Cordial Staff	If you are expecting a 4 star hotel, you will be disappointed. However, the staff was particularly helpful, and friendly. I arrived at 10:00 a.m. and was given a room right away, which I really appreciated.The hotel's exterior was drab to the extreme. The lobby was uninviting-only a couple of chairs. The escalator to the Plum Cafe makes the lobby sound like a mall.The halls were also drab, but once I got in the room, it was slightly better. The linens and carpet in my room were new, and tasteful, although the duvet was polyester. The walls, ceiling, and furniture were nicked, bent, rubbed, and dented, giving it a shabby look, despite the attempt to redecorate.The hotel was retrofitted with central AC, which lowers the ceiling at the entry and throughout the bath by about 10 inches. This makes the shower impossible for anyone over about 5'4&quot;. The bath tub itself is a good 6 inches above the floor level, and then the reduced ceiling really causes a shower problem. On the positive side, the hotel uses Crabtree and Evelyn products, which made me feel a little better about things.There was a tea kettle, cups, tea, instant coffee, sugar, cream, and shortbread in the room. I love this touch in English hotels. The TV was a flat screen, and had a good number of channels, including non-English. The room was a decent size about 16 by 18 feet, with the bath included in that. The windows were small, and separated by a fairly large expanse of curtained wall. The windows did not provide much light. The view was of pipes and plumbing, and had a very industrial look. The windows opened a few inches for fresh air, but there was too much outside noise to leave them open for sleep. (It was cold, so I did not want them open- cannot say if the AC is adequate to sleep with them closed in summer.)Location is a bit off the tube, but if you catch any of the buses outside the hotel, you can quickly get to the tube. All take you to Kensington High Street station. #27 will take you to Notting Hill Gate, which is on the Central Line. Take bus 9 to Picadilly, or bus 10 along Kensington High Street, Kennsington Gardens, right by Harrods and Fortnum and Mason, Hyde Park, Marble Arch, and on to Oxford Street. I personally prefer the bus which, although longer, is scenic. I was able to get an upstairs, front seat on almost every bus- what a view! Buy a travel card across the street from the bus stop for just over 3 pounds sterling for the day. The hotel lists its tube stop as Olympia, but that particular &quot;bend&quot; on the line does not run often- take the bus! The concierge were all very helpful.If you get a really good price on this hotel, I think you will be okay with it. If you pay rack rate, you will be disappointed.	
Apr 6 2008 	Okay	The nearest tube is Kensington High Street - about 15 minutes walk to the hotel. The Olympia Tube is closer but there is a limited service. TIP- catch the no 9 or 10 bus from directly outside the tube station and this takes you to the hotel.Breakfast was okay - if a little cold. The evening dinner was average.Service in the hotel was good, the room I was in was looking a little tired.Good location and excellent transport links. Went to the nearby Memories of China Restauaunt - good food - very expensive.	
Apr 3 2008 	Ho-hum Hilton	This hotel has seen better days. Having read the reviews prior to booking, I was forwarned. I asked at check-in if there was a renovated room and was told the renos don't start until May. I was on the 3rd floor, and although there was an elevator, there was a small set of stairs to negotiate on the way to my room, difficult for anyone with heavy luggage, or handicapped. It is mediocre in decor and furnishings and the bed was lumpy. .Internet access was available at 15 Pounds for the night (around $30) The bathroom was adequate with decent room and plenty of hot water. The adjoining door to the next room was unlocked..I had security come up and lock it.The room on the other side of me was taped off and sealed. It was being fumigated for some reason - optimistically, perhaps it was previously occupied by a smoker. The Brits are taking this very seriously. I paid about $100 for the night, and feel that it was fair value for the money. I felt safe and secure in the neighbourhood, Kensington. It was conveniently located next to the Kensington Olympia Tube Station that is also a depot for National Rail. Good connections to the rest of the city as well as Gatwick Airport and off towards Birmingham, my next destination. There are plenty of restaurants nearby with a lot of culturally diverse cuisine. I chose a sandwich shop across the street and brought snacks from the nearby Tesco store (rather like a typical North American supermarket - open 24 hours!)I'd be interested in trying this location again to see if there really are renovations forthcoming.	
Apr 2 2008 	simply not acceptable	As I read the other reviews of this property, I realize that we each bring to any experience, our personal histories. So a five star rating can be worthless if there are not the same standards. In the last six months I have stayed at 3 Hilton properties-2 in London and 1 in Portland, Oregon USA. Each was different. The Olympia was definitely the worst. The property is a bit remote and in a non-descript neighbordhood. It is an older building from somewhere in the 1960's I would guess. Rather drab.We arrived mid-day and the check-in was relatively painless for the two rooms I had booked through Priceline, although one room was not ready. My first room was on the street side #701. It was uninspiring as the general impression of the hotel, badly outdated with a run-down feeling even tho everything seemed clean and new. I am sure that I would have enjoyed the room but for the street noise. Kensington High Street has a fair amount of traffic. Fortunately, I always travel with earplugs, I slept.The following morning I went to the front desk and asked about the charges on my bill for the minibar. I had consumed nothing from the minibar, but I had moved a few things to put in a few perishables which I had brought over fom Belgium. I was told because I had moved things in the minibar, I was being charged.The charges were removed. I dropped off at 8am some clothes to be laundered for the return trip the USA, the following day. Also, I asked if there was another room since my room was noisy. No problem-- a quieter room away from the street was blocked for me. The room was not ready and when I got back that afternoon, I should check with the front desk for a key. Upon my arrival, I went to the Hilton Honor's check in, which was unoccupied. The receptionist at the &quot;regular&quot; check-in ignored and was handling the long line of check-ins. She ignored me until I asked if anyone was at the Hilton Honor's check-in and that I simply needed my key card. She told me someone should be there in a few minutes. After ten minutes, I asked again, she was now handling another customer and told me she did not know where the receptionist was. I asked for a manager. After several minutes more, no manager came. The receptionist refused to offer to help me and ignored me. I walked over to the concierge/bell desk and explained my situation as I was running late for theatre that evening. The bell man, simply walked over, asked me for my last name and handed me the key card. When I got to the room #603, the room was a sauna--someone had put the heat on high. I noticed that the theatre performance that night was earlier than normal and tried to use the hotel phone to call my friend who was staying at the nearby Holiday Inn, Kensington Forum (great place!) to let her know that we needed to get to the theatre earlier than we thought. I could not raise a house operator or get my call through on the phone because the telephone kept on telling me that I was calling from an unoccupied room. When I arrived after theatre and dinner, I stopped by the desk and asked for a wake up call, no problem. Once in my room, my laundry was not delivered. I went downstairs to the desk. No sign of my laundry. With a little bit investigation, my laundry had been delivered to my old room which was then occupied. The desk said they would straighten it out. I reminded the desk, I had a morning flight out of England. Next morning, no wake up call. No laundry. I checked with the desk. They had not heard from the occupant(s) of the room where they thought the laundry might be and told me that there would be no charge for the laundry and that they would send my laundry to me.Ok, this might not happen to everyone. However, I for one don't consider it acceptable. I just hope I get my laundry some day.	
Mar 28 2008 	Pleasantly surprised a nice stay.	We took a brief trip to London over the Easter weekend and stayed three nights at the Hilton Olympia. Given the hit or miss reviews here (and the relatively poor reviews of hotels in our price range), we weren't expecting much. To my surprise, however, we got a very nice room (for the price range, of course) and were impressed by the hotel. The lobby is in good condition, and there were always staff on hand to answer questions whenever we passed through. Most front desk staff were friendly, though there was often a short line at the desk. Our floor was in good shape, though nothing to write home about, but our room was better than I expected. It was the 'accessible' room, so there's a chance it had been remodeled recently. But everything worked well, was very clean, and not at all shabby looking. Of course it was modestly sized, but it didn't feel cramped for two people. The location turned out to be just fine, though there are likely more convenient places depending on your budget. Like recent reviewer we don't mind walking, and we often went on foot to high street Kensington or even Notting Hill. That said, the tube station is very close and we never waited more then 10 minutes for a train. If you stay here, pick up a bus map, too. There are a couple very useful and convenient bus routes, which we used frequently once we figured them out. Overall, I'd recommend the hotel, especially if you can get it at a discounted price. We had a very nice stay and would happily go back again. This certainly isn't a high-end hotel, but it turned out to be an excellent value. A few details: - We booked through Priceline. I don't know the tripadvisor policy on quoting prices, but we paid significantly less than the best available published rate. Try the biddingfortravel site for a reference point. - Our room was on the 7th floor. It seems likely that some rooms are nicer than others, but our floor was in good shape (and our room in great shape).- We expected a room with two twin beds but got a room with one larger bed. I think the two twins would have been less appealing. - We didn't eat in the restaurant, though we did have a drink, which was quite expensive. There are other eating options within about a half-mile from the hotel.	
Mar 25 2008 	Disappointed	Check-in process was OK. The walk to the bedroom was from one corridor yet it had three different carpets - it would have looked much nicer if only one! The room was a little tired but OK. The restaurant were serving a buffet meal when we arrived and the waitress that served us was completely out of her depth and didn't understand what a cabernet or a rioja were, but hey ho. I stayed here for business so it was fine for a couple of nights, I would stay again but I would look for other hotel choices in the area before confirming my booking.	
Mar 21 2008 	Disappointing	The good: the rate on the hotel (through Hotwire) was great, especially considering the exchange. While not the most central location, I'd been to conventions at the Olympia center so knew what to expect as far as travel.While you have to transfer to get anywhere else in London, there's a tube station just around the corner - not more than a 2 block walk. If you walk away from the convention center, High Street Kensington is not too far away and you can find plenty of stores and restaurants that will let you bypass roomservice, and the overpriced snacks and drinks in the minibar.The bad: The bed was okay if you didn't take the blankets off. Otherwise, I could have been sleeping on a wood block with a mattress pad and sheet and wouldn't have known the difference.The really bad: Despite the fact that I pre-paid my room, the card I left for incidentals was charged the room rate. Essentially, they made me pay twice. Additionally, when I checked in the receptionist told me my card wouldn't go through for the $300/£150 incidental hold and that I would need to leave cash (I had the foresight to refuse a hold on my debit card). Imagine my surprise when I check my statement and see $410/£205 worth of holds from the Hilton - £55 more than what should have been held. The best part? The ridiculous amount (honestly, who goes through $100/£50 a day?) won't be released for 2 weeks. For a 3 day stay that was supposed to be a bargain, I'm out $1000/£500 and the time spent filing request forms and contacting billing departments.	
Mar 13 2008 	Bad start but ok afterall	Checking was an appalling experience. I arrived with 2 colleagues, and the receptionist gave me my key and totally ignored my colleagues, despite the fact that I had written our 3 names on a paper for her.She went on to serve someone else, and when I told her we were still waiting for 2 keys, she didn't call anyone else to help.I have never seen such poor service in a Hilton hotel.Eventually, an employee appeared and was able to help us.It took us 20 minutes to get 3 keys.This was a terrible first impression, but the staff at breakfast as well as the concierge were so helpful, courteous and friendly that the bad check in experience was almost forgotten.	
Mar 12 2008 	Fantastic Stay at the Hilton Olympia!	Just returned from a 7 night stay with my wife, and I was lucky enough to score this hotel through Priceline. Truth be told, I was a little nervous when I read the reviews on Trip Advisor, but my fears were eased within minutes of checking in to the hotel. First of all, the hotel is in a GREAT location. It's within 10-15 minutes walking distance of Earl's Court (major tube junction on the District Line), High Street Kensington, Notting Hill Gate, West Kensington, Hammersmith &amp; City, and Kensington Olympia stations. True, the Olympia station (the closest) only offers limited tube service to Earl's Court; however, the other stations are a short walk away, and it's all through nice parts of the city. Connections from Olympia to Earl's Court run at least 3-4 times an hour (or every 15-20 minutes), so simply time your journey accordingly. Over the course of the week my wife and I found out how walkable the city really was, and we practically stopped using the Tube by the end of our trip, choosing to walk from the hotel to the grocery store or our favorite restaurants.The Kensington area couldn't be more beautiful, and my wife and I loved strolling through the neighborhoods directly behind the hotel. Having stayed in many other parts of London, I felt VERY safe being out late at night in the areas surrounding the hotel. Two other highlights (out of many) are Holland Park (less than half a mile from the hotel) and Hyde Park (a little over a mile from the hotel and a GREAT place to run).Our room was located on the 5th floor near the stairwell and we had a BEAUTIFUL view of Kensington High Street. There was little to no noise from the street, just the occassional sound of a train passing by (just the sound of wheels on the tracks; no whistles, etc.) By night two I was sleeping through this.There are no less than 4 grocery stores within EASY walking distance of the hotel: 1 Tesco Express, 1 &quot;Normal&quot; Tesco, 1 &quot;Mega&quot; 24 Hour Tesco, and a handful of smaller grocers (I only visited one of these though). Each store can be reached within 12 minutes, with the closest being a 5 minute walk just past the Olympia center.Our room was sparkling clean, the towels were fresh, the coffee, tea, and biscuits were replenished each day, and we always returned to a VERY clean room. The cleaning staff was also cordial, making an effort to say &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;good morning&quot; any time we passed. The rest of the staff was warm and friendly also--from the girl who made my wife's latte w/ soya each morning to the front desk staff. What more can I say? I would certainly stay here again, and I feel lucky to have scored this hotel for such a fabulous price. My only gripes are these1. no option for A/C in the room during the winter (the vent only blows out warm/hot air). It was a tad warm some evenings, and it would have been nice to get some A/C without having to open the window. No worries though.2. It cost me $10.00 to make two short local calls. The prices are very clearly marked on the phone, but all the same, the rates are a little excessive, especially when you're paying $3.50 for a less-than-a-minute phone call to make a dinner reservation. Again, no worries... just something to think about.I would recommend this hotel to anyone, even if you don't arrange your stay through Priceline. I would even go so far as to say that the Hilton London Olympia was the highlight of our stay in London.	
Mar 12 2008 	Definite NOT 4 stars	So I got this hotel via Priceline, $100 with tax a night. Pretty good price and was excited that it was rated as a 4 star hotel. However, all expectations shattered once I arrived.I have 2 major complaints: 1. Location. This place is very inconvenient, even though it's next to a tube station. Why it's bad? Because this tube station, Olympia, is the ONLY stop on this short special tube line. So you can imagine how NOT often it runs. It connects to the main line and you have to transfer. Also there was nothing around. No supermarket, a few businesses. Good luck getting some food or water when the tube stops running.2. I would accept the overall condition of this hotel more if this were rated 3 stars. I expected a nice hotel and was disappointed. Carpets were dingy, bed wasnt the Hilton bed, small 19 in TV, bathtub wont drain and towels smelled of damp cloths. Receptionists were polite though.Overall, dont expect too much.	
Mar 10 2008 	Hilton London Olympia fine but 3 (not 4) stars	Priceline claimed 4-stars; TripAdvisor and others rated it 3 stars. Priceline claimed someone won $100 bid on 4-star in area; I tried that but no go. Got it for $131 (65-pounds) plus another 30 in fees and taxes). Plusses: The rooms come with a 110-volt plug, so you dont need a converter. Very friendly and helpful concierge, though they suggest the #9 bus (which takes a LOT longer) instead of the tube. Room was quite acceptable. Clean. Hot water worked well. Noise level and hall lighting seemed fine to me. Had about 14 TV stations plus PPV movies. Fitness club has several bicycle and treadmills, plus a few free weights and a Universal machine and a rowing machine. Tesco just down the road to stock up on shopping. Nearest District Line tube stops (Kensington/Olympia) has somewhat limited service, so its often better to walk the 15 minutes to Earls Court (District Line). Negatives: Internet service is NOT free as seemed to be suggested. In fact, it runs a hefty 15-pounds per day ($30). 3-pounds ($6) for 15-minutes. Ouch. They didnt turn my phones on in the room until the second day. Came back after full day away and my room wasnt cleaned. It was kind of a hassle to keep going back west to the hotel. I ended up doing more things in the Leicester Square and South Bank area, so next time Ill probably stay closer to Victoria. Really small twin bed; I almost rolled off it. Kind of hard bed, but decent pillows.	
Mar 9 2008 	Just about makes the grade..	A couple of years ago, I stayed at this hotel when on business and found it to be perfectly acceptable, so when I found out that this was the hotel I booked on Hotwire, I wasn't too disappointed. I knew it wasn't the best hotel in the world, but for the price I was paying I certainly felt it was acceptable. Check-in was reasonably speedy and I was assigned a double room. Naturally, however, having paid a discounted rate I was put in the older wing of the hotel, and it *really* shows. It's night and day - the newer part where I stayed previously was fine in a chain hotel sort of way, but the older part suffers badly. The rooms/bathroom was very small. The decor is dated, and the rooms/corridors are dark and unwelcoming. Lots of noise from outside, and the TV reception was just terrible.Location wise, it's convenient - lots of good bus links to Oxford Street/Theatre district/Hammersmith/Kensington - so shopping and entertainment is available if that's your thing. However, as an overall experience it's disappointing, even by Hilton standards. I'd recommend it at a budget, budget price - but pay full/Hilton rates? No way!	
Mar 9 2008 	Great hotel excellent value for money!	I booked this hotel through lastminute.com for £65 a night - the standard nightly rate is £195 so I got quite a bargain. I thought that this was a great hotel, the beds were comfortable, plenty of hot water for showers and most of all, the rooms were well soundproofed. The rooms were also nice and clean.The only slight downers were that the rooms were a little bit small but then again in my view if you're a tourist then you're not going to spend much time in your room! The other minor issue is that the hotel is not on a main underground line, the nearest station is Kensington Olympia (just around the corner) where the trains are every 12-19 minutes and you have to change onto the main line at High Street Kensington or Earls Court. However, there is a bus stop literally a stone's throw from the hotel where you can catch either the number 9 or 10 and it will take you into the centre of London within 30 minutes (or quicker in the evenings/very early mornings). In my opinion it was nice to get the bus for a change because you get to see your surroundings instead of being on the tube and seeing darkness!I'll definitely be looking at this hotel for my next visit!	
Mar 5 2008	dated but fine...	We stayed here for a couple of nights in late Feb, 2008.Yes, we'd read the reviews and yes, we did get a reasonably good deal by booking at the last minute, and whilst it was still not cheap, for London standards, the price was quite decent.The hotel itself is a little dated with need for a refurbishment as the decor was somewhat 70's, but it wasn't too bad at all really.Certainly the hotel was very clean, the staff were friendly and efficient and it was 15 minutes walk along High Street Kensington to the Kensington High Street tube station.The area itself is very safe and is close to Holland Park, Notting Hill and Kensington, so the restaurants are all quite good, it seems.Not having stayed at a Hilton previously, perhaps the standard might be a little lower than regular Hilton patrons might enjoy but overall, we would definitely stay at this hotel again, assuming we again got a decent deal.	
Mar 4 2008	Save the ozone layer!!	We have just returned from staying in this hotel. This is not the first time we have used the Olympia, and all in all we had a good stay. Staff were attentive and friendly. The rooms are being upgraded but we were not in a refurbished room. It was clean and spacious but the bathroom really needs to be re tiled etc. Very little headroom in the bath to take a shower, and take care of the marble top around the sink as in our room it over hung the edge of the bath and I caught my knee on it as i got into the bath.The most annoying problem throughout our three day stay was the near obsessive need of the housekeeping staff to spray our room with air freshner. (Did they know something that we did'nt?)I do not like artificial air sprays because they make me cough. Despite three requests we could not get them to stop spraying. The air freshner was also being sprayed in the reception areas and corridors. Afew bunches of real flowers would have been much more effective.	
Feb 26 2008 	Very satisfactory stay	My wife and I only stayed for one night on 21st February, but had a very satisfactory experience.The room was spotlessly clean and the bed very comfortable.The bathroom was in a good state of decoration, and both the shower and the air conditioning were very effective and easy to use.Within about 30 minutes of arriving in the room I received a telephone call from a member of the hotel's customer services team,welcoming us to the hotel and inviting us to contact her if we had any queries or concerns.The hotel reception staff were efficient and welcoming.My wife and I would have no hesitation in staying at the hotel again.Alan Whitfield	
Feb 25 2008 	Average quality but good breakfast	The Olympia Hilton is obviously great if you are working at / visiting Olympia next door as it is only a few metres from the exhibition centre. However, access to central London isn't that great as the overground tube line from the neaby station is not very frequent and it is a fifteen minute walk to Earls Court station.The hotel is fairly average in most regards, and probably not as good as you might expect from the Hilton name. That said, it is comfortable, clean and the staff are efficient. The only criticism of the room is that I couldn't work the air con/heating system and there weren't any instructions. The breakfast is amazing but fairly pricey if it isn't included in the room deal.	
Feb 21 2008 	Not worth the Hilton title	Stayed for just one night. Room a good size, bed very comfortable. Bathroom tatty to say the least - tiles and grouting very delapidated. Access panel in the wall had no grout round it at all and looked disgusting. Ceiling height in bathroom was so low that my head touched the ceiling when standing in the bath to shower. I physically had to hunch down to wash my hair! Beware if you are over 5 foot nine. Temperature of the room was horrendous even with air con on full blast. I woke up in the middle of the night with the sweat pouring off me - not a good feeling. Breakfast was booked as part of the night stay - certainly not worth the £17.50. The toaster wasn't working and the food was mediochre to say the least. Pot of tea was cold and the Twinings tea bag produced a grey coloured tea that was less than appetising.Hotel is close to tube but feels very remote from everything else. Took a ten to fifteen minute walk to find somewhere to eat - not that good if you are on your own.I definitely would not recommend this hotel as I expect a lot more from a Hilton. It felt more like a Holiday Inn to be honest.	
Feb 21 2008 	Not bad at all!	Booked a room for 1 night with my 2 girls for £60 plus tax, which was money well spent. Arrive early for check in but the room was ready. Very acceptable and bathroom was very nice, good toiletries (Crabtree and Evelyn).Had room service at 11 o clock after the theatre and it was excellent.Staff lovely and very helpful.Only downside, it is a little out on a limb, a good 9 mins walk from High Street Ken tube, but High Street Ken is very nice for shopping.	
Feb 17 2008 	satisfactory stay	Good for a London hotel but not really adequate to the Hilton brand name. Having stayed at many hotels in London, the room size is good, the staff is helpful, breakfast excellent but pricey and the location is quite central. However, if you can afford one of the more expensive Hiltons in London, and you fancy something more luxurious you should choose another hotel!	
Feb 4 2008 	OK for 1 night	I paid just over $100 for 1 night on priceline at this hotel. I arrived at about 5.30 pm, went out after I'd dropped off my luggage in my room &amp; left next morning before 6 a.m. so I didn't eat at the restaurant or use other facilities. The lobby was crowded when I arrived &amp; there was only 1 staff member trying to deal with a queue of people waiting to check in as well as somebody looking for lost property. The room when I got to it was fine. I didn't use the in room internet facilities which at $30 a night are more expensive than US hotels, but there was an adequate supply of tea &amp; coffee. There were lots of people trying to get advice &amp; assistance from the concierge when I went to ask for directions which added to the impression at check-in that more staff were needed. The nearest tube station is Olympia which is less than 5 minutes walk away &amp; has restricted opening hours. Otherwise it's quite a walk to the Tube &amp; the location isn't very central. It's OK for 1 night, but unless you have a special reason to be in Olympia I'd recommend that you go somewhere else.	
Jan 16 2008 	Convenient Location	I reserved this hotel through Priceline for $80 a night. For that price it is difficult to complain, but honestly I would not pay more than $100 for this hotel. The hallways and doors are worn and in desperate need of replacement but the room itself was clean and a little more updated. The heater did not work so it was pretty cold but bearable if you do not plan on spending much time in your room during the winter months. The staff was very helpful and one of the great things about this hotel is that the concierge will hold your luggage in a safe room after check out if you have a late flight and want to spend more time in London. Also, the location is very convenient. It is only about a mile to the shops on Kensington Street and you can take the number 9 bus in front of the hotel to Piccadilly Circus or the metro anywhere only one block away. There is a shop almost directly across the street that sells bus and metro passes. I stopped by every day and they were more than happy to give me bus information and directions to wherever I needed to go. Overall this hotel is great if you can get a deal and you do not plan on spending much time in your room.	
Jan 15 2008 	Average hotel with above average service	We stayed in the Hilton Olympia for one night - overall the hotel is very average - stale, tired communal areas - kind of what we've sadly come to expect from large chain hotels.On the plus side, the staff are all very friendly, happy and knowledgeable - which certainly lifts the whole experience.Our standard double room was more spacious than we were expecting, with a fairly modern bathroom.We were a little disappointed to find some rubbish in a corner that must've been missed by the cleaners.Parking is provided by the NCP under the hotel at a staggering £32 for 24 hours - it must be the dingiest car park in the UK - watch for the height restriction too - our people carrier only just made it!Despite being a HiltonHonours silver member, we were initially given a room with a view of the air conditioning ducts!! However, after a quick call through to customer services this was swiftly remedied and we were moved up to the 6th floor with a more open view over kensington High St.Overall, if you're not looking for anything too special - it's fine!!	
Jan 3 2008 	Pleasant but 2.5 star standards	We stayed here for three nights. Considering that I won this hotel for a bargain Priceline bid of total $120/night, I was satisfied. Had I paid the standard nightly rate I would have been disappointed as this hotel is more like 2.5 stars. Go here if you can get a bargain and if you just want a decent place to sleep with a private bathroom, but not if you want to spend significant time relaxing in the hotel.The concierge provides facilities for checking luggage should you arrive early. The staff is polite and helpful. The queen-sized bed was comfortable and our room was, although small by North American standards, sufficiently spacious. We had a relatively quiet room overlooking a park. The bathroom included high quality Crabtree &amp; Evelyn bath products, and the showers were hot with good water pressure. On the downside, the bathroom was in poor repair. Anyone over 5'10&quot; could not stand up to full height in the shower. The countertops were deeply cracked. The toilet was old, loud and very difficult to flush. The temperature controls seemed to do nothing so the room was very cold (in December). Facilities in the hotel were also lacking - although there was an exercise room, no pool or sauna was available. There was no icebox available although a cup of ice could be requested free of charge from the bar. One final thing to beware - the minibar automatically charges your room if you remove anything. Be careful if you are a label-reader like I am, as it can be expensive! The front desk was cooperative about removing the charges as they said it happens a lot.	
Dec 27 2007 	Good location poor service and no hot water	On checking in we were given a twin room when we had booked a double and were informed that there were no more available. The location was excellent and the room was lovely and quiet. The room was spacious with a large bathroom with a shower and bath. The stay would have been great apart from the mix up with the double/twin room booking apart from....We got up in the morning and went to run a shower. After running the hot water for 20mins no hot water came. We called down to reception who informed us that they knew of the problem and would compensate us on checkout. We had to boil the kettle for warm water to wash in. On check out the hotel informed us that they could not give us a discount in the room as we had already got a discounted rate and could only offer us food or drink vouchers to use in that hotel. We would have gladly accepted vouchers to use in another Hilton.When at home we rang Hilton hotels direct and got a full refund of our room.Generally a good hotel but it seemed like a lack of hot water was not a problem and the hotel staff could ahve been more understanding.	
Dec 18 2007 	Very happy stay!	This hotel is great despite its slightly geographically anomalous location. I was nervous when I read the reviews saying the London Olympia was not really a 4* hotel but I have to say I disagree with those reviewers. I have traveled all over western Europe and parts of Asia, worked and lived in France and England, and was perfectly happy with my stay here. I felt totally comfortable and at ease at the hotel-- I trusted its cleanliness and trustworthiness.It is a waste of time and energy to compare living conditions in Europe to those generally found in the States-- everything in America is simply newer than in Europe, and change happens much more quickly and easily in the States. Thus, yes, carpeting in the hallways is a bit worn. But the room was comfortably large (two twin beds, nightstand, dresser, TV, vanity table, hairdryer, corner table and armchair, armoire/closet; Crabtree &amp; Evelyn toiletry products). The mattresses were fine (none of that button stuff nor any thickness issues), pristine clean sheets and towels, warm duvet. We had a great open view out of our window and had no problems with noise. Bathroom was spacious for Europe. Shower had separate water pressure and temperature controls, which was great. I will say, though, that while the ceilings were probably 8 ft high, you had to step up into the bath, which means that if you're taller than 5'6&quot;, the ceiling will be an issue. Regarding the location, the closest Tube stop is Kensington (Olympia). It is weirdly connected to the Underground system (look at a map, you'll see what I mean) but there are many buses that stop right outside the hotel that will take you conveniently into the city centre. The good thing about this particular Tube stop is that there are no stairs involved-- so if you're taking the Tube in from Heathrow, you can switch at Earl's Court (which is also wheelchair friendly, thus has elevators wherever you need them) for the District line, get off at Kensington Olympia and not have to haul 50lb suitcases up and down stairs. Just make sure you get on a train going to the correct station! :DOne more thing to consider is that the rack rate for this hotel is something like 400 USD/night. I used Priceline and got it for $100 ($120 after taxes&amp;fees) which is £50. You can barely get a 2.5star hotel for that price in London. I know prices can seem excruciating in the UK but constantly converting doesn't change anything. What you get for £50 in England is what you might get for $50 in the States.My last comment is just a reiteration of a previous reviewer's suggestion to have breakfast at Caffe Concerto on the Kensington High Street. It's literally just across from the High Street Kensington tube stop (4 stops on the bus, several lines pass on this route) and has a good full English breakfast for £6.95. Marks &amp; Spencer is also across the street from the Caffe and has its own cafe in their foodhall which is really lovely and probably a bit cheaper.	
Dec 5 2007 	Full of Good Surprises	My first experience with Priceline.com and this was the hotel I won for only $85/night (American dollar); which was amazing as we were expecting to pay at least $300/night in London. The terrible reviews I read had me dreading my stay. In between hotels, we decided to attempt an early check-in at noon, or at least check our luggage. Surprisingly we were allowed to check-in when we arrived. We were given a Double Room which was a king size bed - another good surprise, as I expected a much smaller full size bed.Arriving on the 7th floor the carpeting was worn, but not near as terrible as other reviewers suggested. The biggest surprise came as we opened the door to our room -  - it was a newly decorated  - very spacious  - new bedding - new bathroom - linens included large bath sheets - the London Olympia train / tube station is located very nearby, I will warn that the bathtub/shower base is about 12-18 inches off the ground and the ceiling in the bath is dropped. Not an issue for my husband and I who are 5'8&quot; and 5'4&quot;, but it could be uncomfortable for a taller person. Everything in the bath appeared to be freshly updated and clean. The shower head was new and we had GREAT water pressure, which allowed us to indulge in long relaxing showers, too bad there was not a fan in the shower.As noted by another reviewer, there is no top sheet, only a bottom (fitted?) sheet and comforter. We also experieced no top sheet, however what you do have is a nice comforter covered by a duvet cover; the duvet is changed in between guests. This is a trend I've noticed in the U.S. over the past year or two, which is nice for us germ freaks. I felt very comfortable with the clean crisp duvet/comforter - no dirty bedspreads or blankets to worry about.Our stay was WONDERFUL despite only two small issues: - our last night we asked for a wakeup call at 7am, they actually called at 6:14am. - Our checkout papers showed we had made charges at the Plum Grill, which we had not. It took only a few minutes to correct.Highly recommended.	
Nov 20 2007	A Bargain from Priceline but not a 4* hotel	For $125 through Priceline, our room was a bargain (given London prices), but it really compares to a 2.5* US hotel. As mentioned earlier, the room was relatively big, the bathroom was small, but very clean and the shower was good. The bed, however, was horribly uncomfortable with the vintage 1960 buttons pressing into you from the blue and white ticking cover. Sitting at the end of the bed, it would compress to less than four inches thick! I asked for an extra pad to be put on the bed and they made the bed with another duvet under the sheet.I enjoyed the teapot with the tea and fresh cream. However, I had to ask for a hairdryer, and then there was not a convenient outlet to plug it into. The neighborhood was very nice, and we enjoyed walking back and forth to the Kensington High Street tube station, near which are lots of shops.	
Nov 16 2007 	THIS IS A 2.5 star hotel...	I booked from priceline for a $99 dollar bid and got offered this room for $125, so i took it, knowing that is an awesome price for 4 star in london. we arrived and were immediately wowed by the front lobby/restaurant/elevators...we arrived on the 8th floor and felt like we were accidentally backstage all of a sudden, the halls and carpet were pretty dated and worn out. the room is spacious for london, but the shower is a kindve really crappy pulsing thing that is really difficult to adjust the temperature. the area is quite a haul to get to leicster square, where we go to see west end shows, and you will probably find it out of the way for most london attractions (westminister abbey/parliament/london tower etc...) i wont go back to this hotel primarily for the location reason....hilton should really grade this hotel appropriately as a 3 star...i would call it 2.5 star...oh and be careful with the minibar!!! they know if you open the door and look around at the stuff in it by weights/springs... if you are already stuck with this room from a priceline bid, and you are now reading these reviews....dont sweat it...it isnt bad for the price at all....it is just misrepresented as a 4 star, and btw...ask the front desk for an upgrade and he will give you free drink coupons for the adjoining pub;)	
Nov 14 2007 	a nice hotel for the money!	Well, I was &quot;playing around&quot; on Priceline a few months ago and put in a bid for $90 for a hotel roon in London....Lo and behold, I got the Hilton Olympia....I then went to Tripadvisor to check on the hotel and immediately became depressed! The reviews were generally terrible! BUT...the hotel is fine!!! It is in a nice part of town..western area of the city. There is a bus(#9,10,27) that stops right next to the hotel that will take you to the High Street Kensington station(which is the best for service and connections)...the subway system is GREAT and will take you everywhere!! I never waited more than 5 minutes for a subway or bus(even on Sunday!).The hotel receptionist was nice and gave me a room on the 4th floor....the floor is a bit &quot;tired looking&quot;, but not a problem. The room was nice, fairly large(for London) and pretty clean. The bathroom was fine with a great shower! A maid came daily to give new towels and straighten out the room(did not change sheets daily, but that's ok for a short visit). I was quite happy with the room..for the price, it was unbeatable!!Breakfast at the hotel is expensive...go to Cafe Concerto(?) which is right across the street from the subway station)..a full English breakfast(eggs,toast,sausage,bacon, OJ and coffee) for 7 pounds!!All in all, I was quite happy with the hotel..It seems that the rooms do vary, so try for the fourth floor! Enjoy this great town!!Oh, there is a news stand right across the street from the hotel..have USA Today, phone cards and travelcards for the subway and buses..definitely get the 3 day travel card(if the timing is right)which is the best buy in town!!	
Nov 13 2007 	We enjoyed our stay	After booking through Hotwire, I read many of the less than positive reviews and walked into the lobby at 1PM feeling somewhat apprehensive. But the front desk staff were warm and welcoming and we were immediately given a twin room on the third floor which was spacious by London standards. There was more than adequate storage and sitting space and even an iron and a kettle. The only negative is that the ceiling in the shower is indeed really low. Public transport was convenient and the area was quite safe at night. The room temperature and noise level allowed us to sleep pleasantly. The beds were actually quite comfy. We did not have breakfast included but the morning walk along High Street Ken gave us a great variety of choices. On our last day, we were able to leave our luggage at reception and then collect it in the late afternoon before departing from Heathrow.I would definitely return.	
Nov 11 2007	Great place to stay	We had an enjoyable stay at the Hilton Olympia. Our first night's room was at the front of the hotel and was quite noisy, but our subsequent nights, at the end of our tour, were at the back of the hotel, and it was peaceful and quiet. The rooms were small and there was insufficient room to manoeuvre my suitcase past my bed. The bag was too heavy for me to lift and I had to move the bed to access my side of the room with my suitcase, (which wasn't excessively large just heavy.)The rooms were very comfortable, bathrooms good with very good quality toiletries. We stayed for four days and in that time the tea, milk and coffee supplies weren't replenished. Staff were courteous and helpful. The owner of the small souvenir shop was very pleasant.Breakfast was OK, and that was the only hotel that had peanut butter available, now if they could have included a jar of Vegemite, I would have been even more delighted!Only one gripe! There are silly little flights of stairs to negotiate when one leaves the lifts. At my age, and state of unfitness with a sciatic back problem, this presented a huge difficulty for me and I had to impose on the kindness of fellow guests to help me to get my bags up and down the stairs. I was able to use the Porter service when I left but there didn't appear to be the same service available when I booked in. (two occasions).	
Nov 8 2007 	Really nice stay	We stayed here for a weekend break in London. The room was small as was to be expected for London, but not tiny. Yes, the hotel could do with a decor update but it was not in a bad state, just dated. My bed was really comfy but my husbands had a few springs that popped up now and then. Everything was lovely and clean.The staff were efficient, helpful and very friendly. We had the dinner and breakfast package (booked through the hotel website, a better deal than I could find on hotel search websites). The dinner was a bit bland but the breakfasts were great.Overall we had a really nice stay and would come back here.	
Nov 7 2007 	Not bad	Just got back from spending 5 nights at the Hilton Olympia. I was very nervous about it after &quot;winning&quot; it on priceline and then reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor. I have to say though that things turned out just fine. It certainly isn't a glamourous hotel but you could certainly do worse.Lobby was much smaller than I thought (but who cares about the lobby!) Elevators were tiny - but it is Europe so get used to it. Hotel room was tiny - but again, it is Europe so get used to it. The important thing is that our room was just fine. I've stayed at worse in Europe and stayed at better. This was kind of right in the middle. Bathroom was tiny but was in good shape - just needed a little grout work underneath the bathtub faucet. There was nothing materially wrong the bathroom. The bed was hard for my tastes and I had a hard time staying comfortable all night - so caution for those who dislike hard beds. One day we walked down the stairs and I got a glimpse of some of the other floors - some certainly looked better than others. We were on the 7th floor and it was one of the better looking floors. Probably half of the floors looked like ours and the others looked a little more dated. I have no idea as to the consistency of the rooms themselves.I'm a diamond member so we were able to get complimentary breakfast - which is about the right price for the breakfast. My wife enjoyed it far more than I. It by no means is worth the 17 pound price per person. Don't do it if you have to pay.Location was good and bad. If you are flying into Gatwick it is extremely convenient - some commuter trains go straight there (to Olympia station) from the airport - other change in Claphan Junction. Really slick. The hotel is a little bit out from everything. We used the Olympia station for catching the &quot;tube&quot; a little more than half the time. Usually there was a train waiting for us there and we would sit on it for about 5 minutes until we were off. Go to High Kensington (a little bit of a walk away) if you want to get on the circle line - but for every other line Olympa worked just great. So, again, the hotel was just fine. If you get in on Priceline you don't need to dread it. We did not get upgraded to a bigger room with my diamond status but perhaps they gave us one of their nicer standard rooms. I just don't know. If you are flying into Gatwick you could do far worse.	
Nov 4 2007 	A poor example of the brand.	Not what I'd expect from the Hilton brand. The lobby and check-in were fine, but the lifts were tiny, the guest rooms poky, small, run-down and dark, with noisy air-conditioning that could not be effectively controlled. Our stay was only one night, and even that was marred by a fire alarm which was handled incredibly badly by the hotel staff - nobody seemed to be in charge, there was no indication when it was safe to return to the building, and as a result of the lack of organisation and information we almost missed our flight.I paid twice as much for this hotel as I did for the Hilton Islington a few weeks before, and was extremely disappointed. Even at a good priceline discount this hotel did not provide value for money. It seems to be aimed squarely at delegates at Olympia trade shows or conferences; services and food are aimed entirely at business travellers on expenses and hence are priced at a level that bears no resemblance to their value on the open market.This is a soulless hotel with superficial glitz in the public areas but it's tired inside and seems to run on autopilot. It is not by any stretch of the imagination a credit to the Hilton name, being about the worst of their facilities I've stayed in.The only conceivable plus point is that the hotel is close to Olympia. There are much better hotels nearby, particularly in the Cromwell Road/Gloucester Road area.	
Oct 27 2007 	Good value; decent location	This is a terribly expensive time for US travelers to the UK, so we booked via Priceline. Got this hotel for $150 US, and found it to be a clean, comfortable, quiet hotel. Friendly staff, good amenities. The only drawback is that it is a 12 minute walk to the good subway station. It's very close to one station, but from that station you have to change trains twice in order to get anywhere. If you're traveling via taxi or car, this is a perfect hotel -- especially for the price.	
Oct 18 2007 	Think twice about staying here	We stayed two nights in October 2007 and were really disappointed at the standard of accommodation. Considering that it has been rated as a 4 star and that it is the Hilton we expected much more. The foyer was of a high standard but the minute you step out of the lift you realise that this standard is not continued throughout. The carpets in the corridors are worn and tattered - taped in several areas to prevent a trip hazard. The rooms are small and basic and in serious need of upgrading. Be warned about the breakfasts which are overpriced. A continental breakfast is £13.00 and a full English breakfast is £17.00. There is a more reasonably priced cafe across the street. I certainly wouldn't recommend this hotel and definately won't be back!!	
Oct 10 2007 	Very Convenient	We were also worried after reading the reviews, but got such a good price that we were willing to take a chance. The room was certainly adequate, the only problem being an incredibly hard bed. The next morning I asked for some kind of cushioning to be put on it when the bed was made up because my back was killing me. It didn't happen. I called housekeeping to complain &amp; 2 guys were there immediately to take care of it. Our maid also neglected to keep the coffee supplies refilled, but that was probably just one person and her tip reflected that.We were there strictly for sightseeing, so were delighted with the bus stop across the street from the hotel that took us either downtown or to the High Kensington Tube Station. We had the London Pass, so the only trip we paid for was down to pick up the Pass. The library is just a couple of blocks from the tube station, and a temporary library card gave me free access to the internet by appointment for up to an hour each day. I only used it a couple of times because we were just too busy. We didn't use the hotel restaurant because there were so many other options on Kensington High Street. But other than our particular maid, the rest of the staff was always friendly &amp; helpful.	
Oct 8 2007 	vetter than reviews	we had read previous reveiws about hotel and were a bit worriedit was totally unfoundedon entry the hotel smelt lovelyfast smooth check in and staff were excellentrooms clean, smart and large ok the view was nothing special but we werent there to look out of the windowvery close to kensington high street with a good array of bars restaurants and shopsall in all a very pleasant stay	
Oct 7 2007 	Very Average Clean Near Olympia Conference Center	Stayed here for conference at the end of September. Rate was reasonable at around 110 pounds per night. I would only stay here again if I wanted to be near the Olympia Conference Center. If you want a relatively inexpensive London hotel that is clean, but does not have much else going for it, try here. If you are looking for something 4 star or above, you need to go elsewhere. I stayed at the Hilton Paddington on my previous london trip. If proximity to conference center were not a factor, I would definitely choose the Hilton Paddington over the Hilton Olympia.Rooms are clean and very small. Beds are moderately comfortable. Not sure why some of the reviews here are so negative. I would not say this is a nice hotel, but for the price, what you get is not bad for the price range. Bar and restaurant in the hotel are decent. I had drinks in the bar and breakfast in the restaurant. I hate English Breakfast, but this one was not horrible and they had an omelet station. Across the street is a good Asian noodle house for a reasonable price, Hare and Tortoise. Try that out for some decent food.	
Sep 27 2007 	Average really average	Hotel was booked through a housing authority for a trade exhibition. However, the price of 157 pounds/night was pretty steep for what I got. The hotel was okay, but it was not a four-star like the web site said. It may be a three-star at best.The room was clean. There were some stains on the carpet and chairs. I had a few light bulbs not working. The worst part was the bed. I think new mattresses are a must for this hotel. I slept with a spring in my back for five nights. I think an air mattress would have been better.As for the restaurant, the food was not ranking either. I ate there twice, but both times were less than expected.Location, is good for the National/Olympia Hall. The hall is a quick right turn out the door. However, not a lot to do in this area.	
Sep 17 2007 	Very noisy not that good	Room correct but very noisy, inadequat soundproofing.Restaurant in hotel: mediocre cook, noisy (kitchen ventilation)	
Sep 9 2007 	Great for the twice the price	My daughter and I stayed here for 6 nights and had no major complaints. In fact we liked it a lot! We really liked the in-room coffee/tea service and biscuits that were refreshed daily, if not more. They also dropped off bottled water 2-3 times. We blew a fuse with our converter/adapter that wasn't working right and they fixed it quickly and with no recriminations.The beds are hard but after a few nights(and then a week in Irelnd at 7 different B&amp;B's and hotels) we realized that is how they do it in Europe. Also confusing is the plumbing, sometimes you have to &quot;pump&quot; the toilet handle. It also took a few trial runs to figure out the shower. I am a plumber/pipefitter ,so as a professional I found it all fascinating; my daughter found it frustrating.Transportation was no problem, bus stop right outside to take us to tube or we could walk 15 minutes past Holland and Kensington Gardens and many shops an restaurants.There were also at least a dozen restaurants w/in a 10 minute walk to eat at. Al-Dar, a Lebanese place was good, Blue Lagoon(Thai) wasn't great, poor service, decent food, but expensive, and Hand n Flower pub was great. Also Cornwall Pasty shop at the tube station was awesome.	
Sep 5 2007 	Not That Great	Stayed here for three nights and found the hotel to be average at best. The location is alright. It's about a ten minute walk to the Kensington High tube stop which will get you to most attractions. Bus is right outside. But the neighborhood is pretty dead at night with not much nightlife. The room itself was small and dingy. The furniture was old and needed to be replaced. There was water damage on the ceiling of my room and the carpet looked rather dirty. Was rather surprised this was still a Hilton property. Service was pretty neutral. On the Sunday night I stayed I asked if I could use the business center computer and was let in to use it. The next day I was told it was 5 pounds for 15 minutes. Went to an internet cafe instead and paid a quarter of the price. No one really went out of their way to be helpful except the deskclerk when I checked in. Can't rememeber her name. I think she was Eastern European. In all can't really reccomend the hotel unless you absolutley need to be in West Kensington or East Hammersmith.	
Aug 31 2007 	Three-Star Experience	I stayed at the London Olympia Hilton Hotel for two nights, August 26th and 27th, 2007. I had thought this was a four-star property, but truthfully, upon check-in, I realized this is a standard three-star property. Considering I got a 'decent' price for the room, and how expensive London is, I couldn't kick; however, if you are expecting a four-star experience, book elsewhere. The room was decent in that the sheets and towels were clean and crisp, and the bath was clean, which is a big deal with me; however, the furnishings were old and truly, not in keeping with what one would expect in a four-star property. Also, while I was staying on the 8th floor, there was a pungent moldy odor in the hallway, which at times was really awful. Thank goodness this odor was not present in my room. As for location, it is not exactly in the heart of Kensington; at least it didn't feel that way. It was quite a hike to the tube station on Kensington High Street, and elsewhere. All in all a very decent three-star experience, but like I said, if you are expecting four stars, I'd try another property.	
Aug 18 2007 	Even the view was a dump - literally	$99 on Priceline for what was sold as a 4 star hotel - hmmm, must write to THEM about that. This is not a four star hotel, nor is it a three or two star hotel as far as we're concerned. It's very tired and in need of some real upgrading. The 2nd floor was like a rabbit warren with many corners and another 2 sets of stairs to navigate to get to the room (room 255). I mean have a look at our view and the other pic of the lamp to give you an idea of what I am talking about. Olympia is kind of a bad place to get too as well via the tube. The Picadilly line gets you to Earls court then you can catch the District line but the day we were there it was out and we had to get a bus. Even if the Dsitrict line is running it's only offering 1 train every 25 minutes or so. You may walk up to Kensington High Street but you will have to change again to get anywhere. I haven't been to London for a while but prices have jumped like crazy. The room service breakfast was over 45$ USD per PERSON for a cooked b'fast. The internet for 1 x day was over $27USD. This isn't a Hilton thing - I believe it to be common in London, anywhere. Do yourself a favor and find a hotel on the Picadilly line and say a buig NO to this lemon.	
Aug 18 2007 	good value	PETER &amp; PATRICIA (NZ) This hotel represents good value for a 3.5 star hotel. It was clean with ex daily service. Other plusses were the sunny room aspect, good bathroom, tv.( No Sky) and bar lounge area . This area has Sky TV....3 screens, and although you get mostly football (&amp; that's not rugby) it is pleasant. Busses right outside (£3.50 all day )..tickets from newsagent over the road. Lots of shops in High Street Kensington all the way to Kensington Gardens, and Lady Di's Palace...only 15min walk. Waitrose and Tesco handy....lunches deserts etc if you don't like the hotel and restaurants prices( NZ $ does not go far here...Americans don't complain!!). A few negatives...gym is limited and like a sauna in summer, but cold water is supplied. Some decor is in need of refurbishment; room size is not large; Tube at Olympia 200m away is an end of line station in Zone 2, so a bit dearer for tickets and 15 min wait for service.....better to walk 10 min to Kensington High Street station where service/price is normal.	
Aug 11 2007 	Good hotel marginal location	We took a family vacation to the UK in July 2007 and spent four nights in London, three of which were at the Hilton London Olympia in Kensington. We were generally pleased with the hotel itself -- decent sized rooms (we had both a double and a twin), clean, Internet cafe adjacent. However, there are a few issues that fellow travelers should be aware of.Our first issue was at check-in -- they indicated that our reservation was for two twin rooms and while they were willing to change one of the twins with a double, it took forever for hotel staff to prepare the room. Since it was our first day in London, we were eager to get out and see the city. They indicated that if we went out to lunch our room would be ready. It was not. They then said that they would check with housekeeping and respond to the twin room where our sons were staying. We waited for half an hour, anxious to get cleaned up after our long flight, and still no response. When we returned from our day of sightseeing, then it was finally ready and was acceptable.The restaurants were exorbitantly expensive: 12 GBP ($24) for a continental breakfast and 17 GBP for a full English breakfast - the equivalent of nearly $100. We then tried the Internet cafe, and that was only marginally better.The worst part was the location. While the hotel is only approximately two blocks from the Olympia station, it turns out that Olympia is an outpost on the District Line, and trains are few and far between. Further, there were very few dining and no entertainment options in the neighborhood. It made for a rather desolate walk in search of food or nightlife.This would probably be a good hotel for travelers who are visiting family or friends in the Kensington area, or anyone who has business in the Olympia Exhibition Centre. That's about it.	
Jul 23 2007	Never Again!!!!!!	OMG!!!! Worst Hilton I've ever stayed in in the Uk... now that's saying something!!! Perhaps... the only plus points first. The flooding on Friday meant that my train was cancelled... therefore had to drive to london... dreading that... luckily this Hilton is pretty near to the M4... so finding the hotel with the aid of my GPS was no problem at all... and rather quick!! (2 1/2 hrs from Cardiff!!!). Also.. the lobby looks quite nice and staff were ok..... the last good thing... is complementary newspapers in the mornings.. but that's only cos I'm an HHonors member!! Anyway.. right.. .where shall I start with the bad. 1) Door handles were coming off the skanky looking toilets. 2) Tiny bathroom vs the Kensington Hilton (which isn't that big either!!!)3) Tiny room4) Locks on the bathroom doors don't work... although not a problem for me. 5) I'm short.... 5 ft 8... less than.... but yet my head almost touched the low ceiling whilst I was showering!!!!! 6) Safe wasn't working.. .OUT OF BATTERY. 7) Breakfast was ok.. usual hilton standard.. BUT...one morning... they were full.. and I was forced to sit in the bar area... which was fair enough.. didn't mind that.... When I returned from collecting my hot breakfast however... I saw that my table had been allocated to someone else!! I had to sit in the corner where the couches were... bending over to eat my breakfast! Not quite the service I expected! I think that's just about it... sorry to drag.. but I thought I needed to justify this 1 star rating... DEFINITELY not 4 star. Probably an upper market 3 star... if even that!!! Consider it carefully.. it's the cheapest hilton in London.. and it shows!!! Good luck!	
Jul 18 2007 	good vallue for money	I booked this hotel through lastminute.com - getting a very reasonable price for one night in a London hotel. We were in a room on the 8th floor, which was huge with a big comfy bed and adequate provisions of towels, coffees, hairdryer etc. Couldn't fault it for the price at all. Reception staff were friendly and efficient and answered all our queries to our satisfaction. It is a little way out of central London being that it is at the top of Kensington High St, but the Kensington Olympia tube station is less than 5 minutes walk away and tubes come roughly every 15-20 mins which is hardly a long time to wait. Further to this both Earls Court St and Kensington High Street Station are a pleasant 20-25 walk away. My boyfriend and I were going to see a gig at the o2 arena, which is in north greenwich and quite some distance away, and we had no bother or issue with the fact that it was slightly further out. In a city like London with great transport links, location is sometimes further down on the list than accomodation and price. With the right price, I would most definitely stay here again.	
Jul 18 2007 	Better Than The Negative Reviews	I read all these reviews before I went so I had all complaints in mind. My opinion was above average and that most complaints are just that, complaints by complainers.I did ask for a newly refurbished room and was put on 8th floor in a nice size modern room. We had our six year old and they put a bed in for him without us even asking. Check-in was quite smooth and accomodating.I actually found the location fantasitic. Kensington High Street is full of shops and resturants of all kinds. Most resturants are ethnic food so if you don't like that it could be difficult. The Hare and Tortoise accross the street was a great inexpensive noodle house. The closest tube is not conventient, but just a nice morning stroll down Kensington High St gets you to a better tube station that serves the city center. Take the walk and pass places to pick up a muffin, coffee, fruit to start your day. If you don't want to walk and have a travel card, jump the buses 10, 11, 27.. and they stop accross the street from tube station. Buses are constant.Some negatives were visible, since Kensington High St is busy there is some noise, but with window closed and room fan blowing it was not an issue. The room was a bit warm and I did complain, but nothing was done. I like a cold room, but my wife was perfectly happy.I will say this is not a 4-star hotel, but a solid 3-star and since I paid little via Priceline.com I am happy. Enjoy!	
Jul 17 2007 	good experience	After reading a few reviews on this site, and having already booked, I was a little nervous about my stay. It didn't help that when I arrived at the hotel, a woman approached me, telling me that she was changing hotels, because this one was no good. I was very pleasantly surpised, however when I saw my room. I had only booked a twin room, but was upgraded to a double. The room had all modern conveniences including an american standard plug, (for those of us who buy a european plug converter instead of a uk plug converter!!) The bathroom was good, nothing to complain about. The TV was just basic, with only a few channels, but suprisingly, I found quite a bit to watch! I did order room service most nights, and found it to be very quick, and satisfying. Most people on here do complain about the location, which I didn't have a problem with at all. There is a bus stop, pretty much right next to the hotel, and I found that to be very convenient to getting around town. No, this hotel is not in the middle of tourist central, but the neighborhood is very nice. I felt very safe walking back at night alone. Staying at this hotel, I felt very close to the action, but didn't feel like I had to party all night.Overall, I would say that my stay was very nice. This isn't the cheapest hotel in London, but it's not the most expensive, either. I thought that for what I paid (about 200 usd a night), the hotel was very comfortable, and my time there was very enjoyable. I WOULD STAY THERE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	
Jul 10 2007	Wouldn't go back	The Hilton Olympia is really nothing special. I was for business in the Olympia Hall (2 min. walk) so for me the location was good. If you want to see something of the city don't stay here... It is a real hassle to get into town.The room they put me in was small and smelly. There was one very small window with a view of a brick wall. The service was good and I also like the bar (PLUM), though some of the employees hardly speak any English.Better stay somewhere else!	
Jul 6 2007 	Comfortable	Needed a hotel at the last minute in London. This was one of the few available at a decent rate. The room was small but comfortable. Bed linens and comforter above average. Nicely lit bathroom with many amenities. My only issue is with the Tube station, not the hotel. Although it is a block away from Olympia station on the District line, the train comes at most three times an hour.	
Jul 3 2007 	Very Good to Hhonors Members	I had a very positive experience when I stayed for 2 nights here. I had only booked a single room but was upgraded to a junior suite as a result of my hiltonhhonors membership. A superb room with dining table and living area directy above the main entrance with fresh fruit delivered both days. Complimentary breakfast was also offered.The staff at reception were among the most welcoming and genuinely friendly I've encountered.It's definitely not the best Hilton in London but it is priced accordingly and I certainly felt I got great value for money.	
Jul 2 2007 	Comfortable short stay	I have recently returned from a two night stay at this hotel. After reading some of the other reviews I was a little apprehensive. We were allocated a room on floor eight and on entering the room discovered that the window handle was broken and the window would not close. I telephoned reception to report this and went for dinner. On returning to the room I was pleased to find that the handle had been fixed.The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The room was very clean and adequate. The bathroom was in need of repairs to the ceiling tiles which needed replaced. The shower was about my head height and may have been unsuitable for anyone over six foot as reported in other reviews. My husband is 6'2 but as he used the bath this was not an issue.I thought the hotel was a little far out but excellent for anyone wishing to go to Olympia. The nearest tube station was about 5 min walk and another one was about 10 min walk away. There was a bus stop close to the hotel for easy transportation into central London.The food was very good both at breakfast and dinner. Complimentary water and a newspaper were provided.	
Jul 2 2007 	DON'T BELIEVE THE NEGATIVES	Once again, the Hilton Olympia was a nice place to stay. We spent a couple of days there in June of 2006 and a week there in June of 2007. Liked it both times, Not at all bad for the money spent.The front desk and concierge desk were very helpful and friendly. We hit the hotel at 9:00 am and stored our luggage with them and cruised the neighborhood. They had our rooms ready by 2:30.There were little things wrong, an example, no hair dryer in one of our rooms, but this was corrected immediately when mentioned to the front desk. The one shower hand piece leaked a little bit, but I was already wet when I used it, so no problem. Our rooms were large and clean. I saw nothing like the pictures posted previously. A bus stop is just across the street to the left and will take you to the Kensington High Street tube station is less than 10 minutes. The Olympia tube station is right around the corner but has restricted schedule and inconvenient train changes so we avoid it as much as we can.Buy a bus &amp; tube pass for a few bucks and transportation to all of the sights is easy and relatively quick. Most of the good stuff is in zones 1&amp;2 which are the cheapest passes.Taxis are faster but much more expensive. You haven't been to London if you have not used the tube to go sightseeing.Down the street to the right of the front door are several restaurants we ate at and enjoyed. An authentic pub experience is at &quot;THE ALBION&quot; about ten minutes to the right of the front door, locals eat here for the good food. Frank's sandwich shop is about three minutes away to the right and serves good breakfasts and sandwiches along with some fine conversation. PIzza Express is also about three minutes away to the right and serves excellent pizza, a good place for a family to eat.Frank's is cheap, Albion very reasonable and Pizza Express typical for London as to prices.When we go back, we will stay with this hotel again without reservation.	
Jun 22 2007 	Nothing to complain about	My husband and I have just returened from a 3 night stay here and found nothing to complain about. We have paid more money for much worse.Staff were all pleasant and helpful, rooms were comfortable (If in need of updating), clean and adequate facilites.Breakfast very good and due to the different nationalities staying, there seemed to be a good choice for everyone. Only downside was on the last morning there was no bacon which was a shame as it was good.Location is fine, local transport close by and taxis readily available. If you stay there don't miss having a stroll in Holland Park, it is beautiful and the Kyoto garden is wonderful.We found our stay very pleasant and will return.	
Jun 17 2007 	A hospitable welcome!	We arrived in London on May 18th and spent 3 nights at the Hilton Olympia. Upon arrival we had an extremely efficient and helpful gentleman check us in. This was our first stop on our first visit to Europe and we couldn't have hoped for a better welcome. Our room was spacious and had everything we needed. Given it was a Hilton it had many things that we expect in a decent North American hotel (coffee pot, hair dryer, safe, complementary toiletries, etc.). We had absolutely no complaints about this hotel.As for location we quickly learned that upon exiting the hotel walk down the street to your left rather than your right. To the right we found just a few small restaurants, a subway (tube) station that made the tube much more difficult to manuever than necessary, and not much else for many blocks. When we walked the other direction (left exiting the hotel) down Kensington High Street we found a number of decent restaurants, and the Olympia tube station (about a 20 minute walk) that was the easiest way to get around. Once at the tube station it was only minutes to any of the central destinations we wanted to go to. We booked the hotel through Priceline so we had an excellent rate for our stay. We would gladly stay there again.	
Jun 13 2007 	Don't waste your money	This is an old hotel that is not in my opinion fit to carry the Hilton name and reputation. Where should I begin?The door to my room creaked like you would expect in a haunted house. Normally this wouldn't mean much, but at an expensive Hilton, this should not be happening.The bed mattress was as hard as a concrete slab. Add to the the small, uncomfortable European style pillows, and you have a recipe for a very uncomfortable night. All Hilton properties should be required to have the Hilton 'Suite Dreams' style bedding and mattress covers. This bed was unacceptable.My shower was very leaky. It was one of those showerheads that double as a body washers (handheld). Also, the hot water did not stay one temperature...it varied throughout the shower.Breakfast was good, as all European Hiltons seem to be. Luckily, mine was comped as a Gold member. Otherwise...it would have cost 17.95 pounds. That equates in USD to about $35.00 (per person), for breakfast! A family of four...you get the picture.The hotel bar was fairly nice, but they did not have any hand pulled ales on tap. It was all Stella or Heinekin, and Boddingtons.I would not stay here again, and I think that Hilton needs to pay them a visit and review whether or not they are meeting their franchise obligations. This hotel would give Hilton a bad name if someone didn't know any better. The Hilton LHR is an example of a UK Hilton done right! Also, the Hilton London Kensington nearby is a much nicer property.	
Jun 12 2007 	Good except for location	The hotel was actually quite nice. The lobby and common areas were well lit and clean. The staff was friendly despite my very late check-in. I didn't eat at the restaurant, so I can't comment on that. The room was also good. Most importantly, it was clean. The linens were fresh. The bed reasonably comfortable. There was a kettle, iron and ironing board in the room. The TV worked and the temperature control was fine. The room size was - relative to other London hotels I've stayed at - big enough. The only downfall was the location - the website claims to be three minutes from a tube stop. I looked into it and learned that it is a District Line station which would have been great for me considering where I had to travel to for business. Unfortunately, I didn't check the schedule or I would have learned that there are VERY few trains stopping here, and once you get one you need to transfer to another train at the next stop. That made travel quite difficult. Depending on where you're going and how you intend to get there, this could be a very good and reasonably priced hotel for you - but check the tube schedule.	
Jun 12 2007 	Good Hotel	The Hilton in Olympia is a grand hotel with the expected standards of good customer service and cleanliness, The hotel is located close to a tube station allowing great access to all the west end has to offer for an overnight stay. Late night taxis cost around £15.00 back from picadilly circus to the hotel.One thing to be carefull of if you are a cheapskate like me (taking out the overpriced bottles of tonic waters and spirits from the mini bar and filling it up with my own bottles of drink) be warned that there are sensors under these bottles and charge directly to your room even when said bottles are placed back unused Thankfully this was resolved at reception on checking out.A very warm hotel and little chance to open the windows wide on the top floors (understandably) but air conditioning is not up to much.Overall a good visit and would recommend	
Jun 12 2007 	For the price we paid it was a great deal but we must've been lucky	Face it, London is extremely expensive for those of us with the US dollar these days. So we did what alot of people seem to be doing and bid for a hotel on Priceline and got this one for around $80. For that price in London you're lucky to get a cardboard box, so with that in mind, we were extremely happy with the hotel. Since we really didn't spend a whole lot of time there, the room was fine actually as we didn't get the filthy gross ones I am reading about. And the staff were actually extremely nice, far better than at many hotels, and nice hotels, I've stayed at. The biggest downside to me was the location, as it is pretty far out and in practical terms you have to use the High Street Kensington tube stop, since the Olympia just doesn't operate that frequently. We got the hang of that and used the buses too, though as we are pretty good with that sort of thing and keen for the adventure, so all in all I would do it again in a second for the price. There is also a nice grocery store nearby and a good Asian restaurant, Tortoise and Hare across the street.	
Jun 9 2007 	Dreadful terrible horrible awful	After this experience, doubt I will ever use Priceline again - the 4-star Priceline rating borders on FRAUD. This is the WORST Hilton I have ever seen, I cannot imagine how even a 2-star could be worse than this dump.The location is not near to anything, except an underground stop that is poorly served.At checkin, the receptionist seemed embarrassed to be working there and sheepishly told me to contact her if there were any problems with the room.The room was TINY - hardly enough room to pass by the bed. Everything in the room looked old and tired. But, it wasn't until I tried getting into bed that I became truly outraged: the mattress on the bed was completely worn out and metal was sticking up to the point of making it extremely uncomfortable. Both mattresses (had a twin room) were the same - belonged in the trash. That's when I went down to complain --- the girl who checked me in was there, but stayed in the background as another tried to tell me that all the rooms were like that. It seemed incredible to me --- and then, she said they'd switch me to another &quot;updated&quot; room. A while later, the bellboy came with my new keys - but, I asked to see the room first: it was a bigger room, it certainly wasn't any more updated/modern than the original, and the mattresses were no better. I told him this was not satisfactory. He told me they'd try another room. After a while, he was back with the keys to yet another room, and yet 2 more totally worn out mattresses. At this point, I was totally disgusted and suggested that since they apparently didn't have a decent bed in the house, I'd make do if they would give me an extra duvet - there was enough padding in it to somewhat mask the worn mattress. I was told they would be sent up.Nothing was sent up - after an hour, I went down again and asked for the duty manager. Was shown yet another room with a somewhat better mattress (still not really good), which was a smoking room. He offered to move these mattresses into my room, and I suggested that the missing duvet might be easier as my partner was sleeping. After another hour and being delivered TOWELS, asking for duvet, then getting two BLANKETS, I went to manager again. It became painfully obvious that HOUSEKEEPING STAFF DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH and they have a serious communication problem among management/staff. Finally, I did get the duvet, and could not wait to leave this truly horrible hotel. Everything here is overpriced - from Interenet at $30+USD for noon-to-noon (if you need it for 2 hours from 11 to 1, it'll be $60USD, thank you). Make a phone call to the USA - that will be $8 a minute. Mini-bar that charges you if you touch anything. Amenities lacking: no body lotion/moisturizer (housekeeping supervisor tells me that it's &quot;on request&quot;). There is no in-room safe, and the safety deposit boxes in reception look older than most everything else in this worn-put dump: the locks are broken - there is no double-locking, and they don't look very safe.	
Jun 7 2007 	wretched!!!	What can i say?! it's a filthy dump. i rented 3 rooms- all sub-par. one room had no a/c- they didn't say a word about it- and they were no where near fully booked! that room also had a bathroom doorknob just barely hanging, no chain lock . the next room had &quot;mollys&quot; hanging out of the wall where a picture had been yanked off the wall, assorted other furniture handles barely hanging on,the a/c fan clanked unless on high, a moldy bathroom, and a phenomenal loud buzz that went off every 45 minutes throughout the night. all 3 rooms came equipped with filthy carpet- even kinda &quot;sticky&quot;.never again. beware the 7th floor.	
Jun 6 2007 	Depends what you're looking for!	If you're looking for luxury this isn't it however for the price and location it's not bad. The Kensignton/Olympia tube stop was right around the corner however we found it more convenient to ride the bus since the stop was right in front of the hotel. Within a 2 block radius were pubs, restaurants, food stores and pastry shops so that was very convenient. The rooms were average, a little dated which isn't typical for a Hilton and the staff was ok. All in all I would only recommend this hotel if you are on a budget.	
Jun 5 2007 	Dear milkman Extra pint please	Unless youre doing something in Olympia, its hard to recommend this rather below standard Hilton. Proximity to Olympia means this hotel fills itself without a struggle. Had to squeeze in a single room, and I do mean squeeze. Avoid the singles if you possibly can, they are tiny. A badly run hotel in my opinion. Lame check-in, the usual London issues of poor English and poor training. Trainee girl, nice girl totally confused by idea of my mandating 2 colleagues room bills as well as my own. Dragged me downstairs unnecessarily to explain it patiently . Back up we go, no offer to take luggage. Tiny lifts, all squeezed in. Got upstairs and colleague finds she has not been given her room key! Trainee forgot to put it into the holder. To save another wasted trip, I went to my room and rang down to reception. But the phone was dead, out of order. You begin to get the picture.Well we took some bar snacks in the bar. Very pricey but not bad. The barman explained that they were running out of certain options. OK what does that mean? Basically sir, we have run out of cheese.Next morning at breakfast, my colleague sat with a bowl of dry cornflakes while a waitress went to fill the milk jug. Ten minutes later, still nothing. Very sorry, we have run out of milk.Attempting to escape, I went into the neighbouring café, which is linked to the Hilton lobby. Sandwich, £4.25 (take out), £7.50 (eat in). Welcome to London.Incidentally the earlier reviewer is correct - factor any concierge advice x3! For instance, 10-15minutes walk = 45-50.	
May 23 2007 	Not horrible but.....	We stayed 5 nights at the Hilton Olympia, having &quot;won&quot; the booking on Priceline for a little over $90 a night. My recommendation is not to include a Kensington location in a Priceline bid since the Olympia seems to be coming up a lot lately. Try another area, and hopefully you won't be stuck with this hotel which is a far cry from the 4 star rating assigned to it by Priceline.The service personnel were pleasant and the beds were comfortable, but the room was old and tired, not someplace where one would want to linger beyond showering and sleeping. The shower was not as low and they evidently are in other rooms, but the bathroom itself was in dire need of an upgrade. There were no hooks on which to hang anything, and I was reluctant to step on the floor in my bare feet.The location at the end of zone 2 required a long walk to the Earl's Court tube station. This could be addressed by taking a bus from the stop near the front of the hotel--Kensington High Street to Earl's Court Road--and then transferring to another bus on Earl's Court Road to the tube station. Earl's Court Road is a one-way street, though, so returning to the hotel by that route by bus isn't possible. To return, take the tube to the South Kensington tube stop, and get on a bus from there to the hotel.	
May 20 2007	Reasonable Option	In terms of location, for anyone with a bit of traveling experience, the Hilton Olympia is just fine. As previous reviewers have indicated, there are several (and frequent) bus options and one Underground line with limited service. I found a short bus trip to the nearest Underground station (4 minutes) to be very easy and convenient. The fact that the bus station is right across the street is fabulous. Additionally, a short bus trip takes you to that part of Kensington High Street where there are numerous restaurants, pubs, and other things you may be looking to find.The hotel itself is okay. but nothing special. But, for $80a night on Priceline, I wasn't expecting the Savoy. The room was neat and clean, albeit small (what else does one expect in Europe?). Personnel were nice enough and accomodating. However, I found the conceigne desk to be a poor resource. One day they sent us on a &quot;10 minute walk&quot; for dinner, only to find the place wasn't even open. Seems everything was a 5-10 minute walk and easy to find...which was simply not true. Also, the hotel lounge is very pricely, so head to the Hand and Flower or other neighborhood pub.One last thing. A special plug for Frank's. It's a great little more-of-a-diner type place close to the hotel. Great and inexpensive breakfasts. Frank is also a very interesting guy if you engage him in a conversation. He seemed quite pleased and taken back when I mentioned that his place had been mentioned on the internet.	
May 18 2007 	Not worthy the Hilton Brand name	Simply a sub par hilton. Corridors and rooms are old and in a desperate need of refurbishement, or at least a new coat of paint on the peeling walls. The unbelievably low shower ceiling makes it necessary for any traveller over 1.80Metres high to either sit or duck. Non-existant lobby and dis-interested staff complete the sad picture. It is a shame to the Hilton name.	
May 6 2007 	Fab breakfast!!	I recently stayed here for an overnight stay on business.We had room 512 on the fifth floor and although we struggled to find it in the maze of halls it was worth the wait, decent size, fab large pictures windows with a nice view of the park (we'll forget the train tracks it also overlooks!), large bathroom with a very powerful shower - beware!, tv, trouser press &amp; tea/coffee making facilities. Beds are a decent size with extremely comfy pillows.Breakfast the next morning was fab, unbelievable choice which caters for all nationalities and tastes.The only downfall I could mention is the noise, we had to have the windows open due to the heat in the room and the trains ,which seem to travel all hours of the day and night, make such an unbelievable racket!Overall, for a first timer in London it was fine, easy to access the underground and local bus systems, and comfortable enough for a short stay.PS One recommendation for a show to see - Mary Poppins - fantastic night out!	
May 6 2007 	Avoid if you can	The rooms at Hilton Olympia were too small, not clean and old. The bathrooms had a stink. The cooling did not work at all, the room was too hot. Of the 3 elevators they had, only 1 seemed to work fine, and there was always a long wait to get in it. The hotel is in a rather poor condition and needs renovation badly. The hotel staff is helpfull and polite.	
May 4 2007	Good value in Hilton Olympia	We checked at Hilton Olympia ($ 99 +tax per night at Priceline) around 10.45 pm on 27th April for four nights. Front desk trainee serving us was very nice and helpful and check in was fast. Room on 7th floor was ok, clean and comfortable size. There has been complains about showering in the elevated tubs, but we did fit well and we are tall; I am 58 and husband is 62...Bed was quite hard, but still comfortable. There were the normal hair dryer, coffee maker and iron in room.Didn't use restaurants or any sevices, so cannot comment them.Busses no 9 and 10 have a stop in front of the hotel, 9 goes to Piccadilly and 10 to Oxford street. It seemed to be easier to take bus there than tube, Kensington Olympia Tube service isn't very frequent and you need to chage the line in (or to walk to) Earl's Court or Kensington Highstreet station. Nice walking distance to Notting Hill and Portobello road market.The only complaint is that even thought with our prepaid stay our balance should have been zero when we checked out, there were some mystery breakfasts and minibar charges. The front desk clerk said she cleared all, but I have to wait for my next credit card bill to be sure...Se wasn't rude at all, but I was in impression she didn't believe me in 100% when I told we hadn't used any services. There have been extra charges in other hotels previosly, so I never use express check out, but want to check the charges first.	
May 2 2007 	Mised Experiences	I feel a bit embaressed about this hotel. Every time I stayed in thishotel there were a lot of people visting from abroad - and they had to stay in this dump. Check in always took ages. The vast majority ofrooms are dated. Couldn't believe that they had some showers where you had to bend down to get into them. Most rooms were noisy with the road outside.The best thing about this hotel was the free the beer vouchers. If you are a Hilton Honors member and they cannot upgrade you they give you a pile of free beer vouvhers!	
Apr 24 2007 	Nice place to Stay while in London	This hotel was a nice home base while visiting London. The room was spacious for a European hotel. The bathroom was large, clean and had wonderfully smelling shower gel and shampoo. The overall condition of the hotel was great, very clean and modern. The smell in the lobby was a bit overpowering, but you move on. We did not use the gym, conference rooms or hotel restaurant. So no comment on those.Our room was on the 6th floor, and was very clean and nice. We had a kettle in our room to make tea or coffee. And yummy short bread cookies as a snack. We had to request a double bed, but they managed to get us one. (They wanted to give my boyfriend and myself 2 twin beads. I don't think so.) Transportation into central London was easy. Busses 9 and 10 go right in front of the hotel, and those head right into central London. We usually walked to the Earl's Court tube station (go south on Warrick Road) and get the tube there. It was better because it was on the Circle, District and Piccadilly lines. Plus, on the way to the tube, you walk right by a huge Tesco's (a grocery store). It's a great place to pick up some bread for a snack, a pre-made sandwich or a bottle of wine to have back in your room. I found this route to Earl's court better than walking down the High Street.We got our room on Priceline at a reasonable $75 per night before taxes. I would recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay.Some places to eat nearby: Pizza Express - Come out of the hotel and turn right to head west toward the convention center. The restuarant is in the first floor of the convention center. It's just over the bridge that goes over the train tracks.Franks - Good little shop for a cheap sandwich or a nice traditional English breakfast. Not a great place for ambience, but it has a real local flavor. Come out of the hotel and turn right to head west toward the convention center. Cross the high street. Frank's is just across the street on the other side of the bridge that goes over the railroad tracks. Not gormet, just a greesy spoon, but lovely. Make sure you eat English bacon. Yum!Hand and Flower - This pub was rather lame, so I would give it a miss.There is a white pub kind of across the street, heading toward Earl's Court Tube on Warrick Road. If you get to the home improvement shop (on the right), you've gone to far. It has &quot;Arms&quot; in the tile. It was great little local pub. Very old school. I would recommend a pint in there if you want a more authentic British pub over the Hand and the flower.	
Apr 24 2007 	Good short stay hotel just outside London affordable	Well valued hotel, not out of date, but not modern. OK location in Kennsington, near Olympia Tube/Train station. My second story room is large for a London hotel, not recently updated, but was not out of date either. Good hotel for short stay tourist trip where you will not spend too much time at hotel, other than to sleep.	
Apr 15 2007 	Great stay for the price	My son and I just finished a 4 night stay at this hotel (10 - 13 April), which I booked on Priceline for $79/night. After reading the reviews, I was a bit worried, but it turned out to be a great value. I gave it 4 stars because of the value compared to the very low price I paid; otherwise I would give it 2/3 stars.Based on some of the suggestions posted here, I requested a newly refurbished room, and got #418, which overlooks the street on the south side of the hotel. Pleasant view of a tiny pocket park, with not-so-pleasant view of train tracks beyond. The trains (Underground - District line; inter-city and suburban trains; smaller freight trains) run all the time. If you are there during the week, as we were, the Kensington Olympia station is a quick 2 block walk and the trains run frequently to Earl's Court (it's a one-stop spur of the District line). The High Street Kensington station is a good 10-minute walk in the other direction, but is served by the District and Circle lines. There are buses that stop just outside the hotel (#10 and #9) that will take you down the street toward the Tube stop, but it's worth walking there to see what's available - restaurants, internet cafe (L.2 for 2 hours), shops of all kinds, including drug stores, grocers and a Marks &amp; Spencer.The room itself had 2 twin beds which were very comfortable with nice pillows and linens. The size was comfortable - not huge but not cramped by any means. The bathroom was quite large, though the elevated tub made for tight showers - and I'm only 5'2&quot;! Great water pressure, and nice Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. There was some noise from other rooms, but it was nothing compared to the trains, so it didn't bother us. Some days the towels were thick and luxurious, some days threadbare. Our toiletries were not replenished during the stay.The heat in the hotel was extreme - and I tend to be cold all the time. We had to keep the window open to make it bearable. Our candies from Harrods melted at the room temperature. Another odd thing - the lobby was heavily perfumed. Kind of made us scoot through as fast as possible. As noted elsewhere, the halls are a bit dated, but who spends time in the halls? Staff was very friendly and delivered several messages directly to our room, including a fax. Never ate in the restaurant, didn't touch the minibar. Tip: If at all possible, go to The Windsor Castle, at 114 Campden Hill Road (walk towards the High Street Kensington station, left at Campden Hill Rd., and up the hill 10 minutes). It's a fabulous pub, good food, but terrific atmosphere - warrens of little rooms, proper ales, and a delightful large garden out back. A famous London pub off the beaten track. It's worth the hill climb!Overall - for $79 a night, it was a steal and a pleasant stay. For $150 I would be disappointed.	
Apr 12 2007 	Horrendously Ugly Courtyard	I have stayed at this hotel three times. Some rooms are adequate although the common areas of the hotel are showing their age. But this hotel also harbors a number of very bad rooms too. If you got a too good to be true price, that's why.I am posting two photos with this review. The first shows the courtyard of the hotel which half the rooms are facing - it is a depressing and noisy view to wake up to every morning. The second photo shows the horrible condition of the bathroom - worn and missing paint, scratched door, etc.The room reeked of smoke, the sheer curtains were yellowed and unclean, the furniture worn and scratched. The sink and tub took forever to drain.	
Apr 11 2007 	Loved it...	Wonderful.... Loved our stayThe Hotel Staff was wonderful... our room was really small but we were impressed with the location &amp; the bed was amazingly comfortable!	
Apr 9 2007 	Disappointing bathroom but friendly staff and great breakfast	Stayed here for a couple of nights at beginning of April. Room a bit on the small side and got a double rather than a king bed but my concern was the bathroom which was very small and in need of modernisation. The shower was in the bath which is fine, but the bathroom ceiling was too low for me to be able to stand (I'm 6 feet tall - no giant) so I had to stoop over to shower - really uncomfortable and not what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel. I was dulymoved to another room with a higher ceiling for the shower but the bathroom was more dated and cramped than the first one. Friendly and professional staff though, both in reception and the restaurant, and one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had in a while. A word about location - this hotel is only really convenient for the Olympia - even though it's on Kensington High Street, it's a good 10 minute walk from the shops and bars.	
Mar 28 2007 	Little out of the way but rooms are large for Europe	I booked this trip through Priceline about 6 months in advance for $90/night ($108.21 with tax). This is a great rate for a hotel in London, where rooms usually go for $170+.Now right off, this hotel is not in the center of London. It is a brisk 10 minute walk to any stores up Kensington High Street. The closest train station is Kensington Olympia 2 blocks away. Trains were pretty regular during weekdays (didn't wait more than 5 minutes) but I wouldn't try it at night or on weekends. As others have said, the 27 bus also goes straight there from Paddington Station (Heathrow Express). Also, if you don't have lots of bags, walk from Kensington High Street (Circle and District Tube lines). It's a 10 minute walk South on Kensington High Street.If you're looking for a hotel which is in the center of everything, this is not it. But you'll also be paying for that convenience. It's worth your while to book this hotel and take a cab to and from the center. The money you save from the hotel will more than pay for that.The rooms are larger than the typical European hotel. Ours faced the back with a view of other buildings and a small children's playground and backyard. Walls were thick and I didn't hear much from the neighbors. The staff were friendly though I didn't need to ask them for much.As others have noted, don't use the phone if you can help it. The cost is 2.5 pounds for any call. Instead, go to the pharmacy next door, buy a 5 pound calling card, and use the hotel's 2 lobby pay phones. Also, don't touch the mini-bar as it is on a spring weighted system and if you touch anything, you bought it. There is a Waitrose supermarket 4 blocks up the street (North) if you want to buy food or drinks.All in all, we had a very pleasant stay here with no surprises. Clean room, nothing fancy. At the rate I paid, I have no complaints whatsoever.P.S. Best way for cheapskates to get from Heathrow to this hotel. At airport, get an Oyster card (their version of a bus/train card). Take Piccadilly line from Heathrow terminal to Earl's Court Station. Go upstairs. Take District line (Kensington Olympia direction) one stop to Kensington Olympia. Get out of station, make left, make another left, walk 1 block. Cost is 3.4 pounds. Takes about 45 minutes.On an unrelated note, the Brits have got to be one of the most friendly people on the planet. Very polite and well-dressed.	
Mar 12 2007	Great Location	Seeing some of the negative reviews I was a bit worried but booking through Hotwire it was too bad, that was where we were! However, my two children and I arrived at about 9am to be greeted by the friendliest lady on the desk.. We had a twin room with a chair bed and perhaps because it was not refurbished she gave us coupons for the continental breakfast the following morning. Breakfast was fine but I don't think we'd have paid the 13 pounds or whatever ourselves. I had requested two more towels and when we returned to the room later that day, there were the towels, two more sets of toiletries, a half bottle of red wine, two bottles of water and chocolates! The room and bathroom were on the small side and had seen better days but we were only there for the night and the goodies and thoughfulness made up for that. The room was very clean, the shower not on the short side in this room and water pressure fantastic (can be a problem in the UK).The bus stop outside served us well, the #10 bus went right to Oxford St and beyond and the # 27 (I think) went straight to Paddington Station so we could catch the train. It was a bit of a walk from Earls Ct tube initially (approx 15 mins) but all on the flat, passing places to eat, drink etc if needed. I would not hesitate to stay here again for the convenience as much as anything.	
Mar 5 2007	Better than expected	Stayed the weekend of March 3-5, 2007. Booked on Hotwire for $99/night, for a total of $304.15 for the weekend (breakfast not included). This was a pretty incredible price. After reading the reviews on this website, I was quite anxious about our stay there. However, upon arrival, I requested a newly refurbished room and was perfectly happy. The halls and exterior have seen some use, but the interior of our room was great. The bed was very comfortable, the room was HUGE for London standards (about average for U.S. standards), the bathroom was clean and nice and the hotel staff was perfectly pleasant. We didn't eat at the restaurant (we never do in hotels as a matter of policy -- they always rip you off!), so I don't know about that aspect of the hotel. Two things to be aware of: the shower really is very short -- I'm 5'10&quot; and just barely could stand up in it; if you're taller, you'll have to adjust somewhat. Also, the concierge was a bit clueless when I asked him for a local phone number. The last thing is that the London Olympia tube stop on the District (green) line is only served half-hourly in the off-peak times, so it's pretty much useless if you're there on a weekend. We always just walked to Earls Court. If you have luggage and are taking the tube, however, I suggest you wait for the District train as the walk to Earls Court is about a mile.	
Mar 5 2007	I Really Dont Understand the Negativity	Stayed at this hotel from Feb 28th  March 3rd 2007. The staff were very helpful and friendly, I booked a twin room rather than a double and after enquiring at reception, they changed our rooms and moved our luggage for us while we were exploring London.Despite what has been said in previous reviews regarding the location, it took less than 10 minutes to get into Central London using a bus/tube combination or 15 minutes walking then getting the tube.The hotel itself was rather expensive, but most four star hotels worldwide are far from cheap. There are many other restaurants to pick from on Kensington High Street and several pubs and bars less than a 5 minute walk away.On the whole, I would recommend this hotel and happily stay there again on my next visit to London.	
Feb 27 2007 	Enjoyed our stay here	As in the previous post we booked direct through the hilton website on a weekend special for £189 incl dinner on the 1st night and breakfast both mornings. Thought this was extremely good value for a stay in the capital city of one of the most expensive countries in the world - but after seeing some of the reviews on this site was more a bit concerned. However we were not disappointed - the room was more than ok, we had a complimentary bottle of wine &amp; chocs which was unexpected as we were only staying in a standard room. The room was spacious for London with a desk, coffee table and two chairs as well as a king size bed which was so comfortable. I dare say if I had inspected every nook &amp; cranny I could have found some faults but hey I was there to enjoy myself not be a hotel critic and certainly nothing was obvious! Yes the bar was expensive but that is true of hotel bars all around the world. There was a pub not 100 yards away (the hand &amp; flower) so getting a reasonably priced drink was not a problem. Also there was a Tesco &amp; Waitrose within a 10 minute walk if needed. We didnt find the location a problem at all. The nearest station is Olympia - a two minute walk - with trains every 15 mins to earls court where you then change for everywhere else. We never had to wait more than 10 mins for a train and they run till almost midnight so we had no problems there -otherwise the next undergound was a good 10 min walk away. Dinner on the first night was a carvery, breakfast was a buffet with everything from fruit, cereals, cheeses, hams and full english - restaurant and bar area were nice and comfortable. Cant say I had anything to complain about and would definitely go back	
Feb 19 2007 	Good but not great	A large group of us stayed at the Hilton Olympia for the Brits this year. When we arrived check in was very busy but the staff coped with everyone very quicky.The hotel looks a bit tired - with worn carpet and a bit of an out dated look. The rooms itself was OK - i have a view of the stair well so i wasn't over looked but the view wasn't anything to write home about. Amenities in the room itself was what you would expect from a hilton, apart from the v.small bathroom and poor water pressure (which could have been because we were on the top floor).The bar area was large and service efficient.The hotel is a good 10 minute walk from Kensington high street station but if you don't want to stay in central london and want a reasonable hotel this will do just fine.	
Feb 16 2007 	Very Disappointed	I have stayed at this hotel several times due to its proximity to the Earl`s Court Convention Center but I will be looking for new digs. Hilton Hotels in the UK are generally quite rundown but this hotel needs a serious upgrading. Carpets are dirty and the paint is scraped away from the mouldings in the corridors. I reported to the front desk that my bathtub and shower would not drain and was assured each day that a plumber would visit. By the third morning I called for a manager to come look at my bathtub filling up with the dirty water and clumps of black hair from a neighboring room. I was finally moved to another room. Pretty shoddy treatment for a guest who stays 120+ nights per year in Hilton Hotels alone. Two other colleagues had the same drainage problems and said it reminded them of their stays in youth hostels! Beware of the noise level in rooms facing the train tracks and avoid the restaurant for dinner. I would also hesitate booking any meetings here as the sleeping rooms are embarrassing.	
Feb 11 2007	Okay - stuffy air low shower ceiling friendly check-in.	Room: Stayed here for two nights early February 2007 with my wife. Room and bed size were adequate, especially compared with other London hotel rooms. The air in the room was not clean. It was too hot and stuffy. Only opening the window helped (although the airco noise made this un unattractive option at night). The ceiling in the bathroom was too low. At 6'8&quot; (203 cm), it's impossible to stand up straight in the bathtub for a shower. When you're under 5'8&quot; this is no problem. Location: is OK (not super). High Street Kensington underground station is a good 10 minutes walk, buses (number 9 to Piccadilly for example) are at crawling distance to the hotel. Kensington Olympia is close by, but service there is infrequent. This is also a train station which does have a nice train connection to Gatwick airport though (transfer at Clapham Junction train station in the weekend) for GBP 9 p.p.Hotel reception: friendly, but the severely (badly) perfumed air will hit you when you enter.All in all: if you get a good (price) deal on this hotel - no need to worry as the above doesn't spoil a good weekend in London (in my opinion). For longer stays, I'd look elsewhere.	
Jan 19 2007 	Great staff OK rooms far from the Tube	Stayed here while attending a conference in the hotel. Reviews made me dread staying there, but actually helped me enjoy it more than I might have, since it was not only not bad, but pretty nice in some regards. I agree with some reviews that the rooms don't seem 4 * level, although they were comfortable and not small like so many other London hotels. The comforter/sheet/pillows on the bed were very nice, but the mattress was a bit hard (not just firm) and it was not level, with one side of the bed oddly higher than the other (not sloping but with one side at a different level than the other??). Once I settled into the lower side, that was OK, but was glad I had to whole bed to myself. Staff was VERY helpful and friendly in every way, even with some special requests. Breakfast was quite good, and included (I paid about $260/night conference rate, so it should be) If you stand in the tub to shower, you have only 6 ft, and since I'm slightly under that, it was no problem, but if you're over 6 ft, you'll need to crouch a bit to shower! The room was quite warm, but after I figured out how to open the windows (they swivel) the room cooled to a comfortable level quickly. The biggest negative for me was the distance to Tube stations. It's a &quot;10 minute&quot; walk to several stations, but only if you walk at a very brisk pace---it must be at least a mile to the nearest station---do-able but certainly not convenient. If you're older and/or not in great shape, and it's a windy, rainy, chilly January evening, the walks to and from the Tube stations are no fun.	
Jan 15 2007	Great Stay - Don't Ignore This Hotel	We stayed at this hotel on two different occasions within a week. I was very nervous after reading some of the reviews on this site. I honestly believe some floors must be remodeled and updated while others perhaps are not. We stayed on the 5th and 3rd floors and had fantastic stays! Honestly, I couldn't find anything to complain about. Nice fluffy comforters, coffee and tea in the rooms, clean bathrooms. Front desk was very helpful. We went to the bar several times asking for ice and was always assisted without issue. This hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Hammersmith and South Kensington Tube stops but there are several shops and good restaurants along the way. On our next trip to London I would definately stay here again. Don't let the negative reviews scare you off.	
Jan 10 2007 	Excellent value although a tad on the warm side!	We booked this hotel through a Londonwebsite and got a good deal, 2 nights including breakfast plus dinner on the first night for £189.00. Excellent value compared to most other 4* hotels in the area where breakfast is always extra.I checked the &quot;Tripadvisor&quot; website before we left for London and was rather worried that we had made a terrible mistake as not many of the reviews were good.On arrival at the hotel we were welcomed by a very friendly and helpful receptionist and when we got to our room on the 6th floor we were pleasantly surprised as it was spacious, immaculately clean with a contempory decor. The bathroom was a good size although the shower above the bath was clearly designed for a small person! A very nice complimentary bottle of red wine and glasses were also on offer.The inclusive first night dinner was very good, the restaurant was modern and nicely lit for the evening with a vast choice of food laid out buffet style for you to help yourself to. Breakfast was also served in the same restaurant and again the choice and quality of the food was superb.Our only criticism was the room temperature which was stuck at suffocation level for the duration of our stay. This made sleeping very difficult as it was hard to breath!! We opened the window but it made little difference and also proved very noisy. When we spoke to reception about the room temperature they said it was because they have to set the thermostat for the winter and they were expecting cold weather and it had turned out to be mild for the time of year! This is all very well but i would expect a 4* hotel to be able to regulate the temperature of its rooms accordingly.All up i would reccomend this hotel, the location is good and if you can get a deal it is well worth the trip.	
Jan 6 2007 	Worn Down Hilton Lacklustre In All Regards	This hotel secured my belief that the Hiltons run by Hilton UK are not up to the same standards as those elsewhere in the world. This was not worthy of being a 4-star hotel as one would expect all Hiltons to be. The Hilton London Olympia was generally shabby and unimpressive all around. In the halls the paint was peeling, there was exposed wiring, grubbiness on the walls and the decor was dated. The rooms were reasonably sized for London and kept clean, but as it is an older property, the walls and doors were uncomfortably thin. We could hear the muffled voices and television of the people in the room next door and could clearly hear the conversations of anyone outside in the hall. The hotel overlooks railroad tracks as well, so the noise from trains was not particularly pleasant either. The bed being quite hard was rather uncomfortable, and no match for the new generation of beds being rolled out by Westin, Sheraton and Sofitel. The lack of a hotel directory in the room was also disappointing and exemplified the general lack of detail in services and amenities provided by the hotel. Perhaps the one nice thing about the room were the crabtree and evelyn toiletries which were above average, but little details, like how they only provided one bar of soap seemed a bit odd. The towels, as with most of the things in the hotel were old and thin. The service was ok... certainly the front desk staff were always polite and friendly. That said, I'm not so sure about housekeeping. On one day, we overheard a loud and indiscrete argument between two housekeepers that went on for a full 10 minutes outside our room in the hall. We also saw a vacuum cleaner left carelessley out in the middle of the hall another day. The hotel also lacked a doorman, which would be odd for a large 4-star in North America, but is not uncommon in London.The location, as other posters put it, is not particularly advantageous either. There is a tube station close by (Kensington Olympia) but it only operates at peak hours and trains only come about once every 15 minutes, and then you have to transfer at Earl's Court. The best station to go to is High Street Kensington which is a 15 minute walk away. There are restaurants close by, but you are by no means in the thick of the London action, being out in what is technically Zone 2. All in all, there really is absolutely NO reason for someone to choose this hotel. There are far better 4-stars that you can get for as cheap, in far more central locations. Indeed, the only reason i can think of why this hotel is still in business is that I noticed it was frequented by airline flight crews, who probably appreciated its proximity to a main road that led to Heathrow.	
Jan 6 2007 	Good Value	I was a little nervous about staying at this hotel from the previous reviews. Especially, since booking on hotwire and only paying about 100USD per night I expected the worse possible room, but that was not the case.This is a good value hotel, it probably compares to an older 3 star Marriot in the US. It is no 4 star Waldorf and I would not pay above $170 a night to stay here. However, for the rate I paid was a really good deal and I would stay here again.The room was in okay shape. It had an older smell to it, like it was previously used as a smoking room with older carpets etc. The beds were clean, but a little older. Not a nice firm matress. One wall in the room was covered with dried brown goo like there was a little water leak. Decent size room.We had a good view of the Olympia exhibition and a view of the street. An occasional train past here at night which was a little annoying.Bathroom was okay. The toliet flushed well. The shower had a good flowrate (the best I have had in London), but was really low. If you are any taller than 5'7&quot; it is hard to get under the shower head. At 5'11&quot; I managed.The elevators were a little quirky but were okay.Restaurant and bar are very expensive. Bar fridge is automatic which is really annoying as you cannot use this to store food of your own. Good nearby restaurants are cafe nero which is also a really cheap internet cafe (for 2 pounds can use for two hours over 3 days). There were always lots of seats here and close to high street kensington tube. Went here almost everyday. Many other good restaurants for breakie nearby. I often grabbed a sandwich or meal to go from waitrose (high end grocer, excellent take away) and ate it in the hotel room when I did not feel like eating in a restaurant.The location of this hotel is in the west end of kensington. High street Kensington shopping is not directly outside the hotel door but a 10 minute walk or 1km away. I did not mind the walk at all. High street kensington has lots of high end shops and a station on the circle/district lines. From this hotel you can walk through Holland park or hyde park to Notting Hill (30mins) past Kensington palace. You can even walk down to leicester square past hyde park, royal albert hall, the V&amp;A, nat his museum, knightsbridge, buckingham palace, downing street and trafalgar square (7 km or 1h15 mins or so) and have a nice tour of london. Alternatively take a bus 15m across from addison road 10m from the hotel exit.Aside from the bus in front of the hotel, the closest tube stations are high street kensington (circle/district) and earls court (picadilly) are 10min walk away each. If you are going to be out late the hotel has a good cheap minicab service which we used once, talk to the conceirge.Hotel staff are friendly and polite. Although they knock at 9AM to clean the room if you do not have the Do Not Distrub sign out.This hotel is used alot by tour groups etc can get a little congested if you are trying to get in or out when they are checking in/out. Had a couple of fire alarms (over 10d) which was a little annoying.	
Jan 5 2007 	Not bad but expected more from a Hilton	Booked direct throught the Hilton website 2 rooms, one for me and one for my mate, both couples.We turned up expecting the 'wow! factor' as we've had in other hotels but this turned out not to be the case. The reception area looked fairly 2/3 star, with staff uniforms looking quite battered.I was a bit worried, but we got our keycards and proceeded to the room on the 8th floor with our bags. Tried both key cards and 'neither' worked. I called from the nearby phone and was told to come back down again to reception. Luckily i was with my girl friend so could leave all the bags with her and i got the keycards re-authorised and went back. As i opened the door i was quite shocked, the room was massive (not all are, you can check from the hotel map) #827.The room had pretty much everything, hairdryer, gown, towels, minibar, internet with keyboard, compliementary chocolates &amp; snacks, iron and ironing board, slippers, playstation access etc etc.The bed was big as well and was not one of those 'two singles pushed together jobbies'. The rooms was showing some signs of use but not too much to be concerned about.However, during the night i put the heating on full but this didn't seem to be very high. The next morning, we couldn't get the shower to work properly, it just kept alternating between hot and cold all the time, it was weird. I was even more surprised that when i told my mate about this, he told me he couldn't even get his shower to work so had to have a sort of bath and throw water on himself!Parking is in NCP around the corner, it is £29 per day! be warned.Breakfast (if not included is about £12-15).	
Dec 30 2006 	Hotel ok - Staff awful	Stayed here twice in December - before and over Christmas. Our first stay was quite ok. We only stayed the one night after arriving on an early flight into Heathrow. We arrived at the hotel at 8am and were given a room immediately. It was a modern but fairly small room which is what we expected for London but very comfortable nonetheless. Our return visit was when the problems started. When we checked back in we were never asked for a credit card to cover incidentals and therefore I never provided it assuming they still had the information from our previous stay which was less than two weeks earlier. When we went to dine in the restaurant that evening I received the bill and asked that it be charged to my room. They refused to do that without any explanation (we found that very few staff in the hotel spoke english as a first language) saying that I would have to pay with either cash or credit card. Not carrying either, I had to trudge back to my hotel room to fetch my wallet leaving my wife sitting alone embarrassed in front of the surrounding onlookers. We then tried to make a phone call from our hotel room at about 10pm using our telephone card (by the way, they charge two pounds fifty as a base price to make any calls, even toll free) and got diverted through to reception who told us that they had suspended chargeback facilities to our room because we had refused to provide credit card details upon check in. The fact is we weren't asked and the staff made no effort to contact us to advise us of the situation. We had to make two trips down to the reception late at night to provide credit card details so they would open the phone lines up. The second time was to provide the details again because they had no record of me coming down the first time because the staff member who took my card details was nowhere to be found even though I had only been down 10 minutes previously. I was then informed by the reception staff that when using my telecard I should dial the local London access number rather than the national access number as the charge back to my room would be the two pound fifty access price. Upon checkout the following morning I discovered that the opposite was the case. I was charged 9 pounds to make a London local call to use my tele-card account!! The Hilton charges local call rates at 50 pence per minute - BEWARE!! When I complained I was told that I had made the call and was liable for the charges regardless of what I had been told and that was that. They may suck you in with a cheap rate but they sting you for everything else - even the internet is five pounds per half hour!! You have been warned. The whole experience left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. The location is ok and the rooms are ok but the staff customer service ethic is just appalling.	
Dec 8 2006	Worth Staying Here	The most enjoyable aspect is the 20-minute walk through this upscale neighborhood from Kensington High Street Station (Circle Line), which is a great place to stroll and do a bit of shopping or dining, and access to other parts of the city is very good from this station. You can also take a train from Earls Court (Picadilly Line), which is about 15 minutes walk, or a few minutes by taxi, and is a good station to use if you are coming from Heathrow. Dont try to take a train to or from the nearby Olympia station, as the trains run very infrequently.We first stayed here in Dec. 2005, and got a deal on a room for about £89 direct from the Hilton website that included breakfast and buffet dinner, both of which were excellent quality, but beware of ordering any drinks as these are sky-high and will erase any savings from the free meal. If you don't get a breakfast deal, then turn left as you exit the hotel and walk about 5 minutes to the east and you will find a local pastry shop that serves sandwiches, as well as bacon and eggs with coffee for about £5.The room was pretty spacious, but the toilet was a Queen Mary-vintage model that was a bit tricky to flush. There is a hot water pot and coffee/tea set which came in handy, and the cookies provided were appreciated. Theres a Tesco supermarket about 5 or 6 minutes walk to the south on the way to Earls court.One major complaint was having to go to the front desk to get a key to the fitness room. I was given a cocked eyebrow by the staff when I appeared at the front desk in shorts and a t-shirt to fetch the keycard, and on two occasions, the keycard did not work and I had to return again for a new one. There is a questionnaire about the state of your physical health that you are supposed to read and sign, as well as sign a register with the date and time of your use of the fitness room, the whole process of which is unnecessary, time-consuming, and very inconvenient, since there is a camera in the fitness room which would surely capture any acts of vandalism (if this is the reason for all this red tape--I think the real reason is to reduce wear and tear on the equipment by discouraging use of the fitness room). The fitness room is pretty nice, but I almost froze as, for some unknown reason, there is an air conditioner on full blast, even though the temperature outside was about 8c (45F), I made a call to the staff, who agreed to come up and switch it off, but they never appeared. By the way, dont try the Scoffs Italian restaurant which was heartily recommended in a prior review here (I suspect this was a rigged recommendation; read on). The décor is dated and the pasta and sauces tasted like the type sold in the frozen food section of the supermarket. My primary beef is that they do something very cunning, which is to bring the credit card authorization machine to the table and ask if you want to add money for a tip onto the machine, which you key in as the waitress holds the machine. Very unprofessional, and we typically leave no tip when put on the spot like this. The waitress looked the other way as we left, even though we paid £23 (for two) for this slop that tasted half as good as the canned variety available for a few dollars in the supermarket. Take a pass on Scoffs, there are plenty of other choices.April 2006, was our second visit to Hilton Olympia and its worth returning to, primarily for the good location, as long as you can get a deal on the room. The rates here are usually a bit less than Hiltons elsewhere in the city.	
Nov 30 2006 	Terrible stay in every way	My experience was terrible in every way. My last night in my room (after staying there for 5 nights) they checked another couple into my room and gave them my room key. This was not such a big deal to me, until the guy at the counter did not bother to apologize *at all*, acted like it was my fault, and just told me that it showed I had checked out in the system. On top of that, the next morning someone came into my room again with a key (housekeeping I'm guessing--I was sleeping and did not see them), even though I had my Do Not Disturb light on. If you're going to stay here, make sure you use your deadbolt and chain lock! The customer service is terrible and it is way overpriced for a location that isn't really that great. This is NOT a 4-star hotel--maybe 2 stars?--it is small, dingy, and dirty. The carpets are stained and the hallways stink.	
Nov 27 2006 	Better than I expected!!	I booked this hotel as a 'secret deal' with lastminute and got a great rate of £74. When I found out which hotel it was and read the reviews I was really worried. Overall the hotel was very nice and in a good location for Earls Court (10-15 min walk). The room was a good size and clean (passed the bathroom check for hair!!). We didn't eat in the hotel, but could recommend the noodle bar across the road. The only criticism I would have is the underground car park is very small and only accommodates 20-30 cars ( also v. expensive @ £30 for 24 hrs).	
Nov 27 2006 	Big Thumbs Down!	I think your opinion of the Hilton Olympia depends very much on your expectations. If youre expecting four-star (which Priceline claims this hotel to be), or even a three-star, accommodations, youll be sorely disappointed.The lobby of the hotel is quite nice. Deceptively so  dont think that this will reflect the quality of the rooms. The concierges were not consistent. One was very nice, and gave us a map and detailed instructions on how to get around the immediate area. But the others we dealt with either barely spoke English or were out-right rude.Check-in went smoothly, and we were offered a room right away, even though we arrived at 9 am. Unfortunately, they only had smoking rooms available, even though wed requested non-smoking, but we thought wed give it a try.Our first room was awful. Wed requested a double bed, and were told over the phone that the hotels doubles were equivalent to American king sized beds. Complete falsehood. The double was the size of an American full. Even worse, the springs in the bed were broken. I sat on one edge, and the mattress sank all the way to the frame (and, no, Im not a large person!).We complained, and they switched us to a room with two singles. Not romantic, but better than the tiny double, so we took it. The room was small and drab, and in desperate need of refurbishing. It was so cramped, there wasnt room to wheel a smallish suitcase through it. The one good thing about it was that even though it was a smoking room, it didnt smell at all smoky. And the beds were actually pretty comfortable in this room.And the problems . . . the problems were never ending. The first night we were there, the heater in our room broke, and we froze. It took repeated calls to reception, before they grudgingly came up and brought us a space heater and an extra blanket (one extra blanket). The second day, the heat was fixed, but I got a shock when I plugged in my hairdryer. The shock fried my hair dryer and caused all the power in our room to short out. Again, it took repeated calls and a long wait before reception sent someone up to fix it. The third day, our phone was blocked due to a computer malfunction. It was so bad that the manager sent up a complimentary half-bottle of wine. I was just glad that the electrical shock I got didn't seriously hurt me.Housekeeping was negligible. I know they came in, because the beds were made and towels were left, but that was it. They didnt remove any of the used glasses or mugs, or leave us clean ones. The room has almost no amenities  just a phone, tv and hot water heater with instant coffee.Beware of the phone! I brought a prepaid international calling card, and even thought the calling card number was toll free, the hotel charged us TWO POUNDS FIFTY for every toll free call. This was so absurd we complained, and they ended up reducing our phone bill by half. Even so, it was a complete rip off.Yes, we got a good deal through priceline at $75 dollars a night. But this hotel was supposed to be a four star hotel . . . and it was really more like a two-star, which is to my mind a deceptive trade practice on the part of priceline. Im pretty sure we could have gotten a better deal elsewhere -- maybe at a B&amp;B -- and would been much more comfortable. I have to say this experience has turned me off of Priceline for good.	
Nov 26 2006 	Good hotel for the price	I stayed 5 nights at the Hilton Olympia in London in the first part of November. I booked directly through the Hilton site as I am an HHonors member. After booking I was concerned about it from reading the reviews here. I must have stayed at a different hotel. :-) I found the Front Desk staff to be very friendly and helpful. I arrived before my room was ready. The Concierge took care of my luggage while I went to explore the city. When I returned, I was given my room key. The room was small, which I expected in Europe. However it was extremely clean! And very well taken care of. The bathroom was huge! Which I did not expect. There were two very large bath towels, a face towel and a washcloth. As well as standard shampoo and conditioner amenities in the bathroom. There was a kettle with coffee, tea, sugar and cream. A hairdryer, trouser press and iron and ironing board in the room. Also, there were standard American plugs and voltage in the bathroom and at the desk. I was able to plug my curling iron in without having to use my voltage converter and British plug converter. The Kensington Olympia Tube station is literally around the corner. Although the tube runs only every 15-20 minutes from that station, it's very convenient. For people in a hurry, the bus stop is practically right outside the front door of the hotel and you can take the bus anywhere in London. The only problems I had with this hotel was that bed was extremely hard. I love a firm mattress but the mattress on my bed was like sleeping on a block of concrete with a sheet over it. Whoever bought that bed never actually tried to sleep in it. The other problem was that they charge a phone access rate of 2.50 GBP. With the extremely poor American exchange rate, it was close to $5.00 to use the phone. I didn't call home much on my trip. I did not eat in the restaurant. There are too many choices for dining in London to be stuck in the hotel dining room. And I don't drink, so I don't know how the bar is.As a single woman traveling alone, I felt very safe in the area, even coming back to the hotel at 1:00 am. All in all the hotel was fine and I would stay there again on a future trip to London.	
Nov 22 2006 	Not as bad as I though!!!	Just back from a 3 night romantic break with my fiance and was really worried after reading some really bad reviews on this website. Checking in was fine and quick but when we got to our room they had given us a twin - not my idea of a romantic break... Went back to reception who after checking were adamant there were no double rooms available - after pleading for 20 minutes they offered us a free meal in the restaurant for any night of our stay but we'd all ready booked elsewhere. They then offered us free champagne, fruit basket and chocolates, which we accepted and the duty manager herself came to our room and pushed the beds together! The next day we were upgraded to a deluxe room and received more free wine. All in all I think they more than made up for their mistake. The hotel itself is OK. Not the nicest Hilton i've ever stayed in but OK. Thought the location was great and would probably stay again if I could get a special rate.	
Nov 20 2006 	Worst Hilton Ever	Experienced a check in staff of calculated indifference of the type I thought disappeared from London years ago. One lady (heavily accented English but eventually helpful) looking after 2 other guests. Another seated side on to the check in area (where a glance would have shown me waiting at the HHonors line), managed to not once in 10 minutes move her eyes one millimetre from her computer. A third (young guy) looked me full in the face from 20 feet away for 10 seconds, picked up a phone, made a call, then deliberately and calculatedly strolled out of the check in area.Bad: SINGLE room (yes they exist, as per a previous review); stifling &quot;air conditioning&quot; which could not be set to cool; tear in bedroom carpet covered with duct tape; musty smell throughout; no facewasher (in a HILTON??!); location in the middle of nowhere with very infrequent tube service.Good/OK/Lucky: Room only cost 88 pounds; windows can open so musty smell and stifling heat could escape; Frank's breakfast place directly over railway bridge - classic traditional English &quot;caff&quot; complete with local characters; trains to Gatwick with no changes from Olympia station next to hotel (40 minutes to Gatwick).Never again unless for a few hours before flying out and same or lower price.	
Nov 20 2006 	Room big enough for a mouse	I thought that because I was staying in a Hilton hotel, of which I have stayed in quite a few around the world, that this hotel would be of a similar standard. I did not find it matched anything like where I had stayed previously. I usually travel on my own, but have always been given a double room - not at the Hilton Olympia, I was given a room with one single bed in it that was about the size of a walk in wardrobe. There was less than one metre between the bed and the wall and in the bathroom, although I am only 5'3&quot; tall when I was in the shower my head hit the ceiling. I did not find the front desk staff either welcoming or friendly, in fact I found them quite defensive, they are obviously used to receiving criticism about the hotel. The food was only average and I did not find a large variety. When I next return to London I will make sure I avoid Hilton hotels completely, they are not obviously of the standard they are elsewhere in this country.	
Nov 17 2006 	Very disatisfied	My colleague and I stayed for one night in the Hilton Olympia on business. It is advertised as being a 4* hotel but I can assure you that it is not even a 3*. We were allocated 2 'Single' rooms which I didn't realise still existed today in 4* hotels. The rooms were tiny. It was like half a standard sized room. I called my colleague and asked him if he had the other half of my room! His was the same size. There was a single bed up against a wall and hardly any standing room between the bed and the dressing table area. The hairdryer was mounted on the wall directly over the tea &amp; coffee making facilities therefore there was a combination of several different coloured hairs in the sugar bowl!! The bathroom was ok with one thread bare greyish/white hand towel and another rock hard again greyish bath towel provided. It had one of those shower curtains that insists on clinging to you when you are showering and all that goes through your mind is whose body was it clinging to yesterday morning!!.. The room smelt stale and the corridors were crying out for new carpets and a paint job. I have never seen such worn out carpets. They were thread bare and all the doors had not seen paint for years. The restaurant was like a sauna for breakfast. Everybody was fanning themselves with serviettes and the tables were dirty. I would most certainly recommend giving this hotel a miss if you are planning a trip to London. We paid 159 pounds per room and I am sure that there are plenty other nicer hotels in the immediate area offering a far superior standard of accommodation for this price. Will definitely never go back even though I need to be in London every 2 weeks for the foreseeable future.	
Nov 12 2006 	OK provided you're not in a hurry	I stayed here for one night on business. Painfully slow check-in (the member of staff handing cookies out to people in the queue could have been better used behind the reception desk) and a hopeless member of housekeeping staff trying to find somewhere to plug in a standard lamp in my room (I told him to leave it) made me even later than I already was in meeting my colleagues. The room was everything I'd expect from a Hilton but nothing more and there was quite a lot of traffic noise. Breakfast was good. If you're in a hurry the only way to leave or arrive at the hotel is by taxi, traffic permitting, as the underground service to Olympia is infrequent and it's a fairly long walk from Kensington High Street station. If you need to be in this part of town then it's not a bad hotel but it could be so much better.	
Nov 9 2006	A good stay	We stayed at the Hotel Olympia for 7 nights in Sept 06. On first impressions, we were a little disapointed. I guess we had expected more for a 4 star hotel. But after doing more travelling after London (it was our first hotel of many), it probably was a reasonable hotel in comparison to others we have encountered.To get to London took us 26 hours! So we very much looked forward to getting to our room. We arrived there at about 9 in the morning and they let us go to our room straight away, which was unexpected and we were very grateful. However, we found the reception staff were a bit rude and they couldn't seem to understand us too well, even though we were speaking english.Our room was small, but we had expected that. It had everything we needed - comfortable bed, hot shower, TV, kettle etc. There was no laundry in the hotel. You have to pay astronomical prices to have your laundry done, so I suggest bringing plenty of things to wear. I unfortunately just assumed that there would be a laundry. Luckily we found a laundromat close to our next hotel.Breakfast was very good. The staff in the breakfast area all seemed to be French and they were very friendly and accomodating. The food was very good, a lot of assortment, lots of fresh fruit. If I had known it would be my last chance for fresh fruit and real toast for our whole trip, I would have appreciated it more - toast seems to come in packets, like biscuits, in France and Italy!The location of the hotel was excellent. We caught the number 9 bus almost directly out the front of the hotel and that got us just about everywhere - Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Harrods, Hyde Park etc. The hotel isnt far from Notting Hill, Holland Park and Kensington Park, and there are plenty of shops and restaurantsAll in all we had a good stay at the Hilton Olympia and would recommend it to other people	
Oct 25 2006 	Great Location Enjoyable Stay	Managed to get a great rate for this hotel situated a 3 minute walk from the Kensington Olympia Tube station. Spent 2 nights, and being a Gold HHonours member recieved a free upgrade to a queen deluxe room. Check in was quick and straight forward, the only problem was the fact that the room was not avaliable, but we were trying to checkin at 1200!!! The porter stored our bags at no cost, and gave us some useful information on things to do. We ended getting the bus and going down to Knightsbridge and looking at the shops!!! The room had a great view towards Battersea Powerstation (Room835), and the room was quiet. Breakfast was great if included in your rate, otherwise your looking at £17.95 for the buffet breakfast.The only downsides that I can see is that the hotel bar is very expensive (well I thought so), a glass of Rose was £7.50 and a JD and coke was £6.50. Also, the bathroom did look tired, all thought it was functional, and the shower did have a tendancy to fluctuate the water temperature when you were showering.Over all the staff and hotel were excellent, and the only downside were as I have just mentioned.	
Oct 21 2006	Never again!!!	Staying at this hotel was an absolute nightmare. I just could not believe this was a Hilton hotel. It does not deserve its 4 star rating at all!! At best 2and half due to health dangers.Problems encountered: Not only does air conditioning not work it emits a &quot;putrid&quot; odour which causes nausea and headaches. Toilets tend to stop workingStaff whilst eager and enthusiastic tended to be inexperienced and unhelpful.Location is undesirable as not located near shops, restaurants or attractions. All require significant walking or public trasnport.	
Sep 29 2006 	Total Rip Off	Absolutely the worst value for money I have ever had in a London hotel.Myself and two colleagues arrived at 11pm on Wednesday evening, tired and weary after a day of travelling and meetings. We checked into our tiny rooms - 648, 660 and 862. 648 stank like a toilet that hadn't been flushed for days. 862 smelt like the smoking room in an all night drinking den. 660 (mine) was OK - but not a £196 per night room - more like a £35 value.But we were all very tired so decided to hit the sack and put it down to a bad experience.At 2pm the water dripping from the air conditioning in 648 got so bad he had to move to another room.A horrendous night's sleep followed by a bill for just short of £600 for three of us. I feel totally ripped off by Hilton hotels and it will be a long time before I check into another one.This hotel it appears is undergoing renovation (slowly). Staff told us the they were having problems with the air condituioning etc. If I had been told this at the time of booking or at check-in it would have been better.My advice would be to check in early to give yourself the chance to complain and get moved into a better room or check out if you are given really bad rooms. Well actually my advice would be to stay somewhere else!	
Sep 1 2006 	There are better Hiltons	As a Hilton honours member we got upgraded to a suite which was nice. The bedroom was excellent however the living room part of the suite was all a bit pointless with a few pieces of furniture scattered around making the space look spare and uninviting.Staff were extremely pleasant and friendly, always smiling and always noticing you which I particularly liked.Wifi was patchy and not available outside of the lobby - Hilton really need to work on this in all their UK hotels, we want Wifi and we dont want to pay for it, we're paying enough for the room!Breakfast was usual Hilton routine, big buffet, reasonable choice.Parking was an atrocious £28 a day which as a British traveller I find disgraceful - I have to bring my car the get to the hotel.Taxi into the centre of london was always around £15-£16 each way.It's a little far out to be convenient for central London and I would choose a hotel closer to the centre on my next trip.All in all it was okay but nothing special and Hilton really need to get their act together in the UK as they are starting to feel like rather overpriced travel lodges!	
Aug 16 2006 	Hideous Decor	Hotels in central London are expensive, so when I found this to be the cheapest place available, I should have known that it wouldn't be perfect. Still, it's a Hilton, right? How bad could it be?The lobby was like something from 1970, really unwelcoming and just plain unpleasant. The check-in clerk was friendly but a bit awkward. He told me that I'd luckily been upgraded to a suite and that the room would be really really nice. I was pretty excited about this but when I got to the room I found it to be decorated in the most hideous green colour with a load of nasty old furniture and long green curtains that covered nothing but wall. Aside from the decor, however, the room was ok. The bed was large (a king I think), and the bathroom was very large and sparkling clean. I was also given free tea, coffee, biscuits, and fruit.Breakfast the next morning was very nice, and I was quite shocked at how stylish and modern the restaurant was compared to my room. This hotel is in desperate need of a makeover. I never realised how important decor and ambience is to a hotel stay, but trust me, if you had to spend one night in this hideous room, you'd be plagued with vile green nightmares for weeks to come.	
Aug 14 2006	Excellent value	After reading the critical reviews of this hotel posted on the internet, we were a little worried about our purchase of a week stay in this High Street Kensington Hotel. We needn't have worried. We stayed for a full week at the Olympia and were very happy with our accomodations. Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The snow white bed linens looked brand new. We had a full size bath with bath and shower which was very spacious. As with all our travels we did our homework in advance. There were hefty charges for using the phone, even with a phone card, so we used the public telephones located both in the lobby and at a phone both next to the hotel. However, the hotel had clearly marked the rates for calls right on the telephone, and the front desk had suggested public phones when we inquired. The breakfast was not included in our rate so we did not eat at the hotel. The area has numerous wonderful cafes and restaurants within a 5 minute walk at a fraction of the price and with personal and attentive service. We did have tea, coffee and shortbread cookies in our room daily and when we went down to the lobby in the morning were offered freshly baked cookies daily as well. The hotel has bus service to Picadilly and Trafalgar Square right outside the door. Given the congested traffic in downtown London, we found it quicker to take the underground. There were 3 underground startions within walking distance. We took the Olympia station to Heathrow and back and were able to walk to the station with our luggage in about 5 minutes. The trains run to Olympia about every 15 minutes so it is a quieter station. The rest of the time we walked down to the High Street Kensington Station or Earls Court. We timed these walks at 12 minutes but we are not fast walkers. From there we could be anywhere in just a few minutes. A travelcard was 4.90 for the day (after 9:30am) and enabled us to go back and forth to the hotel in the afternoon to freshen up or rest if we needed to. The area itself has many interesting shopsand an internet cafe is just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.The downsides of staying in this hotel did not affect our experience in London. Our room had NO view. We could see a brick wall with windows and the sky, but not the ground. We had natural light but it was hard to tell what the weather was like. We did not get the breakfast included in our rate. We heard it was very good but at 17.95 per person were not willing to buy it on its own. The telephone and minibar were very expensive extras.The upside was the comfortable room, friendly and helpful staff, the ease of access to public transit, fairly central location where it felt safe to walk at night, and the excellent rate we got for this hotel. We will definitely stay here again.	
Aug 13 2006 	Staff couldn't have been more attentive	British Airways moved us to this hotel after the other one was such a disappointment. The staff was courteous, helpful and went out of their way to answer questions and get things for us. The room was quiet, air conditioned, and comfortable. The breakfast was huge and tasty. A bus took us to the nearest tube station so getting around from here was not a problem.	
Aug 9 2006 	The rudest staff on the planet!	OK, so I got a cheap LastMinute--- rate. That shouldn't meant that I get a cheap service! This is a Hilton Hotel. Thus I would expect a better class of service.My friend and I arrived about half five on the Saturday evening. We had been tromping about London half the day and were more than a little keen to have a half hour kip before getting ready and going back out again. It was not to be... When we went to check in we were advised that there were no twin rooms available, even though this is what we had booked, and were rather rudely informed by an unsmiling check in clerk that we would have to like it or lump in (not in so many words but that was the gist of it).My friend is male. He is not my boyfriend. We did not want to find ourselves sharing a double bed. Despite my protests at check in - this was what happened. Otherwise we might have been out on our ear.The room was nice, I'll give them that. All mod cons, air con, ironing board, iron, TV, mini bar, kettle and biscuits etc. Lovely bathroom, nice free toiletries. Tiny double bed. (Probably not tiny if there with boyfriend/husband but v tiny if with non-boyfriend male!!) The view from the window was terrible - a brick wall and an alley, but I wouldn't have thought the view from the front of the hotel was much better as not picturesque area. Didn't sleep a wink all night, lying perched on edge of bed, worried would roll over and spoon my friend!!Also note that when you step outside the hotel it really stinks of leaked sewage or something that really pongs along those lines.If you can fins somewhere else to stay - do it - don't put money in the Hilton pocket, they clearly don't care about their customers.All I would say is that if you stay here and are thinking where to eat - just 15 minutes walk down the road is the best veggie restaurant ever - 222 Veggie Vegan. I loved it!	
Aug 6 2006 	Good hotel if you get a good rate	Stayed here recently for 2 nights after getting a great rate from lastminute. Like all Hiltons, I wouldn't pay the full rate as I think their prices are over-inflated, but well worth staying if you get a good deal from another website. Cannot believe the last review, sounds like they stayed at a different hotel! Our room was spotlessly clean, as was every other area of the hotel we came across. All the staff were very polite, friendly &amp; helpful and quick to respond to any requests. Our room overlooked the back of the hotel which was not the greatest of views, but we weren't there for the view &amp; on the plus side, we were not bothered in the least by any noise, traffic, etc.Bedroom was an adequate size with 2 comfortable beds, minibar, tv/playstation, kettle, iron &amp; ironing board. Also easily adjustable air con. Only thing I would have liked to have been in the room that wasn't there is a safe. Didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food, but the bar area was very fresh &amp; modern looking.The hotel is about a 10-15min walk from Kensington High Street underground on the opposite side of the road. Bit of a walk if you have cases, but buses run very frequently. No's 9, 10 &amp; 27 all go past the hotel. Buy a travel card from the tube station when you arrive, saves you a small fortune &amp; can be used on the tube &amp; buses. No complaints about the hotel at all, but would probably somewhere nearer the main 'touristy' sites next time.	
Aug 1 2006	Poor service and staff	This hotel was used by the Trafalgar touring group. The front desk yelled at us because we did not have our vouchers. Teh elevators were broken. The concierge told us to take a bus rather than help us hail a cab. The window faced another wall. The staff had a hard time with English and could not find a church for us on Sunday. Thee was no service for the tourist. the location is also too far out.	
Aug 1 2006 	Would never go there again	This is the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. Dirty and old, roach infested and my boyfriend got eaten alive by fleas. Nothing worked- a/c, shower etc. Absolutely horrible.	
Jul 31 2006 	Enjoyed the Hilton via Priceline LOVED London	After reading some so-so reviews of the location and condition of this hotel, I was a bit apprehensive upon arrival. First...if you're taking the tube from Heathrow/Gatwick...be advised that service to Olympia station is sporadic (but its just around the corner). Next time I might just take the tube to Earls Court and take a cab/bus from there to the hotel.I got this hotel at a great price from Priceline, so I cant complain about value. I was worried about the location, thinking that it was a bit far away from all the typical tourist spots I planned to visit further towards the city center. But this hotel is very convenient to the bus stop in front, as well as easy walking distance to Kensington High St tube stop, which then takes you just about anywhere you want to go. We never had to wait for more than 5-10 minutes for any buses/trains, and it was easy to catch a cab from the hotel. I wouldnt hesitate to stay in this location or part of town again.The room was small, but I suppose that's London. The bathroom was a little smelly due to poorly placed short shower curtains, but it wasnt enough to damper our week stay there, or our enjoyment of london. The bedding was slightly upgraded, which was nice, and we never did eat in the hotel's restaurant. I cant wait to return!	
Jul 20 2006 	Great stay at the Hilton Olympia	We booked two rooms at this hotel on Priceline and were very pleased with the price and the accommodations. It's in a relatively quiet location, but that was a relief after a hot day of sightseeing. There's a bus stop just outside the hotel, so we used our transit pass to zip down the street to the High Street Kensington tube station every day. The staff was very nice--including the engineer who successfully repaired our air-conditioning on a hot summer evening.Some neighborhood tips:1. Avoid the pub just the other side of the bridge as you turn right out of the hotel. It's horrible.2. Try Cafe Pasta, about four blocks down High Street toward the tube. We had such a lovely dinner that we went back a few nights later.3. Instead of paying high prices for the hotel breakfast, stop at Waitrose near the tube station, pick up breakfast essentials, and store them in your mini-fridge. (We emptied out our mini-bar; our son's room had an empty fridge.) You can make coffee in your room.I'd estimate that the tube station is about a 15-minute walk, or more. You won't want to do it with suitcases, so take a taxi to the hotel. Don't expect your room to be ready, but they do store luggage. Overall, a pleasant stay in a convenient hotel.	
Jul 1 2006 	A Pleasant Stay	I stayed in this hotel for two nights while attending an exhibition at the Olympia centre. The check-in process was friendly and efficient. My room overlooked a roof full of air conditioning plant equipment but none the less was not disturbed by any noise from it. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The air conditioning was a little temperamental and some items in the room looked a little tired. Some carpets in the corridors were worn and a little threadbare adding to the impression that some money needs to be spent.The hotel has a very nice and spacious bar area but drinks are expensive. I did not stay in the hotel for dinner so I cannot comment on this. However, in the morning the Restaurant was very busy for breakfast. The good news was that they had plenty of staff on so seating was quickly and efficiently dealt with. Once seated, hot drinks were ordered and were promptly served. The self-service breakfast buffet was well stocked and the English breakfast excellent. This was regularly topped up with freshly cooked items which looked as tasted delicious. Checkout was again quick, friendly and efficient. Overall I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend this hotel.	
Jun 27 2006	Enjoyed our visit	My wife and I stayed five nights at the Hilton London Olympia, May 25 - June 1st. We found the hotel to be comfortable though not elaborate and the staff extremely helpful.The location is just a short tube ride away from all sightseeing. We rode the Gatwick Express to Victoria Station, changed trains and then on to the hotel by taking the tube to Earl's Court where you will change trains once again. From Earl's Court, you will take the train to Kensington (Olympia). This train will be the third or fourth one to pass this direction and from our experience, is not ridden very much as it is off the beaten path. Once you depart the train at Kensington (Olympia), you will walk up a short hill, turn left and you will see the hotel.One highlight of the hotel is the buffet breakfast which we found to be exquisite with all types of fruit, eggs, toast, etc. I would advise eating breakfast here before a full day of sightseeing in London and I would also advise to have at least a drink in the open spaced bar with its large television screens at night. The drinks are a little expensive but the atmosphere in the bar area is very pleasant and inviting.We booked a day tour from the hotel to Stratford, Oxford, and the Cotswolds and the concierge was more than happy to assist and book this for us complete with pickup at the hotel. On the last day, the concierge booked a private car to take us to London Gatwick from the hotel. This is expensive but it saved us the trouble of dragging bags up and down all the stairs of the tube at several stops and I would recommend it.We had a good stay at this hotel and would stay here again upon our return to London.	
Jun 27 2006	We had a great experience at this hotel	My wife and I just returned to the U. S. after a week vacationing in London. We used Priceline and got a great rate for seven nights but we were bit worried because of the mixed reviews on this site.Our experience though was topnotch. We could not have been happier. We had a large air-conditioned room on the 1st floor facing a side street. We had TV to watch World Cup soccer. The staff was friendly and helpful. We never used the restaurant or the internet at the hotel. There are many places around town where you can do internet for one pound per hour. We had a small dorm-size refrigerator that we used regularly to cut our food costs. We bought Oyster cards that gave us unlimited underground and bus travel. Buses run very frequently and we usually took the bus to the underground at Kensington High or sometimes the bus all the way to our days destination. I recommend both Priceline and this hotel highly.	
Jun 15 2006	had a great stay	Having read some of the reviews, and having booked (perhaps foolishly) on the basis of the brand name Hilton, I went with some trepedation to stay in the Hilton Olympia. I need not have been concerned; there were two blips which I will address at the end of this review but otherwise the stay was fabulous.The hotel was clean, well air conditioned (given the untypical current UK heatwave) and well maintained. The decor was smart, appealling and functional - if slightly 1980s. The room was well equipped with all the usual, mini bar, iron, ironing board, tea and coffee facilities, bathrobes, hairdryer and king size bed etc The room was comfortable and I had an exceptionally good nights sleep in the very comfortable bed.The breakfast was first class as I would expect in a Hilton.The gripes are with staff though. I was staying with my male partner (gay relationship) and the receptionist was a little surprised that we wanted a double bed and repeatedly tried to persuade us that a twin was more appropriate. This minor, out dated attitude problem was easily dealt with.The second problem was that the concierge when asked to flag us down a taxi directed us to a &quot;friend&quot; of his. The car he drove us in turned out not to be a licenced cab and the fare charged was grossly inflated (i checked with a genuine hackney taxi driver later).	
Jun 3 2006	Also pleasantly surprised	We had read such mixed reviews, so were thrilled when we got there. Hotel rooms small by American standards, but quite large for London. Staff very nice and helpful. Were able to check in early. Rooms clean and had all the amenities. A/C didn't work great, but with windows open had a great cool breeze all night. Shower ceiling was low, but not really a problem for us either. Location was fine. 24 hour grocery a few blocks away and all the shopping and restaurants you could ask for 10-15 minute walk away, along with the tube. Bus picked up right out front, and always easy to get a cab. We got a great deal on hotel/airfare on Priceline, and would do it again.	
May 14 2006	So-So Hotel 	We booked this hotel for 5 nights through Priceline. It was OK, but not what I expect from a Hilton. This hotel is used by tour companies, airline crews, and such so there are always large crowds checking in and out. We arrived early and, to their credit, they immediately put us in a corner room on the 7th floor; we had expected to wait. Room wasn't huge, but it was adequate by European standards and bed was comfortable. Unfotunately, they managed to garble a message from our son about when he would be arriving. He arrived the 8th - they told us the 10th! They also checked us in with his reservation and charged us, even though we had prepaid with Priceline. I had to produce our Priceline paperwork and it took two days and the manager to straighten out the charges. Internet charges are high - for in-room use, it's £14.95 for 24 hours. In the business center or their coffee house, £5 for 30 minutes or £8.50 for 60 minutes. Business center was not so good - marginal inkjet printer that constantly jammed paper. Also, the business center employee made a lot of personal calls and it seemed to be the gathering place for people to chat. I had to get grumpy so that I could concentrate on what I was doing. Ultimately had to print out boarding passes on the hotel's dime, because my 30 minutes expired trying to get the printer to work. The breakfast buffet was adequate but pricey. If it's included in your room charge, then it's OK, otherwise it's £14.95! The desk staff is multi-lingual, with English being a second language for most. We used the concierges several times with mixed results. For example, they set up transportation for us to the theater, but then the driver couldn't find the theater and we just made it in the nick of time. We also had to nudge the concierges to do simple things like make calls, and they seemed to be more proactive doing things for my husband or son than for me. Nothing serious, just annoying.Would I stay here again? Probably not. I think I would probably choose something with a more central location. However, if the price is right, it's clean, comfortable, and there are lovely restaurants nearby.	
May 5 2006 	This Hotel Sucks	I had the misfortune to book a room in this hotel mainly due to it's close proximity to the Olympia Exhibition halls. The first non-smoking room I was allocated on the 5th floor had clearly seen better days (and many smokers), and when I complained about this at the reception area I was made to wait over 40 mins before someone saw fit to move me. 2nd time lucky (or so I thought), but whilst the room on the 4th floor was smoke free, everything else was just plain dirty or soiled...from the grubby bed-linen to the &quot;seen much better days&quot; badly marked marble floors in the bathroom. The room faced towards the nearby tube station, and rest assured you WILL hear every train that arrives and departs (although Olympia does run a limited service).Overall, this is NOT the place to stay if you're heading to Olympia, checkout the nearby Novotel.	
May 5 2006	Better than expected	My husband and I spent a night either side of our Trafalgar tour in this hotel and were pleasantly surprised. On both occassions, the rooms we had were of a decent size and what impressed us most was being able to check in at 7am on a Saturday morning having spent the last 20 hours in the air. The hotel is located in trendy Kensington High Street and just a few blocks away are all the high fashion shops, places to eat, etc.. The bus stop is less than a block away, although the tube station is about a 10 minute walk. Overall, we were pleased with our stay (the breakfasts are great too!).	
May 4 2006	Average hotel	We stayed at the Hilton Olympia London for three nights. The first room we stayed in was quite small and did not meet our expectations. But it got worse, when one of us tried to take a shower the following morning, there was no water in the shower!!! Not what you expect at a Hilton hotel in London, to say the least. When we complained, they sent up a janitor, who could not fix the problem. We were then offered a new room, but no other compensation. After a telephone conversation with the hotel manager, we were offered a free breakfast. So you have been warned, do not stay at the 8th floor!!!! The hotel is aware of this problem, but they still let people stay at this floor. Our second room on the third floor was much nicer. The breakfast buffet was average, not exactly what you expect at a four-star hotel. Bus 9 and 10 stop right outside the hotel, and are the most convient way to get to the city centre.	
Apr 20 2006	Disliked this hotel would not stay again...	Just returned from 6 weeks &quot;around the globe&quot; holiday (2 adults 2 teenagers).Booked this hotel for our stay (6 nights)in London. Rooms were OK and clean. The hotel is 5 - 8 minute walk from the nearest tube station - Kensington Olympia. However, you have to change trains at Earls Court to go to other London destinations. Main issue was that we found staff very unattentive, disinterested and in some cases rude. Most staff also had trouble speaking or understanding english!!. Found the hotels other ammenities to be a rip off (e.g. internet 5 pounds per 30 minutes). Decided to cut short our stay and move.Ended up only staying 4 nights at Hilton London Olympia. Got onto &quot;Hotwire&quot; and moved to the Melia White House hotel - fantastic. We wish we had booked here earlier.In short, you can do far better in London than spend your hard earned money at the London Hilton Olympia. Spend it with people more appreciative of your custom!!	
Apr 11 2006	Pleasantly surprised	I was a bit worried about all what has been said on the review of this hotel, but we found it lovely. The area of Kensington was clean, friendly and only about twenty minutes by bus to town. I did not have a drink in the hotel after I read the comments of £6.75 for a glass of wine. The room was lovely, large and looked out to the front of the hotel. We arrived in Kings Cross and took 3 underground trains to the hotel in about 30 minutes. (We had bought the travelcard for the week-end, on and off buses and trains for one price). When we arrived we found out that the NO 9 + 10 bus from outside the hotel took us straight to the centre of town (Oxford St/Regent St) and they run every 5 minutes. We preferred this to the underground. We ate lunch in Scoffs Italian restaurant in Kensington High St (any pasta/pizza for £4.95), really gorgeous, home made pasta. We ate there as our room was not available at 13.00, so we walked there and had lunch. It was 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Out of hotel turn left and walk up the road on the opposite side from the hotel. Then it was time to get in our room. The breakfast had something for everyone, buffet style. We did use the underground to go to Victoria (one stop) to see Billy Elliott, which was fantastic. The area of Kensington High St was really busy at times, lots of shops and restaurants, which is just a ten minute walk from the hotel. Would definately stay at this hotel again, well worth the money.	
Mar 28 2006	Hilton Olympia Was good to us!	We stayed at the Hilton Hotel Olympia for eight nights in mid March, 2006. We had read some rather negative reviews and were somewhat hesitant about the state of the hotel and its' service. We were very pleasantly surprised by all that we encountered.The first room we were given was very tight as we were two adults with a very large sixteen year old. We asked for a larger room and were given one on our second night. The luggage was moved when the room was ready and we returned after a day of sightseeing to a roomier spot.Our son did enjoy the workout room and this helped to keep the teen content while with Mom and Dad.The breakfast, although a buffet, was varied and quite good.We found the area of Kensington High Street was a fantastic area. Great for walks and runs and close to shopping. Any request that we made to the hotel staff was politely and expediently carried out. Kudos to them!We would certainly stay here again.	
Mar 17 2006 	Avoid the 5th floor!	Overall the hotel is clean, tidy and staff seemed friendly but the first room I got on the 5th floor was very very small and boiling hot! I complained and got moved to a much nicer, larger, cooler room on the 4th floor which I was very happy with. The gym is small but very nice with complimentary towels and water. There was a really good buffet selection for breakfast of cereals, pastries, continental and full english! The bar is very expensive so beware!I would go there again on business but would probably look for another hotel if I was paying! I also heard another guest complaining about a hot room on the 5th floor so perhaps avoid this floor if possible!	
Feb 24 2006	good london toursit hotel	Stayed at the Hilton Olympia while on spring break, doing the tourist thing. Got a great rate (under $100, can't remember specifically). The room was small by american standards, but worked just fine for us. It was clean and no maintenance issues. The olympia tube station is visited by trains somewhat infrequently, but we learned to live with it, and spent most of our days exploring the city. did not try the in house restaurant. I would prefer something closer to the action, but for the price it was unbeatable.	
Feb 22 2006	Quite a nice hotel	We stayed at his hotel primarily for its location...there are frequent buses to Central London and the neighborhood is lovely...nice local shops interesting architecture, ethnic restaurants. The Olympia station is just around the corner for a direct trip to Gatwick airport. The room was very clean and when we needed some items for it... our TV remote control needed new batteries and we requested an extra blanket, these were brought to us within 5 minutes. The Monday night buffet was generous and had great variety. The dinners and service on the other nights were enjoyable. It would have been nice if we did not have to walk through a smokey bar to get to the restaurant however and it would have been nice if they had let guests know that a continental breakfast was available too, not just their pricey breakfast buffet. Our room was quite chilly even with the heat turned up...but they did give us that extra blanket quickly.	
Feb 19 2006	Fab Hotel! Are You Sure You Have Written Reviews about the Same Hotel?	We stayed at the Hilton Olympia as part of a package for The Brit Awards, I read the previous reviews after we knew where we were staying, and my heart missed a beat as I was expecting something from &quot;Psycho&quot; when we arrived!What a fabulous surprise though! Are you all sure we are talking about the same hotel? We arrived at a very busy time when dozens of other people were booking in during The Brits also, despite this, check in was very swift and staff very courteous and helpful. Our room was 511 and was a lovely big corner room, with two lovely big windows, small lounge area and lovely bathroom, the bed was a king bed and the room was spotless and warm. No problems as previously mentioned with water etc. One thing I will comment in a negative on this hotel is that the hotel bar prices are absolutely ridiculous, £6.50 for a glass of wine and £7.50 for a vodka and coke. Breakfast is as good as any 4/5* hotel we have stayed in and the breakfast staff very efficient and helpful.Can't say anything other than good things about this hotel would definately stay again - 10 mins walk to Earls Court.	
Jan 17 2006 	Worst Hilton in the world	I am amazed that this hotel can bear the Hilton brand. My company had 20 rooms here during a recent event at Olympia and many of the rooms were disgraceful.The 8th floor has a serious problem with the plumbing (very low water pressure and no hot water when you need it). Even the staff at the desk acknowledged this as they moved me to another room, this time a room on the 4th floor where the ceiling was so low that I could not stand up in the shower! And this was supposedly a deluxe room!In some rooms the heating did not work either.The rooms in this hotel are just awful - avoid this hotel at all costs!	
Jan 3 2006 	Avoid 8th floor executive rooms	As a gold hilton honors member I was upgraded to an executive room. The first week stayed in the 7 floor and the room was OK, but in my second stay I was placed in the 8 floor where the shower ceiling was so low I couldn´t stand up in the shower (I am not tall). The fitness centre is OK (free for executive rooms).The room service is very expensive and the food its not very good. Avoid telephone use, they even charge the free calls (0800)I can´t complain of the staff but it was usual to find someone complaining at the reception desk.Location: 8.good, 10 min walk to picadilly line (tube) and bus 9 at the door to the centre in 30 min.Room: 5.enought (executive room)Breakfast: 5.Room service: 3.Overall: 4.9	
Dec 16 2005	Mixed feelings	Having paid GBP130/night for a double deluxe room I was expecting a decent room...... which although well equipped and on 8th (top) floor was rather old and dowdy. The main gripe was a complete lack of water pressure which led to miserable showers every morning and evening over my 4 day stay.The full English buffet breakfast was good, but the Plum bar very low on atmosphere and high on prices.The staff were all foreign, but helpful and friendly; and the location convenient and easy to get taxi.Over all mixed feelings .... but one feels in terms of value for money this is not one of the better hotels to stay in London.	
Dec 13 2005	Excellent!!!	We reserved a place through Price Line and after reading some of the reviews here were quite concerned. However, we must report that our stay was wonderful. HOTEL LOCATION - The hotel is not situated smack in the center (i.e. Marble Arch, Oxford St. etc). but it is located at the end of Kensington high street where there are a lot of shops (including all the leading brands) and restaurants. There is a movie theatre 400 meters from the hotel where we went to a movie one evening. Kensington tube station is 10 min. walking distance, however due to the cold we chose to buy a Travel pass which enabled us to take the bus (and tube) as many times as we wanted. The bus stop is directly outside the hotel, it takes 2 stations to the nearest tube station and we also used it to get to the city at times since there are buses every 5 minutes. We are very spoilt and I am 7 months pregnant, so when I say it was easy and comfortable, I really mean it. Just buy a Travel Pass and it will make your life easier and your stay much more enjoyable. HOTEL ROOMS - we arrived early in the morning (6:30)and our room was not ready. However, rather than tell us to busy ourselves until check-in time, the hotel gave us a different room &quot;to rest and sleep a bit&quot; and told us to come back later when our room will be ready and we can get the key. The rooms are relatively large (this is Europe! not the U.S.), clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly, helpful and we have nothing but good praise to say about them. FOOD - we did not dine at the hotel, nor did we have breakfast. Instead we enjoyed a sandwich at Pret-A-Manger or at Starbucks on Kensington High Street and dined in the restaurants in the area. We would definitely stay there again!	
Dec 12 2005	not your typical hilton	We stayed at this hotel in March 2005 on two different occassions for one night each time so this review is a little late.I will say that the staff at the hotel were great and offered their assistance whenever you asked for some. They were able to provide clear directions and were knowledgeable about the area, services and transportation.The rooms, however, were not worthy of the rating of the hotel. They were clean for the most part but very small and cramped. I have been to London before so always expect that the standards for London hotels are different than Canadian standards, however, for what you pay to stay here, there should be a higher standard.We had two single beds that were practically on top of each other and the bedding was quite sparse. Only a thin fitted sheet and one blanket on each. We faced the rear of the hotel which was very noisy from the work staff early in the mornings. While there is a lift in the hotel, you still have to go up and down many varieties of small stairs to actually get to your room from the lift and the hallways are extremely narrow so you will spend some time manouvering your luggage. Or you can ask for the assistance of a bellboy for a fee if you can find one in the lobby. The area itself is nice and appeared safe with alot of shops and restaurants nearby. Depending on what tube station you want to use there is one closer to the hotel and Earls Court approximately a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel.Overall it was okay, but I think you could get a better deal for your money elsewhere	
Dec 8 2005	a long walk to train station	i found the location to be inconvenient. The reception suggested that we walk to High St. Kensington station as the trains are more frequent instead of Olympia. The walk took more than 20 minutes. Apart from that, the hotel is functional...and basic.	
Dec 5 2005	No problems for this visitor	I didn't book this hotel through choice - reading the previous reviews would have directed me elsewhere. When Priceline told me where I would be staying I headed to tripadvisor and my heart sank.I arrived in London on Saturday and expected a three mile hike from the nearest underground station, to be met with a disinterested surly receptionist and be pointed to a dark damp broom cupboard located in the hotel basement. What I experienced was completely different. A pleasant 5 minute stroll from Kensington Olympia (trains run every 15 minutes from Earls Court) and we were in the bright modern hotel lobby. Within 5 minutes we were checked in and on our way to our room on the 5th floor. On leaving the lift lobby there were a few steps down to room level and the corridors were a bit of a maze but following the signs we found our room with no problem.With some trepidation I opened the door to be greeted with a reasonable size room with two single beds (as requested), a bathroom with bath and shower, TV and drinks tray. We're talking of your typical Travelodge/Travel Inn/Holiday Inn Express type rooms. For the people commenting on &quot;very small rooms&quot; - believe me, you've not stayed in a &quot;very small room&quot; in a London hotel.Getting out and about from the hotel is easy. Turn left out of the front of the hotel and 50 metres away is a bus stop. The number 9 or 10 will take you down to High Street Kensington station, on to Knightsbridge (Harrods / Harvey Nichs), Hyde Park Corner and further into town. Coming back the bus stop is almost opposite the hotel.There are lots of shops and restaurants nearby - you'll use them as the hotel facilities aren't cheap (but then it's a Hilton - did you expect them to be?)I'd certainly stay here again.	
Oct 23 2005	uncomfortable problems overrated	Room was hot upon arriving (in October), so we had to wait a couple of hours before it cooled off enough to sleep (we arrived at midnight). Beds had no sheets, except for the mattress sheet, and a very thick heavy hot duvet. Tried to call front desk for sheets - phone didn't work. Shower head leaked, leaving a lake on bath floor. We fixed it - why didn't housekeeping? Construction at back of hotel greeted us at 8:30 am with jackhammers - so much for sleeping in after finally falling asleep in the heat at 2 am. Other reviews said small rooms, but I didn't think that would be problematic since we weren't going to be spending a lot of time in the room. But small rooms means barely enough room to walk around the beds, not enough room for 2 suitcases. We booked thru priceline for $100/night for 2 people. Priceline said 4 star hotel - i would say 2.5. Location was OK - 10 min. walk from circle/district lines (Kensington HIgh street station), and couple of blocks from #9 bus stop, several restaurants nearby.	
Oct 8 2005	Cannnot Jusitfy the Rating	Stayed at the Olympia for one night in transit. We arrived early so the room was not ready and we had to wait; however there is no real lobby to wait in so you have to stand in front of the registration desk, walk outside or sit in the overpriced restaurant.When we finally got to the room we were surprised at how small it was considering that I am an elite member of the Hilton chain.The room also faced the railroad so we heard the train every time it passed.I am surprised that it is rated 3 stars.	
Sep 29 2005	I was satisfied	I've just returned from a trip to London and a stay at the Hilton Olympia. My room was very small, but clean and comfortable and everything worked. The air conditioning worked perfectly, but I discovered I didn't need it, as the climate in London was quite cool. While reading reviews on this board, I see that many people had problems with the bathtub being too high off the floor. My tub was a little high, but there was plenty of room at the top and taking a shower was no problem. A person well over 6 feet tall would be just fine. The continental breakfast buffet (that was included in the room price) was sufficient for me. It consisted of small chocolate muffins, blueberry muffins, toast, croissants, bread rolls, cereal, fruit (peaches and pears), juice, water, coffee, and tea. The staff was very friendly, attentive, and efficient. My only complaint is that the concierge wasn't as knowledgeable as I'd expected. There were three different gentlemen at the post and since I stayed over a week, I met them all. Two of them kept mixing up the Museum of London with the British Museum. One of them had never heard of the Museum of London. One of them thought that the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and the Albert Memorial was the same thing. None of this was a huge crisis, as I'd already done my research and pretty much knew what direction to go in, but I was a little surprised that they weren't more knowledgable about these very famous sites. (especially the V&amp; A vs. the Albert Memorial thing...one is a museum and the other is a statue! Not remotely the same thing. And they're not that far from the hotel)The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to the High Street Kensingston tube station and a 25 minute walk to Kensington Gardens. There are two Boots pharmacies nearby, as well as a Waitrose and Tesco. There is also a wide variety of restaurants in the vicinity - upscale, ethnic, sandwich shops, and fastfood. You definitely will have no trouble finding supplies or food in this area. And if you're a shopaholic, you'll love the plethora of clothing and shoes stores as well. If you want a hotel that's upscale and elegant, this definitely isn't it. But if you just want a safe, clean, reasonably priced, and pleasant hotel, this place will do just fine.	
Sep 4 2005	Undistinguished hotel but good value	I stayed here at the end of May, 2005. I found the Olympia to be a rather drab, labyrinthine, but serviceable hotel. The corridors are small and dark; the rooms are also on the small side. I was given a room with twin beds; it was rather plain and small but no real complaints. For those who like this (like me) the beds are very firm. I did not use the fitness center or the restaurant. Its a good hike from the Kensington High Street Station (a long 10 block walk of about 25 minutes and I am a brisk walker) There are better, more convenient choices but for $73 on Priceline, who am I to complain? Continental breakfast is £13, high-speed is £15 daily or it just might be free if your window faces the right direction.	
Aug 19 2005	not good-bad first impression and tiny worn rroms.	Me and my friend checked in an hour early, not expecting our rooms to be ready, which we were quite surprised when we were told both rooms were ready for us. This is the only positive point about the hotel.Whilst checking in we noticed that a few members of staff were sitting in the lobby chatting and laughing quite loudly. They were quite aware that there were other guests in the lobby area but made no attempt to move out of their seats. Not a good first impression. My room was to be quite honest: crap. It was small, old and worn. My tv was not working and the minibar was overpriced. I had a lovely view of the central building and the main power system. The room service menu seems to be the same as a lot of the hiltons I have stayed at in the uk: simple and overpriced. The staff in general were ok, they seemed pleasant and helpful. But that was it.	
Aug 12 2005	Nice hotel comfy bed	Room was very comfy. There was an electronic fridge. The beds were really comfortable. The room was very nice and modern, decor was modern as well.The thing i didn't like was that i was given a room on the 2nd floor. Upon exiting the lift, there were like 10 stairs to climb. Very small stairs which made it difficult to carry up and down and there was no one around to help.We used the bus (i think no 9) to go to piccadily circus. the bus stop is just across the road. Walk out and turn left and cross the road, you won't miss it. I suggest you to get a one day travelcard at the tube before getting the bus because there is no ticket machine at the bus stop and they don't have change on the buses.Oh, ask the concierge for a free map. There are discounts to various attractions and restaurants on that map. I highly recommend Bella Italia (restaurant) they are all around the place (20% off). The food was delicious - try the tirimisu.	
Jul 27 2005	Olympia is great	This hotel deserves its 4*s. The staff are very friendly and well trained.The food is excellent at all meals but the drinks are very expensive though!It's a long way out of London centre but Olympia station gives you tube and rail connections.Holland Park nearby is worth a visit as is the pub down the road - the flower in hand (I think). Good pub grub and beer and again friendly staff.	
May 9 2005	Great variety of rooms	Looked to me as if the hotel was three connected buildings. Thus, the comments I have concern rooms in the building in the back of the hotel along Holland Rd. For example, I read reviews indicating that the hotel doesn't have air-conditioning, but my room had air-conditioning. Judging from the windows that were open in other parts of the building, I would say that many of the rooms may not have a/c. My room was average size and comfortably furnished except there was no sitting chair. The bathroom had a tub, hand held shower that could be set into wall holder to use as regular American shower, shower curtain, dial to control water temperature in shower based on degrees centigrade, excellent towels. The beds have nice new duvets. For me the duvets are rather warm for the room temperature, so I was glad to be able to turn on the a/c at night. Many hotel chains are changing over from bed spreads to duvets, and I wish they would also put sheets on the bed as an alternative when the room is warm. The room had a minibar that automatically charged you if you removed a bottle. There was a large sign warning of this. Mini bar prices were high. The room also had a small refrigerator that could be used for your own drinks. Rooms on Holland St side of hotel were not very noisy, but front of hotel faces very busy Kensington High St., other side of hotel is half a block from rail tracks that have a modest number of trains, and many rooms face courtyard that house ventilation and other equipment and no view. I had requested a quiet room and my room was not noisy, but one night there was some unpleasant vibration from a source I couldn't identify. The sound proofing between rooms was good. If I stay there again, my concern will be getting a quiet room given the traffic on Kensington High St and the RR. I had a rate that included the full breakfast. It was great. The buffet included everything I could think of cold or hot. You could have a healthy breakfast or a high fat one, or both. no need for lunch. I liked the location because it is a good place for the Underground or the busses, and for transport to Gatwick (by rail from Olympia RR station) and Heathrow (by the Underground). However, there isn't any sight seeing in walking distance and no fancy shopping. In walking distance, there are many Iranian restaurants and groceries, wine shop, pharmacy, Asian restaurant, newsstand, pub and one coffee shop with internet. A few more blocks along Kensington High St in either direction brings other restaurants and shops. If you want to be in the heart of the action, don't stay here. I did note that persons arriving in the morning were not being checked in but were having their bags stored until check in time. If you need early availability, don't take it for granted. I have stayed at other hotels in London that regularly find a room for early arrivals. The hotel has internet station in the lobby at five British pounds per 30 minutes.	
Mar 11 2005	Nice Property (March 1-3 2005)	After having read good and bad reviews, I was happily suprised with our stay at the Hilton Olympia. Clearly found the best Hilton rate in London proper, and since I have some HHonors recognition I was upgraded before I asked. As a US business traveler, I found the differences in this property vs US Hiltons to be minimal. Sure, smaller bathrooms, a short set of stairs between the &quot;lift&quot; and my room , but I never felt I was in anything less than a Hilton property.Location is acceptable, although the taxi fare from Paddington to the hotel at 7 PM was hefty as we crawled through traffic. I thought we had the worst traffic, but I will turn the honor over to London! There is NO better way from Heathrow to downtown than the Express, by the way, easily beating out any ground transportation with its 15 minute high speed ride. The walk to Kennsington Tube station is every bit of 10 minutes, and maybe 15 is your are looking around a bit, but it was not a big issue. The bus line 9 and 10 is very convenient, about a half a block up the street, and will take you to Picadilly, Harrods and other West End locations. We built our trip around a couple of West End plays and this property is well within &quot;bus&quot; distance to the main theater areas.If you have HHonors recognition, the breakfast upgrade you might get is well worth it- Full breakfast everyday was too hard to pass up, although I could have easily gotten by less expensively in the pastry/ coffee/ cafes between the Olympia and the Kennsington Tube. Also a Whiterose grocery store right up the street where they even opened up a bottle of wine my wife bought when she did the conversion on what it costs to buy a glass of wine in the bar, close to $18 US. If I had any complaints it was that the hotel bar was so very expensive... but we only used it for a nightcap after coming back from the West End anyway. Everything else closed down during the week around 10PM, so it was a necessary evil!All in all, the Hilton Olympia was everything we needed and met our expectations.	
Nov 16 2004	Very nice hotel	Came down to see a show and really enjoyed my stay. Only fault was the continental breakfast was very basic offering a limited choice of fruit and juices plus it would have been nice to have tea served in a teapot. One last point they really do need to purchase a new toaster as the one they are using takes forever.	
Nov 10 2004	Good for the price	Hotel was good for the price, nice clean room, no view but it's the middle of London so wasn't expecting one anyway, breakfast was very good, plenty of choice and good service. Would not drink at the hotel bar unless it's on company expenses, £11 for a pint and a G&amp;T, erm, is that magic gin you are serving?!! Would stay here again if going to see a show in Hammersmith, or if on business, would not stay here if on a week long holiday and had extra money to spend on a more up-market boudoir.	
Sep 29 2004	Hmm...Don't Know Yet	My husband and I are going to London this December 2004 and we will be staying here. We are looking forward to our 1st trip to Europe (Paris &amp; London) but not sure on all the below average reviews.I got 4 nights at Priceline in late December for $70 per night (plus taxes). Not bad for a 4* or even 3* hotel when compared to Expedia/Orbitz/Travelocity that a 1 to 2* hotel will cost more than $89 per night.	
Sep 22 2004	excellent...for the price.	My wife and I stayed here from 9/17-9/20 2004. We got it through priceline at 55 GBP/night (included tax, no breakfast). I believe this was a great price for a hotel in London at this quality. I would rate the quality of the room at a three star (not a four star), but we may of recieved one of their worst rooms because of the cheap rate we were paying.Some positive remarks:1. Good location. Taking the train from Olymipia station to Gatwick airport was too simple. 15 minute walk to Kensington High Street was fine, we took the bus a few times because we had a weekend travel pass (this pass is highly recommended).2. Semi-modern rooms, not too small.3. Very clean room, except some mold in shower.4. Price was remarkable.5. Very courteous staff.Some negative remarks:1. Bed was extremely uncomfortable, and old. We had a hard time sleeping on it.2. Walls were &quot;paper thin&quot;, you could hear other rooms, and especially people in the hallway. The worst was housekeeping at 7am...slamming utility doors in the hallway every 15 minutes.3. Breakfast...do not eat breakfast in the hotel (unless it is included in your rate)! 14 GBP for a continental breakfast (cereal, bread, fruit) was the biggest rip-off I have ever experienced. We only made that mistake the first day.4. Location could be inconvenient to those that like to stay &quot;in the center&quot; of things going on.Overall, excellent hotel if you can get it under 60 GDP/night. We paid a total of 165 GBP for three nights, this is less than one nights cost for most hotels in London.	
Sep 18 2004	Good bang for the buck!	Stayed 8/21-8/23 on our first trip to London. Hotel is conveniently located within 5 min. walking distance from Olympia tube station on the District Line. Do not follow the directions on the hotel web-site to get down at High St. Kensington station - its easily a 15+ minute walk from there!! Hotel is clean. Our room did not have any view - maybe because we had made award reservation using our HHonors points. Check-in was swift. The staff is very cordial. I am 6' tall but I had not problem with the bathroom height (though one of the reviews here complains about the same). No ironing boards in room but they are brought in if you request. Newspaper was offered but not delivered both the days - we didn't care since we used to leave in the morning and come back in the night - we just needed a place to crash. Good upscale quiet location - good to relax - felt like home!	
Aug 1 2004	If I'm paying I try to stay here.	If I am on the hook to pay for a hotel in London, I try to stay at the Hilton Kensington Olympia or the St. Giles. This is because I'm cheap, and I like a clean room and a good location. If someone else is paying for my trip, my hotel of choice is the Langham.While many will complain that the Kensington Olympia tube stop of the District line has limited service, this overlooks a very important point. The Kensington Olympia stop is also serviced by British Rail with a direct connection to Gatwick Airport for only £7. Talk about a time, money, and hassle saver, Gatwick to 50 feet from the front door of your hotel in 45 minutes!High Street Kensington tube is a 15-minute walk, not bad. In addition, another option is to visit the Olympia tube station to purchase a 2-zone day pass and then turn right around and use the bus with it.The hotel is something of an Art Deco/Streamlined gem, and there have been renovations in many of the rooms in which I have stayed. The only problems are 1) like many other hotels in London and Paris, there is no air conditioning in the summer. If it is hot and humid, it can get a bit brutal; 2) If there is a convention or show at the Olympia Center or at Earl's Court, you would be best avoiding the area (although, you more than likely won't find a good rate if this is the case).For the price (often around £69 online), and if you are using Gatwick as your airport, it is an excellent hotel for the money (as long as it isn't too hot in the summer).	
Jun 11 2004	Upgraded breakfast was the only thing good.	This hotel was pre-selected as part of a 5 country Europe tour I went on. I had no choice in the matter and I would not choose this hotel if I were to visit London on my own. I would prefer a hotel that was close to a tube. There was a 24 hour grocery store named &quot;Tessco&quot; in walking distance from the hotel which was quite convenient. It is a full service store similar to a Krogers/Ralphs or Safeway/Vons. For breakfast, learning from our mistake at the Novotel Bagnolet in Paris, we went right at opening time, 7am. The hostess left her podium for a short time we were greeted by a waiter who filled in for her in the meantime. Normally, you would give your room# to the hostess and they will confirm your seating. Because we were part of a tour group, the waiter thought we were part of Trafalgar and sent us to the standard breakfast without carefully checking. Not knowing of the difference between the standard and upgraded sections of the restaurant, we were abruptly stopped by the hostess who had then returned stating that if wanted to upgrade, it would cost us 7 pounds. Not until 30 minutes later when other members of our tour arrived and saw that they were seated in the upgraded section that we went back to the hostess and told her that we should be eating where our tourmates were. (Monkey see, monkey do ;0 ) It was then that we learned that this hotel had 2 types of breakfasts. The first one is a standard breakfast which includes toast, milk, orange juice, coffee, cereal, and hard boiled eggs. The second is called an &quot;upgraded&quot; breakfast for an additional 7 pounds for those individuals who are part of a tour. I don't know how much breakfast rates are for individual bookings. This included included everything the standard breakfast had but also, hot food such as sausage, eggs, hotcakes, fresh fruit, yogurt, more beverage varieties/juices but the highlight of this breakfast were omelettes and waffles made to order. The room we had was wheelchair accessible so we had extra space in comparison to the other reviews. We could not confirm if we were in a non-smoking room or not but smoke from the other rooms permeated through the walls and vents and was quite uncomfortable for us. The shower was the highlight of the room as we heard so much about it and the other reviews are accurate about how it's not built for tall people. We even took a photo of the shower to be part of our trip album!	
May 4 2004	Disappointing	We got this hotel through Priceline, and we were pretty disappointed. The double room was tiny, very hot, and as other reviews have pointed out, there's no air conditioning. The bathroom was also very small. The room was clean though. We will not stay here again.
