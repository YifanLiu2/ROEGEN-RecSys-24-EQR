Nov 18 2009 	A Very Good Stay	October 25-29, 2009We visited London four nights the end of October 2009. This hotel was recommended by a friend, and we were not disappointed. Others have mentioned what the rooms were like. Ours was not big, but big enough. We have stayed in smaller. But staying in the room was not why we came to London.The Mitre Pub was just down the street, and an excellent place to meet locals and have a pint or food. The tube, Lancaster Station, was nearby, and centrally located to go anywhere in London. Just up Bayswater, there were many other restaurants if one wanted some variety. WE had some very good Chinese.The breakfast was good and the variety satisfactory. We could not complain. The staff was helpful whenever we had a question or asked for advice.Hyde Park which is basically across the street, was beautiful. We were there in time to see all the fall colors.There is renovation going on across the street, but this had no effect on our sleeping, and since we did not hang around the hotel during the day, we could care less what happened then or how noisy.Overall, you could not go wrong staying here. Did I say it was close to a pub?	
Nov 12 2009 	Good Hotel	My partner and I visited London for the first time ever and we wanted somewhere to stay that was in a nice location that was quite central to London's attractions and shopping. The purpose of the stay was a birthday trip and I found London to be a really really great city. The hotel is situated just off Bayswater Road and by Hyde Park and about 5 minute walk from Lancaster Gate tube station. The access to public transport was great as there is a bus stop about 2 minutes from the hotel and buses to Oxford Street and Piccadilly were very frequent. There was even a bus to and from Euston Station which we found really handy when coming home as it was a much cheaper option to get the bus then a taxi. It takes about 30 mins on the bus to Euston. Oxford street is about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, London eye is about a 20 minute bus ride. Most buses from outside the hotel go to the top attractions in London and if they don't they take you to a connecting bus stop.The hotel itself is really clean. We booked a double room for 2 nights and it cost £130 for the two of us, so try and book in advance to get the best offers. I don't think we would have paid the full price to stay though. The rooms are quite bright and spacious especially if its just somewhere to sleep and leave your luggage whilst sight seeing. The room has TV, hairdryer, kettle etc. If i had to complain about one thing it would be that it needs a little updating especially our bathroom the mirror was mouldy but hey we never travelled to London to stare into a bathroom mirror all weekend. ha.Reception were really polite considering the negative comments we read before hand. We took all our documentation to prove we had paid incase of any discrepencies between the hotel and ourselves and we did not need to as mentioned in previous reviews. The staff especially the manager were very friendly, helpful and polite. We never used any of the hotel's facilities but the restaurant and bar seemed to be very bright and clean, again with staff all very good.All in all the hotel was worth the price we paid for and the location is great. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling to London for sightseeing and shopping.	
Oct 26 2009 	So-so	Location is great. You have Lancaster Gate tube station 4 blocks away from hotel. Rooms are clean and bathroom too. Breakfast at restaurant was very average, but nothin bad. There were two problems: First in front of the hotel they are bulding a complex and it can get a little noisy, specially in the morning. Second, service is terrible. Room service is awful. And when we made our checkout they charged me (without my authorisation) with the cost of the room, even though it was already paid with orbitz. com. If you are looking for location and you don't mind for room service, this is a great place. If you are looking for a nice stay in London with quality service and spa-like facilities, go somewhere else.	
Oct 25 2009 	Go somewhere else	On checking in was asked to wait 10 minutes, no welcome to the Park Inn, the lock had broken on bathroom door so they had to reallocate. Asked to go and look at a room in the basement, very small and dark so refused and asked for another room. Eventually we were sorted. Wasn't informed about anything in the hotel, had to either ask or find out ourselves.The room had ripped lightshades and down the side of my partners bed was a brown stain, looked like an old spill, could it have been blood or beer? not a good start. Will try an post the photo. The beds look like they are very old and the mattress is very hard, very good I beleive for bad backs, or giving you one. Went for dinner on the first night only us and another couple had dinner which must say something. I had a burger and chips, on a 4* dinner menu? Not much choice and it was a new menu. Expensive too. Had a pre dinner drink in the bar, the barman didn't have the knowledge to serve us he had to call a colleague to serve us. The staff try to be very helpful but for most of them English does not come easily. A lot of the staff seem to be learning their jobs. The hotel is in a fantastic location however and we had a good weekend on the whole. Tired from being out all day we decided to have a few drinks and watch a film in our room. Films on demand didn't work, lady on reception came up about 3 times to try and help but no luck, had to go without. She however sent us up a lovely bowl of fruit as an apology which was nice. This hotel is never a 4* hotel it is nearer a 3* People in the next room were making a lot of noise both the nights we were there, knocking on each others rooms and waking us up at around 4am. Must be better hotels around for your money.	
Oct 12 2009 	Nice Hotel	It's a nice hotel, good areas at the lobby. Loved the variety of food available at breakfast !! Very very very good! Nice room areas. In the room there was several kinds of teas, and coffee (nescafe), and a machine to heat the water. The room had A/C, mini-bar, Plasma TV (with cable TV :) ), and a bathroom. The only thing i didn't like in the room, was the decoration. Most of the decoration was ripped off, vandalized ... the wall lamps, were also vandalized ... i think that could be avoided / replaced/ fixed, by the management ... Apart of the vandalized decoration in the room, it was a very pleasant stay. I'd recommend it ! PS : The breakfast was really awesome !! :D 	
Oct 12 2009 	Amazing stay	My husband and I wanted to write a review of this hotel . (just last weekend). We can't say enough good things about this hotel. The rooms were well appointed and clean. The staff were exceptionally helpful and overall we had an amazing stay! We have been visiting London for many years now and have stayed in a number of hotels and have been disappointed. But this one is a gem! We will be regular visitors to the hotel whenever we come to London.	
Oct 7 2009 	nice stay	Surprisingly good.. my stay was much better than anticipated. The room was clean and looked out onto people's flats on a quiet street. Empty fridge was provided so it was easy to buy from the grocery and store what we needed for the week. Cable tv on a flat screen was nice and the bed was comfy. Ample closet space and storage for clothes and toiletries. I would stay there again. Also, very close to bayswater and lancaster gate tube stations also a 10 minute walk to paddington station where you get in from heathrow connect and express trains. Cons: The reception staff didn't speak great english. But it was a workable situation	
Oct 7 2009 	Excellent Weekend Getaway	My partner and I stayed here last weekend. We had a wonderful stay and look forward to staying here on our next visit.	
Oct 1 2009 	Great stay - will stay again	I stayed here for three days. I must say that the staff were very helpful. I left my phone chrager at home, they lent me one for the duration of my stay. The room was very comfortable and had everything you could want. Breakfast was great and the bar is realy comfortable with freindly staff. Had a great stay and woud recommed it. will be back on my next trip to London.	
Sep 26 2009 	Clean good location helpful staff	As we were not first time travelers to europe we did not expect a large room. As a matter of fact it was much more modern than we expected, A bit worn in the bathroom, could use a new shower head, and the shampoo soap thing on the wall did run out, I had brought my own so no matter. They should think about the little soaps &amp; shampoos that most hotels provide. The staff was extremely helpful, on the day before checkout they went to a lot of time and trouble helping me gey my boarding passes printed. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.	
Aug 30 2009 	Crappy	This hotel was decidedly crappy. Here are some reasons why:Shower only worked on &quot;massage&quot; setting (think: pelted with hot hailstones)There was no clock in the room. The rooms are TINY.The receptionist was snotty and seemed to be withholding information in order to get us to book a cab through them to the airport (i.e., he didn't bother telling us there was an express train that was half the price and 1/3 the time to get to the airport). We also overheard them talking trash about some of the other customers, &quot;That [--] totally [--] me over and I knew she would...The breakfast is TERRIBLE: powdered eggs, stale bread, weak coffee, canned fruit, over-processed coldcuts, etc. etc.The internet service costs 10P/day. Or you can use the one VERY slow computer near the reception desk with a printer that doesn't work (if there isn't a line ahead of you).In short, too much money for a hotel that cuts so many corners.	
Aug 21 2009 	DON'T STAY HERE!	The Park Inn at Hyde Park was dirty, the air cond was broken, the window did not open and the room was rediculously small. The front desk attendants were extremely rude, and disinterested in our room problems. Our room was not ready when we arrived and there was no air conditioning in the lobby. Thank goodness, we were only there for one night. We had stayed at the Heathrow Park Inn previously, awaiting a morning flight, and it was delightful. Stay away from this Park Inn.	
Aug 17 2009 	Never Again politer Staff on reception	I booked this hotel as it was my Birthday and i was going to see a show, on arrival i was early but still managed to get in my room which seemed to be the only thing that was good about the hotel. My Partner had arranged flowers for me but when we arrived they hadnt been delivered and it was about 2 hours later that they came- some surprize. The hotel its self is in need of a refurb, the reception area is a sick yellow colour and even though i am aware park inn's are fun and virbrant this colour mad the walls look dirty. I was upgraded to a bussiness Friendly room but it was shabby, i wouldnt have like to see the standard rooms, my shower was sooo low you had to sit down in the bath for the water to go over your head!- Strange (601). I conpletely understand when there are new staff on and are training but the way i was spoken to by the new receptionist was unbelievable!! she was rude and not very helpful- she claimed that she was too busy to help me as she had to do other work like a very busy check out- might i add i am a receptionist and i dont find having to carry out 2 checkings in 10 minutes busy. When i called down from the room to ask for a number i was told to find it my self! slightly rude i think and uncalled for, she wasnt very helpful and to be honest neither was any of the staff part from one manager that my partner spoke to about the flowers, he said she was very sorry and helpful- sorry dont know her name. Breakfast the next day was horrible, food over cooked, cool and not much of it, it wasnt a busy morning but there wasnt much food, when i asked for a new knife as mine was dirty i was given a look of- why, theres nothing wrong with it and the girl looked like she didnt wanna do it. i witness staff cleaning tables with no cleaning products just using the previous guest napkin to wipe the table down. Overall, london is great but this hotel is a no no. staff need extra training on how to be polite and how to not seem like they are pissed off witha guest as the reception took a very i cant be brothered apporach when dealing with myself.	
Aug 4 2009 	A perfect stay	The Park Inn Hyde Park hotel is situated ideally close to Hyde Park and a walking distance from Oxford Street. Paddington Station is also near the hotel, which comes handy, if you're travelling to/from Heathrow like we were. The hotel staff was very friendly and nice. The room was quite spacious for a London hotel and very clean. There was a safe in the room, which was very useful. The hotel had a bar and a restaurant and it was also possible to order room service or breakfast in bed. We had a very pleasant stay and I would like to stay in this hotel again when next in London.	
Aug 3 2009 	Nice Hotel for Short stay	I stayed at this hotel just for the one night with my mum on a London break. Check in was slow and the room wasn't ready until after 3pm. Room itself was ok, clean and modern, they could do with new window's, this had a large crack in the pain of glass due to them being sash windows and it didn't stay open, fortunately the room did have air con.We had a drink from the small bar which I thought for a coke at £3.00 was quite pricey even for London prices. Breakfast in the morning was quite good, it was a buffett type breakfast with hot and cold food, with a range of food to suit all.I would definately use this hotel again for the price and location.	
Aug 2 2009 	Don't Expect Much	The location is great, and since we didn't spend a ton of time in the hotel, it served its purpose, despite the pungent odor of the hallway outside our room. However, we had several interactions with the staff that ensure that will we not return. The shampoo/soap dispenser in the shower was empty -- when we called our first evening in the hotel to ask for shampoo and/or soap so we could shower, we were cursorily told housekeeping would bring it in the morning and then the person on the other end hung up. I had to walk down to the front desk with wet hair (from my first unsuccessful attempt at a shower) so that one of the two people there could reach behind the desk to give me shampoo and soap. Also, we were yelled at by a member of the staff for using the only stairwell that went directly to our room but that they contended was not for guests to use. These were signs that the staff was not concerned with customer service.	
Jul 25 2009 	Decidedly average!	For the price the hotel is not bad by London standards. Location is good - minutes from Hyde Park, handy for the tube and plenty reasonably priced places to eat and drink nearby. Staff were friendly enough but didn't really tell us anything about the hotel other than the cost of breakfast which we passed on - much cheaper alternatives a few minutes walk away if your room rate doesn't already include it. Room was small and VERY basic and in need of a bit of a spruce up - personally I'd rather they spent more on that than on the plasma tv! I was staying with a male friend and had requested a twin room but the beds were together with no room to move them - we were basically in a double which was not ideal! Towels provided were very small - definitely not proper bath towels! No iron or hairdryer were provided despite both being advertised.As already mentioned there is a huge building project taking place across the road. Although this is obviously outwith the control of the hotel I feel they could have mentioned it whilst booking or even when checking in. On the first morning some work started on the site before 6am but admittedly I am a very light sleeper - this might not wake everyone! I wouldn't be surprised if the hotel was so cheap because of the building work but if you take time and shop around online you will find other similarly priced alternatives. All in all the hotel wasn't bad - if you're on a short leisure break in London like us then it's fine but I would not recommend it for business travellers or those who generally spend more time in their hotel during their stay.	
Jul 24 2009 	Fairly Good Value for London	This property is located a block off Bayswater Road and Hyde Park. It is between two Underground stations and within walking distance of Paddington.The rooms are basic and the Inn takes up three or four houses, interconnected by hallways. The breakfast is good and plentiful. The staff is cordial and you can leave your luggage with reception if you are in London the day you check out.The area is very pleasant and there are numerous restaurants of all types nearby. There are also a couple of serviced laundromats two blocks away.It is quite a conveniet place to stay.	
Jul 21 2009 	Fabulous Value very comfortable room perfect location	Very spacious room and bathroom unlike most hotels in London. Check in desk staff very friendly and efficient, breakfast in restaurant good quality. Could not fault any detail of our stay- very good value by London standards.	
Jul 20 2009	Great location decent hotel	We stayed here over the weekend of July 18th on a hen weekend. There were 16 of us in 9 rooms, and we had a good stay.Rooms are nothing to rave about. Some were yet to be renovated, with wood panelled rooms and floral decoration, while others were brightly painted, like the communal areas.Certainly a decent 3 star, not a 4, but all told, if you are in London for sightseeing and not spending time in your room then it's a good option.Close to both Bayswater High st (Queensway tube) or Lancaster Gate, both on central line. Hyde Park is across the road...Building work is taking place opposite so beware, and I imagine given the size of the project it will be ongoing for some time. That said, we were on the front of the hotel and didn't hear any noise.Also - if having a few drinks then find a local (The Swan near Lancaster Gate tube) is OK. The hotel bar is v expensive.Enjoy	
Jul 13 2009 	Poor service horrible food definitely not worth the price	Stayed in this hotel from Friday 10th July till Sunday 12th July with family. Hotel was in a decent location, at the centre of everything, and that would be the best thing to say about this establishment.Firstly, the triple room was below standard, really small for 3 adults to stay in, just enough for beds with hardly any moving space. Towels seemed to be on an on-request basis and when these were received, appeared used and unclean. The double room was no better and reaked of smoke despite being a non-smoking room.Had dinner on the first night at the hotel restaurant as this appeared the most convenient option, but turned out to be the worst. The staff were polite and helpful but service was incredibly slow to begin with. No water on the table and took an age to come. Pasta main course arrived cold and had to be requested to be reheated. Steaks did not have an accompanying sauce, unlike what was described, and we had to ask for sauce be made. Unfortunately, incredibly slow and by the time that the long-awaited sauce made it to the table, most of the dry steaks had made it along our digestive tracts. It was either that or have sauce to go with a cold piece of steak...Breakfast the next day was buffet which was decent, once again, service was the issue. When we asked the staff for the plates for the breakfast buffet, as these had run out, we were asked why we could not use the smaller side plates.And finally just to top it off, upon checking out, we were produced with a bill double the price of what was agreed on our initial booking. Upon production of the email confirmation sent by the hotel reservations team to us, the reception staff still stated that this was not an approved price, despite the previous arrangement/agreement that they had sent us in the first place. When a manager was requested to discuss this matter, there was none available as it was a Sunday and the person behind the desk was the most senior staff present to deal with this, though ineptly. We were offered to be charged the full fare and have the reservations manager call us to talk over the issue, eventhough we had informed them that we were catching a flight home within 3 hours of checking out, so it was highly unlikely that this would have been settled at all. The reception staff made us feel as if we were entirely unreasonable until another couple also checking out mentioned that they were in the same predicament. They were unfortunately charged full fare as they did not have their confirmation email with them and had no proof of that they have been offered and had reserved their room as the reduced price.All in all, aside from the location, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Jul 11 2009 	Very satisfied	We have stayed at the hotel twice, once in July 2007 and again in January 2009. The hotel was satisfying both times. Reception staff was polite and quick. A snow storm hit during the morning when we had to make our way to the aiport to go back home, and the staff were very helpful, finding weather forecasts and explaining our options when the public transportation closed down.The rooms are good - not luxurious, but they have everything you need. Breakfast is good with a lot of things to choose from. The location of the hotel is fantastic and it is very easy to navigate around the town with train, tube and busses.	
Jul 9 2009 	No air conditioning - but that might be common in London.	Very nice hotel. Polite staff. Allowed us to check in early. Staff friendlier than a pricier hotel that we stayed at earlier in the week. Clean. just needed some A/C as it was hot and muggy. Opened the window but it didn't stay open so had to use the chair to prop it open. Couldn't leave the window open while we were gone because someone could enter the room through it. So if the weather is fine then this is a great place to stay. Close to Paddington station which has the Heathrow Express to the airport.	
Jul 3 2009 	Nice and clean	Nice place to stay. Rooms were clean and price was right for what we got. Great location. Walking distance to park and Tube.	
Jun 28 2009 	Would Not Hesitate To Stay Here Again	Very nice place in a great location. Staff was super polite. A little ragged around the edges in spots buy not enough to detract from the overall charm. Room was cleaned completely EVERYDAY and no hidden fees at checkout time so I don't know what some of these other reviews were about. My wife and I were allowed to check in 2 hours early after an exhausting trip which meant a lot to the both of us. We look forward to staying here again.	
Jun 22 2009 	Good 3 star near Paddington Station.	This hotel has a great location just 2 minutes walk from Hyde Park ,and about 10 minutes to Oxford Street and Paddington Station. We stayed in the family room which was very spacious by London standards. The hotel building is a little dated and in need of a little investment but I think if your looking for a 3 star hotel around £75 - £100 then this would be a good choice. I recommend it.	
Jun 17 2009 	A great weekend break	We took a risk in booking this, as the name wasn't revealed until we received the confirmation e-mail. At the time, special rates were available for booking the 'Mystery Hotel'. It was in a perfect location for us, it didn't take us long to find and we wern't far from all the shops and sites. Check-in was smooth, room service was efficient, staff were friendly and we got a good nights sleep. Very happy with our stay.	
Jun 10 2009 	Average hotel good location	This is an average hotel with a good location. It is only 10 minutes walk from Paddington station which is 15 mins away from Heathrow with Heathrow Express. Lobby is ok. Front desk is not the most efficient, but friendly. Rooms are small but sufficient, especially bathroom is a bit squashed. I would say, if you need a basic place to stay, and if you get good rates, I would recommend this hotel.	
May 24 2009 	Enjoyable stay in a great location.	My husband and I stayed six nights at the Park Inn. We were there to see the sights of London and England, so we didn't spend much time in the room. After being worried by some of the reviews on this site, this hotel exceeded our expectations.Check-in was a breeze. Room: Our room was on the first floor. The room was very small, but I didn't exactly expect a wide open space in London. We had a double bed, which was a relief because we were worried about having two twins pushed together. The room, including the bathroom, was VERY clean and we were very pleased with all the facilities. The bed slept well and we had adequate bedding and towels. We came back during the day to rest or change clothes and found the room comfortable. The only issue we had with the room was that my husband was too tall for the shower and he had to kneel down to take a shower.Food/Bar: One night we returned quite late because we had been in Liverpool all day. We had not eaten dinner, so we ordered room service. It was a bit pricey (room service always is), but the food was good and arrived quickly. We stopped in at the bar one night and had an enjoyable drink. We had breakfast at the hotel twice while we were there. It was about what I'd expect anywhere else. Don't really understand all the comments about the food being bad. The serving staff was very nice and attentive.Location: We loved the location. It is right at the edge of Hyde Park and we enjoyed walking across the park to Knightsbridge for some hardcore shopping. It is also conveniently located to the Tube. Though the hotel advertises it's proximity to Lancaster Gate station, my husband and I actually found the walk to Queensway station quicker and more interesting.I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to London for a full sightseeing visit who doesn't expect to be in the room too much. If you are coming to London to do nothing more than lounge in the hotel room or be attended by hotel staff, maybe it's not for you.	
May 20 2009 	Fantastic location	We had 2 rooms, both were very clean, although decor was a bit dated. Staff was helpful but unobtrusive. The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms were a little small but each had a tub/shower, which worked great.The location is fabulous; we walked the few blocks from Paddington (train) and Queensway (tube) stations, and there are buses that go by every 5 minutes just one block away.Because the hotel is a block from Bayswater Road, it is extremely quiet, and felt very safe on the streets at night. The bartender was friendly, the bar clientele in the evenings was quite entertaining.We didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment there. Overall, a very good value for the price near the center of London.	
May 8 2009 	Not Serviceminded?	Stayed for 6 days, average room , just sleept thereBut they have charged me 40 GB for something, its not in the invoice, just om ny creditcardbillHave sent 2 email asking about the invoice but no respone, lousy serviceMy company will not do busines whit Park Inn Hyde Park againnot much money but I want an answer at least	
May 7 2009 	Park Inn Hyde Park	We had booked a one night stay at this hotel, ok I had booked it in January 09, but found it excellent value for money. The room was clean and so was the bathroom, room was a bit small, but really did not spend much time in it. Staff were friendly and extremely helpful, as they booked a taxi for us at 4:45, which came early! and also booked an alarm call for 4:15am which was on time. Breakfast was ok, my beans were a little on the cold side, but other than that, it was fine. If you need a budget hotel near Hyde Park, then I would recommend this, oh they did charge £6.30 for 2 teas, but we did get 2 cups each out of it.	
Apr 28 2009 	Scruffy	Had a 2-night stay here on a business trip: two nights was more than enough! Check in was fine and the public areas are reasonably well maintained. However the room was badly in need of an overhaul. The bath was chipped, the bed cover stained, the toilet roll holder missing, the bath tap broken and the room smelled of sale shower curtain. Breakfast was fine, nothing special. There's not much life in the immediate vicinity and the advertised 9 minute walk to Paddington assumes you are a brisk walker but there's a bus stop within 200m. I think it's worth spending just a few more £ to get somewhere decent.	
Apr 25 2009 	Okay one night stay	I used Radisson points to book this room so it was &quot;free&quot;. I am a gold card member this year due to extensive work travel so we were able to check into our room on arrival in London which was a godsend. We had a small twin room. It was very clean but needed some updating (worn carpet and plaster damage). We only stayed one night and the location near the tube and Paddington Station could not be beat. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. I would recommend this hotel for the location and the cleanliness if the price is right.	
Apr 17 2009 	Okay hotel if the price is right.	This is a delayed review, but I did make notes while I travelled and only now am writing them on TripAdvisor from those notes. We got a free night at this hotel with our British Airways plane tickets. Since London is so expensive, this was quite a nice perk.The hotel had a clean and colourful lobby. It was about 5 minutes walk to the Lancaster Gate tube station, which isn't bad. And the location is through quiet side streets, I never had a problem with noise. But we couldn't find a nearby supermarket or food store. When we travel we usually get some local food to stretch our budget, and this hotel didn't have anything close.The room itself was rather ragged. The lighting was showing its age. The carpet was thin and frayed and dirty-looking, and we had a room where there were big holes in the floor (circular depressions about 6 inches across and I don't know how deep) that were just carpeted over? So when we walked around our room, we had to remember where those holes were or our feet might sink into them. Why not just fill in the holes to avoid this possibly dangerous situation? An unlucky traveller might twist an ankle.The mattresses were hard, and the &quot;double&quot; bed was two twins put together. I am fine when twins are the zipper-together type, making them solidly joined, but these were not joined, so in the middle of the night I would often wake up to find the beds moving apart, and myself falling into the crack.There was no view to speak of, just some piping and a wall, but I don't mind since I just use the room to sleep and recover for more sightseeing.Our room had massive vaulted ceilings, perhaps 20 feet high. And excellent air conditioning, made the room so cold so quickly we had to turn it off.The cleaning staff did a good job, but we never got a bath mat (to avoid slipping) despite multiple requests. I've never had this problem in any hotel before.Breakfast was plentiful and included, that was a big &quot;plus&quot;. And served in a lovely large, bright and cheery (and colourful) room.Overall, this is a decent hotel if you can get a deal on it. But there must be other hotels in London that are better for the price.	
Apr 16 2009 	Great location - very small room!	We stayed for five nights. Unfortunataly the room(No. 317 - off street view) was very small but clean. Bathroom/Toilett was so small that only one person could be there. The Hotel air condition was quite loud allthough the window was closed.The location was very close to subway stations and opposite the Hyde Park. We think the value was ok. Attention: they charge you for luggage storing when you have late departure!	
Apr 4 2009	This is ok	This hotel is quite OK. Nice, reasonable clean rooms if somewhat small, a good breakfast buffet, friendly staff and situated close to public transport and of course Hyde Park. Situated on a back street makes the hotel quiet even if you have a room towards the street.	
Mar 29 2009 	Overpriced	The hotel was ok for one night but the room was tiny. We stayed in room 131, as soon as we walked in we were dissapointed with the size of the bedroom and the bed, the bed was smaller than a double.I am 5 ft 8 and couldn't stand up straight under the shower which was a bit awkward.The staff were friendly enough but the room was definitely overpriced. We paid £79.00. I would have been happy to pay £50 but no more than that.We didn't eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food.	
Mar 26 2009 	Nice Rooms but Restaurant had horrible food and poor service	I stayted at this hotel for 8 nights while in London on business. The rooms themselves were comfortable, clean and updated. The downfall of this hotel is the restaurant. I booked a &quot;business friendly&quot; room here and paid for that upgrade however the restaurant staff continuously told me my breakfast wasn't included and I had to argue this point 4 times during my stay. In addition, they ignored me and did not offer coffee after I was seated during 3 visits. The food was not very good either. Internet service in the rooms was periodically unavailable and it was very difficult to get connected and stay connected to the Wi-fi network.	
Mar 15 2009 	Great stay and location	I travelled back to London from Australia, having lived in Berskire previously for 6yrs. I was not looking for the nicer hotels eg paying 100GBP per night, and hence was looking more at the cheaper options. This hotel was fantastic for me, as the price was reasonable, and the location great. It was as the website says, about 9min walk to Paddington Rail/Tube station (Where I was doing some commuting) and 7mins from Lancaster Gate Tube, which is on the Central tube line and excellent access to the city. The room was spacious and clean. Had a great Flat screen TV, had coffee/tea facilities and a Fridge. - TIP: Go to Sainsburys at Paddington Station (Supermarket) and you can get beer/food etc and store in your fridge, if your on a budget or just to have a beer in your room :-)I didnt go to the restaurant or bar, but can say it did look pretty nice walking past it. There is a pub on either corner of the hotel (5mins walk away) that had good options for meals and atmosphere.I paid 10GBP for 24hrs internet x 2. ITs 30GBP for the week. A bit expensive, but convenient wireless in your room.I went by myself, but will prob travel back with the family next year, and would have not hesitation staying at this hotel again (Assuming the price is still good) :-)	
Mar 10 2009 	A Night to remember	I highly recomend this hotel. The room was clean and the service was great. If you are looking for a short break away from it all, this is the hotel to go too. I also have to say that the breakfast had a great selection and was very yummy!!	
Mar 9 2009 	excellent all around	The Park Inn was an excellent choice. The rooms are very clean, the location is great and the staff is fantastic. I would highly recommend it and would definitely book there again.	
Mar 3 2009 	Very basic rooms desperately in need of a facelift	I travelled with my husband from Mallorca to London the day before taking a flight to Sri Lanka and was looking for a hotel in London with two main criteria. One; that it be close to Paddington station in order to catch the Heathrow Express the following day and two; that a late check-out could be arranged as we had an evening flight. This hotel delivered on both these points. Paddington station was a five minute walk away and the hotel charged us 50 pounds for the late check out (10 pounds per hour). Nevertheless, I would not stay at the Park Inn Hyde Park again. Our room was in desperate need of repair with cracks in the walls, a very old and warn bathroom with warped wood damaged by damp and the filthiest top sheet I have ever seen in my life (badly stained although luckily the sheets appeared to be clean so I just removed the top sheet). There was even a large brown stain on the wall where an iron had been left and a large crack through the dressing table mirror, would a coat of paint and a new mirror really be difficult to arrange? If we had been staying for more than one one night I would have asked to be moved immediately. Wished I'd chosen one of the other hotels inPaddington in hindsight.	
Feb 25 2009 	Excellent value. Great staff. Highly recommend.	Just spent five nights there and we were completely satisfied. Our room was very small but since this is a renovated older hotel that was no surprise or problem. Buffet English breakfasts were fine. The staff is excellent and quick to respond. This is a very good deal for a nice room in London including a full breakfast.	
Feb 21 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Location and value	I was nicely surprised by the Park Inn Hyde Park London for the price we paid. The Bedroom was clean and comfortable for one nights stay. The location is good for access to central London and near Hyde Park for relaxing walks. There was a good choice for breakfast.	
Feb 20 2009 	Can't complain when its free	My wife and I stayed at the PIHP for 2 nights in room 514 in mid-february 09. The room was provided to us &quot;free&quot; as part of a British Airways promotion whereby if you buy 2 round trip tix from the US to London they throw in 2 nights (inc. breakfast) at one of a few London hotels. I chose this one based on its location, which turned out to be very good location indeed. The hotel is located just a couple of blocks from Lancaster Gate Tube station on a very elegant London street, although at the moment there is a large construction project underway directly across the street from the hotel. The lobby of the hotel is modern-ish but nothing special. An internet station, a bar, and a restaurant also occupy the main floor along with the reception desk. The various staff who interacted with us over the course of the 2 days all seemed very courteous and willing to help. Our room, 514, was a little underwhelming in a number of ways. While attempts had been made to make it seem fresh and modern (flat panel tv, new tile in the bathroom etc) it still seemed like it needed some work. First, it has to be said that it was a little on the small side - yes, this is London, but I was still expecting just a little more space. Second, there was a large crack running down one wall. Next, the shower didn't work properly - the shower head appeared to be broken so all the water just ran down in a single stream rather than as a shower. There was also the issue of twin beds - I had wanted a double or queen, but we got a twin (that was all they had apparently). And there were a few other little things not worth mentioning that just made the hotel feel like it needed someTLC. In terms of breakfast, it appeared that the PIHP went for quantity rather than quality - the buffet style breakfast included quite a variety of cooked items (bacon, sausages, etc), cereals, some breads, fruit etc. I can certainly say that there was probably something there for most people, however none of it was of a particularly high quality. Bottom line was that you could fill up on something.Overall, this is a difficult one to judge. Due to the hotel's location and the fact that I didn't pay for it I was willing to overlook an awful lot of things. However had I paid the going rate for this hotel I think I would have come away disappointed. My advice would be to see if there's something else in this area unless you get a really good rate on this one.	
Feb 8 2009	small but ok	The hotel is in a good area for a quick route to any part of london. We booked for my birthday with a theatre break company. The room we had was quite small and the bathroom had quite a bit of wear and tear the shower function was tempermental as it wouldnt stay on. The t.v had loads of uk stations which was good after a hectic day out. Our room was right next to a staff door which kept slamming early in the morning and through out the night which was annoying and also the fire alarm was above the bed and it was flashing above us...also annoying! We went down to breakfast and we was told we were not entitled to english breakfast even though that was what we had booked so we had to go all the way back to our room and bring our booking confirmation to reception were the receptionist told us to hurry as we will miss breakfast...even though we had spent 10 mins getting paperwork to prove to them we are allowed breakfast! also when we sat down we felt pressured to eat quick as they were packing up around us and kept looking over which is not a comfortable feeling when your trying to enjoy breakfast! It was ok but not great basically!	
Feb 2 2009 	wonderful service wonderful room very nice location	We really enjoyed our stay to this hotel ,very good service,excellent staff and of course nice rooms	
Jan 26 2009	Small Room - Not Hyde Park standard	Booked this hotel for my girlfriend and I, when going to a concert nearby. On check in was given keys to room, however, given 'twin room' instead of 'Double' as booked.Receptionist, gave a sorry looking shrug, but changed room immediately. Comfortable and clean in bedroom area, bathroom a little dated with wear and tear, overall impression a tad too small.Okay for a one night's stay in the vicinity, but not really to the standard previously experienced in the Hyde Park area of London and wouldn't recommend for a long term stay.	
Jan 12 2009 	Hotel Bad Staff Exellent!	What can I say about the hotel. Well first of all the thing that hits you first are the bright colors upon entering. The check in was pleasant and speedy, the room was nicely laid out and I was particuly pleased with the options on the television. The location is superb with attractions nearby and close tube stations however the hotel did lack a certain prsence so me and my friends did get a little board and so we spent a lot of time in the bar. Phil, the delightfull english bartender was very sociable and helpful with his knowledge of london, and his special cocktail was surprisingly fantastic. Breakfast left more to be desired with unclean tables and a poor selection, however the staff were very very helpful and polite which somewhat made up for the dissappiotment. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will certainly come again.	
Jan 5 2009	Shame about the breakfast	We stayed at the Park Inn from 27th December to 30th December 2008 and were very impressed with the location. Very handy for so many attractions - just to walk across Hyde Park was a delight. Our room, though small, was perfectly o.k. for the time we spent in it - clean, comfortable and well-serviced and the girls on Reception were very helpful and efficient. Breakfast was another matter though - the staff seemed to be over-whelmed - first day there was no juice in the machine and no milk for cereal - although, once asked, a chap did go and get some - there was also no scrambled egg and just the one toaster for the whole dining room - which took ages to work, also all the clean china was very wet - as though it had just been taken out of the dishwasher - I had to dry my cereal bowl and breakfast plate before I could use them. On the last day there were no clean tables at all and, after queuing, we ended up cleaning one ourselves and getting our own cutlery etc. - no pastries at all and no coffee was offered so we went up to our room to make one there. Such a shame as the rest of the stay was very good. Perhaps a coffee/tea machine would be sensible instead of tying up staff carrying jugs around - and a couple of toasters at either end of the room to ease queues. However, we always make the best of a situation and thoroughly enjoyed our stay and had a great meal in a pub just behind the hotel which served the most delicious meat pies with veg, good beer and very reasonable!	
Dec 16 2008 	Can't fault it!	Having looked around at a last minute deal in London, i was very wary about booking here. Upon arrival i was pleasantly surprised to find i had an excellent room. It was plenty big enough for me, and was kept to a very high standard. It makes me wonder if people who have stayed here are regular Hilton goers?!Set in a nice location just off Bayswater, it's in tghe right place for 2 tube stations and Hyde Park.On the second night i fell extremely ill, and the hotel manager was more than helpful, offering to call an ambulance, and gave me anything i needed to recover.Staff were polite and the overall impression of this hotel was very good indeed. I couldn't get the safe to work in my room, but all my valuables were still there when i came back in the evening. The bed was a bit hard, though i think it was me passing out in the bathroom and hitting my side on the toilet that didn't help!The rooms are well equipped with flat screen tv's, tea and coffee facilities and air conditioning. I would DEFINITELY stay here again.	
Dec 11 2008 	Small Rooms - Personalized Service	I was staying at the hotel with my mom and found the rooms to be very small, and the room furnishings below average. The bathroom looked bright. Though the furnishings were not attractive, what caught my attention was the personalized service offered during the stay which is very uncommon at London Hotels.On the second night of our stay I informed the hotel's General manager who was at the reception desk that I would like to cancel the buffet breakfast for the following morning since I had to check out early at 6:00 AM and anyhow since I am Indian and Vegetarian the breakfast does not meet the taste and dietary needs of my mom. The general manager took a note of this, and asked his Chef to specially prepare an Indian Vegetarian breakfast for my mother and make it available at 5:30 AM (1:30 hours before the restaurant actually opens). The manager also asked for my feedback about the hotel, what should be changed and how they can make our stay better.The hotel has a great location if you are in the area as a tourist. The bus stop for tourist sight seeing busses is very close to the hotel and tube station is also walkable. There are few convenience stores around the area.	
Dec 2 2008 	Not an enjoyable stay	I have stayed at Park Inns before and was quite looking forward to booking in. The hotel was central just off the Bayswater road between Lancaster Gate and Queensway tube stations. The staff on check in were polite and friendly and I was quickly allocated a room. There were no cups in the room and I had to ask room service to supply them.The room itself was very poor. It looked dirty and great chunks of plaster were missing from the wall. The paint under the window was bubbling, and it looked like it was damp.The bathroom had grout missing from both the floor and wall tiles which made it look very tatty. The mirror in the bathroom had lost some of its paint and had gone black with the damp. The air conditioning wouldn't work properly and I had to wedge the window open with a yellow pages.On the plus side, the television had a huge selection of channels. Breakfast in the morning was very poor and the seating allocation for me as a single traveller was on a make shift table just stuffed at the end of a wall. A woman on the table nearby told me that 2 other guests had been seated there and had asked to be moved. The hotel makes a charge for leaving luggage which seems a little money grabbing. Whilst it is only a pound a bag, it doesn't help to give a good impression of the hotel. I will not be staying there again.	
Nov 24 2008 	very strange place	i thought this hotel was a bit strange. First of all we got to our room which was very clean and nice. put the climate control on to heat the room because it was like arctic temperatures outside and the air conditioning kicked in,i had the thing set on 25 degrees! so basically it would have been nicer sleeping outside with a blanket.When i reported it to the reception the next day i was met with a attitude that dident care really,the receptionist dident offer to get someone to take a look while we were out did she show any concern that my mother whos nearly 70 may freeze to death.The breakfast,well thats another story,it looked so disgusting i dident eat it,the area where you helped yourself was dirty,there was one big spoon to be used on all the food,the scrambled eggs were green,the bacon was raw,need i go on?as for the cappucino i ordered well for £3.10 it was the worst ive ever tasted,it was black coffee with froth? very odd.Out of all the hotels i stayed in over the years this is the only one i wouldent stay in a again,yeah the rooms were clean but that was where the attraction ended,the staff dont care about you,i dident feel particularly safe there,mainly because noone ever picked up the phone on the reception desk when you ring it and the food was disgusting.So there we have it,dont stay there,for a few extra quid you can stay at the thistle round the corner which is lovely	
Nov 17 2008 	Absolute disaster (faulty towers)	This hotel from start to finish was APPAULLING!! My friend booked a Triple room for herself, myself and another lady approx 3 weeks before arriving. The cost we were told was 338pounds for a two night stay. One girl however had to cancel, leaving myself and my other friend in the room. When i phoned up to change it to a twin room,(well in advance) i was informed that the cost would STILL be 338pounds for the 2persons, I immediately cancelled the room, went online to their website and without hassle booked a TWIN room for both of us at 99pound per night (why couldnt the girl in reservations just change it for us in the first place??Anyway, that was the start. The next was during our stay. I found the hotel extremely shabby, dirty looking, old shabby carpets, chipped bedroom doors, skirting boards and so on.... When I tried to use the shower I noticed that the temperature was &quot;BOILING&quot; . Enough to scald you underneath the water, when we tried to change the knob from Hot to Cold, it stayed HOT and remained at that temperature. at that moment i had to improvise and decided to get down on my hands and niece, place my head very awkardly underneath the bath tap and proceed in washing my hair, as the bath tap seemed to have an adjustable temperature gage.The room was small. Food was extremely plain(Not enjoyble)We had our room secured by Credit card, but were told on two different occasions (during our stay) to Pay our bill. (as if we were going to do a runner without paying) Ive never come across that any where in any hotel. Uusally, on departure is fine, once you have secured your original booking with a credit card, which we had done. The First occasion was when i went down to get my key card reprogrammed as I could not enter the room. (I was told by a guest who was staying in the room across from us that it wont open because the key cards were printed upside down, when making them!!! (how ridiculous!!!) Approx 2 hours later our phone rang, from the receptionist asking us to pay our bill. I felt like a criminal, as if they thought we would leave without paying.Breakfast had a satisfying range of food, but I was eating the English Fry wondering , will i be sick after eating this? not very enjoyable (cheap sausages, rashers, wattery shrivelled up old mushrooms etc.... ) Resaturant staff were quite pleasant.At breakfast my friend asked for a bottle of Still water, it was brought to her promptly, with a glass, FULL Of LIPSTICK STAINS (absolutely disgusting), The waiter came back with a glass and it looked as if he had basically just gave the SAME GLASS a quick wipe, instead of returning a fresh clean glass to my friend. It was still dirty, so she had to refrain to drinking from the bottle!!It really was like Faulty Towers, it was by far, the worst hotel i have ever stayed in, It certainly didnt meet other park Inn standards, they should all be of the same standard in my opinion. It is definately not worth the star rating they have. And I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for an enjoyable weekend away in a nice hotel.	
Nov 13 2008 	Good location comfy bed but a bit shabby	Full disclosure: We stayed here for free having won a trip to London so I cannot compare value for money. Having said that, we enjoyed our stay at the Park Inn despite a few issues. First, be aware this is a hotel that caters to a lot of groups. That can mean busy check in/check out times. But, no noise to speak of once we were in our room. Lobby and room were both furnished pleasantly. Nice TV's and comfortable beds/linens (except bathtowels...why so scratchy!?).We didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant or have a drink at the bar as we were out and about other places but both looked nice.The staff was, mostly, helpful and accommodated us when we had a late check in. But, here are where my few complaints kick in. We had a leak in our bathroom. water was dripping from the ceiling when we checked into the room. I called to report it and to let them know we had no kettle. They brought the kettle 20 minutes later and I showed the Housekeeping lady the leak. She looked kind of blankly at me and smiled and said &quot;OK.&quot; hours later, upon returning from our day out, still leaking. Bathroom soaking wet. Another call to the front desk. &quot;OK.&quot;Morning: &quot;Hi. calling about our leak again. All our towels are wet from soaking up the water, can someone bring us new ones?&quot; &quot;Certainly Madam.&quot; half hour later towels arrive. Later that day the leak was, indeed, fixed, but it took a good 36 hours from the time of the first report.We chose not to ask to change rooms because a, it was the bathroom that was leaking and not the sleeping space b, the room was in the back, rear corner of the hotel and was therefore quite quiet and c, we were too lazy! :)The hotel is convenient to Hyde Park (lovely for a walk) and a short walk to Paddington Rail Station (convenient for Heathrow)I'd recommend it.	
Oct 21 2008	At last value for money in the West End	London is one of those places where you resign yourself to paying way over the odds for poor hotel accommodation, unless you're prepared to stay out of the way or simply get lucky. The Park Inn bucks the trend by offering good value rooms on a very exclusive street, Lancaster Gate, in an upmarket area a stonethrow's from Hyde Park.The lobby is a funky affair with lots of the typical Park Inn colour branding and the bar seemed quite lively too. Reception staff were very helpful and there was plenty of information at hand for both the tourist and business traveller. An added bonus was free broadband internet in reception, although just one terminal was available.The rooms were tiny and I'm not often fazed by mazy hotel corridors, but at times I felt like I needed a GPS system to negotiate the in theory short walk from reception to our room. With such a cramped room and bathroom, you wouldn't want to be spending a lot of time there, the view was of a yard, but at least the fixtures seemed to be reasonably new and everything worked.Best of all, apart from the price, was the location, virtually on the doorstep of Hyde Park and a very pleasant 30 minute walk through the park to the Natural History Museum and Harrods. It was a similar distance from the shops on Oxford Street, approached through the relatively quiet streets of Mayfair. The only downside is the relative lack of bars and restaurants in the area later on, don't expect to find a late night pizza or kebab after a night out in the West End. The main concentration of restaurants are Arabic ones by Queensway tube station. For English breakfast or a pint, try the Swan pub, just 5 minutes walk away facing Hyde Park.	
Oct 19 2008 	Not such a great experience	My husband and I stayed here for one night on our way home from our Greece honeymoon, and we were quite disappointed. Since we were only in London for one night, we wanted to stay in the center of London to make it convenient to see the sights, and this was really the only good point of this hotel -- it's location.Upon check-in, we were given a room with this circuitous route to get through -- down the corridor, up some stairs, down some stairs, through the exit stair and out the other end (bizarre!) -- with a non-working telephone. Since we needed the telephone to communicate with friends in London, we asked to be moved to another room, which was promptly done. We found the 2nd room that we were put into to be a little larger and layed out better than the first, so if you are unhappy with your room upon check-in, certainly ask to be moved.The biggest complaint about this hotel was that it looked shabby and we did not feel that it was clean. There was mold in the bathroom, the toilet was difficult to flush, and it just plain gave me the heeby-geevies. When we were ready to go to bed for the evening, we realized that there was no sheet between you and the duvet cover on the bed. When I called down to the front desk to inquire about this, the person told me that this is the way it is supposed to be -- gross! I was instructed to find a blanket in the closet, and when I looked at the brown shaggy thing that he was referring to, no way did I want to put that thing next to me. Not knowing if they'd washed the duvet cover after each guest left, I ended up sleeping in my clothes. Yuck!Not a great place to stay -- we were very happy to leave and probably would have left altogether had it been for more than one night. I would recommend to pay a little more and look for another hotel while in London.	
Oct 10 2008 	Worst Customer Service Ever!!	This was not my first problem encounter with this hotel - previously when I had stayed there for work we had had:1. A bar with no wine at all2. Duck and whale bath toys in the &quot;executive room&quot;???3. Terrible food4. Cancelled rooms at short notice5. Promises of upgrades due to problems the last time - the &quot;upgrade&quot; was in fact still occupied....6. A &quot;who cares&quot; attitude when being told at 10.45 pm that there was no room for me despite having booked a whole month prior.7. Dirty rooms and bathroomsI could go on and on, suffice to say the final straw was when I didn't even manage to get a room but the cost turned up on my credit card anyway - without it being swiped or anything.....I will never stay in this hotel again and I have had the company I work for remove this from the list of hotels to use as myself and my colleagues were so appalled by the standard and service!	
Oct 9 2008 	Petty-minded policy	Stayed for four nights in this hotel and have been pretty much satisfied by the level of service and the quality of the room (despite leaky 1940' windows!). The room was overpriced (like everywhere in London!) but reasonably comfortable, very clean and correctly equipped. We thus could keep a pleasant souvenir of our stay. Unfortunately this won't be the case because of a last minute incident: on the day of our departure we asked to leave our bags at the reception for a couple of hours. This has been accepted for a charge of 1£ per bag!!! We were flabbergasted! First time that we are confronted to such practice (and we travel a lot).This policy is the meanest we've seen since a long time and is very representative of a highly deficient sense of service. Shocking enough to recommend avoiding that kind of place.	
Sep 23 2008 	Great value for the location	We stayed at Park Inn with our daughter who will be studying in London for one semester, we stayed here for 3 days. The staff are very helpful. The room is a bit small compare to US hotel. Our room is a triple with one double bed and one twin bed. The bathroom is actually not that small. Quite roomy I should say. The service is great, at first we were given a room on the 3rd floor but the bath tub was clogged, they changed our room right away to the 5th floor, the bathroom is big with bathtub and shower. The location is great for the money. It is very close to the tube (Queensway and Baywater), less than 10 minutes walk.There are all kinds of restaurant on Queensway and the food is great and price is reasonable. The only thing I was surprised is that they charged one pound per piece of luggage for storage. We arrived at 11 am anf our room was ready until 1:30pm. They charged 3 pounds for our 3 suitcases. Also on the day we are checking out, they charged our credit card again for our 3-day stay which was already prepaid as we book through Orbitz. The girl at the front desk didn't know how to fix it and they have to call the manager to fix and refund our credit card. The good thing that we caught the mistake before we leave, otherwise we would have to deal with the problems when we get back to the States. So do check your bill on your check out.	
Sep 5 2008 	Great value for London	Myself and my wife were spending a Saturday in London and decided we would stay over if we could find something cheap enough.As we were eating out in the Hyde Park area we found this hotel to be a great location and at a good price. It was about £75 and the best we could find around for that price.The room was small and basic but still a good standard and exactly what we wanted. We were looking for a good deal, but were not willing to slum it out somewhere, and this was spot on. As it was the weekend there was no activity from the site opposite, but to be honest if there had been we would have been out exploring London during the day.If you are someone planning to spend time in your room then this is not for you, but if like us, you want a good quality but well priced base to explore London for a night or two, I don't think you can go wrong here.	
Aug 28 2008 	Great Value for the Price	Stayed for 5 days and loved my stay.The shops are all around and the tube is within walking distance.The night chef made a special chicken panini for me which was not in the menu and the restaurant staff are so polite.There was a good selection for breakfast.Thanks Gate1 for a memorable stay.	
Aug 24 2008 	Comfortable Stay	Just returned from a pleasant stay here.Check-in was efficient with all the information we needed given.Our room was clean and cheerful though the trouser press was hanging half off the wall. The beds were very comfortable and the bedding nice. The en-suite was quite small - difficult I imagine if you were a larger person but all was clean and working and the tioletries supplied had a pleasant smell. The air conditioning worked wonderfully well and our room's position and the soundproofing meant we slept soundly.Breakfast was a very busy affair and the staff struggled to keep up with supplies of food for the buffet and crockery/cutlery for the tables. The staff were exceptionally pleasant and obliging in quite stressful situations and did their best to fulfill requests.The breakfast food available was varied from full English to continental cheese/ham/tomato/cucumber etc,pastriesand rolls to cereals,fruit salad,prunes,yoghourt,whole fresh fruits,and cake muffins.Whole and skimmed milk were available and the usual drinks-fruit juice,teas and coffee.Something to satisfy everyone I think.Check out was as efficient as check-in and we would be very happy to stay here again.	
Aug 21 2008 	Good Hotel Good Price Few Problems	Myself, along with my family stayed at the park inn Hyde Park for 3 nights during august 2008. We booked two twin bedrooms. We had read many reviews of hotels on trip advisor, and also reviews of the park inn Hyde park and we found this one to be the best priced with best reviews, we paid £70 per room, per night, which was quite a good price, especially for central London.When we arrived at the hotel which, from the outside, wasnt quite what we were expecting; the hotel does look quite drab and could do with a lick of paint! And there was also a huge renovation going on right opposite the park inn, which meant a lot of noise, vehicles and disturbance for the people staying in the rooms at the front of the hotel; however ours was at the back, which meant we heard no noise at all, and got a very peaceful night sleep. Once we were inside the hotel we greeted with a large bright reception, with sofas, and stairs that led to the bar and dining room. We were served by a very helpful young woman, who checked us in smoothly. The lifts up to the rooms were ok, a little slow, but good. The corridors were nicely decorated, looked very nice. Upon arrival in the room we were pleasantly surprised; the rooms were bright, clean and were a good size, with ample room to move around in. One of the rooms had a double glazed window which only opened a few centimetres, but the other room had a sash window which opened right up, which was quite dangerous as there was a 6 storey drop below! The views out of the window were satisfactory, but at times one could see into someone elses room, so I would advise to keep the curtains closed when getting changed. One of the best features of the rooms was the air con. It was bliss! The powerful air con made sure the rooms were pleasantly cool, which is something you dont often find in hotel rooms in London! The beds were comfortable, and provided a good night sleep. The rooms also have a desk with chair, a table and chair and a large plasma TV which was great! The built in wardrobes were also good sizes. The décor in the room did have the odd scuff, and there was a tiny patch of damp, but this didnt matter. The bathrooms were pleasant, with a toilet, sink, and bath; with shower over. The shower had a good water pressure, but on one of the rooms, would squirt water all over the roof of the bathroom! Upon arrival I would advise to turn the towel rail off which is simply done with the flick of a switch, as with it on the bathrooms heat became unbearable! The bathroom was mostly clean, but in one room did have quite a bit of scum and dirt in the tiles. However, there was a fault with one of the rooms, which caused us quite some distress. When we were using the hair dyer one morning, the power suddenly went out, and all the sockets stopped working. Luckily this didnt affect the lights or air con. We quickly phoned reception and told them, and a woman was sent up quickly, however she didnt know what to do and told us she would get maintenance to take a look, however this didnt happen and we were left without sockets for the rest of the time. Luckily we had the other room, so we had to use to hairdryer etc in the other room. We didnt opt for breakfast, but on a evening did get some chips from the hotel bar, however the prices were quite expensive, so we didnt use the bar often.The staff were pleasant and helpful, but sometimes didnt really know what to do; but this did include the manager too! On the rare occasion we did use the bar, to get chips, the service was slow and I had to wait about 10 minutes to be served. The location of the hotel was great; it was tucked away from the main road, and was only a 5 minute walk to the tube station. There was a good selection of small shops and cafes nearby, so for the money, the hotel is a great option. However I wouldnt recommend walking to much around the area at night as it isnt very well lit in places, which can make it a bit scary. Overall we did enjoy our stay at the park inn Hyde Park, and would use the hotel again, apart from the glitch with the sockets in one of the rooms; we found the hotel great, clean and bright.	
Aug 21 2008 	Fab location	This hotel is in such a great location. My husband and I stayed here after going to Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday concert in Hyde Park, which is a 2 minute walk away. The next day was spent shopping in Oxford Str, which was also only 15 mins away.It was also very convenient for us to get to the museums in South Kensington.Overall we found the hotel to be as we expected it. Friendly staff, clean rooms, and a great buffet breakfast.We're planning another trip to London soon, and we'll definitely be staying at The Park Inn again.	
Aug 12 2008 	good for a short stay	Booked this for two nights to go to Community Shield. Rooms are a little small but ok for a short stay. They are comfortable and the air conditioning is great. Breakfast is buffet style and has everything you would want - cooked breakfast would do you for the whole day.The hotel is only 5 mins from Lancaster Gate tube which takes you on the central line right into heart of London.At the price (£79 per night for two people including breakfast booked through Superbreaks) I would definitely recommend it for a night or two.	
Aug 3 2008 	Poor bathroom small and dirty rooms	I stayed in this hotel on my business trip for 4 days.Let's start with the good sides: Air-conditioning worked perfectly. The shampoo and the shower gel smelled very nice. I had a big LCD screen TV. Tea &amp; Coffee facilities. The location is great; the neighbourhood is calm and secure, 2 minutes by foot from Hyde Park entrance, 5 minutes from the Tube (Lancaster Gate), and 10 minutes to Paddington station.Negative sides: The room I stayed in was dark and very small, the ceiling was very low and you cannot open the window. The walls were so thin that I could hear my neighbour coughing! The lamp shades were torn, curtains in dust. The bathroom is supposed to be cleaned everyday, but actually the bath tub was in exactly the same state as I had left it in the morning. The shower did not work properly, it was either too cold or too hot within 2 milimeters of moving the tap. And I could not make the shower head work, so I took a bath all the times. There is no hair-conditioner. The wardrobe doors did not open fully. The breakfast was ordinary (I've heard it was priced at 15 pounds), you can have a great apple&amp;cinnamon muffin and coffee at Lido restaurant in Hyde Park for 3 pounds, sitting next to the Serpentine, and that would make a real good breakfast!Overall, I think you can find worse hotels in London at higher prices, so if the price is right for you and you are not looking for great luxury, feel free to Park Inn!	
Jul 17 2008 	Would happily return here.	Spent just one night here. Booked a standard double but were upgraded to a business room on arrival. Not a huge room, but very comfortable with Wifi, bathrobe and slippers, tea &amp; coffee, iron and trouser press and big TV. Bed was comfortable (certainly given the price we paid; have stayed in more expensive places and had a horrible bed) . In the bathroom there was a small bath and good shower with a fixed head and also a hand shower. Water pressure was good. There is a notice to say they set the water temperature to a certain level for safety. I found the water was fine in the evening but not very hot the next morning, but that would be my only complaint. We did not have breakfast as we felt we could get it cheaper somewhere else and did not want 'The Full English'. The location is very good and close to Lancaster Gate, as other reviewers have said, but I found it is not 9 mins walk from Paddington as they say on the website. It took me at least 15 and I walk quickly! The colour scheme is certainly bright and may not be to everyone's taste, but it was all clean. The staff were helpful and friendly and we will happily stay here again.	
Jul 1 2008 	Great Value	Booked a one night stay here for a night out in London, and it was excellent value, as soon as you arrive you are mde to feel welcome.The room whilst it wasnt huge was big enough for 2 people and I agree it does look dated in some places but still managed to maintain a good standard. The bed was very comfy and the TV was a very modern with freeview.Only minor quibble was that the bath was small for one fully grown man and it is very narrow, so if your of a larger build may cause problems. Am sure there are bigger rooms if you enquire.Breakfast at £17.50pp is a bit steep and you are better off going into oxford street and eating at John Lewis or somewhere similarOverall great price and location for London	
Jun 23 2008 	Nice clean hotel	This hotel is close to Hyde Park and about 10 min walk to Oxford Street shops. There are two underground stations nearby at Queens Way and Lancaster Gate both on the Central Line.The hotel itself is away from the main road and so quiet. Reception is clean and modern. There is paid for wifi available in rooms, plus a free to use PC in the reception. The bar is bright and modern plus breakfast is buffet style English and Continental arrangement. Our average size room was pleasant and comfortable. Bed was a little hard but not bad. Pillows OK. Lareg flat screen TV in room plus pay films and movies. The room also had a good wardrobe space and a small chair and desk.The bathroom was rather small with a good shower but a very small bath but clean and tidy.All-in a nicely loctaed hotel with good facilities.I would stay here again.	
Jun 23 2008 	Pretty good all-rounder	Nothing outstanding or luxurious here, but this hotel is getting all the important things right. My room was medium-sized compared to similar hotels, had air-conditioning and a bath plus shower, it was comfortable and quiet (facing to the back) and the service was friendly and prompt. Breakfast was not included and seemed very expensive so I ate elsewhere. My only quibble is that the room was a little shabby in places - the bed was modern with white cotton sheets, but the rest seemed a bit tired. Still, not at all bad overall and I would return. Location is great. If travelling here in Summer 08, try to book a room at the back as there's major building work directly across the road out the front.	
Jun 16 2008 	great value hotel	Stayed here recently during a weekend break in London. After extensive searching online, chose this hotel based on the trip advisor reviews and I confirm it lived up to most of the reviews here.Whats good?- low price, for London- location, very handy for both queensway and lancaster gate - lots of shops and restaurants nearby- staff are very friendly and helpful- rooms are clean- multichannel digital tv in each roomWhats not so good?- rooms are small - but you only need to sleep there right?- some noisy construction going on opposite (ask for a room at the back of the hotel)- wireless broadband access available, but it is expensive	
Jun 4 2008 	Enjoyed the hotel	Stayed at the hotel over the spring bank weekend booked through show and stay which includes theatre break, rail travel and hotel. Was pleased with the standard of the hotel, changed the sheets every day, even though we were only there two nights. The breakfast was very good included, hot buffet, cold meats and cheeses, cereals, fruit, croissants as much as you want. The rooms were very clean and had blackout curtains, very pleased with the hotel would definately use them again. Not far from the westend either	
May 11 2008 	Who could ask for more - clean good location by Tube	Excellent value and location for the price. Yes, the rooms are small - as in so many other London business hotels, but most importantly, they are clean! My only suggestion is that the hotel use a better quality towel - these are little better than paper.Front desk staff was friendly and helpful with directions. While my stay included full breakfast, I did not partake,thus I can not comment on the quality of the food.Be aware there is constuction across the street from the front of the hotel (and it looks like it will last for a while - rehabbing a large building)so ask for a room in back. Mine was terrifically silent.As someone who was out all day and did not go out at night,I enjoyed the extra touch of digital TV to give me a wide range of viewing options. I would book here again without hesitation.	
Apr 26 2008 	Great Location small rooms	I spent a weekend at the Park Inn Hyde Park. It's in a perfect location, 5 min walk to a tube station and a short taxi ride to Paddington station. The room was clean and had everything you would expect from a hotel of this standard. My own complaint was that is was on the small side although no smaller than other hotel rooms I've stayed in perviously in London. If you are looking for a hotel that is in a great location and is reasonably priced then I would recommend this hotel.	
Apr 23 2008 	"pleasantly surprised"	we were very satisfied with the overall experience. We had spent two nights at the Central Park hotel and needless to say we couldn't wait for a change of scenery. We expected Park Inn to be just as bad because the two are so close but we were pleasantly surprised. The lobby is very modern and inviting. The receptionist was great and talked to us about our trip and how we were liking London. The hotel is a little hidden but close to this beautiful church and across the street from Hyde Park which was just gorgeous! The room was lovely and big and had great decor. The hotel offered internet and information about tours and trips which came and picked us up right from our hotel. We walked through Hyde Park to Buckingham palace. The hotel was close to a subway station and we took that everywhere. We were so lucky to find this place after the awful Central park!	
Apr 16 2008 	Handy location cheep and cheerful accomodation	I am inclined to agree with the other reviews on this site in respect of the Park Inn...it's location is hard to beat - 5 mins walk to Lancaster Gate tube station and 10 mins from Paddington (or £3 in a taxi).The rooms are small and the decor perhaps a little tired, but this is London after all! I ate in the restaurant on my first night and, whilst it was nothing special, it was perfectly adequate.So, whilst the Park Inn may not excel in any particular category what is does do is offer reasonably priced, well located and comfortable accomodation which can be someting of a rarity in London.I would have no hesitation in staying here again.	
Apr 11 2008 	great location.	great location. good hotel. we don't have much to compare this one to, but found the room to be quite comfortable. thinner walls but as they stuck us a bit out of the way, this was not a problem for us. we'd come back to this one for sure unless we were absolutely guaranteed something better for less money. might be hard to do in london. booked with laterooms.com, got our good price there - 89GBP	
Apr 10 2008 	Great Location	We stayed at the Park Inn for Spring Break. The breakfast was wonderful, but all full English breakfasts get a little boring after a few days. The heat in our room quit and it was very, very cold in mid-March. But the hotel was very accommodating and moved us to another room. The shower was fantastic. The room was a little basic, but the location was wonderful - very close to 3 tube stations, lots of resturants, and the park. Would certainly stay there again.	
Mar 20 2008 	Really not too bad	The first time I stayed here was during the very wet summer 2007 and everyone was miserable. I took away a poor impression, but I was being unfair. I spent two nights there - 17 and 18 March and for a pretty good rate - less than than £99 quoted elsewhere. I thought the place was good and I will be going back again. The room was comfortable and while not big - it was big enough for one. I was on business and it was important to be near the Tube at Lancaster Gate. Also I was coming in through Paddington which a 10 minute walk.Here's a tip: i thought there was nothing of note around the hotel but turning right out of the front door and right (not left as was my intention) I discovered The Leinster Arms &lt; http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub1390.html &gt; What a fantastic pub! Well it's OK as a pub but they specialise in pies - oh dear oh dear, I'd stay in the Park Inn just to be near to those pies.	
Mar 16 2008 	Small not value for money...	Overall appearance of the hotel isn't classy, were told that the Hotel was a 4* although it should not warrant that grade. The rooms were very small, looked out to a wall. One small window obstructed by the TV. The shower was ok, sink and mirror crammed in behind the wall. Ceiling in the bathroom in need of some paint, brown and mouldy in corners. I would not stay here again and if I was staying longer than one night I wouldn't have been pleased. Choose this hotel from a list on the Show-and-stay website where we had purchased a deal. OK for one night, no longer. I have to say breakfast was very good, but didnt warrant the £13.50 per head charge.	
Mar 12 2008 	Good hotel not sure about the value	The bed was comfortable, the room wasn't spacious. But it was clean and had lots of drawers and storage. The bathroom was very pristine, although they had shower curtains that let water through making the floor wet. I booked the room free through a British Airways promotion, so I'm not sure about the value. But it is in a great area, right near the beautiful Hyde Park. The Tube stop is about a 5 minute walk. Very safe and relatively quiet. Courteous staff, free internet terminal, and good breakfast were all bonuses.	
Mar 6 2008 	Adequate	Stayed on business for one night. Staff friendly and good first impressions. I stayed in a 'business friendly' room but it was quite small and nothing special and no bigger than a standard hotel room elsewhere. The only 'extra' was a bathrobe and slippers. Hotel was adequate for my short stay. Nothing to complain about really but nothing to rave about either. Walls were thin (I could hear the shower running in the next room), room was clean, breakfast was reasonable. All in all OK but don't expect more than that.	
Feb 15 2008 	It will do	It did provide a place to sleep in relative comfort. While the rooms are quite small, they were adequate.The location was excellent. Close to lots of sites and things to do. Public transportation is close by. The staff was very helpful (front desk)The restaurant left a little to be desired. They seemed a little disorganized. They tried very hard to please and should not have needed to try that hard. There were lots of apologies. The next to last night we came in for dinner and only wanted soup and a baked (jacketed) potato and they had none. That's just bad planning. We were the only customers in at that point. Pricing was good through BA compared to others around town.Overall was good but could use improvement. Inexperience seems to be the biggest area in need.	
Feb 11 2008	Not too bad!	When we arrived the staff at reception was very friendly and got us settled quickly.We booked a room with supposedly two person bed (double/queen) but ended up getting two twin (single) beds placed side by side. I did put in the request for the two person bed but they said they can not guarantee it, so fair enough. At first I was iffy about the gap between the beds, but actually it turned out great! At least if one person toss and turns while sleeping, it didn't bother the other person. We ended up getting two single comforters as well, which also worked out fine at least we didn't have to fight for the covers =) Overall the beds, pillows and comforter were quite comfortable.The shower heads are great! We love to start and finish off our day with a nice shower and I was able to do so at the Park Inn.The rooms do need some fixing up though. We found leaks and cracks here and there, but again, things like that don't really bother us because the hotel room is simply a place for us to sleep while we spend most of the day outside.The rooms are not sound proof though. The hallway outside the room is very squeaky so you can really hear someone walking down the hall. Doors slam shut with a loud bang too.We absolutely loved the breakfast buffet we had in the morning. There's lots of food selections to choose from. After all there's only so much one person can eat early in the morning so I thought it was plentiful. Staff was great too and made sure our cups were full.The hotel is located about 3 blocks from Lancaster Gate Tube and about a 20 minute walk to Oxford Street. Hyde Park is about 3-5 minutes walk. Location wise - it's great! Very close to the eateries by Bayswater Tube too.I wouldn't mind staying with Park Inn again in the future. The price is not bad for the location and we had a pretty comfortable stay.	
Feb 6 2008 	I definitely would not return!!!	As a frequent guest at numerous Rezidor hotels accross Europe I was looking forward to staying at the Park Inn as it had a good location and I expected the same standard of service that I had received at all other Rezidor hotels...this however was not the case!The hotel boasts a 'Yes I Can' policy but myself and my friends did not experience this from the moment we stepped into the hotel to the second we checked out.The staff need further training on how to deal with guests as there rude and nonchalant attitude was not acceptable. When confronted by a simple question or request it was often met by a shrug and 'I don't know'!Problems:1. On check the reception staff treated our simple request of two rooms together as a great struggle even though we called the day before to request this.2. Neither days was the breakfast order correct, there were things missing and there is only so many times you can ask for tea and coffee without getting aggravated in waiting for this.3. The hairdryers in both rooms were broken and instead of offering us a replacement or sending someone to fix it, we had to go into a completely other room just to dry our hair!4. In our room the bath had sewage coming UP the plug hole, this filled the bath and was utterly disgusting, when I confronted the front desk about this, they found another room for us but did not offer to help us move our stuff to the new room, or to check the problem in the first room, again this was evidence of their 'we don't care' attitude!5. 24 hour room service...does not exists! There is a menu in every room which clearly states that there is a 24 hour selection available, when one of our group went to order us some food she was met with rude staff at reception who told her they didn't do 24 hour room service and weren't sure why this was the case. She then showed them this menu and was told again that they didn't do it even though it was advertised! They then offered us a selction of crisps but when this finally arrived at the room, it was 3 packets of ready salted crisps which was even more of an insult!Overall, the experience was not pleasant and has left bitter feelings with all of us and none of us will return. The staff need to be trained on how to implement their Yes I Can training and also learn how to deal with simple requests. The way we were treated by staff at the reception desk, bar and room service was terrible and completely unacceptable. The hotel does not deserve it's 4 star rating, simple as!I would like to receive some response from the Park Inn regarding this to hear what they have to say but it will no doubt follow the fashion of the weekend and I will receive 'I don't know'!	
Jan 28 2008 	Problematic	We had booked 4 triple rooms for 12 guests two months in advance. 4 of our party arrived on Friday evening to be told that the rest of the party had checked into all the rooms despite the fact that we hadn't touched down in London yet! There was a second party booked under a similar name and the bookings had gotten confused and merged. As a result when the remaining 8 of us arrived we were told that there was no room and we would be put up in a nearby hotel. The 4 early arrivals had gotten the last four single rooms. We were promised dinner the following evening to make up for this inconvenience. On Saturday we had booked a table for 12 people for 8pm. At 9pm we were asked if we wanted to sit together and we were finally seated at about 9.15. At this stage we were told we could have a drink from the bar for the long wait. We all ordered our main courses only and the food eventually arrived close to 10. Having eaten very quickly the waiter presented us with a bill for the food. We explained that we had been told the meal on Saturday would be free of charge due to the inconvenience over the rooms. The manager argued that we had been told we would get a round of drinks instead. At the end of the day we argued and got the meal off the bill but the shoddy service in the hotel turned me off this place. Location was nice and rooms were small and clean. Never again.	
Jan 15 2008	perfect!	my boyfriend and I stayed at Park Inn Hyde park for 4 days, and it was perfect for us! Great location and very nice and helpful staff. A short walk from both Paddington station and Lancaster gate, where all the tubes we needed went. Quiet and lovely neighbourhood.Clean rooms and nice breakfast.Will go back next time!	
Dec 25 2007	Loved this hotel	Light and airy. Very clean overall including room. Tea and coffee in room. Fantastic breakfast buffett; everything from cereals, yoghurts, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, baked beans, french pastires, muffins, danish pastries, fruits, toast with cheeses, jams, honey and ample tea/coffee, juices. Moderately priced and very convenient for local buses.. maybe fifty yards from Hyde Park itself. I walked from Paddington station in under 15 minutes. Free internet service in the lobby were daily newspapers available.	
Oct 10 2007 	Good	Stayed for 2 nights over a weekend. Hotel was very clean and professional. Restaurant menu pricing very reasonable. Room was nice, although shower was a bit dodgy! The only downside to this hotel for me was the location. Two Tube stops away from anywhere we wanted to go.&amp; I prefer to be in the thick of it all!	
Oct 8 2007 	It's Alright...	Got a good discount so can't really complain but I must say that I wasn't too happy with the overall quality of the hotel. No room service, no late bar even for residents (???), room too small --- whatever, the location is good given it's a 5-minute walk from the tube station. Breakfast was a bit disorganised. Front Desk staff were very friendly:)	
Oct 6 2007 	great location	I booked this hotel through Travelall, who managed to get me a cheaper deal than any on the internet. the hotel was clean and friendly. Good breakfast. very friendly staff. I stayed there with my daughter and the night manager made sure we got a safe taxi for our night out in the west end. I will definitely use this hotel again. Good pubs and restaurants nearby and very handy for the Tube and for a morning walk in Hyde park.	
Sep 26 2007 	Decent place to stay for the money	I stayed here on the 12th of September till the 15th of September.The only negative comment I will make on this hotel is that it was very basic and the rooms are a little dated and could use a bit of sprucing up. My wife and I were given a room on the ground floor which, in all honesty didnt bother us much because we only used the room to sleep and wash. It was fairly dull as it was surrounded by 4 walls of the building and there were employees walking past the window all the time, which made us close the curtains for some privacy.Other than that I would have to say that the area is fantastic, it is so central and close to the main part of town, I mean it is literally across the road from hyde park, it is a 5 minute walk away from lancaster gate underground, which is on the central line. I never felt that walking after dark was risky and it was well lit and there was always loads of people around. The check inn was quick and painless as was the check out. The transport links, position of this hotel and the price give this hotel a competetive edge that any traveller to London should take advantage of and it comes highly recommended by us.	
Aug 30 2007	Very Very Good!	A great find in London! Clean, friendly and centrally located. Just a 10 minute walk from Paddington and across the road to Hyde Park. Room was clean and modern and the bathroom was at least 4 star standard. Full amenities and reception staff were outstanding at organising my room move to a non-smoking despite being full that evening.For the price (£75) a bargain in the centre of London. Would definitely recommend!	
Jul 25 2007 	A cozy most pleasant hotel	My husband and I booked a tour with Trafalgar Tours, and we asked for extra days at a hotel in London, preferably in the Hyde Park-Lancaster Gate area. The day before leaving, I phoned the hotel, and told them we would be arriving on a very early flight and asked if we could possibly get into a room as soon as we got there. They said they couldn't guarantee it, but would try. Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed and shown a room which seemed a bit small. They promptly showed us another, more adequate room., and they kindly brought luggage racks, so that we wouldn't have to get down into our luggage on the floor. We stayed five nights before our tour, and returned for another four after. We asked if we could have the same room upon our return, and the Manager, Mr. Tharwat, who was very kind, obliged. We stayed in four and five star hotels while on tour, but were glad to return to our little Park Inn. It was not the fanciest, but it was clean and everything worked. The restaurant is really the breakfast room, and they are not set up very well for dining, but everything else was perfect. Incidentally the included breakfast was wonderful with eggs cooked to order and plenty of everything. Other people might have another experence, but we were truly happy during our stay at the Park Inn Hyde Park.Marlyn and Joe, New York, NY	
Jul 19 2007 	Okay although not up to the usual Park inn Standards	This Hotel is located in between Bayswater and Lancaster Gate tube stations on the Central Line. The hotel lobby has been done up in the Park Inn colours and has been refurbished. Was allocated a room at the back of the hotel which scored plus points as this was very quiet, although If I am honest the hotel looks rather dated.Obviously Park Inn are having to refurbish the whole hotel as this was previously the Gresham, major problems are with the old rotting sash windows but the property does have double glazing and a very effective Air Conditioning system.Bathroom is in a very dated state and in need of refurbishment, I have stayed in worst, but having stayed in other Park Inn Hotels, this is a serious drop in their usual standards.The Bed was comfortable and the room had tea and coffee facilities and had a fridge in the room along with an in room safe, so plus points here.The Hotel room reminded me of the Millenium rooms at the Kings Cross Royal Scot Travelodge hotel, so if you have stayed there the rooms here are exactly the same and in the same condition.Given that the Travelodge is only £26-70 a night and the Park inn starts at £75.00 per night, I would prefer the Travelodge, but I would be interested to see the hotel post re-fit.	
Jul 10 2007 	Good value and location but have dinner out elsewhere.	We booked 4 double / Twin rooms for 3 nights 11 months in advance and paid £92 per room.We arrived slightly early and were able to gain immediate access to our rooms. The hotel lobby is smart and clean and the reception staff very helpful. Our rooms were clean and the bathrooms fine with powerful showers. None of our rooms had views. Three faced a central courtyard containing air conditioning units. However we were on the 4th floor and the noise was minimal. Room air con was very effective. None of the rooms were massive but good value for the money we paid. We ate dinner in the restaurant on the first night and it was a little disasterous. There were items missing from the menu due to a missed delivery and as a result there was no vegetables and all dishes came with chips. The wine list was not great and the food over priced for the quality.Costa Coffee in the bar afterwards was fine for the first six of the group who used all the cups. Others had to wait for the cups to be rewashed before further coffee could be served. After that a round of whiskys were served in half pint glasses due to there being no whisky tumblers. The breakfast buffet was very basic and not very inspiring. Ok if you like coissants and cheese slices.All in all a reasonable hotel for the money in terms of room spec and location for hyde park. I would stay there again but would have evening meals out. There is no hotel parking and the nearest carpark is 10 minutes walk and costs £22 for 24 hours.	
Jul 9 2007 	But me no buts. Comfortable and convenient.	My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in early June and were quite happy with it. Yes the rooms are small and worn but not necessarily by London standards. The staff are young and a bit inexperienced but were friendly and helpful. Some people consider Bayswater to be out of the way and inconvenient but it is a short walk to Lancaster Gate tube station or a bus and then a short ride to the centre of everything. Paddington Station is also close but not as close as some would have you believe (as we found out).Lots of good restaurants nearby, especially the Lebanese one around the corner.	
Jul 9 2007 	OK budget hotel	We stayed at this hotel for two nights in June 2007. Firstly, it's in a great area of London (Bayswater, on the west side of London) and is still in Zone 1. It's located between 2 tube stations, each are about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel. Paddington station is about a 15-minute walk away from the hotel.The Hotel itself is OK. The staff are not quite clued-up, but overall they're not bad. The impression I got was that this is a training hotel before the staff can move onto proper Radisson hotels. The hotel itself is older, so the fittings and furnishings are not up-to-date and may be fiddly. The walls seemed very thin since we could clearly hear our neighbours late at night. Be warned that this hotel charges a rate of 1 pound per bag for left luggage.Overall, I'd rate this hotel as OK - good if you can get it cheaply (&lt;90 pounds per night) or you want a cheap hotel in a posh end of town, but there may be better choices out there if the hotel facilities are important to you.	
Jun 27 2007 	Satisfactory.	The hotel interior and roooms were quite nice, however the window in our room would not open and the bath took hours to drain after a shower. We had a very disappointing evening meal in the restaurant. Service very slow (even though there were only two other tables dining - it was a Saturday evening) The quality of the food was not great considering the prices. I would visit again but would not pay any more than the 360 that we paid for 3 nights in a twin room.	
Jun 9 2007 	Convenient situation helpful staff. Expensive for what you get.	We arrived around 9.00 am after a long flight from South Africa and were offered immediate access to our room by a very friendly member of the resception staff. The room was tiny and the window faced the back end of the building in front and a noisy ventilation unit. The air conditioning only worked intermittently, despite reporting the fault, so the room got a bit warm as we could not open the window. Apart from this, the room was fairly quiet.The double bed was comforatable, but past its best.The situation is good - close to two tube stations and the lovely Kensington Gardens.Internet access is expensive - 5 pounds per hour. Above average lower end Hotel, but I suggest you ask to see your room first!	
Apr 18 2007 	Met our requirements	We booked this hotel as a Mystery Hotel in Hyde Park for £70/night through another website. The hotel was 5mins from nearest tube station and practically on Hyde Park.Breakfast wasn't great.....it was buffet and the hot food was a little cold.Room was clean and the shower was great. We had a room that looked onto the court yard (not very pretty!!) and therefore onto and enormous and very loud extraction fan. This was a bit annoying.The staff were very pleasant and helpful.All in all it was an adequate hotel for the price we paid and we were fairly happy.	
Mar 31 2007	Not bad at all	A little out of the city centre, but close to a Tube station. Breakfast a little basic, but clean, modern rooms, decent mattresses,friendly, and bearable pricing. Surprisingly good, especially for London, and no discredit to the SAS brand.	
Feb 19 2007 	Good location good hotel	Stayed last week for an awards ceremony at the Grosvenor House nearby.Nice bright hotel with lovely staff who humoured our large slightly boisterous group.We had a fantastic evening out and were a little the worse for wear next morning, hence I left some clothes in the room. When I rang they promptly got back to me and assured me the items would be sent back. Sure enough they arrived in the post next morning.Would recommend a stay here.	
Feb 17 2007	THERE WERE SOME ISSUES..BUT WOULD STAY AGAIN	I always do serious research on hotels prior to staying anywhere...and this time was no different. It was tthe reviews on this hotel that made me choose this hotel.I got an exceptional deal through the hotels website itself. I paid £60 / night which is unheard of in this town for this quality of hotel.Here is the low down..CHECK-IN:I arrived at 1pm (prior to check-in time @ 3pm) and they put me in a room immediately. Which after a long flight I was very happy about.THE ROOM: (The first one!)The room was VERY small. Especially the bathroom. I was staying in a single room ( one person only) The window in the room looked out onto a series of other peoples rooms..the total space of the inner courtyard ( if thats what you could call it) was about 100sqf MAX! I kept the curtains shut! The bathroom door opened outwards to the room..and this is because the door wouldnt fit inside the bathroom..it was soo small. you were almost standing in the hallway of the hotel room while brushing your teeth!Unfortunately I awoke at 4am in a sweat as the temperature rose to 32°C in the room! I think it was the heat of the room that brought out the smell of cigarette smoke ( and I ordered a non-smoking room!) additionall the bed was very uncomfortable as it was on an angle from the wall outwards.I called the reception at 4am to ask whether I had been placed in a smoking room...I was told YES. I informed the night manager of all the issues which have woke me up from a dead sleep. He replied by telling me &quot; I find it strange that you have only now realized all of these things&quot; I was in no state of mind to get into an argument at 4am..but rather asked him what he intended to do about it. he said he would be at my room in a few minutes and to start packing! So I packed up everything in sight...got out of the PJ's, and was moved to another hotel room.THE SECOND ROOM:This room was in the basement...same window view situation.The room was DOUBLE the size of the first one...with new carpets, a comfortable bed, and the bathroom was a good size with a full size tub. This was night and day from the first one..in fact you were hard pressed to believe I was even in the same hotel! Much better!THE STAFF:they were fine....I didnt like how they dealt with the 4am hotel room shift...but thats life of travelling! They were not particularily friendly..but not overly rude either. They never appologized for the state of the first room..oh well!CHECK-OUT:Nothing to note here..Just swiped the Credit Card and was on my way. No thanks or anything.THE FACTS:-Glad I paid only £60 / night as not really worth much more-If you are not happy with the room..CALL RECEPTION..It can only get better!-GREAT LOCATION as you can walk from very the very central Paddington Station.( direct from Heathrow)(which takes about 15 mins max) Very close to marble arch / oxford circus are ( 25 mins) which has some great shopping.- You have a Tube station ( Lancaster Square) which is only a few minute walk to the hotel..very convenient to get to all the sights.-I would stay again..but search around for the best deals..as I would not pay more than I didnt for the hotel.HAVE FUN!	
Feb 5 2007 	Very comfortable great location	Having read other reviews on the site, I elected to come to Park Inn Hyde park.On the whole, I was pleased as it was clean, staff were friendly, location was 10 minutes from Euston by tube, and 10 minutes from the West End by Tube.On the negative side, the room was unbelievably small, the view was awful - a building very close by - and the bathroom even smaller. Had it not been so convenient and clean, and had the price been any greater my review would have been different.3 star is about right - the lobby is professional etc etc.On the whole, yes would stay again although I think next time I might try to find somewhere else for the money with perhaps breakfast included. Great location though if you want to sit between Euston and the West End.	
Jan 28 2007 	Very nice stay	I booked my London stay through Gate 1 travel for a Thanksgiving Special. My 14 year old son joked that the space between the twin size beds were close enough that we could hold hands while laying in bed. We laughed plenty over that. Even though the room was tiny we had a view of the street yet didn't find it noisy at all. It is a really quiet neighborhood. The buffet breakfast was plentiful and the staff were very nice, especially the bartender. The walk to the tube station was not too close but not too far. I did notice that there were other hotels much closer to the tube. On two occasions, when we arrived in the evening, our key card did not work. The person at the front of the hotel accused me of not locking the door properly. However, the last people to have left our rooms would have been their cleaning staff. On that note, the cleaning staff did a great job of tidying the room every day and I left them a nice tip.	
Jan 9 2007 	Very good choice	My daughter and I recently stayed at the Park Inn Hyde Park hotel in London and had a wonderful visit. The hotel staff were very polite and the desk staff were very knowledgable and helpful and answered all of our questions. Our room was quiet and a nice size with twith twin beds, a TV with cable, an electric teakettle to make coffee or tea and a hairdryer. The bathroom was also a nice size and there was decent water pressure and we did not run out of hot water. Breakfast was buffet and was way more than adequate with hot and cold food choices.We were well located to both trains and buses and a 15 minute walk across Hyde Park to the V and A, the Science and the Natural History museums.It was good deal with British Airways and we were very happy that we had made a very good choice of hotels.	
Jan 4 2007 	GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY HOTEL	The Park Hotel is situated just 2 mins walk from Hyde Park and very close to Lancaster Gate underground station.Our bedroom was clean, spacious, and well appointed. The only minus factor was the very noisy people in the adjoining bedroom. The walls apppeared to be very thin as we could hear them very clear.Breakfast (buffet-style) tasty and plentiful. Staff pleasant and obliging.All in all a pleasant stay and a hotel to be recommended	
Oct 28 2006 	strange microwave in the cupboard	Booked two rooms through Last Minute.com, - got quite a good rate of £65 per night (breakfast not included  but MacDonalds and other restaurants near buy in Bayswater High St) Typical labyrinth style Bayswater Hotel within easy distance of tubes and buses. A taxi ride from the Hotel to Oxford St was about £6. The rooms where clean but uninspiring, a bit on the small side but good for what we paid. My wife said there was a strange microwave in the cupboard but after inspection I pointed out to her that it was a safe box !! Top marks to one of the reception staff who offered me an umbrella when I was about to wonder out in the rain. I also asked for both rooms on the back side of the Hotel and fairly close to each other which I received.Would stay again at that price.	
Oct 17 2006 	Ok if you can get it cheap!!	The Park Inn Hyde Park is in a fairly good location. It's not within walking distance of anything much except Hyde Park... But it's just a few minutes' walk to Lancaster Gate tube station and a few bus stops. So you can be in the West End / Oxford Street area within about 10-15 minutes.I managed to get a great rate (£100 per night) through a last minute booking site, and so I feel that I got value for money. But I have to say that I wouldn't be so happy if I'd paid the advertised rates.The good points: The location, the rate I paid, wi-fi internet throughout the hotel (only £10 for 24 hours or £30 for a week which is very cheap by UK hotel standards), smoking rooms available, air con, in-room safeThe bad points: Other than the safe there are only pretty basic amenities in the rooms - no tea/coffee making facilities, no minibar, no iron or ironing board, relatively few TV channels, &quot;sandwich only&quot; roomservice after 10:45pmOn balance, I'd probably stay here again... But only if I could get another good last minute deal.	
Oct 11 2006 	Hotel drastically needs improvements	We stayed at the above hotel for 2 nights in June. I'm afraid to say that I really cannot recommend this hotel which is a shame as it is very well located in London. We were given a really small room with a view of a dirty internal courtyard. The furniture in the room was very dated and the walls had obviously been given a sloppy quick whitewash, as the furniture had splashes of paint covering some parts! On both nights we were awoken by the sound of banging guest room doors in the outside corridor &amp; by the sound of our next door occupant using their bathroom - the walls were paper thin! I found the staff to be OK'ish, although it did take 2 attempts to get some water delivered to our room. After our stay I completed a questionnaire and received a reply from the General Manager. She told me that the hotel is about to be fully refurbished which may explain some of the problems.	
Sep 29 2006 	Adequate stay at Park Inn	Previously known as the Gresham Hyde Park, we booked a stay here through a promotion with British Airways. This hotel has a newer interior in an older style exterior. This hotel was decent. The room was small but sufficient for us since we only used our room to sleep. The place was clean, and the bathroom was large enough. The hotel was close to transit, and the walk was pretty short, even though the closest stop to the hotel was closed when we were there. The bed was comfortable enough but small, and the room was relatively quiet. The breakfast was delicious with a great selection of Traditional British breakfast or Continental items. Unfortunately, there are also some concerns. Our original room's temperature control broke down twice. The first incident occurred a few minutes after we checked into the room. This was fixed pretty quickly by the maintenance guy. The second incident happened at night, and unfortunately we had to wait until office hours for the temperature control to be fixed. So we requested another room and got it immediately. The night staff are very limited in what they can provide, unfortunately, since most of the hotel employees work during business hours. The view was not great, overlooking another building. There were only 2 elevators servicing the whole hotel. During our stay, one of these elevators broke down over the weekend, and could not be serviced until the weekday. So going up to the 5th floor, where our room was took 5-10 minutes on average.Overall, the stay was average. For the price we paid through British Airways, the place was decent enough. However, for the regular price, this hotel would definitely not be worth it.	
Jul 2 2006	Good place to stay	The room was small and expensive by American standards, but it had everything we needed. It was clean and well maintained. Get up early to take your shower, though, because the hotel did run out of hot water a couple of days. The nearest tube station (Queensway) was closed for construction, but the Lancaster Gate station was still within easy walking distance. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced place to stay in a convenient location.	
May 16 2006	Wish it still was the Gresham - Park Inn Management needs improvement	We have stayed at this hotel 3 times when it was the Gresham because we got a very good room rate through the airline. The first time we stayed there was when the Gresham chain took over and the breakfast service staff seemed confused and service was extremely slow. We returned in spite of the breakfast service as it is convenient to the tube, buses and Hyde Park. The service improved and we settled in.We booked this hotel again through the airline and it was the most expensive room we had on a two week trip to Europe. We were terribly disappointed. The room we were given initially was a twin room with literally no room for suitcases  we had to sit them in front of the door and stand them upright and move them between the beds when we wanted to go out. We asked for a bigger room and told we could not get one until the next morning, which was fine. They moved the luggage for us, but they moved it to a smoking room, which the desk insisted I had requested. I apologized and said I mustn't have said non-smoking loud enough, and we moved our own luggage to a new room. None of the rooms had mini bars like the rooms we had stayed in on our previous stays. The best feature of this hotel was the bath/shower facilities. They have a bathtub, a hand held shower and an overhead shower and we always look forward to this luxury. This time it was marred by the state of the tile in the bathroom. The tile and tub corners were completely covered in mold and mildew. It was disgusting. I am posting pictures of this with the review so you can decide if you want to pay for this.There are plenty of hotels in this Lancaster Gate area and we will choose another one next time. The breakfast service is again chaos and there is a long wait for seating even when there are hardly any other customers. There is also poor service at breakfast for your coffee or tea.	
May 4 2006	better off at selfridges	this hotel ruined our whole trip, from the moment we checked in it was to be a disaster.............waiting to be seen, waiting for our room, nothing was as it seemed when we booked it and it is too far from public transport......just a nightmare.	
Apr 30 2006	more 3 star than 4	hotel is a good distance to public transport. lancaster gate tube &amp; various buses on the main road. also a few tour buses do a pick up on the main road too. this hotel has had a few names but the one on the door says park inn, so maybe they will change that too.the room facilities were ok, tea service, trouser press, bathroom toiletries. it looks like they could use some new towels, ours were looking a little worn. safe in the room &amp; minibar. our stay there was satisfactory, but i would not pay the full price to stay here. i got a last minute deal which seemed reasonable. it will probably look good after all the renovations, but in terms of a few nights, it was satisfactory.	
Apr 26 2006	Gresham or Park Inn?	This would be a 3-star rating based on room service availibility, thinness of walls and room size. Also the difficulty of finding any reference to the Park Inn Hotel (which seems to have been renamed the Gresham) on the web made the purchase decision difficult. However, the room was cosy and the service and attitude of the staff on the front desk was excellent. They were extremely busy although still got us checked in as quick as possible so that we weren't late for our theatre booking and arranged for a taxi within minutes. Incidentally, the taxi ride to the West End cost £15 from the hotel. Also, the proximity to Hyde Park makes for romantic walks! And the Greek/Cypriot restaurant around the corner may not look much from the outside but the food was fantastic. We would stay again as it is very good value for what it is.	
Apr 10 2006	Good Hotel!	We stayed here for 6 nights whilst doing some sightseeing in London. Only a 10 minute walk to Lancaster Gate Tube Station.The rooms were not overly large. If we'd had a couple of suitcases we would have struggled for space. The room itself was clean, the beds were changed every day and if you're just looking for a base then this is an ideal place to stop.The walls are quite thin and you can hear people in the rooms next door if they are being noisy. The staff at the hotel were helpful and when we extended our stay they matched the price we paid with the third party we made the booking through! Would stay there again !	
Nov 30 2005	Average 3 Star	This was our 4th visit to London. We found the Park Inn satisfactory as a 3 star hotel, but it fell far below our expectations for a 4 star hotel (as compared to other 4 star London hotels). Rooms: The rooms are small, even by London's standard. We had the chance to see 4 rooms and the bedrooms averaged 10ft-by-12ft. The first floor bedrooms are pretty: cream walls, blue carpets and blue patterned draperies, soaring ceilings. The rooms have excellent lighting. There are no closets, just a large armoire in the bedroom (1 1/2 ft x 3 ft) making the room even smaller. The rooms have a wall mounted ironing board and a tea service. The bathroom was modern and clean. Our first floor room was quiet, we did not hear other guests or street noise. What was lacking: the bed linen and blankets showed signs of wear and the quality was substandard (for a 4 star or above average 3 star hotel). No place in the room to store luggage. Bathroom toiletries are minimal. No hotel directories (either written or online), no clock radios and no newspapers either in the room or lobby, no automated billing and checkout feature on the tv.There are renovated and unrenovated rooms in the hotel. We saw one of the unrenovated rooms on the 6th floor and the furnishings, carpet and draperies were worn, mismatched and depressing.In short, because of the room size and lack of amenities we did not find the room comfortable or inviting for a stay longer than a couple of nights. Staff: Desk staff are pleasant but expect delays. From Friday to Monday there was no concierge on duty - inquiries/needs were handled by the front desk reception. Note: The hotel will only cash up to 50 pound traveller cheques at a time.Dining room: Very basic continental breakfast. Staff was pleasant, but half the time we had to wait for seating and by the end of our stay we gave up waiting for coffee or service. Location: Well situated. Central tourist area with two tube stops within three blocks (Lancaster Gate, Bayswater). There is a strip of budget and moderate priced restaurants on the Queensway, 3 blocks away from the hotel. The hotel is a short bus ride (10 minutes) from Picadilly or Bond Street. In short, if you are looking for a three star hotel or a place to stay for a couple of nights the Park Inn is satisfactory.	
Nov 29 2005	Ecellent location and Hotel	Recently purchased by Rezidor SAS, it has been spruced up. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The front desk staff is very helpful and pleasant. The only noise you can hear is from the hallway, otherwise it is quiet. The continental breakfast is quite adequate, although the wait staff is a bit brusk. The shower is strong and hot and the room heater works just fine. The tube stop is a few blocks away. And just around the corner on Craven Terrace and Craven Road are several excellent restaurants...Italian, Tandoori, Chinese, sandwich shops and a good grocery store. Altogether an excellent value for the money.	
Jul 22 2005	Very good experience	We stayed at the Gresham Hyde Park (it had just changed to the Park Inn Hyde Park) for 4 nights in early July, 2005. We were very pleased. We had a special deal through British Airways Holidays, in which we purchased 4 nights but paid for only 2. We received a friendly greeting from the desk staff when we arrived in the early afternoon, and our room was immediately available to us. While the room was small by U.S. standards, it was perfectly serviceable and well-maintained, and the bathroom - including a tub and shower combination - was found and kept very clean. Water pressure and temperature were never an issue. The noise from nearby rooms reported by other reviewers on this site was not a problem for us. The room air conditioning was very efficient, but we chose instead to have the large window open, given the cool temperatures while we were there. The in-room safe was very handy for securing our passports and other valuables. Our room was on the front of the building, 3rd floor, but we did not find street noise troublesome. The continental breakfast that was included was repetitive, but perfectly tasty, generous, and varied enough to provide a good start to a full day of sight-seeing. The front desk staff were very helpful in assisting us in arranging an Evan Evans day trip, for which we were picked up at the hotel. This hotel was also convenient to the Lancaster Gate tube station.We would stay here again without hesitation.	
Jun 22 2005	A Good Spot!	I stayed at the Gresham in January 2005 for 12 days and quite frankly I think at least one of your reviewers, who was also there during January must have stayed somewhere else. granted the rooms are compact, but the quality of the furnishiings and the overall cleanliness of the hotel generally, the friendliness of the staff and the the quality of the meals I thought to be excellent. and I have no complaints. In fact I booked a dozen of my colleagues who were on a study trip for 3 weeks in London in April 2005 into the Gresham for that period, and their comments have also been most favourable, and finally I am returning to the Gresham for another 12 days with a friend in September. It is comfortable, close to all facilities, bus train etc and near to the centre of London.	
Jun 17 2005	Great hotel great location!	My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in conjunction with a BA promotion. The location is terrific! A quiet street very close to Hyde Park and 2 convenient metro stations to choose from only a few blocks away! Our room was very clean and the perfect size. Hotel staff was friendly and breakfast was good. No complaints whatsoever. I was weary of the noise level since I had read so many of the reviews on this site, but we had no problems. It was very quiet at night.	
May 27 2005	Just Adequate.	This hotel is close to Hyde Park and tube stations, but there are very few restaurants &amp; cafes around the area so you have to plan on eating elsewhere or stick to the limited choices in dining. Rooms are tiny and non-descript. Ours faced the center of the hotel -a dark and gloomy-looking view. Staff was indifferent for the most part. Overall, pretty average.	
Apr 8 2005	Paper-thin walls in a convenient location	Just to support others comments. We were on the first-floor with windows right next to the Union Jack you see displayed in the pictures of the hotel's facade. Between street noise and paper-thin walls, it not a quiet retreat. Room was smaller then other London hotels I've stayed in and the layout of the room was fairly inconvenient (no closet near the door...instead you have to negotiate past the beds and desk to get to the armoire in the far corner). Pleasent older-style furnishings in the room and comfortable bathroom but very little storage space (desk drawers were taken up with teatray and mini-bar and no drawer space in armoire).Spacious and pleasant lobby. Breakfast was adequate (but I've had better). Pleasant and relatively organized staff. Can't comment on value as we stayed here as part of a BA promotion.	
Mar 5 2005	good value	I stayed at the Gresham for 6 nights. The rooms/bathrooms are very small, but clean and well-taken care of. Nice lounge/bar/restaurant. Breakfast comes with the room, nothing fancy, but good value. Fruit, cereal, yogurt, juice, etc. Well located, near 2 tube stops, several restaurants/pubs in the area. A block from Hyde Park.	
Feb 1 2005	Location is the Key	Small room for sure but clean and perfectly acceptable for the 65 pounds I paid. In a central and safe area with 2 Central line tube stations within 5 minute walk and the Circle and District tube station no more than a couple of minutes further. If you're arriving from Heathrow off the express to Paddington, also very good as about 10 minutes on foot.If you manage to get a bargain rate then go for it, but don't pay too much - there are better places to be had for 85 pounds plus.	
Jan 11 2005	To sleep well go elsewhere	I stayed at this hotel for 7 long and mostly sleepless nights. Be prepared to be awaken by any door opening or closing on your floor, as well as unbelievably loud fan and heating system in the room. Good luck with your neighbours, as you will hear them talk, snore or play !The rooms are small and furniture is basic, very basic. Don't expect much from the little tiny TV in the room. The place was clean and the cleaning lady did a great job during our stay. No complaints there. The location is also quite decent, a short walk to the Queensway and Lancaster underground stations. You can also take the bus on Bayswater and enjoy the sights. The free breakfast was kind of sad, with watery fake orange and apple juice, tasteless pieces of bread and bad coffee. The staff at the restaurant did not seem too keen on serving coffee and cleaning tables. Be prepared to give them a hand by serving your own coffee. This is not a 4-star hotel. At most, it's an old unkept Comfort Inn. It would certainly rate as a 3-star in Spain and elsewhere...Do no pay 80+ pounds per night for that kind of place. You might as well go to the YMCA a 3-minute walk away.	
Dec 13 2004	suprised!	I stayed at the Gresham Hyde Park Hotel with my girlfriend in November. When i arrived i thought the hotel looked very nice once inside. When been checked in by a foreigh gentleman didnt find him helpful at all as he didnt quite understand alot of what i was saying. Then i arrived at the room. I thought the Room was very small, but nice . Then i went into the bathroom which was very small compared to most 4 star hotel bathrooms ive seen. apart from that the hotel was ok but i am still quite suprised the hotel is a 4 star.	
Dec 1 2004	The rack rates are not fair at all ....	The location is excellent!!! The rooms are very small and basic - I even didn't have a minibar though it is a !!4* De Luxe (as it was mentioned on lastminute)...The staff is not very helpful... A little disappointed with the hotel.	
Nov 9 2004	not getting your money's worth	We stayed at this hotel in early October. This hotel for some unknown reason gets a 4 star rating, but believe me it is not a 4 star hotel by any country's standards. Maybe 3 star: we also paid top dollar because of the exchange rate. While centrally located, the staff was unknowdgeable and worse; unhelpful. I practically had to tackle someone to get coffee in the morning and the front desk staff was down right rude. Most of the staff are &quot;guest workers&quot; so their english isn't even passable. While that might be okay for the maid service, that is NOT okay for front desk staff. This hotel seems to cater to group tours from Italy, and I noticed they all got better service and attention from the dining room staff (many of whom were also Italian). The rooms are small, carpets frayed, the bathroom was smallish, but okay. Little in the way of amenities. This hotel has the air of someone not quite able to &quot;keep up appearances&quot; any longer. If the staff were nicer could have probably overlooked some of the room issues, but I assume you can do better, esp for the 4 star price.	
Nov 1 2004	Good hotel for the $$	Through reading the reviews posted here on tripadvisor, I decided to book 2 nights here. The hotel lobby is chic &amp; nice but be warned that the rooms look nothing like it. The room is somewhat small but clean. Very old school decortation. Our first room the toliet handle wasn't working properly and we were able to switch to another room the next night without any hassle. The hotel was further than the Lancaster Gate tube stop than I hoped, about 6-7 blocks. The hotel is near the park and that's about all that's there. The staff was very helpful. This is a good place to stay but I would personally want to be closer to more of the lively parts of the city.	
Oct 22 2004	Great value for the location	The hotel is only a block from the park and close to three tube (underground) stations. Room was small, but clean and comfortable. The shower had good water pressure.The complimentary continental breakfast was pretty bad, but the coffee was good and strong. We had a room on the 4th floor and could not hear outside noise, although we could hear other people on our hall (and I'm sure they could hear us!)The workout room has fairly new cardio equipment and comes with free weights. No one ever used the workout room while I was in there.I definitely would stay here again when in London, especially at the price I paid.	
Oct 18 2004	Good base for exploring London	Stayed 2 nights in September.Booked with British Airways Holidays and got a good rate.Hotel is a short walk from underground station so it was a great base to explore London.Stayed on 5th floor in a comfortable, quiet and large (by London standards) room.Found out our phone didn't work but we didn't need it and front desk would send someone up to knock on door for wake up calls so it wasn't a problem.Continental breakfast (included) was a bit limited.	
Oct 7 2004	Pleasant stay at the Gresham	My daughter and I enjoyed a 5-day London &quot;girls&quot; vacation and the Gresham Hyde Park fit our needs perfectly. The rooms were pleasant and the breakfast was fresh and plentiful. We appreciated the convenient, quiet location after fun-filled days of sight-seeing, shopping, and theater.	
Jul 10 2004	Nice hotel near the park	We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in early July, 2004. The hotel is in a pleasant area one block back from Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens. We are joggers so it was great to be so close to the park for a morning run or walk. The Tube stop is a 10 minute walk away. This walk wasn't a problem for us but might be for some. Taxis were available across from the hotel.We had a triple room to accommodate me, my husband and our daughter - one double and one single bed. The room was comfortable and quiet. It appeared to have been redecorated within the last couple of years. Bathroom was clean and modern. There was no bathroom ventilation (seemed to be a common problem in all hotels we used during our trip).Front desk staff were pleasant. Wake up calls were reliable. Continental breakfast was the typical buffet assortment of fruits, cereals, rolls plus cheese and salami.We would use this hotel again for reasonable price (by London standards), comfort and park-area location.	
Jun 6 2004	Great Experience!!!	The location cannot be faulted - 10 mins walk along Bayswater Rd from Marble Arch Tube, and about 2 mins walk from Lancaster Gate Tube. In the other direction, it is only about 15 mins walk to Nottinghill.The rooms are small, but immaculate and the A.C. is excellent (which you will need if you go in June, July or August). The rooms were less grand than I hoped from a 4* delux hotel but considering I got a great last minute price, I have no complaints.The staff are friendly and helpful. The street is quiet yet safe. I'll definitely use this hotel next time I visit London.
