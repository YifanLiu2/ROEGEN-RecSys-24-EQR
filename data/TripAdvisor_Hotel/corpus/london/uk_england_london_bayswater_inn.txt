	Warning !!!	Reception staff where polite, but demoralised by the constant barrage of unhappy customers complaints and demanding there money back.The dining room seem to have know training at all, it was like they had all started that morning it was just chaos.The location was good local to the bus routes and underground, and a quite square.The reception area was clean but needed up dating, however once out of the reception area you where confronted by heavily stained carpets and the very poorly maintained state of the hotel.The rooms where very dated and in a poor state, with broken furniture, the door lock was broken as well as number of other things, the linen was clean however because of the general state of the room i cant say felt at home or comfortable in the rooms.The worst and most dangerous fault was on opening the draws between the beds dangling in the draws where live electrics, which where uninsulated and a real threat to life.Cant say i ever complain about anything but really you will ruin your break if you stay here, this is not a cheap hotel and it just strikes me that the owners of this hotel are taking there guests for a ride and will continue all the time they can get away with it, and clearly dont care.They have staffed the hotel with people who have probably never had a days training who they obviously dont care about either, and i think thats who i probably feel sorry for!!!!	
	was waiting for basil faulty to appear	after reading the reviews on here i thought it cant be that bad can it? have stayed in hotels that have been slated on here before. boy was i wrong. booked weekend away with friends to see a show, had booked 3 double rooms, checked in, went to rooms and found we all had twin rooms, went back to recieption to ask for doubles, after long time she came back and said hotel was fully booked so couldnt move rooms(no managers to speak to they all finish at 2.pm), hey lets not it spoil our weekend. back to rooms we go.then the list started.musty smelly rooms and towels,one of our rooms, opened bed side cabinet and live electrical wires all taped together,breakfast was a joke dirty tables had to ask waitress 4 times to clear away the dirty plates, even then some one else did it,had full english breakfast all six of us ordered at same time and they came out 1 at a time, had to wait 40 mins for last breakfast to appear.when you did get your eggs and bacon was stone cold,no knifes and forks,then joined the que at receiption to complain.i've stayed in much better hostels around the world than this place.deffo do not stay here.had rooms 219, 205 &amp; 124.have taken pictures of live wires and have forwarded then to H.S.E	
Nov 21 2009 	Good location and value/Wee rooms and Old but with character	Having read the mixed reviews and contacted somebody who gave a favourable review, we went with info and an open mind. First impression; good location,easily found following tripadvisor directions and lovely quiet area. Chap on desk helpful when we asked for a twin with a bath, instead of double with shower which was very small. In the basement but lovely and fresh and recently refurbished. Yes breakfast was rolls,butter and jam. Hot breakfast could be purchased and alll very cheap. However you can get the usually fruit,cheese, yoghurt at Tesco's on the Queensway by the Bayswater tube station. Or lovely Greek deli. The Bayswater Inn, does snacks, lunches and evening meals (never had any but super prices) and the bar is open until midnight unlike the pubs around about that shut at 11pm.Lovely and warm but might be too hot in the summer:probably need a fan. Super value for London. Just a base to see the shows and the tourist stuff.	
Nov 18 2009 	Simply somewhere reasonable to get your head down for the night - little else	I stayed here after landing at Heathrow and I simply wanted somewhere cheap to sleep to break up my journey - after reading the reviews on here I was not expecting anything special and, inkeeping with that expectation, it was ok. Nothing more nothing less. I paid £33 which I think was really good value for a central London hotel with breakfast (this was just fresh bread rolls with butter and preserves, juice, coffee, tea, but it filled the gap for me). It had the feel of a youth hostel with people standing outside smoking when I arrived and general basic facilities on offer. The tea and coffee facilities in the room were a bit of a let down with polystyrene cups and sachets of milk creamer but I really appreciate that this sort of cost-cutting is the thing that enables them to keep the cost down to their customers so cannot criticize them really. Internet access in foyer-small fee payable. The shower was very basic and old fashioned but I would stay again if I was in the same position. Overall this hotel is basic for basic needs-and that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion.	
Nov 5 2009 	It was nice	We have been there for three dayes .As a matter of fact ,this hotel is fine with respect to the low price !!	
Nov 5 2009 	Excellent value for what you pay for.Not the Hilton but not a dump.	If you want a cheap hotel stay that is close to tube station(Bayswater) 5 mins walk with no frills then this is your hotel. Stayed there for 2 nights staff were friendly but if you dont expect a lot then this is where to go. Bed for the night and breakfast the following morning. Breakfast is poor enough so be advised to buy from local Tesco. The literature you are given is photocopied (hotel info,table menus) so if your sensitive about these things then its not the place for you. Room is small and there is a TV and tea coffee making facilities. There is towels and soap for your shower. The bar is open till 11pm.	
Nov 4 2009 	Fair	Small Cozy hotel. Close to Public Transportation, affordable. Breakfast included but not too good. Clean, small size bed.	
Oct 21 2009 	Dump stay clear.	Was given a room in the basement,on the way to the room the damp smell was terrible.On entering the room the smell from the previous occupants earlier meal was still present,a small room with a window looking out onto a very small courtyard.Was given another room straight away.The next room on the top floor was bigger but the state of the room was not good(mould in bathroom,hairs in the bath,rotten windows,beds very uncomfortable)the need to itch was at times unbearable.A word of warning with future visitors if you have dentures do not bite into the bacon quickly ,as future dentists bills will be considerable,do not pay for a swim anywhere, a dive onto your plate with the amount of oil on it would suffice.PLEASE STAY CLEAR OF THIS HOTEL.	
Oct 16 2009 	What a DUMP	I was given a room on the street level even a MONK would find offensive, They changed my room after one night which was considerably better, but hotel is definitely not 3 star perhaps no star would be more appropiate.	
Oct 14 2009 	Pluses and minuses	Excellent location. Access to two tube lines, Circle and District. Access to two tube stations, Bayswater and Queensway. Nearby ethnic food, Whiteley's Shopping Centre, three groceries--Marks &amp; Spencer, plus two Tesco's, Boots Pharmacy, laundry and pubs.Downside--bring shampoo, none provided. Breakfast continental, breads and drinks. Buy fresh fruits/cheeses from grocery or order eggs/ham from hotel. Bring earplugs to dampen street noise. If need internet, go to internet cafe.	
Oct 11 2009 	Don't stay here!!!!!	Oh my goodness! Do not stay at this hotel, I've added photos to support my review. The radiator was hanging off the wall, the bath, mouldy and dirty, the windows were rotting and the beds...well...they just didn't let the terrible state of the place down!We ended up leaving as we'd booked a 'recently refurbished 3* hotel' and this really is not any of that!	
Sep 29 2009 	Good value for location basic hotel	We stayed at the hotel on a Sunday night and got a fantastic rate of £39 B&amp;B. The hotel is 5 mins walk from the station in a good neighbourhood, safe and quiet with all the bars and restaurants just around the corner. The staff were pleasant enough, thelady in the Bar was friendly, helpful and efficient and deserves a special mention. The public areas are clean and functional. Our room was small, but this is very normal for London hotels and unless you pay for suite in a 5 star hotel you aren't going to get a lot of square footage. You will need to bring shampoos, shower gel etc as the hotel only provides soap, but our bathroom was clean and no maintenance issues. Unfortunately our mattress was like a trampoline, so I didn't get the best night's sleep. But that is my only complaint. Yes, breakfast was very basic but it fills a gap and the rolls and coffee were fresh. If you want a larger room with fluffy towels, luxury bathroom amentites and 5 star service, then you need to pay for it. But if you are in London to see the sights, then don't waste it sitting in a hotel room complaining about the choice of tv channels - sit in one of the beautiful parks, see the fabulous historic sights, have a cocktail in a trendy bar, go to a free museum, take a walk along Embankment.	
Sep 28 2009 	Bayswater Inn is an "out"	Do not stay here. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was a triple. The carpet was filthy. The bathroom had black mold around the shower. The bathroom above us dripped into ours. The mattresses were so old, all three had sunk in the middle. We had to pile three duvets on each to make them even sleepable. The pillows were so flat we all had to request more. The hotel staff were rude, with the exception of some of the desk staff. The &quot;breakfast nazi&quot; that checked the breakfast cards was extremely nasty, making Seinfeld's soup nazi seem like a kitten. No card, no breakfast, room key was not good enough...which was no loss. Breakfast consisted of a cold hard roll, horrible coffee and worse orange juice. The &quot;hot chocolate&quot; was weak chocolate water. Three boringBT channels on the TV.	
Sep 26 2009 	Wonderful location!	Although Bayswater Inn is not perfect, I think generally it has gotten a bad rap. First the positives: the location is really great. It's in a residential neighborhood near to two tube stations and several bus stops and some good (not gourmet, but good) restaurants nearby. We also found the staff to be very congenial and helpful. Although the hotel was old and our room was small, our bathroom fixtures appeared to be near new and our sheets were crisp white cotton--my persofnal favorite. OK, some negatives: The hotel in general was &quot;tired.&quot; The lobby furniture in particular could use replacing. Like others, I didn't like the paper bathmat. The computers in the lobby were out of order about half the time, so don't count of them. The continental breakfast was plentiful and always well stocked when we were there. However, it was pretty much white bread, although we found they were happy to make toast for us--again, white, but always came hot. But there was always plenty of good hot coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and orange juice. For a small additional price we could get eggs, bacon, and/or sausage. The eggs came in twos, so we occasionally split an order. The breakfast would benefit by the addition of some whole grains, fruit and yogurt, and when we couldn't stand it any longer, we would go out for just that. It wasn't perfect, but we weren't really hanging around a lot. It was fine, although I'm not sure whether or not I would recommend it to a friend--depends on the friend.	
Aug 30 2009 	find another place...pay a little more	too bare bones....dirty carpet...tiny room... one bbc tv channel...poor reception....wierd shower....continental brkfst was a basketful of hamburger/sub sandwich rolls with no tongs to choose (everyone used their hands to dig around to make choices)....yuk. Instant coffee and oj.	
Aug 4 2009	That can't be a 3* hotel	On the internet the hotel looks very good and also the woman on the phone was very helpful and answered all my questions. The location of the hotel is very good for a city trip. It's just a few minutes walk to the tube. I booked a special offer rate which was not too bad for a London city hotel, but for the price we would have expected more. Our rooms (we had two) were in the basement. Very dark and not very friendly looking. The bathroom urgently needs refurbishing, it seem that it can't get totally clean anymore. The temperature of the shower seemed to be connected to the force of the water coming out, so showering without washing your hair wasn't possible because warm water ment a flood coming down the showerhead. The breakfast was ridiculous. We had continental breakfast included. What it was: a breadroll, butter and jam. Nothing else. And the coffee and hot chocolate were both not good. We were very disappointed and after the first night we didn't really want to go back there...	
Aug 2 2009 	dont do it	we booked a cheap theatre deal and got this hotel , read reviews after booking and thought cant be that bad oh yes it can , got basement room , smelt of dampness , constant door banging , smells of kithchen ,complained and got moved to fourth floor room much better but still not more than one starbrekafast dont bother bread rolls, and coffee fo to bella italia at 9am beuatiful breakfast for a fiver	
Jul 26 2009 	Floods and Famines in London	We were a family of four - my parents, myself and my sister. We were assigned a room in basement. The shower floods. The room was boiling - opening the window doesn't help as it is a basement room and all you see is a wall when you open the window. At breakfast it's easily a scene you witness on news report about famine - although with better dressed and healthier looking individuals - hoards of people swarm towards the few bread baskets with bread. If you are lucky you arrive at the breakfast room when they had just refilled the bread baskets and you find bread there. If you don't, you mill around the bread baskets until they refill them, which could be 5 minutes upwards. d After you'd found your bread you repeat the same procedures with orange juices / coffee / tea / hot choc. The breakfast fills you up... by getting you feeling fed up for having to fight for food you had paid for.We had stayed in one star hotels in Paris with better services. Enough said.	
Jul 25 2009 	Basic - OK	Good location near Circle &amp; District tube lines for access to many London sites. Room basic but OK. Continental breakfast lots of bread and rolls, with even more bread and rolls. No cold meats or fruit. Had room on first floor. Guests can leave luggage in luggage room prior to checkin and after checkout. Still had a good time in London.	
Jul 17 2009 	Location is the only plus	This hotel is unacceptable by most standards. Motel 6 is luxurious compared to this place. Its only benefit is its location. Accommodations are very basic ( a paper mat in the bathroom???), the &quot;continental breakfast&quot; consists of bread and jam. There was no AC and we unfortunately got to London during a heat wave. At least they offered us a fan. The staff does not seem interested in addressing the issues. The price is too high for what is offered. Accross the street my friends stayed at a much better room.	
Jul 16 2009 	Not a good place to stay.	A room about the size of a prison cell, below ground, during a heatwave, no a/c, and told by reception to keep the window closed because of security concerns. Woken numerous times during the night due to the constant slamming of doors. Glad to leave. Will never stay there again.	
Jul 15 2009 	Cheap and basic average hotel	I stayed at the 2nd floor, and the room was generally clean and basic. The warm water tap of the shower was defect. Breakfast was sober but ok; Brown or white bread rolls, jam, coffee, tea or chocolate milk, orange juice. The location is just great! Bayswater is certainly the best location in London to stay, and it is also near to 2 subway stations and shopping malls. Staff was generally helpful and kind, but they seemed somewhat distant. It's an old hotel, so the rooms and corridors are small. This is a good hotel if you need a cheap hotel in the city centre, only to sleep at night. There is a 24h desk and it feels secure. This is not a good hotel for elderly or disabled people, or those who like to enjoy some luxury. For younger or not very demanding guests, it is perfect. You get what you pay for.	
Jul 14 2009 	Stay anywhere but here	When we arrived at Bayswater Inn, we were given a room in the basement that was hard to find with a very small window. The room was extremely warm and had no air movement. The toilet handle squirted water when it was flushed and took about 10 minutes to refill. The hardware on the sink spun around when you turned on the water. When we compained to the manager, we were told that was all that it was not their best room but that was all they had available. When we asked them to discount the room, they miraculously came up with another room - in the basement with a toilet that still took 10 minutes to fill. We were told that that's how the plumbling worked there and there was nothing that could be done.We told them that we would be going elsewhere since their plumbing did not work properly and there was no air movement. In the mean time, we were told that the upstairs rooms had airconditioning . Interestingly, they came up with another room upstairs that was much larger and the toilet worked. However, there was no airconditioning as they had said and it had a funnel shaped cloud of swarming insects over the middle bed that we could not shoo out of the window. They refused to refund our money. Keep in mind that I had two daughers with me that had backpacked around Europe and stayed in hostels for 2 weeks before coming here and that this was the worst place that they had been. Plus one of them is in Peace Corps in a third world country and is used to less than adequate accomodations and she thought that is was unacceptable. We went down the street to a cheaper hotel with working toilets and a better breakfast.	
Jul 6 2009 	Thought it was very good	After reading recent reviews we were concerned to be staying at the hotel. We were pleasantly surprised. Our room was nice with all we needed and as breakfast is only a complimentary breakfast we helped ourselves to rolls and jam and the waitress brought me 4 slices of toast when I asked for some. For £20 everything was very adequate and we could have paid a bit more for a bigger breakfast if we wanted. Altogether a very reasonable place to stay in London with pleasant staff.	
Jun 24 2009 	Will Come Back Again	Breakfast is ok as I am no bread lover. Room / Bathroom / Corridor are clean. Bathroom got hot water and water pressure is adequate. Towel clean, hair blower (dryer) available and to our surprise, they even have kettle. 5 min from Bayswater Station, 10 from the Hyde Park / Queensway, 15 from Paddington. Good Location.	
Jun 9 2009 	Not nearly as bad as the bad reviews describe it.	A friend and I booked this hotel as part of a package, and having read the reviews here on Tripadvisor, we were expecting the worst. However, we were pleasantly surprised. Our room and bathroom was clean and perfectly acceptable with absolutely no sign of the mold in the bathrooms and carpets that others have experienced. We had a room on the 4th floor (3rd floor G.B.) which had a lovely view of a church. The room was quiet, except for the other people staying in the hotel who allowed their doors to slam shut whenever they came and went. The location was great, it was in a quiet neighborhood and yet a 5 min. walk from all the wonderful restaurants and cafes of Bayswater and the Bayswater tube stop. I could see how a basement room here could be abyssmal as we had to store our luggage in a tiny room across from the basement rooms... There was not much to the breakfast--tea, coffee, juice, rolls and jam but I was able to supplement with scrambled eggs for 2 pounds. The staff was on a good day, helpful and cheerful, and on a bad day, just ho hum. I wish there had been a refrigerator and AC in the room, but overall, it was perfectly fine place to stay and a good value for the money.	
Jun 8 2009	It's not a 3 star hotel like they say it is	I got back from London yesterday and I had to write a review here already. My experience wasn't as bad as the other reviews I've read. I stayed in Room 19 with family so we had 3 single beds. Our window looked out to a wall. If I was told I was staying at a Hostel, I wouldn't have been disappointed. However, I was told this was a 3 star hotel, so I EXPECT 3 star hotel amenities. I have no idea how a hotel like the Bayswater Inn can be classified as a 3 star hotel because I've stayed in many 3 star hotels in my lifetime, and Bayswater Inn is THE WORST 3 STAR hotel I've ever stayed in.To review this hotel as a HOSTEL, I had no issues. This HOSTEL is everything I would've expected.To review this hotel as a 3 star Hotel, I have many issues. First of all, what the heck was on the beds? Some kind of plastic cover? The TV remote barely worked. The bath mat was a piece of paper with foot prints on it. There were no hand towels, just regular bath towels. The room was so small with the 3 suitcases we barely had enough room to walk around without pretending we're in an obstacle course.On top of that, there was no AC. Luckily it was cold the 3 nights we were there so AC wasn't required. As for the breakfast, I thought you at least get free eggs in a contintental breakfast. This is the only continental breakfast I've ever had where all they served were Buns, Orange Juice, Water, Jam and Butter. Everything else you had to pay for. Seriously, who did they pay off to get a 3 star rating, the nicest part of the whole complex was the freaken Lobby, the rest of the hotel was a dump. There is no way this is a 3 star hotel, NOT EVEN CLOSE. I stayed in a 3 star hotel just a week before in Dubai that after staying in Bayswater, the 3 star hotel in Dubai felt like a 5 star hotel.Absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT stay in this hotel if you expect 3 star service/amenites because you will be thoroughly disappointed and feel ripped off. If you expect Hostel atmosphere/amenities/service, by all means stay here. It's central to many areas and it's cozy enough that you get what you need out of a hostel, and that's to SLEEP and SHOWER.	
Jun 8 2009 	nice staff shame about the polystrene cups	i booked with a travel agent ,cost 150 pound per night for a room 2 adults ,A 4 year old and one baby ,corridors smealt musty ,bathroom had papper bath mat and no safety rails in bath ,bathroomed cleaned daily but didnt get fresh towels daily as stayed 5 days ,sheets not changed daily but beds made daily .carpet wasnt hovered daily .but the thing that upset me the most was the tea and coffee faclitites ,cheap and no real cups polysterene ones .that leked when you but hot water in . had to buy my own whilst staying. on a good note nice area and reception satff were lovely .the staff make the hotel .	
May 8 2009	The breakfast was a big joke!	Me and my mom spent 6 nights at this hotel. When we booked at the travel agency in Sweden we asked not to get a room on the lower ground (souterrain), if possible. Unfortunately, when we arrived, it still turned out to be such a room. At first we couldn't find the room, so we had to ask the staff. It appeared that the room was situated in a corridor with a sign that said &quot;Staff only&quot;. No wonder we couldn't find it! The room was very small and very hot. You could hardly move yourself in there. On top of the mattress there was some kind of plastic cover. That made it rustle and in the morning you woke up totally sweaty. The bath mat was a small piece of paper to no avail. There were no handtowels, only bodytowels. One day when we had become clean towels, there were brown stains on one of them! Disgusting! If they couldn't remove the stains in the laundry, why give them to the guests? There was also a very disturbing buzzing sound from the walls. It seemed as it occurred everytime someone had been to the bathroom, and it lasted around 10-15 minutes. Once there was a terrible smell when we passed through the corridor, it was so bad that one of us almost vomited. We're used to many kind of smells, but this was really disgusting. It was NOT from cleaning products.The absolute worst thing was the breakfast. We had ordered continental breakfast. It consisted of: coffee, tea, juice, too soft french breads (almost wet inside) and marmalade. That was it! They had some other things too, but not much, AND you had to pay extra for it. It was a big joke! We never were satisfied enough so we had to buy something extra to eat in a store nearby.However, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the hotel is situated in a very nice area. Still we wouldn't recommend this hotel. It's a very low standard for being a 3 star hotel. It's only worth 2 stars. Jenny and Eva from Sweden	
Apr 14 2009 	horrible	The first night of our stay, we were sent to another hotel - should have stayed there. When we returned, we were given a 'basement suite' - musty, noisey, cramped. The view from the window was a concrete shaft. The bathroom window had no treatments. No wash clothes, hand towels, the bath mat was paper, and just three towels and two little bars of soap. the continental breakfast consisted of plain rolls, butter , jam, water, OJ, coffee, tea, hot chocolate. Would NEVER stay here again. Thank goodness that this place was booked and we had to find another hotel for the rest of our trip.	
Apr 6 2009 	Cheap and good location	Very close to Baywater Tube in a semi-touristy area but a couple blocks away so quiet and safe. - Lots of cheap eateries nearby. It's inside Zone 1, which means it's fast to get around london. If you go in expecting hostel type conditions then you'll be pleased with it! (Lots of space, good shower pressure, t.v. quiet rooms, breakfast included - not sure what though, as never went to it!).	
Mar 18 2009 	nice and friendly hotel	We stayed in room 424, from 12-17 march 2009. I'd read the reviews on this site and was very apprehensive. But as it turned out, our stay was wondeful. The hotel is located in Bayswater, just a short stroll from portobello market, and tubestations. The neighbourhood is lively, with lots of restaurants and pubs. The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly and the breakfast is adequate. It wasn't noisy at all, although another family that stayed on our floor made a nuisance of themselves (letting their hyperactive kids play in the hallway). The bed was a little too soft to our liking, but we slept well anyway. Room was cleaned every day, as was the small but functioning bathroom. There are two internet terminals in the lounge (1 pound for twenty minutes). It's a smoke-free hotel, so smokers have to go outside. I used the ashtray that is mounted to the gate, but a lot of guests didn't. cig butts were cleaned off the pavement on a daily basis. Some guests used the stairs to the hotel entrance as their personal smoke lounge, but my swift kicks soon remedied that.London is a wonderful city, and you could do much worse than stay in this centrally located and friendly priced hotel. I would recommend it. Will stay there again.	
Mar 17 2009 	Excellent!!!	After seeing many negative reviews regarding the Bayswater Inn, I wasn't looking forward to my stay one bit. Although as soon as I arrived I was sure my stay was going to be pleasant. The smell of Mildew was non existant, and the bathroom and sleeping quarters were adequately clean. I am a bit of a clean freak myself and I was able to walk around the room with no socks on, this shows i was pretty sorted in the room. The hotel staff were nice enough (although not an English person in sight). The view from our room was lovely and overlooked the square. Clean sheet, radio and TV facilities a bonus!The only minor problems I encountered were.....Breakfast, not worth getting up for.Some people had problems with the toilet paper, not soft enough for my delicate behindNo lock on the bathroom door.But on the whole a very good hotel to stay in and we would definately recommend it to a friend!!!Matt, James and Luke - room 126(York, UK)	
Mar 2 2009 	Do not stay here	Me, and my fiance stayed here for 2nights and when we arrived we got given a room on the lower ground floor with a view of another room, got 3 single beds instead of a double bed and all night constantly there was loud footsteps above us backwards and forwards which meant we didnt sleep very well. we were told before we booked that this hotel had recently been refurbished so the rooms had new flat screen tv's and were really nice but we seen no sign of any refurbishments. also our room was right next door to the maids staff room so from about 6am all we could hear was them chatting. luckily enough London was fantastic so we didnt let this ruin our weekend but we were not impressed it is more like a hostel not a hotel so i will not be going bk to this hotel.	
Mar 1 2009 	Hotel with 3 small stars	Hotel with a good location, nice square, good value, clean, but small rooms. In overall I think it should be a 2 stars Hotel.	
Feb 16 2009 	Non-existent customer care (reservation not honoured)	Don't book this hotel. The hotel dishonoured my laterooms reservation on arrival, very late at night - leaving me without accommodation. The hotel had processed my bank card pre-authorisation incorrectly (I checked with my bank). The hotel manager said that they had cancelled the reservation but he would not show me the documentation to support that claim (I checked and Laterooms had not received any cancellation from the hotel). The hotel refused to discuss my complaint with Laterooms when they telephoned.The hotel management blamed me, despite all of the evidence showing that they had simply made a series of mistakes themselves. Deceitful and incompetent - a sure recipe for failure and customer disappointment.	
Feb 10 2009 	Cheap 	For what I paid for this hotel I was quite happy with it. The location was fantastic, just a short walk to Bayswater Tube and also from heaps of restaurants, pubs and convenient shopping.The room I stayed in had room to move. It was simply furnished but included a television and adequate coffee making facilities. The bathroom was small but warm with it's own radiator, the room had an adjustable one as well. Our room was in the middle of the building and so the view out the window was not exciting, however we were only there to shower and sleep!The breakfast was simple with breadrolls, butter and jam but you were able to take as many as you wanted. They also had basic coffee, tea, hot chocolate, juice and water. It was quite adequate and lasted us until lunch time.The staff at reception weren't inclinded to say good morning unless you said it first but they weren't outwardly rude. I had no real problem with them.All in all this hotel is cheap, basic but was quite adequate when we spent most of the day out sight seeing! I would recommend to anyone on a budget who is in London to see the sights.	
Feb 5 2009 	Hideous Hotel.	Do not stay here! My family got sucked into this hotel thru Virgin Vacations (airfare &amp; hotel package deal) By the time I looked up the Bayswater on trip advisor, it was too late. So I kinda knew what we were getting into, but here's my 2cents anyway.As everyone else said....Completely (4/5 of them) rude &amp; unhelpful staff. Breakfast was a JOKE. The mildew smell in the rooms &amp; hallways, I can't even describe it. Our toilet seat was not connected to the toilet, but hanging off by a hinge. Windows would not open. The BEDS! Those might have been the most uncomfortable things I have ever slept on. Camping out in the mountains is comfier. The shower clogged and filled up to right below my knees everytime and flooded the bathroom floor. The remote for the television had tape wrapped around it to keep it together (hilarious). The towels smelled dirty. I asked the housekeeping staff NOT to make my bed (as I brought my own sheets and wanted to do it myself everyday) yet they proceeded to take my 50lb suitcase off my bed to make it anyway. Yes, the tube was close but that doesn't make up for anything. That's pretty much all I want to get into for right now. Moral of the story......DON'T even think about considering this INN for ANY reason.	
Jan 31 2009 	Bayswater Inn Hotel	Firstly i would advise anyone reading this NOT! to stay at the Baywater Inn Hotel. I am not usually one to write poor reviews however I can definately make an exception as i would like to warn people for their benefit.  When looking for a hotel in London I thought this was the best option for me personaly as the price was low (£20.00 a night) and the reviews where adverage, however when arriving at the hotel the staff where unhelpful. But this wasnt the start of our problems.  I stayed at the hotel with my boyfriend and a cople of friends, as the stay was only for one night i didnt make too much of a fuss, however if i would have been there any longer this wouldnt have been the case. When booking we where told that my boyfriend and I would have a double and this wasnt the case as we where given 2 singles. After asking politely for this to be amended there was a long wait for the room to be changed. Another reason I was unsure of our room was due to the unlockable door as this made me feel unsafe.  Once the room was changed I was quite happy as the room was a double and there didnt seem to be any problems (Boy was I wrong). After unpacking our bags we left the hotel for the evening. When returning to our room we where overwelmed with the worst smell you can possibly imagine, this had obviously been covered before we entered our room previously as when first arriving there was a fresh smell of air freshner. The smell was so intense I gagged and nearly vomited (I appologise for being so graffic but i need to warn you of the conditions). After explaining this to the receptionist I was given can of air freshner (barely enough for one spray of the room) and told to use this and open the window. This shocked me as the smell was clearly there to stay. Trying to make do with the smell wasnt the last our problems. The bed covers where dirty and clearly hadnt been changed. As by this point we were tired so to get some rest we slept on top of the covers as there was no way i would have subjected myself to sleeping under the covers. I stayed in the clothes i was wearing as i was concerned about the cleanlyness of the beds, however my legs wernt covered as i was wearing shorts.  I was woken up at 1am to the sound of someone trying to open our bedroom door, this was alarming to think that people would try to enter your room when your sleeping. At 7am the door was opened using a key and closed again , however this could have been someone leaving as I only woke up as the door was closing. It was hard enough trying to sleep after the first time the door was trying to be opened but at this point i couldnt stay any longer. I and my boyfriend left as soon as we could, not staying for the breakfast of a bread roll and orange juce as by this point there wouldnt have been anything to keep us there.Also after leaving the hotel I noticed an awful rash had apeared on my legs overnight and was increadibly ichy and sore. This worried me as it had appeared whislt staying at Bayswater Inn hotel. Even now a couple of days after staying there the rash is still on my legs and is still causing me discomfort. Please for your own sake do not stay at The Bayswater Inn Hotel and if you do make sure you take something to block you nose with and a sleeping bag.	
Jan 29 2009	Convenient location but no wonderlodge	What we liked about the Bayswater Inn: 1.5 blocks from Tube, quiet area, okay price, luggage storage, pharmacy and restaurants of every kind 1 block away, two blocks from Grayline tour bus stop.What we didn't like: beds, breakfast, desk staff, oldness of interior. All in all, okay for us because we don't like to spend too much on lodging. We like to be out and about most of the time.	
Jan 27 2009 	what you can get in London for 50 euro	Ok, for this hotel I have not paid too much so if you get really good deal you will have more money to spend on good food.London is not inexpensive city and I wanted to save money.the shower is very small, when I wanted to open the shower door I had to leave the bathroom and open the door then I came in and can walk into shower.Yes, everything is very old, not clean and cheap, and yes, the service is from hell.but I can not find any other hotel in London where I pay 50 euro and there is bed and toilet included in the room rate.If I pay 49 euro I think I will sleep in the park on the bench.	
Jan 12 2009 	The Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in	I have stayed in better hotels located in third world countries! This hotel should be bull-dozed.I'll sum up......dirty towels, paper floor mats, polystyrene cups, drafty single-glazed windows, faulty wiring, dirty walls, poor TV reception, uncomfortable beds, 1970's decor and furniture, dust and dirt caked surfaces, mouldy bathroom suites.......I could go on..........All in all I would thoroughly recommend you pay a little bit extra and find somewhere else.I paid £40 extra last year and I stayed in the Waldorf.......needless to say it was much much better.If you do stay there........good luck.	
Jan 9 2009 	Get what you pay for!	Breakfast wasn't very exciting. The website says breakfast is included but they forget to say what that includes: piece of bread, jam and water, orange juice, tea or coffee. If you want a traditional english breakfast that will be an extra fee. We got stuck in the basement. It wasn't the most satisfying place but we were comfortable. At night you can hear all the noises around you, the toilets flushing, people walking and random doors slamming. The toilet in our room was okay. There was hot water one night but another day there was very little hot water. The toilet also took a couple of attempts to flush... The lift was terrible and we couldn't find the stairs. The lift on one of the occasions actually stopped and wouldn't open. We managed to get out but it's never happened to me. My advice be patient.The people were friendly and we didn't have any problems with room service. They made our beds every day. You get what you pay for!	
Dec 29 2008 	Average London Hotel	It's not that easy to find this hotel because the sign is not very prominent and the direction from their website is not very clear. Just in case you need clearer direction, you can reach this hotel by taking Tube to Bayswater station (take to the direction of Edgeware Road at Platform 2 of Earl's Court), turn left from the exit, then left again until you reach the square. Alternatively you can go to Queensway station, which is not very far either.When we reached there, the lady receptionist was quite rude, but she was helpful enough when we told her that we needed help with our luggage padlock. The male receptionist is much friendlier.We have triple room even though we booked a double, so our room was of an adequate size. A bit small, but decent.Breakfast was horrible as the other reviewers had pointed out. Just bread roll and coffee or tea.All in all, I guess it's quite a decent inn, but I think it's more suitable to get a 2 star instead of 3.	
Dec 27 2008 	WHAT A DUMP !!!!!	If I could give this hotel a minus figure I WOULD!! first of all - extremely rude staff, who delayed us checking in to shout down the phone at suppliers, asked for more personal information than needed (requested passport number which we refused to give). Second of all,extremely small, poorly designed room. the bed slopped to the wall, down the side of oversized headboard. Also had paper thin walls!! i was able to listen to the next rooms tv word for word during the night! people checking in rougly 12:30am were laughing and screaming in the corridoors, and countlessly slamming doors. my girlfriends brief stint in halls of residence at uni was quieter!! the bathroom was disgusting. nothing you seemed to touch was clean! if me &amp; my partner were not staying just the night and leaving early for a flight we would have found somewhere else to stay. i have never felt so caustrophobic in all my life.how this place got 3 stars I will NEVER know. this hotel is a disgrace!!!!!!!	
Oct 29 2008 	what a shocking place to stay thanks Flight Centre	The hotel where the toilet doesn't flush because the floor slops. The hotel where your feet are higher then your head because the floor slops. A dirty kettle, broken TV remote. The breakfast that is included is a joke! a singe type of bread roll, you must ask if you want toast, the rest is coffee, OJ, and tap water. If you want more you must pay. The best part is we booked a double and received 3 singles and when we explained that we booked a double they said sorry there is no more rooms left. There are room below the road but don't tell the management that they are in the basement because they aren't they are lower ground! But in the lift you must push the letter B (could that stand for basement? because if it doesn't shouldn't it read LG for lower ground!). Don't get fooled by the photos, great Photoshop work. The best room in the hotel is the area just inside the front door but that only because you can turn around and leave. Thanks Flight Centre. Please do not stay here! London is beautiful don't have it upset by staying in a place like this. We did and we where popping sleeping tablets so we could sleep and go exploring around London the next day. This is not a fake review!	
Oct 19 2008 	Hated this Hotel	I booked this hotel through Gate1 Travel. I went &quot;C&quot; class but still expected better. I can tell you first hand that I'm not a complainer although this reveiw will make it sound like I am. Staff were rude and gave bad advise. I think they were getting kick-backs off tours of London because they told us one particular tour would bring us back to the hotel when they didn't. The Continental Breakfast consisted of rolls and jam, coffee/tea and you have to show a card in order to get the pleasure of eating it. One day I forgot my card in my room and the person guarding the &quot;continental breakfast&quot; acted like I'd committed a crime. The lobby was far less impressive than in the pictures. And, the worse part, the toilet in the bathroom we had was so close to the heat/air piping that we had to sit sideways to keep from getting burned. We, at first, thought the piping was a towel warmer but was later told it was the heating system. If you are diabetic and have a hard time healing your legs/feet do not book this hotel. The tub was a little easier to get in and out of the one we had in London but you could actually see mold on the ceiling around it. Overall, the hotel smelled bad, musty. The only thing I have to say good about this hotel was that the beds were somewhat comfortable and I liked the dressing table in our room.	
Oct 19 2008	Can I Get Some Clean Sheets?	So here I was a young girl about to embark on what I thought to be a week with some girlfriends on a school trip. I was quite fooled by the outside of the Bayswater Inn, I really did judge the book by it's cover, I assumed it was going to be a nice, cozy hotel, even the lobby was quite nice. Than we got the key to room 24 (que the horror music). I stood for about 20 mintues waiting for the elevator to decide to come pick me up. After boarding the elevator, at my stop it made screeching noises, as if it were about to break down, luckily it did not. The rooms weren't organized in order and it seemed as though, I'd stepped into a maze. A big pink maze. After a little help from some friends we found our room was closed off to the side in a little area.  After leaving the hallway (which smelled disgusting), we arrived in what I thought was going to be my favourite place at night, than we saw the blood on the sheets, the mold on the floor and the window. My ideas were changed immediately.After complaining about the sheets, we were told it's ink. Which in 16 years ink has never quite been that colour. We were left with just one towel for three girls and a faucet named TRICKS. Our facuet just barely worked it spun in circles and rarely gave out the warm or cold water I was looking for. Than we thought why not have a nice warm shower? I found my water to be scolding hot, and the bath wouldn't drain, I was having a shower with water up to my knees. And after the shower being used by three girls the PAPER mat was soaked RIGHT through, the sink was otherflowing, the bath was overflowing and the floor was soaked from the leak in the pipes. Mmmm was that ever a downer on the trip. My trip was absolutly flawless except for the Bayswater Inn, other than it's good location, it was one of te WORST places I've ever resided in. I do not recomend this hotel to anyone, unless you like men at your windows and doors that only have a dead bolt.  The Bayswater Inn, is not a place, I'd return to nor send anyone to, so please take my advice and find a better stay!	
Oct 18 2008	If you want to relive Stephen Kings "The Shining."	This past October 9-16 I travelled to London England with 25 other students from my High School and 3 womderful teachers. Our trip was organized through EF Tours an acredited and very pleasing touring company. This trip was honestly the best experience that I've ever had as a 16 year-old. England certainly is a beautiful country. Although there are always reminders that perfection cannot exist, that's why swans have black spots under thier wings. For me the black spot was The Bayswater Inn. In order for my review to be understood one must believe that i hold no predujice and that my complaints are not results of high-matienence. If you are accustomed to blood on your sheets and tap fossets that do 360's then by all means enjoy your stay in the farthest thing form the lap of luxury.  I'll start with the entry to the hotel where the elevator has it's own agenda and may make one wait up to 5 minutes for it to kick into gear. Some of the levels of this hotel had wood borded upon where glass should be in the elevator. Down to the basement i went with two other girls, and others from my group were scattereed throughout all floors of the hotel depite a request to be together. The basement was a maze of pink and when i found our room i turned the key to find our humble home. Yes, this time the key worked but other times the key wasn't even neccessary: jiggle the handle the right way and it was a waste to even need a key for room 24. The deadbolt was all that held my hope.The television did not work, the radio did not work, only 75% of the lights worked. And the ones that did took 3 minutes of flickering to settle into a constent glow. One of my teachers rooms had zero electricity, apparently a fuse box had to be played with in order to gain light in her room. There was blood on our blanket. Blood. Is that really easy to be overlooked? I say no. And when we brought it to the reception they claimed it wasn't blood. But as a 16 year old female i'm well aware what blood on blankets looks like. Even if it wasn't blood why were we getting stained blankets? And why were we never brought a new blanket? After 3 phone calls and a visit to the front desk? One teacher had two beds in there room and gave us the blankets off of it. One was used to give padding between the springs protruding from the mattress. The next day: the bloody blanket was back. Although sheets were not changed and a stain of chocolate became our constent companion throughout the week. The most interesting affair seemed to be when a man watched a girl in another room change through the window, until there was a man at our window. The window that didn't lock. At 3am our teachers were all up and showing teh receptionist how easy it was to get into our window from the outside. The receptionist gave my teacher a mop bucket full of rubber bands, plaster and scotch tape with a few scattered screw drivers and screws in the mess. He told my teacher he could fix it if it really bothered him. And so he did. Our teachers weren't sure of what action should be taken, should police be called? The receptionist thought not, so they weren't. But when our tour guide, who had a room at this lovely hotel but didn't saty there for obvious reasons, became aware he called the police the morning after. The next day he requested mateniance to be done on all our rooms; checking the locks on windows and such. It wasn't done. But we did find that the maids had gone through our stuff and found some of the extra towles we had hid in our suitcases. They weren't the most amiable when being asked for towels. 1 towel per person, but some of us girls liked one for our hair. Our teacher and a student stealthly borrowed some extras and the maid had found them when we had put them in our bags for the day. Our bathroom was the biggest of all the ones we saw there. European bathrooms are naturally small and i am aware of that. But the tap wasn't attachted to the sink: it did 360's, the toilet was as stubborn as the lights, and the bath tub had a draining issue. Light bulbs fell untouched from their sockets and water ran from the walls to add to the mold plastered along the floors.  The lack of safety, cleanliness and the rudeness exhibited by the staff of this establishment show the standard of this hotel. Many people said it was like &quot;the shining.&quot; I'm not sure i would go this far, but it certainly was the black spot in our swan of a vacation.	
Oct 9 2008 	How did they get a single star???	Paper bath mats. Yes, that's right - PAPER!!! Such quality!! Rooms are absolutey filthy! Glasses with lipstick stains still clearly on the rim after 3 DAYS!!!! Breakfast was.....help yourself to 3 baskets full of STALE rolls, tea &amp; coffee with UHT milk.....THAT&quot;S IT!! Staff are about as rude as it is physically possible to be. Security is non-existent. If you find Youth Hostels luxurious, you'll still think this place is a DUMP!!!!	
Oct 4 2008 	Don't go there!	Where do I begin? I am fully aware that accommodation in London is outrageously expensive and you get what you pay for. However I have stayed in a range of budget accommodation in London including university student accommodation, youth hostels and B&amp;Bs and this hotel is by far the worst. My single room was located in the basement and was so small that my two suitcases covered the entire floor. And the shower and toilet were located in a cupboard! The room was also located next to a room full of pipes and I heard evey flush of every toilet and every turn of every tap...all night. I didn't even bother to stay for breakfast as judging by the hygene of the rooms I was certain that I would end up with dysentry if I ate there. The carpet in the room was so dirty that I dared not walk on the carpet bare foot in case my feet stuck to the floor! If you are on a budget I recommend that you look at hostels as an alternative to flushing your money down the toilet by staying at this hotel.	
Sep 15 2008 	Do not stay in the basement.	My relatives from Norway are staying at this hotel. I came with them for check in and found the lady on reception to be abrupt and unhelpful. My Aunty is 76 and my cousin suffers from Asthma so we were alarmed to be shown to damp and smelly basement rooms. When we complained we were informed that these were the only rooms available. However, after threatening to leave and requesting a refund we were shown to some semi- respectable rooms upstairs.	
Aug 28 2008 	had to check out pronto	on arrival there was a large que to check in only one member off staff in attendance who was unhelpfull &amp; fraught. Whilst waiting to check in my husband went to the bathroom and was horrified to see it in such a run down state , toilet seats broken badly stained grouting. I then went to the bathroom &amp; the sink was cracked, no soap or paper towels, toilet seat broken &amp; this was just the first impression. We were allocated a room on the 4th floor, the door key was very difficult to manouver and it took several minutes to open the door, as we entered we sunk into the floor as it was uneven, the bathroom was dirty very dated looked like the taps, plug hole had never been cleaned since installing. the floor tiles were grubby &amp; the grouting was black with grime. bars on the windows which made the room even smaller than it was.The furnishings were very dated &amp; broken nothing matched curtains were green bedding orange &amp; red, the throw smelt stale &amp; the cost per night £ 100. We were given polestyrene cups &amp; plastic spoons. to drink from. Continental breakfast was included in the price, this consisted of bread roll with a choice of apricot or strawberry jam, a tea-urn containing orange juice &amp; choice of tea coffee or hot chocolate. We found alternative accommodation &amp; checked out	
Aug 27 2008	really good hotel for the money you pay	really nice hotel if you want to see the city.i think the most important thing to notice is where is this hotel,really only 5 minutes walking from Bayswater underground station,7 from Queensway underground station and in a really nice area,safe and with lot of nice place to eat something good.the hotel looks very good when you go in it and i think is defenetly good for the money i've spent,compared to other hotels in london.As suggested from other travellers i had a room on the 4th floor,really quiet.maybe the only things that can be improved are:dimension of bed and room(a little tiny for a doubble)breakfast(is really basic,if you want smt more is better to go out)I really enjoied this hotel and i'll reccomend it to anyone who doesn't intend to spend there his whole day or is looking for a 5 stars.the 24 hours reception was working well enough to allow us to go home at any time without problems.hope you'll find this useful,have a nice trip	
Aug 21 2008 	Just Fine	I stayed here with 3 friends from college. As American, male students, we weren't expecting a whole lot, just a place to sleep and shower during our stay in London and it provided just that. The front desk staff (except the late-night man) was extremely friendly (a woman talked to us regularly for 10+ minutes), as was the bartender in the hotel bar. Extremely convienant to the tube as well as Paddington Station for rail trips, would definatly recommend the hotel to like-minded travelers. Cleaner than my room at home, comfortable enough, and we were in a basement room which seemed fine to me.	
Aug 1 2008 	A very good hotel	This hotel is great. The receptioniste and night-receptionist, the waitresses and waiter in the restaurant, the cleaning-lady of the room, where very friendly and helpful. Very interrested in what we had done every day. The room was every day very good cleaned and given fresh towels.The English Breakfast was made for us every day fresh and very tasti.When we go again to London, we surely will stay in this hotel. We thank everyone in the Hotel for a very pleasant and relaxed stay.This hotel is wthin 10 min. walk from Queensway, where are nice shops/ restaurants/ pubs/ supermarkets/ internetcafe's and the Tube who brings You easy thtoughout whole London.This Hotel is surelly recommandable!!!	
Jul 26 2008 	Worst Value Hotel	Avoid this hotel at all costs. Having stayed in hotels from back-packers up to 7* all over the world, this is the worst value hotel we have ever stayed in. Dirty, stuffy rooms with poorly designed shower that wouldn't drain properly. Very noisy despite being in a relatively quiet area. Breakfast is virtually non-existent. Would recommend a back-packers over this place - less than half the price for the same quality. Other guests were making similar comments. How this place got a 3*, even in London where the * rating system seems pretty random, we'll never know.	
Jul 16 2008	Cheap Hotel Cheap Service	We spent the last three days as a group of 50-odd school students and staff. The hotel overall treated us quite badly, however we were quite lucky and got a nice triple single bed room on the third floor, however other members of our party complained that they had been given horrific camp-beds and bunk beds. On the first night the water went off as of 11pm + and the TV reception was incredibly poor. The so called &quot;Continental breakfast,&quot; which is supposedly included consisted of only a burger bap with a selection of jam and drinks, to be honest you could get a better breakfast at McDonalds. One of the hotel's advantages is it's close proximity to the tube station and shops. Stairwells were very steep and lifts were slow and small. The basement is a maze, and could easily be confusing to anyone. The hotel is in nice surroundings, and first impressions of reception are great, however the corridors and rooms are in dire need or refurbishment. The bathroom was very basic, and had a very strange layout, for example the toilet roll holder being at the opposite end of the room to the toilet itself. The shower was very dangerous as it was slippery, when leaving the shower. The rooms seemed very claustraphobic, and lighting was only at one end of the room. Also, windows were very difficult to open, and there were two large, bulky iron radiators with sharp corners, my friend managed to hit his leg on it while opening the window and was left cut and bruised. These could especially be dangerous for small childern. There was small warning sign, however it was very difficult to read and was at ankle height. All in all, this hotel is not worthy of its three star status as i have been in numerous three star hotels which have much better locations, facilities and services (especially breakfast!) The experience was poor and i would definitely not return, i was very glad i only had to endure this terrible ordeal for 2 nights.	
Jun 30 2008 	Nope.	Not great. Location is good (short walk to Kensington Palace) and the price is nice, but I got stuck into a basement room...not nice at all. It felt like an old workroom that had been converted to a hotel room. Right next to the building's pipes (so I heard every flush), cracked tile, leaky faucets, stained coverlets. I know, I know, you get what you pay for, but STILL. Perhaps some of the rooms upstairs are nicer; some of the other reviews seem to indicate so. Staff was friendly. I didn't spend much time there anyway; just slept and bathed.	
Jun 11 2008 	Not recommended	Good location close to lively Queensway. Big tripple room although we booked double room. Also stayed here in 1996 but the hotel has been refurbished since then and now has an elevator. Not the cleanest room. Nonchalant staff in reception. Breakfast was ok but not great.	
Jun 4 2008 	Great hotel!	I stayed with my parents, younger sister and younger brother in this hotel for a few nights. The only problem we faced during our stay was that the room we booked for me and my sister had a double bed that was very slim. Also it had only one big blanket which could be a problem if you're not used to it. With this exception the service was great for such a economically cheap alternative. It was close to great restaurants and a beautiful building. Though the hotel restaurant's food wasn't very good with quite few alternatives I recommend this hotel to those who want a pleasant stay in London without a hotel bill that cost the earth!	
May 31 2008 	Would not stay here again	The front desk staff were polite &amp; helpful, but other areas of the hotel need alot of help, especially housekeeping. In the 8 nightsthat we were there, the sheets were never changed, in fact the beds were barely made up. The shower was terrible and very dangerous, as there was nothing to keep you from slipping in the tub (it was very slippery). The hotel was very noisy with guests slamming doors &amp; talking in the hallways all night long.	
Apr 11 2008	Would not stay here again	I regret staying at this hotel. I was staying in a hostel previously and it was so much better. My room here was so tiny, the door would not open fully. If anyone who is clausterphobic were to stay here-they would go insane. My room was the size of a tuna can, my private room in my hostel was bigger (the washroom too). The breakfest was awful, just bread, juice, tea or coffee. I would not stay here again.	
Apr 6 2008	Nice Hotel Nice Area Nice Price	I stayed here for 1 night sharing a triple room. First impressions were good. The hotel is quite grand in looks and is in a nice area close to shops, restaurants &amp; Hyde Park / Kensington Gdns. I found the lobby to be in keeping with a higher rated hotel.Its quite a big hotel and there were a lot of European visitors stayingCar parking is for 4 hrs max where allowed, although a lot of spaces outside the hotel are for residents only. There is a car park on nearby Queensway, 5 mins walk but its expensive at about £22 for 24 hrs.The room was pretty standard. The 3 beds were quite slim but comfortable. There was no view from the room as we were in the basement. The picture on the small TV was a bit dodgy but we were not there to watch TV. There was also a Kettle &amp; Tea / Coffee which was quite handy. The bathroom was not the neatest but functional.I did not use the in hotel bar but the prices seemed reasonable for the location at about £ 2.80 per pint.The complimentary breakfast which consisted of 3 different types of rolls, butter &amp; various jams and Tea / Coffee was a bit basic but what do you expect at this price.Surprising to get anything at all this cheap. There was a cooked breakfast available for about £7 but we did not use this.The breakfast room was nicely decorated too with original artwork on the walls.I found the staff at the reception to be smart and helpful.Overall an excellent stay and I would not hesitate to recommend to others	
Apr 4 2008 	Cold run down skimpy breakfast	My granddaughter and I stayed at the Bayswater Inn in March of 2008. While the location was great, the hotel itself was a miserable experience. The beds were old and lumpy. There were no extra towels, washcloths or blankets. The window in our room did not close all the way, so it was extremely cold. The breakfast consisted of a large dinner-type roll and jams. We asked the hotel staff to arrange for a taxi for us on the day of our depature (which they said they did) but the taxi never showed up. We nearly missed our connection to our next destination. I wouldn't stay there again.	
Apr 3 2008	Small room	Found the room very small and with no view at all. As I had booked last October I expected a better room. The breakfast for which I was charged £9.00 per person was actually only £7.00 per person on the menu. The bar was very good but was shut on the Wednesday night. The television reception was rubbish.I have written to the hotel twice since last Saturday but, as yet, have had no reply.	
Mar 18 2008 	Central London For 33 Quid A Night For 2 People With Breakfast - Great Value	Right people its time to get real here . This hotel ain't the Ritz but it ain't the Pitz either . It is unbelievably cheap 33 quid off Venere and 3 pound cheaper on Expedia - this is for 2 people a night with breakfast and in Central London ? Come on ..London is the 3rd most expensive city in the world for hotels - this place is a bargain . You could live here for 105 pound a week / sharing with a breaky thrown in and no heating/water/cable tv bills . Please get a life ! the average cost of renting a poky box room in a house in this area is about 500 quid a month and thats if your lucky !We got a perfectly clean ,tidy and comfortable double room with ensuite bathroom . It was reasonably furnished ,bit outdated maybe but we had a great nights sleep and breakfast was a bonus - not the worlds best but not the worst either . Eatable and filling .Hotel was in a great location, near shops,bars and most important public transport . Would definatly stay here again .If you want luxury then pay luxury prices . Bed and breakfasts all over the uk that are no were near as good as this hotel are charging double its price a night for a room .honestly i thought it were a bargain for what we paid - and the telly worked !!!	
Mar 6 2008	No No No No	First of all we arrived earlier than Check in time ( 10Am)THe bad:Front Desk Old lady was trying to check us in but she was VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY RUDE OMG why is she even in the front desk?????? WHY?i kindly asked her how many stars is this hotel and she just said 4 STARS!!! with a slightly loud Tone of voice.... i was like OK fine you win now check us in will ya? then here came the Ops support coz the nice lady couldnt see our reservation apparently... anyways they told us that our room wasnt ready so WE had to store our luggage OURSELVES in their Luggage room. Ok if your a 4 star WHERE THE Heck is the concierge???? they gave us a room in the BAsement. trust me it wasnt a good experience. we didnt manage to complain because we were busy through that time..... Continental Breakfast? by that you mean no hot food right? well we had the coldest Bread Rolls and the coldest coffee and the warmest Orange juice =) too good to be 1* hostel.i dont even remember how we checked out to be honest. this is a -5 out of 10 in terms of rating.	
Feb 2 2008	Reasonable	I looked on tripadvisor prior to booking and was a little concerned by some of the negative reviews. I do agree that this hotel is not the Ritz but for the £35 for a night I paid it represented good value. The room was clean and a reasonable size. £35 even included a basic breakfast.I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere inexpensive to spend a few nights in. It is situated well for all central London transport links / attractions.	
Jan 28 2008 	basic but bearable	I was expecting the worst after reading the write ups on this hotel so I guess this prepared me &amp; made my stay quite pleasant. The hotel is basic &amp; rather shabby but our room was clean &amp; the hotel's very near to the tube station (5 mins walk to bayswater tube on the circle line &amp; 10 mins to paddington) and a reasonable price. The staff are not the most helpful &amp; the breakfast is lame, the bed wasnt comfy but what do you expect for one of the cheapest priced hotels? If it's comfort &amp; style you want book elsewhere. If you're looking for a reasonable priced stay as a base to see london then certainly consider this hotel	
Jan 18 2008 	better than expected	Some of the reviews were not very promising but we found the hotel adequate for our needs. There were no directions to get there but it is in fact very close to Bayswater tube station. We had a triple room (there were only two of us) with a large balcony overlooking the park, although access was denied. The road was quiet for London although by 8am traffic was beinning to build.The room was basic but clean with kettle and hairdrier. The bathroom was the same, some soap and clean towels were provoided but the taps were very stiff making the shower dificult to use. If you are a foodie, DON'T stay here. Breakfast was breadrolls with butter and preserves. Very limted but also very fresh and as much as you wanted. Hot drinks and fruit juice too. All in all, for the price we paid I think we bagged a real bargain!	
Jan 16 2008 	Our introduction to London	The Bayswater Inn Princes Square, London.This hotel was a disappointment from start to finish.Our travel agent assured us that this would be an ideal place to stay even though we made it clear that money was not an issue.On our arrival at the Bayswater we were confronted by a sour faced receptiomist who looked like she 'd take our heads off if we asked her for assisstance. We were given the wrong kind of room and it couldn't be swapped, even though the requested room had been booked well in advance. The room we received was dingy and small. there wre stains on the carpet and bed linen. The plumbing in the toilet was very rough as was the sealing job done around floors and fixtures. The toilet seat poorly fitted and the hand basin was not sitting straight on the wall.The floor mat was a small sheet of paper. Poor drainage left the floor saturated for several hours whie it drained through a tiny hole in the wall.The bath towels were not changed until the fourth day. The floor in the main room had a fall of about 10cm which meant the you were lying level only when supported by a pillow. There were no spare pillows supplied. TV reception was poor and displayed only a few channels.The alarm clock and the bed light were not working Foam cups and a couple of wooden stirrers were issued for making tea or coffee.Breakfast consisted of a dry bread roll and a cup of coffee or juice. People who require extra food were greeted by rude, unhelpful waitresses and a chef who lost his temper and refused to cook for people who had ordered food after 9:30, even though finishing time is 10:00.There were not enough tables and chairs in the eating area and many of us had to wait for a long time .Such a disappointing introduction to such a great city.	
Jan 16 2008 	A bit like Faulty Towers	Booked via lastminute.com, literally last minute (about 3 hours before our stay)It looked ok from the outside but was entirely different inside. The lobby was quite pleasant, as was the receptionist. We were supposed to be in a double room but ended up with a triple with 3 single beds.... Hardly suitable for a couple! I didn't moan as I heard her turn a customer down on the phone as they were fully booked, so I knew we'd not get to change rooms. The entire hotel needs a refurb, its very out of date. No room service, we had to fetch the (broken) iron ourselves, which leaked water everywhere and was somewhat dangerous! Breakfast was a joke. Bread, water, OJ and coffee. Absolutely disgusting! Prison fare would be better! £31 for a night per room. You get what you pay for. Which clearly wasnt a lot!	
Jan 6 2008 	Absolutely Awful!	I had the unfortunate experience of staying in this tip of a place in the beginning of December. The beds are simply the most uncomfortable I have ever stayed on. the &quot;continental breakfast&quot; is a bread roll, coffee &amp; vile orange juice. When I complained about the mattress on several occasions nothing was changed until my last night where the mattress was turned over &amp; a piece of wood stuck under one of the legs so the mattress didn't appear to be sloping so heavily. I have made a complaint through my travel booking company only to be informed that there are no reports of any complaints being made. I strongly advise everyone NEVER stay in this hotel as it is truly the worst I have ever stayed in!	
Jan 3 2008 	We were pleased	My husband and I just returned from our trip to London over the New Year's holiday. We stayed at the Bayswater and were truly afraid of what we'd find once we got there after reading so many negative reviews. We found this to be a very nice hotel, it's no Ritz Carlton, but for the price it was more than adequate. Our room was clean, comfortable, no mold in the bathroom and everyone on the staff we dealt with was extremely friendly and helpful. Even the rolls and jelly breakfast was good. They had a menu available if you wanted a cooked breakfast. And the location is great! You don't have to be afraid to stay here.	
Dec 29 2007 	Budget hotel no luxuries close to tube stations!	We stayed at Bayswater Inn Hotel over Christmas 2007.We arrived at 4 a.m. (6 a.m. my own time!) so I am sure any room having a bed or a large flat surface to sleep on would have looked lovely. However, I was genuinely pleased with our twin room - in my opinion, the twin rooms are LARGE!It was also very pleasant that the windows faced the little garden in Princes Square and we could hear birds singing in the night.There was central heating that worked, too, except we turned it off for the whole time and kept a window or two open, as we are used to a colder climate.The shower was a bit tricky at first before I got how it worked. (When you turned the tap thing, you were changing the water pressure AND the temperature at the same time, so colder water = less water pressure, hot water = higher water pressure!)! I learned to turn the shower on from BEHIND the shower curtain and fix the temperature, only then did I step in! Must say, the water pressure was the best I´ve ever experienced in Great Britain! Also there was no brist of hot water!Ok so there was only one towel each, and if you did not leave it on the floor, it was not changed. Yes and the paper &quot;bath mat&quot; was kind of funny as it did not absorb water - I know, I spilled some while on shower!I would have preferred a pump bottle of soap to the small bar soaps. Yes, they were 2 unpacked small bar soaps, and they were not changed the whole time. Oh and I noticed some really small insects in the bathroom. Very very small and thin, reddish I think. Like miniature, thin ants. But, they did ot bother us and we did not bother them. And, to tell the truth, I think complaining at the fron desk would not have helped. Just a couple of them I THINK, not like it was infested.The cleaners came in at 1 p.m. every day, it was nice to come back to a made-up room.The linens were not changed after our arrival, but we only stayed for 5 nights. Usually when I have stayed in hotels for a week, they have changed them in the middle of my stay once.The beds were large but weird - we were sleeping on the bed springs! In my country, beds consist of 2 or 3 mattresses, the top one(s) are there for the very purpose of insulating yourself from the springs.One thing I did not like was the floor to wall carpeting, which I find unhygienic as it can hide anything, and is certainly not washed as often as other floor materials (hopefully) would be.Also, the usual problems with staff in the breakfast room that spoke worse English than I did.BTW have a look at the &quot;Deals&quot; as there is a good permanent one for 4 nights incl. English Breakfast AND a visit for London Eye or Madam Tussaud´s. We used that one, but did not want the tickets. At the time I made my reservations, it made financial sense = saving me money to take the deal and one extra night.A couple of days before we went, I noticed they had GREAT deals, just 39 £ per night for a double or twin room! Incredible!We payed 76.5 £ per night per room, incl. English breakfast.The staff seemed tired / fed-up / depressed / who knows what. The attitude seemed to be &quot;We won´t seeing you again anyway so who cares?&quot;. You know, sighing on your face etc, making us feel we were bothering them when we wanted our key etc. One was outright RUDE on Christmas day, but I did not complain, because 1) I am a big wussy 2) I doubt it would have helped.The most important thing for us was the closeness of the tube stations. (Hubby cannot walk very long, sadly.) Also Queensway has lots of stores and Whiteley´s shopping centre nearby so you can buy groceries and snacks to your room. Also the wonderful Nandos restaurant is close! Queensway is very lively and feels very safe, bustling with tourists.BTW I stayed in this hotel back in the 90´s and boy was it great then. I am not quite sure it still deserves the 3 stars it did, 2+ or 3- maybe?I think we got what we paid for. Still, next time I think I´ll also ask for a couple of recommendations on this helpful forum before making my decision.	
Dec 17 2007	Dire Experience	Booked this hotel through Late Rooms. I selected this hotel because of its reasonable price and location, as it was within 10 minutes walk from a ridiculously expensive hotel where I was attending an industry dinner.On arrival, they claimed that they had a computer problem and did not have a room for me.Consequently, they shunted me off to Earls Court to a hotel that was nearly £20 cheaper and ended up in having taxi rides (which the hotel paid for). I had to wiat 40 minutes for my taxi back after the dinner.Absolute mess of my evening.I have made a formal compliant, but have had no response after 10 days.	
Nov 28 2007 	Was ok but won't go back!	I booked the Bayswater Inn without looking at the exact location - mad I know but the description of &quot;ideal location for Oxford Street&quot; sold it to me as the main purpose of my trip was to go Christmas shopping. It took me a good hour from Oxford Street and I'm no snail!I read some of the reviews on here the night before I came to London and was pretty nervous at what I would find but apart from the location not being as central as I would have liked and the breakfast being exceptionally poor I have no other complaints. The staff were friendly and helpful when asked for directions and our room was clean. This is not a hotel to stay in if you want to be treated as royalty but it is ok for a 3 star hotel. I won't be going back purely because of the location although I must just add that the breakfast really is a let down and if you like a decent breakfast to set you off for the day then you will be extremely disappointed! Think bread rolls and jam.....you may get a slice of toast if you're lucky!!	
Nov 24 2007 	NEVER again!	Oh dear! I work in hotels and fully understand that you get what you pay for so when a hotel says 'Double bed and continental breakfast' thats what I expect! The problems started the minute we arrived, the receptionist (v nice girl) checked us in, we got to the room and it stank of smoke-this is suppose to be a non smoking hotel!(some people have no consideration), we requested to move rooms, even thought they were fully booked we were allocated to a second room,great, I thought until we found out it was a triple room so we requested a different room. The duty manager (v unhelpful, unfriendly woman) told us they were full and would 'sort it tomorrow'. By now, Im in the bar, leaving my partner to get us a suitable room. Eventually we get a room and while it was generally clean the bed was rather small (think 3/4 bed), and there was dust all over the mirror frames, the lampshades etc, great for allergies . Neither night did I manage more than 4 hours sleep (total, not continuous).The shower in the morning was great until I saw the size of the towel that was suppose to dry me! (hand towel springs to mind-spare a thought for my rugby player built South African boyfriend)On our second morning we did venture down for breakfast, I have experienced better in a £20 a night, scummy hotel by a train station! Continental breakfast-look it up! Traditionally consists of bread, pastries (croissants and danish) coffee, milk and juice. Hard bread rolls and white toast (no choice) didn't quite live up to it. Service was also appalling-not one member of staff smiled or said good morning, despite the fact we did both. A SMILE COST NOTHING!Anyway, to sum up this rant up, the hotel will be getting a complaint letter as will the site we booked it through. Don't be fooled by the good location and prices-book a Travel Lodge or a hostel-you will definately have a better experience!	
Nov 18 2007 	You get what you pay for	A dark basement room, a crunchy plastic matress, mold in the bathroom and an unwelcoming staff. We had to special request toilet paper and the complementary breakfast consisted of hamburger buns and jelly. This hotel was certainly proof of the old adage &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;! Certainly there must be a better way to economize. If you are considering a stay here my strong reccomendation is- keep looking.....	
Oct 8 2007 	You get what you pay for	I was super nervous after coming to this site and reading all the bad reviews after my boyfriend and i booked our stay at the bayswater for 4 days. I was expecting the worst. I dont know what the fuss is about. The room was clean and the staff were friendly. What else do you people need? Its not like we came to london to hang out in the room. The beds werent very comfortable but its a budget hotel in a great location! I cant believe how many people simply just love to complain. You get what you pay for! We had an amazing trip and simply came back to the hotel for showers and sleep. Anyone looking for luxury at that price in london really needs a wake up call. If you're looking for a small, quaint bed and breakfast, this is the place. Its cheap and got the job done. We drank our coffee and ate our toast in the morning and were on our merry way. We made the best of it and had a great time. No room for complaints while on holiday here.	
Oct 5 2007 	Cheap and cheerful	I got transferred to this hotel as my orginal hotel changed ownership. Looking at the reviews on here I was quite worried. All in all though our rooms were clean and comfortable and the location was great (5mins from tube). I have to say though that the hotel staff were a little rude and breakfast was very limited. For a one night stay it was fine but if we go back to London for a longer break I'll be staying somewhere else.	
Sep 19 2007 	Great deal	Me and my girlfriend went to London on a romantic getaway. We booked our vacation trough a travelagent website and stayed at Bayswater Inn for 5 days. After booking the vacation we came across this site and became very nervous about the hotel but desided to give it a chance. We were pleasantly surprised by the standard of the room, the staff and the overall experience.The room wasn't that big but provided all the things needed for a great stay. The room was clean, fully functional and quiet.The staff was very helpful in all ways. They helped us store our luggaged upon arrivel until the room was ready. They help explain how to get from A to B in London ad so on.Overall this is a hotel that we wouldn't mind coming back too.The location is great (central but still quiet), the prices are fair and the room was adiquiet &amp; clean.We can recommend the hotel too all except perhaps families with small children due to the fact that there are no entertainment facilitiis for kids.	
Sep 17 2007 	Don't ever stay here....	This hotel was absolutely disgusting. Unfortunately, the bad reviews are all correct so advice to anyone considering staying at this hotel: the reviews are true and take them seriously. I had to see it to believe it. First of all, the whole hotel gives you a feeling of uncleanliness and filth. The staff barely speaks English and no one is willing to answer your questions, and if we asked for something we would get a look and an attitude that we were needlessly occupying their time. The staff in the breakfast room was especially rude. The cleaning ladies WALKED INTO our room without knocking first while we were still in there changing/showering/getting ready, and one day we were still asleep and had to wake up to find strangers IN THE ROOM. This happened 2 of the 3 days we were there, and it also happened to our friends staying there. All the furniture is badly outdated, in horrid conditions (especially the mattresses), and I felt I had to sterilize my hands every time I touched something. We were awakened at 3 a.m. one day by reception because they wanted to know if our bathroom had flooded! I asked for an extra towel, got it, yet the next day it was removed promptly by the cleaning staff. My experience with this hotel was horrible, and I strongly advise anyone against staying there. The only positive for this hotel is its location, but there are tons of other nicer, cleaner hotels for the same or less price in the area.	
Sep 7 2007 	Disgusting place	Nevermind the disgusting facility, but the staff were rude and they charged me more than I was expected to pay, then refused me a refund. DO NOT EVER STAY HERE.	
Sep 4 2007 	No room at the Inn	We stayed two nights at the Bayswater Inn last week, booked through a small agent we found on a London website.The hotel has a lot of promise, but our room was so pokey that the double (well, a single and-a-bit) bed was up against a wall, so one of us had to crawl down the bed in the night to get to the loo, avoiding banging our head on the wall-mounted TV as we went.The room smelt strongly of smoke, the loo was so close to the radiator in the bathroom that you had to sit sideways (too much info I'm sure), and there were really thick prison-esque bars at the windows.The continental breakfast consisted of three types of bread roll, with little portions of jam, and some coffee that made my teeth squeek. I'm used to that type of breakfast offering pastries, and often meat and cheese too. At leats there's a Tesco Express opposite Bayswater tube station.On the plus side, drinks in the bar were quite reasonably priced.We booked on a tight budge due to impending parenthood, but I would recommend spending a little more and picking somewhere different if possible, it certainly isn't the three star we were told it was.	
Aug 11 2007 	Don't do this to yourself or family	We stayed here from June 4-11, 2007. The pictures look great but prove that pictures can be deceiving. The double room made a Motel Six look like the Ritz-Carlton. The beds looked like they had been used army surplus from WWII. With the exception of the night clerk, David (who was a joy to deal with and quite ebullient), the staff was rather unhelpful and quite dour in their demeanor. &quot;Amenities&quot; were a joke. Can you believe a disposable paper bath mat (good for only one shower, so if more than one is staying here you'll have problems)? One towel, no face cloths, no washcloths, per person. Beds were &quot;made&quot; but sheets were not replaced and when they were, the sheets clearly had large stains on them which looked liked dryed, but washed blood. Further, if you must stay here I would like to point out that this hotel is VERY heterosexual and if you are not you will feel quite uncomfortable and unwelcome. Don't do this to yourself. From my observations while there and since, there are better hotels at more reasonable prices in the area. The area is a good one, close to the Bayswater and Queensway tubes with major bus routes on Bayswater Road.	
Jul 28 2007 	WARNING: We checked out the next day.	My husband and I took our teenagers to London for our big vacation. Bayswater hotel (3stars) was listed in our package via our travel agent. We read the bad reviews but we booked 2 rooms hoping for the best. When we arrived, I was horrified to see black mold in the shower, the bed unevenly sloped against the wall, mold on the linens...an odor of sour mildew was present in each room...no soaps/shampoos and the bath mat was made of paper. The carpet and walls had stains on them. I wouldnt let my kids touch the comforter or floor barefoot. All afternoon I made calls to the U.S. hunting for a better hotel via our travel co whom didn't help us at all. At our own expense, we changed hotels the next morningI Since our breakfast was included, we drank the coffee and sour juice but wouldn't touch anything else. There were no smiles from the waitstaff. Who can blame them? We took photos to make our case with our travel co. Our memory of London will begin with a entire wasted day searching for a clean place to stay. There is one positive. The staff were helpful, kind and understood our plight.	
Jul 26 2007 	Fine hotel	I stayed at this hotel in June 2007 with my mother, sister, and grandmother. I disagree with the extremly negative reviews of this hotel. Basically you get what you pay for. This is London, after all, one of the most expensive cities on Earth. And in that respect, this hotel is an excellent deal. I am a travel agent here in the US, and have a reasonable standard of Luxury. I knew before booking this hotel that it wouldn't be luxurious, I wasn't paying for Luxury!! I was paying for clean, comfortable, and conviently located, this hotel was all of those things. The Room was small, but that's how nearly all rooms are in London. It was clean at least. There was a wardrobe in our room to hang clothes if you are staying a few days. Bathroom was large by London standards, and clean.The staff was very accomodating, my grandmother has to have her diabetic medicine refridgerated, and they put her medicine in their bar fridge every night, and got it out for her every morning with hardly any incident. The breakfast was pretty minimal, rolls, coffee, and OJ. But that's continential breakfast!The location is excellent, 8 min. walk to Bayswater or Kensington station. 10 minute walk to Hyde Park. Plenty of restaurants/pubs shops around.We hardly spent any time in the hotel as we were exploring London, and it's a perfectly fine place to lay your head down at night.	
Jul 17 2007 	Good location But NOT good hotel!	The location of the hotel was superb, as soon as we arrived we walked to Notting Hill and happened upon the Portobello Market. But the room itself was the smallest thing ever. The bed was against the wall and if you have more than one small bag you will find it difficult to find a place for it. But the worst thing of all was that the bed comforter, it was covered in hair. It was disgusting!!!!! We removed it and put it in the closet. The sheets and pillows were clean but the comforter was not. I would not stay here again but would find a hotel in the area.	
Jul 9 2007 	Much better than expected	This is a perfect hotel to stay in if you want to explore the city all the days. It's clean and it is located in a good neighbourhood. The breakfast had no high continental standard, but it was OK. When we arrived at the hotel, we were all worried because of all the bad reviews we had read, but the hotel turned out to be much better. It has a great location with several pubs in the area, two great tube lines and Kensington Gardens which you can reach by only a 5 minutes walk. If you just want to stay in the hotel all the day long, choose another hotel much more expensive. But if you want to hang around in this beautiful city and just need a place to sleep and rest your feet, this hotel is great.	
Jun 5 2007 	previous reveiws do no justice	Do you speak English is a commonly used phrase in this Hotel .The staff are mostly european and langauge was a real problem on our stay . having read previous reviews on this hotel we thought we would give it a go as the price and location seemed good , In future I will take more notice of trip reviews ,the hotel lived up to the worst of the reviews . We stayed in room 64 , the mattress had collapsed ,there was no ventilation ,there was a constant smell of mould , the floor had sunk in ( causing problems during the night ) beds were poorly made up and food was left on the floor for up to 4 days . The public areas were old and and unclean as were the public toilets. Surprisingly the bread rolls ,tea and orange juice for breakfast were quite good as was the location .Next time in London I will stay at the sister hotel Faulty Towers .	
May 15 2007 	It's fine	This is a good, clean budget hotel - beds slightly hard as were pillows - but bathroom was more than adequate and cleaner than some higher class hotels I have stayed in. You get what you pay for but this was good value for money £49 for double room on laterooms.com. As a place to crash after a party or gig this was great. Close to tube stations and you felt quite safe walking round the area at night.	
May 15 2007	Maybe the rooms above ground were better....	But I wouldn't know. They put me in a cell in the basement. And I kid you not - the room was smaller than a police holding cell. I took the elevator down, wandered through the maze of corridors to my room, inserted the key, and...walked straight into the nightstand. In order to pull my suitcase into the room, I needed to first open the closet door directly opposite the room door, then step into the closet, open the room door all the way and grab my suitcase before it wandered off. The window lock appeared to be broken, but that apparently didn't matter much, since I had a grand view of...a window well. The bathroom, while it had a nifty heated towel rack, was a tad too narrow for someone larger than a house cat. I'm quite small, yet even I discovered one morning that it was possible to simultaneously burn my back on the towel rack and bash my forehead in on the faux marble ledge over the sink as I leaned over to wash my face. The walls appeared to have been made of rice paper, because I could hear every single movement in every room down in the basement. And judging by the number of families I heard, I was only mildly reassured that they didn't just put the solo travellers in the dungeon. I'm a very low-maintenance traveller. I can deal with just about anything, as long as I'm not rooming with rats or roaches. This was the only time I thought seriously about asking for another room. But since the room actually was quite clean, and I was only there for a short time, I decided to suck it up and deal. It's definitely a hotel for the budget traveller.	
Mar 31 2007 	Things you should know	Nice clear hotel. That descrides it well enough. Not very expensive tho in the center of the city. Only 5 mins walk from the nearest subway station.It's situated at a quiet neighboorhood that has everything close. From pharmacy to Burger King (for fast cheap food).If you have an option, do not choose the breakfast to be included in the fee. It's nothing special. More than a waste of money. Just bread, butter, jams. You can get a sadwich or croissant in great prices very near.Carry your own shampoo and shower gel. The hotel doesn't provide any. And get a smaller towel cause they only provide a body towel.If you come from a 220 (or other voltage) country get your adapter or they charge 3 pounds each.Have fun and see as many things as you can in London! don't forget to take a relaxing walk in Hyde Park which is no more than 15 mins walk from the hotel!	
Mar 19 2007	Great for Budget Shoppers	Most reviews we have seen rated this hotel rather poorly but I think it is a great place..for the money. The young ladies on the front desk, a Pole and a Russian, spoke English, were very helpful and were very good at fending off the unhappy customers who thought they made reservations at a three star hotel. I'd say they rate right down there with Motel 6. We checked out just a week ago today.	
Feb 20 2007	Caught by surprise	So this hotel was not as bad as we thought it was going to be.After reading SO many reviews that did not favor Bayswater, we found nothing wrong with it. Possibly because we had low expectations. (and americans tend to be VERY picky)The location of Bayswater is excellent! Pubs all around, not far from notting hill market, shops, close to the tube or a walk in hyde park. It was clean, good size, slipped once in the shower, but all was good. Service was complient and helpful.Breakfast was decent, rolls in the morning, but as long as I had some coffee, all was good. I have no complaints, the only thing is if you plan on staying in, which I have no idea why you would do this, the beds were a litle springy, but if you were out all day site seeing or whatever, you should be tired enough to sleep on them. We were there for a week, and I found it to be very pleasent.	
Feb 13 2007	rude receptionist	I took 18 of my students (aged 18 to 20) to the hotel in February. I had stayed in the area - though not at this hotel - before and can only recommend it (the area that is). Pubs, restaurants, supermarkets, a shopping centre, cinemas, the park and two underground stations are all within walking distance. You can also stroll through the park to the museums (Victoria &amp; Albert, Science etc.) and end up within walking distance of Harrods.If you are into walking you could even walk through the park to Oxford Street.The Bayswater Inn was my third choice, a hotel I had stayed at before was being renovated, another didn`t take groups. After reading some of the rewievs I was a bit apprehensive but the only really negative experience we had was with the front desk. A woman who called herself the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful when two of my students asked to change their room because they had not been able to sleep all night because of a group of Spanish teenagers partying next door. Other members of staff were friendly but seemed disorganised, e. g. they couldn`t find our reservations even though we had already filled in all the forms in the morning.As other reviewers have pointed out you have to leave your luggage in the luggage room which can be accessed by anyone. On arrival the &quot;friendly supervisor&quot; even suggested leaving it in the hotel lobby!My room was a single on the first floor which had the size of a shoe box and faced a brick wall. Even though it was right next to the elevator it was quiet - the bed was a nightmare though. If I went to the hotel again I would book myself a twin at the same price as the single.None of us stayed in the basement but I had the chance to look at one of the rooms and can only underline what previous reviewers have said, it is like living in a hole.Breakfast was rolls and jam which was basically what I had expected - it is London after all. At least it was buffet style. I had stayed at a London hotel before where you got two pieces of toast and that was it.If you have not been to London before, as a rule you get much less than you pay for. Rooms are tiny. So if you are talking value for money (London style) I would say the hotel is ok. It is a sightseeing trip after all and the time you spend at the hotel is extremely limited.Still I would not recommend the hotel to individual travellers. There were three international groups there during our stay. A choir from Norway, a group a Spanish teenagers and us. Surprisingly they did not put me on the same floor as my students which I suppose also happened with the Spanish group thus the excessive noise at night (see above).The hotel offers a bar that is reasonably priced, service was good.In a putshell, yes, I would probably take a group there again, no, I would never choose this hotel for a private trip.	
Feb 5 2007	You get what you pay for	For £50 for 1 night can't really complain. Room was clean enough (4th floor) although it did seem to be on a slant!! Noisy during the night, due to other guests lack of respect. Bathroom was small, but had amenities thats would expect. Covers on bed had cigarette burns in!!Breakfast consisted of bread rolls, jam and butter. Coffee and Orange Juice. We asked for toast and it was brought out to our table very quickly. Full English is available for £7!!!Just one thing, we arrived at 2pm and were told that we could not go to our room until 3pm!!! Lady on reception suggested that we shouldn't leave our luggage at the hotel, got the impression bags had been stolen plenty of times from there as the information in the rooms, strongly advised about leaving valuables etc in the room.Would stay here again if was for just one night as location was ok, 5 mins from Bayswater Tube. Also price was very good for 2 people to stay in London.	
Feb 1 2007 	Don't stay at the Bayswater Inn	Location of the hotel was quite good, very easy to get to central London however had some some very dodgy experiences in the week I stayed. Stayed as part of a group of 16 of us - even though we told them who was staying in each room they didn't keep a record. One room was broken into (and locked again) and camera, ipod, and cash were stolen - when the key was left at the front desk. Rooms smelled of cigarette smoke even though smoking is meant to be banned inside. While away on my trip my bank reported that someone had tried to access my credit card account - the only place I had used it was a this hotel - in order to make a local call from my hotel room! Beware!! Don't stay here!!	
Jan 22 2007 	Beware!	Hi Everyone We stayed at this hotel as part of our vacation package booked by Gate 1 Travel. We were there for 4 nights &amp; just got back. I am the type of traveler who has no problem staying in a 1 or 2 star hotel or even a hostel when I vacation in Europe. All I need is a safe neighborhood, a clean bed &amp; I'm happy. This hotel was in a safe neighborhood that offered plenty of food choices &amp; was close to public transportation. However the negatives for the hotel outweighed the positives. Our initial response to the room was &quot;OK&quot; but upon closer observation we found multiple things that needed repair or cleaning. This hotel could be a nice place to stay if the owners put out the money to update the facilities  we decided its just cheaper to pack the tourist in every few days since a remodel or update would cut into profits.  Positives - The reception staff were pleasant to deal with. The room had the basic necessaries - heat, hot water in the shower, hair dryer, hot water maker for soup &amp; tea, &amp; a TV for those who need that item. They did offer a free breakfast but choices were very limited (3 types of rolls, butter &amp; jam, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, &amp; watered down orange juice/drink).Negatives - This establishment is old &amp; in need of some basic TLC. It has definitely seen better days - The halls &amp; rooms had an odor. Our beds were extremely uncomfortable - we could feel the individual springs poking through. The bathroom was very small - that was OK but I would like to have had a toilet that actually worked. It wouldn't flush unless you took the top off the tank and manually held down the bulb while flushing. I told the front desk but they never responded to my request to have it fixed. (I guess it's just easier &amp; cheaper to pretend you will have a repairman fix it but then not follow through.) The shower stall was so small that when you went to turn around to rinse off your back you couldn't do so without bumping the on-off handle &amp; turning off the water (we're not large people either). There was mold in the shower stall. I couldn't tell if the towels laid out for our last day were stained or possibly dirty. They needed to be replaced. The soap left out for our use had been unwrapped &amp; I couldn't tell if it had been used or not - luckily we had brought our own to use. No shampoo was available  luckily we had brought that too. Bath mat was a piece of paper. No hand towels, just one big bath towel for each adult in the room. Only natural light was a window that looked onto a brick wall several feet away. The luggage room was like others on the site have described it - locked in a room with buzzer access - gave the appearance of security without really being secure - anyone could gain access by simply pressing the buzzer - didn't have to show anything that proved you were guests of the hotel to gain access. The rating above woud really fall between the 1-2 dots. Not terrible - but not OK. Would I stay there again  No Way - To many negatives!	
Jan 4 2007 	Bayswater Inn ruined my trip to London	Sorry, this review is far from complete. This &quot;hotel&quot; is simply not worth a review, but a severe warning.&quot;All the extras you would expect in a London 3 star standard hotel&quot;?My room was a rat hole in the cellar, smaller than a prison cell, next to a noisy lift motor, almost no natural light; with a door, where light shines though all night; stinky and rotten.What a shameless rip-off.	
Nov 27 2006 	Never Again	We arrived in the morning and left our cases in the luggage room, which was not at all secure. Entrance is gained by pressing a buzzer - you do not need to show a ticket or press a code. Anybody could gain entrance and walk out with your suitcase. If you are travelling by train then use the lockers at Paddington Station instead.There were always long queues at the reception and the staff were very abrupt. We booked a double room but was given a twin room. Staff not sympathetic/helpful at all about this - we were told they would do nothing.We were extremely dismayed by the size of the room - at most there was only 2 foot of space between the beds or the wall/wardrobe. The wallpaper was peeling in places, the ceiling sagged down and there were metal bars over the window. The beds were camp beds; the mattresses were extremely uncomfortable - we both felt bruised by the broken springs.Tiny bathroom. The bath mat was a piece of paper. Decorated with blotchy green/white/brown tiles.The walls were very thin - the noise came straight through from the corridor. Every time someone opened their door we thought someone was going to walk into our room. The lift was very slow and make loud groaning noises/shuddered.	
Nov 15 2006 	Neutral Review	We stayed at Bayswater Inn for 2 nights in Nov. 06. This hotel was booked through GATE1 Travel as part of our London, Paris, Rome vacation on plan C. I have used Trip Advisor many times in the past so I can expect the best, or at times get ready for the worst. My stay at Bayswater Inn was a neutral average. There were positives and negatives. It turned out more positive than negative. The main thing I can stress is &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot; This establishment, like many in the area were some type of business structures or maybe apartments that have been turned into hotels. It doesn't appear the Bayswater was built as a hotel.  The positives for my stay out weigh the negatives by far. The Bayswater Inn rooms are simple. They had a bed/beds, TV, clocks, private bath/shower, desk and chair. There is nothing extravagant at all. So if you are like me and only use the hotel to sleep and shower, this is perfect. We get up early in the morning and usually do not make it back to the room until late at night.  We arrived from the airport (at least a 15min drive) before check-in so they allowed us to store our luggage for free. Personnel were very friendly and attempted to assist us as much as possible. They have two lifts (elevators), two sitting area and a restaurant. Their location is perfect! The hotel is 2blocks from the subway, many fast food places like KFC, Pizza Hut, also there are plenty of ethnic eateries, and pubs around. There is a laundry mat one block away and a bus stop close by. You are walking distance from Marble Arch if you would like (maybe 25mins at a leisure pace and 3-5 minutes on the bus.) There were several money exchange services and a couple of stores; however we didn't go in them. The breakfast (which is my #1 negative) consisted of 3 different types of breads. A roll with poppy seed, a roll without poppy seed and another type of bread. They have 2 or 3 different type of jams to choose from and butter for the bread. Their beverage choices are orange drink (not juice) water and coffee. THAT IS ALL. When we saw what they had to offer we ordered from the restaurant menu, however that also was poor. We did not participate in breakfast anymore.  When on vacation I tend to sway to establishments with a good breakfast. This was not even what I would consider continental breakfast. The second negative, well not really a negative, but unexpected, and not only at this hotel, but every hotel that we stayed in while visiting Europe, no one gives you wash rags. You get a towel and mild soap. So bring your rags! If you asked me would I stay here again, my answer would be yes. I overall enjoyed my stay here . I have included some pictures of my room and the hotel. I hope this review will help you.	
Nov 12 2006	Quality Services	The hotel really provides quality services, no matter staff, room and restaurant. Location is also definitely an advantage. I heartfelt recommend to anyone who will travel for any purpose.	
Oct 26 2006 	Horrible Hotel	This place was terrible.The beds were awful (the springs would dig into me and wake me up all night). The staff were unfriendly. There was no handtowel and the bathmat was a piece of paper. The rooms were dirty. The breakfast was much worse than a hostel I stayed at for half the price. Do I need to say anymore? For the price I thought this was a terrible place to stay!	
Sep 16 2006 	vile	tiny rooms. mouldy bathrooms. very uncomfortable camp beds. smells terrible. basement rooms mean you can't leave a window open for fresh air incase someone comes in. unfriendly staff. terrible breakfast -bread rolls, cheap orange juice, and a mild excuse for coffee.Need i say more? Spend a few more pounds and have a much better experience.Well avoided.	
Aug 14 2006 	Hyed Park so close.	The Bayswater Inn is a tourist class hotel and you get what you order but since being so close to the Metro and Hyde Park its quite good. The hotel was clean, neat - nothing fancy but ideal for a short stay in London. My only issue was the breakfast which was basic but as we were busy seeing the city it didnt matter. The internet and services are notable and overall it was fine.	
Aug 13 2006 	Moldy bathrooms horrible staff	Do yourself a favor and do not stay at the Bayswater Inn! I was a guest there for seven nights for Christmas 2005. Moldy bathroom, staff very unhelpful, and the heater was broken in my room, but they would not fix it citing &quot;no one is around during the holidays&quot;. I caught a bad cold due to freezing in my room.....they would not move me to another room. But the prize complaint, is that the front desk staff messed up my reservation, and while I was out enjoying London, they went into my room and packed everything up, and gave my room to another person even though I paid in advance and had a confirmation for the entire week! No apologies, and I had to fight with the manager to get a refund. Horrible, horrible, horrible hotel! So if you enjoy mold, broken heaters and people going through your stuff, this is the place for you!	
Jul 4 2006	Some problems but we survived	The Bayswater Inn has a good location in a pretty borough of London, very close to two underground stations and to Queensway, where you can find all you need, from Boots to pubs. The staff is quite kind, no problem with it. That's it for the good comments. Infact, other aspects are very disappointing. First of all, when we arrived we realized that they gave us a room in the basement. It was very wet, dusty, dark. People from the street could see into our room. We found also a beatle into the bathroom lamp, it was fighting for life, then it died, but it was horrible to know that an other host was livinig with us, thinking also to its companions likely hanging into the ceiling gap. We stayed for another week end at the Bayswater, the week later, after a trip to southern England, and we asked for a room in another floor. Finally, the staff gave us what we asked. This other room was better but I found a dirty towel, dirty of the wrost thing you could imagine. Another default that other people have underlined: the breakfast, very poor, almost sad, with a humble bread and a disgusing orange juice. The coffee was coloured water.I don't know wether I could find at the same price a better location in London. 99 pounds per night in a twin room with en-suite bathroom, but next time I will try to find something better.	
Jun 19 2006	Absolutely poo	I was very unhappy with this hotel, and so was Kel. However,Igor, the fictitious man who lives in room 101 provided much entertainment for Robbie K. The hotel staff did not care that a 15 year old male ran around the corridors for over an hour, displaying his arm pit hair and wearing nothing but boxers. Cripes! A pool of vomit was left undisturbed outside of the lift, and 2 members of the trip organisation staff were verbally abused by a Russian lady built like a tank. The language skills of the staff were to be commended (it was such a shame that English was not spoken). One night, I approached the desk with my card for room 118 to get my key. I put it upside down on the desk, only to be told by one of the Scandinavian staff that &quot;there was no room 811.&quot;However, if you go and stay here, you can look forward to the luxurious breakfasts of bread rolls. Oh and don't bring your children, as the staff are possibly the most anti-social people I have ever met.	
Jun 13 2006	You Just Had To Laugh!	This hotel was just pathetic! You just had to laugh!! First of all the rooms were tiny and were originally made for 3 people but they had placed a camp bed in to fit more people in! It was just ridiculous. The T.V didn't work, the kettle took ages to boil, the hairdryer nearly blew up and the 'tea making facilities' were something to laugh about! The beds were extremely uncomfortable and people resulted in sleeping on the floor, as this was cleaner and more comfy. The shower and toilet did not work which is very unhygienic! The staff were out of order. On the first night they would not give us our keys as we were told that the key cards were for breakfast only. This meant a group of 60 school children at 11:30 at night were sat waiting to go to bed. When trying to explain to the staff that they had made a mistake, in broken English they firstly shouted at me, then one of our teachers, then another pupil and finally me again! The staff were extremely rude and should be sacked. On the second night at about 12:30 there were 2 drunken men shouting and vomiting everywhere, which was not dealt with. One of our group needed a camp bed and so we went down to reception and explained the situation and asked for help. This resulted in once again being shouted at and told that we could have no bed, pillows or quilt!  'Breakfast' was a joke! You did have a large choice between brown mouldy rolls or white mouldy rolls! On the second day we had no breakfast due to the poor quality. The hotel was disastrous and practically ruined our holiday. So thank you very much to all the staff that went on the trip from Bury Church High School, without you the trip would have gone downhill from start to finish! xx	
Jun 6 2006	mouldy rolls!	Be prepared to have an 'extensive' choice of brown or white mouldy rolls for breakfast, and a very lumpy bed, with rock hard pillows. The location was good though.	
Jun 2 2006	stay away if you want to sleep!	We arrived with a school party of 60 and the room was an average sizeThe huge problem is nobody is fluent in english so this makes things extremely difficult also staff are rude and incompetent.Breakfast is a joke we didnt bother the second morning we can eat bread and jam at home. I am sure prison breakfast is of a higher calibre. The beds are so uncomfortable we didnt sleep you can feel every spring in your back and on night number one we wanted to leave. Night number two there was a pool of vomit by the lift and this stank the floor out!never again would we return, it isnt suitable for a school party as in no way can corridors be policed with the amount of fire doors and lifts and stairs! It was horrid! i am sure for the same price higher notch accomodation can be found	
Jun 1 2006	The worst hotel in london!!!!!!	this review is from pupils of burychurch of england high school we think that this hotel it is a disgrace crap food a stale roll for your breakfast and if u like orange juice you wont like it ever againthe bedsare apsoluly appaling	
Apr 27 2006	A Disgrace	Let's start on a positive note - It was not so difficult to get to. It is only a short distance to the Bayswater underground station. It is located in a neighborhood that is very ethnically diverse and has restaurants from every nationality to match. WARNING: Beds in this hotel are not beds by any reasonable standard. One earlier reviewer called them cots which is actually the truth. They are flimsy, dirty, lumpy, torn &quot;mattresses&quot; on a wire frame. It is just not fit to sleep on. We were travelling with a party of four other persons and all of the beds were the same, regardless of room location. We had each prepaid $900 U.S.for 3 nights and were stuck. The included &quot;breakfast&quot; consisted of a stale roll with terrible coffee and worse &quot;orange juice.&quot; And the staff providing this fare did so with a level of service that would have gotten them fired from a job in a prison inmate cafeteria.The bathrooms are so small that it is difficult for an average person to sit on the toilet.Beware of basement rooms. Yes, they have basement rooms - and they don't really disclose that you are getting a beasement room. Its like a surprise. The dungeon in the Tower of London must be better.That the rooms are small, I can overlook because that is the standard in Europe. But, these rooms are dirty. In fact, everything in the place is dingy. It is a horrible place to stay in a city as classy as London and can really put you in a negative mood during your stay.	
Apr 15 2006	Pleasantly Surprised	Our travel agent booked the Bayswater Inn for us because we wanted 3 star accomodation near the city.It wasn't until after we had paid for it thatwe found this website and read these reviews.We were therefore filled with great trepidation upon arriving.What a pleasant surprise!I will start off with listing the &quot;cons&quot;to this l, but believe me, the &quot;pro's&quot; far outnumber them!Firstly, the staff all seem very friendly, but there is a distinct communication barrier. I would suggest, if you have the inniative to figure things out for yourself, don't even bother talking to them. I believe we only came across one lady at the reception desk who spoke passable English and she seemed to be under tremendous pressure.Secondly, our plane got in from Sydney at 5:50am, we arrived at the hotel at around 8am - only to betold check-in wasn't until 3pm. We'd been on our flight for 23 hours and we weren't up to sightseeing. There was no negotiation with regards to early check-in, so we had no alternative than to leave our luggage at the hotel and find things to do.Thirdly, the only bad thing about our room was the bed. Definately NOT a double bed. More like a king SINGLE. And the matress needed replacing at least a year ago.That's it for the bad. Now on to the good!This hotels location is phenominal! It is only a 5 mnute walk to Bayswater tube station, which is on the Circle line (a major line).If you walk 10 more minutes in the opposite direction, you'll get to Nottinghill Gate Tube Station. This one's on the Circle, Distric &amp; Central line. You couldn't ask for a better location.Yes... the room was small, but considering we only really used it to sleep in, it didn't bother us at all. The bathroom looked brand new, and the towels and sheets where changed daily. The room also came with a hairdryer and coffee and tea facilities.The very best thing about the room was that it was WARM. We would walk around in t-shirts and shorts most of the time. The towel rack was heated, which was perfect for hanging went underwear from after washing them.You hand your key into reception when leaving the hotel. While some may not like this, we found it very convenient, as there was no fear of losing the key.The breakfast is bread rolls, with tea, coffee, orange juice and hot chocolate. Not fancy, but what else would you expect for FREE?As the hotel is a converted old Victorian residence, it epitomised the charm and character of London and we would definately stay at the Bayswater Inn again.	
Apr 9 2006	You get what you pay for	We read the reviews on this site and were more than a little nervous about our stay at the Bayswater, but were pleasantly surprised.The room was small, but for where we were and the price what else can you expect? We were slightly inconvenienced by having to provide our credit card details and deposits for everything extra we required and the breakfast leaves alot to be desired (we only ate our complimentary breakfast once). The attitude of the staff ranges from courteous to friendly.We were not expecting to stay in the hotel room and we didn't, the only time we saw the hotel in daylight was on the day we left. We were out of the hotel from 7 - 8 am untill 8 - 11 pm at night. It is a great location, we even walked from Marble Arch. The underground is close enough not to need to walk too far.There could be improvements in the quality of the food provided, but that is our only criticism.	
Mar 26 2006	Much better than the reviews!	I came on this site before my trip absolutely dreading the hotel given the reviews. However, the Bayswater Inn is the best hotel I've stayed at in London. The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom was huge (as compared to other European hotels I've stayed in).The location is great-- it's just a short walk to the Baywater tube station and it has everything you could need near by. Breakfast was basically buns, juice, and coffee, but all were delicious.My only caution-- watch out for the front desk staff. They are a bit rude to say the least. Despite this, however, I would definitely say that the Bayswater is at the top of my list for my next UK visit.	
Mar 18 2006	Not Too Shabby	I'm back from a 10 day European (Germany, Holland, Belgium, France &amp; England) tour and this is one of the hotels I stayed at. The Good: Awesome location. You'll be very close to a bunch of cute shops, restaurants, grocery stores and there's a 24 hour laundromat if you need it. Also, the Bayswater Tube station is a short walk away.  There was heat, a working alarm-clock-radio and tv People were relatively friendly Internet: 1 pound/14 minutes (at least they have it) Safety: You have to be buzzed in so random strangers can come in and try to rob the innThe Bad: Free breakfast is two thumbs down. All they give you is bread, coffee and OJ. They hide the free cereal somewhere in the back, but you can buy a better breakfast if you wish (eggs, ham, etc)The Ugly: Shower takes like 15 minutes to drain, there was no bathroom window and it smelled kind of weird The mattresses were not good. You can feel all the springs stabbing your back. I was in a room of four so I slept on a thin springy mattress on a piece of cardboard that was suppose to be a cot. Thank goodness I was exhausted every night.Overall, this place did its job and was probably cheap because a tour company used it. I would stay there again, or definitely somewhere in the area.	
Mar 16 2006	Fun at Bayswater	I just camr back from a seven day tour in England and had the privlige of staying at the Bayswater Inn. Located in a posh district of London. I had the ability to run to Starbucks every-morning and have the luxuri of having the Bayswater tube station 5 min walk away. The bayswater Inn is in a rather quaint district of London in a semi middle -eastern disctric. with many shopes and restaurants to choose from one is never bored in the evenings. With a short hop skip and jump one is able to see Kensington Gardens and the palace. Being there for the week I did have the luck of seeing Prince Charles and Camilla get into their Royal Helicopter in the morning whilst alking in the park ajacent to the back area of Kensington palace. The rooms are rather nice for what one pays for at the Bayswater Inn. The staff are rather graciouse and kurt depending on who you are dealing with at differnent points of day. If one has a chance try speaking with the midnight desk clerk. A fellow from Thailand who is more then happy to help you with any probplems you have. He is very knowledgeable of the area. If one is so lucky enough to get him onto the subject of the many stars and socialittes that populoate the area. One is able to see how lucky and privliged it is to stay in one of the most charming districts in all of London. Breakfst is nothing to exciting. It mostly consisted of buns with an asortment of butter and jams with orangejuice. If one is willing to go the extra mile and pay some 9 GBP, one is able to have a full english breakfast. The wait staff in the restaurant are polite enough but enlgish can be some what of a barieir. If you can try and dela with a charming young girl named Inga from Lithuania. She is rather polite and willing to help you in any means to make your stay at the bayswater better. All in all, I guess one can say that &quot;you do get what you pay for.&quot; If one is expecting more then what I have said in the above then maybe it would be wise to go to the Savoy or the Rotz, but if one is interested in the true life and atmosphere of real people who live and breath London everday. Then the Bayswater Inn is the place to be.	
Feb 23 2006	No problems	I stayed in the hotel from 19 to 22 of February and there were no problems whatsoever. The double room (4th floor) was small but enough for a quick stay. Everything was clean, towels were replaced everyday and nothing was broken.On the room, there was a hairdryer and an electrical water boiler to make coffee or tea. Television was small, but worked without problems.The bathroom was a bit small, but everything was very clean, in perfect conditions and there was plenty of hot water.The staff was lovely and the breakfast was very simple but good enough for the price.The Tube station (bayswater - Circle and District Lines) was two streets away, making the location of the hotel perfect. Very quiet neighborhood with loads of restaurants (Queensway) and shops.Fairly decent for the price	
Jan 29 2006	Sometimes you get less than you pay for!	This hotel was represented by the agency &quot;Gate1 Travel&quot; as being a three star. It is located in a decent ethnic neighborhood (Greek &amp; Algerian?) about 5-7 minutes walking time from Bayswater tube station. The location is also convenient to Paddington Station (about 15-20 minutes walk) and Hyde Park / Kensington Gardens (5-10 minutes walk) When we arrived in the morning we found the lobby and staff to be pleasant enough with good security, but beyond that is where the trouble starts. For starters the luggage room was filthy, Wood chips all over the floor from the cracked and broken racks. It was obvious that it has not been cleaned in a very long time if ever. After a day on the town we returned and were given two rooms in the basement. The first was a small single. The entire room was about six feet wide by ten feet long and the temperature was about 90 degrees F. The knob on the radiator was broken so it could not be adjusted. The other room was supposed to be a double and it was fairly large with two single beds and a double bed, however the condition of the room was atrocious. The stench of old smoke permeated the room and there was graffiti on some of the walls. The double bed was pushed up against one wall that was covered with scuffs and dirt as if someone had walked on it. The carpet had numerous stains on it and appeared heavily worn. The bed linens were old and worn looking with holes in the bedspreads and there was some kind of stain on one of the sheets that appeared to have chunks of something stuck to it. The bath had cracked and broken tiles on the floor. We returned immediately to the front desk and after considerable debate with the night manager I escorted her to the rooms and pointed out all of the aforementioned flaws. It was only after this and more persistent badgering that she finally agreed to move us. The other rooms were better, but not much. They gave us a double on the second floor and another different single in the basement. The single was no bigger than the first one but had a much better temperature. The only real flaw here other than the size was that the shower head could not be adjusted and in order to get wet, one had to get very close to the shower controls which were positioned such that a slight bump would send the water temperature plummeting or soaring to the point of scalding. There were also guests in the next room who were drunk and very loud when they came in at 4:30AM. The noise continued until 7 AM when I left the room for the day. I advised the desk clerk who seemed indifferent to the problem. The double room on the second floor was much better if smaller than the one in the basement and other than the fact that everything looked old and worn there were no problems. There are two elevators in the building but one of them was broken for most of our three night stay making the walk to our rooms twice as far a it needed to be. As for the continental breakfast, here is the exact menu: Wheat Roll, White Roll, Poppy Seed Roll, Butter, Apricot preserve, Strawberry Preserve, Coffee and Orange Juice (From a can). If you want anything else it's extra. I have described this hotel as well as I can. If you are told that this hotel is anything more than a good one star or a poor two star you are being lied to.	
Jan 4 2006	You get what you pay for	Stayed from Dec 27 till Jan 3. The rooms are the size of a room on a Cruise. Ample closet space,2 beds,small desk with 2 chairs,nice size bathroom with plenty of hot water and great water pressure. we were on the 2nd floor and there was no noise. The room was CLEAN and the beds were made every day and the 2 towells were replaced. The breakfast was very basic but it was FREE. The staff was polite. Long walk to the TUBE. Plenty of resturants nearby. Was not the RITZ but well worth the price	
Jan 2 2006	Never again!	Got a small, noisy basement room with hardly any ventilation. Never will I stay in this hotel again. Stay away!	
Dec 30 2005	And they sd it was handicapped friendly--ha ha ha	What a joke!!!! I will never stay there again....I could hardly even get through the door.I use a wheelchair and before I scheduled my trip I called and spoke with the hotel staff who assured me that there were no stairs and the elevator doors were large enough for a wheelchair. Obviously they were wrong and extremely rude when I talked to them about the problem!!!!!!!!!!	
Sep 16 2005	Never again	I stayed at the Bayswater Inn with my wife and will not return. The room was too small. however our room was in a quiet area and the location of the hotel is quite good. Don't expect a courteous frontdesk.Quiet neighbourhood, close to Bayswater tube station. nearby at Hereford we found Restaurant Veronica's, it's very good, nice and friendly.	
Jul 21 2005	Never no more !!! Parasites !!! No breakfast and dirty !	The managers of this hotel should be ashamed ! You call this a 3 star hotel ??? Let me laugh !!! Never saw a sad hotel like that in my whole life.You people are just parasites ! And more customers we spoke had the same reactions.Very unsympathetic reception by a Pakistan guy.We slept in an old room in the basement. Plenty things broken, old paint, holes everywhere, no outside view from the window. Continental breakfast ??? Never saw that in my whole life:Just a few sandwiches with butter and marmalade and that's it !Nothing salty, no cheese, no bacon, no cereals, nothing !!!Never no more ! This is what people call a one-time-shot hotel. You go ones and never no more !Just take a look at some pictures you'll know what I mean !Jean-Marc Van RavelsAntwerp Belgium	
Jul 1 2005	Wow.. we must have been lucky...	We had a triple room (me, husband and daughter) and we have no complaints except for a broken bedside lamp, we paid £ 177 for three nights all in all and we were pleasantly surprised by the comfort, service etc.Breakfast wasn't fantastic but not bad either.	
Jun 26 2005	Dirty Bayswater Inn	My family and I booked three room at this hotel. It was the worst we have ever encountered. Bathrooms very dirty with broken tiles and dirt coming through the tiles, rooms dusty and filthy. From the moment you walked in this hotel you wonder which HELL I am in.	
Jun 21 2005	Steer Clear!!!!!!	I stayed at the Bayswater Inn as a single guest on May 29-30, 2005 and will definitely not ever return. I was booked into a single room in which I could barely turn around. There was not even enough space to lay my suitecase out - I had to close my suitecase in order to get to the bed. The worse part however was the noise. My room was in the basement and located next to the housekeeping closet. At 06:30 AM, I was awakened by bags of bed linens being thrown against my window which just happend to be next to the door which supplied the housekeeping closet. I reported this to the front desk, asked for another room, and was refused. Not even a courteous apology or explanation was provided.I also had the honor of listening to the activities of the couple next door well into the night. The walls are very thin.Breakfast was strictly bread and coffee. If you want eggs, you will pay £7.00 (almost $14.00 US).My advise is that if you book on-line, verify the location of your room within the hotel. More times than not, if you get a good deal on line, you will not get a good room unless you ask, otherwise you will end up in the basement. I am an American who lives in the UK and have grown accustomed to the smaller spaces of the European lifestyle, however, this hotel took the lack of space, excessive noise, and customer service levels to a new low. There are better hotels on the same street which are much better and around the same price!	
Jun 17 2005	Bad Hotel	The hotel location is bad , it is difficult to find if you haven't print out the map in the internet. I go to there early so i cannot check in immediately. So that i store my luggage in the room .The room have lock but everybody can also enter to that room to get back the luggage . But there is a risk to lost your luuage as everyone also can go to that room to get the luggage (EVEN you can get the other person 's luggage ) It is so Horrabile. I stay in second floor so i think it is better than stay in basement . The room is not bad . But the room service will not change the towel in the toilet even I stay there for 4 night ( HORRIBLE ). I also find they also will not change the bed sheet also. At night , it is easy the hear the sound near your room . I heard the childen opposite my room run and run and they run to the room at about 6am. Luckily i still can sleep . Hope you will luckily not stay in basement . I you will not stay in that terrible hotel again.	
Jun 14 2005	Never Again	Staying here was horrible, and I've stayed in so called &quot;bad&quot; places before. I have to agree with most of the comments from the last poster. I was booked for 4 or 5 nights, and they tried to put me in the basement near the elevator and I slept one night there, it was the size of the closet and no place to put my suitecase, not enough floor space to even put it on the floor! I felt so tucked, it was a little worrisome... I didn't expect much for the breakfast, buns and coffee, but I'm not a morning person so I left to go get a real coffee anyway. When they changed my rooms it wasn't any better, but it was on the ground floor, and SOO cold in the room, there was no door on the bathroom either, probably because it wasn't big enough. I finally apologized for my nuisance and offered to pay for a larger room, that I just could not do one more night without sleep. So they then put me on the 3rd floor in a double room facing the front which was much more comfortable, I've learned my lesson!!	
May 17 2005	horrible hotel	This was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The room was tiny, dirty, in the basement with one window onto an airshaft. The beds were what we describe in the US as cots and the mattresses were lumpy. The carpet was stained, the curtains dirty. The breakfast was rolls and instant coffee with watered orange juice. We only ate there once. On the plus side, the desk staff was friendly and helpful and the location was good. The room was not noisy, but I think we may have been the only guests in that dank basement. Next time I would definitely spring for the extra money for a decent room.	
Apr 28 2005 	Good value for money	I stayed for two nights in April and received an excellent and reasonable rate through a website. In view of some earlier comments about this hotel, I wanted to record my observations. Although I booked a single room, I was given a triple room on the 2nd floor overlooking Princes Square. I checked with reception to make sure they hadn't made a mistake and they assured me that this was the correct room at no extra charge. So maybe I was just lucky. I found the reception staff pleasant, polite and speedy.The room was very clean, spacious - compared with what I was expecting - and it proved to be quiet. There were no sounds from neighbouring rooms, and with my windows open at night, all I heard were occasional vehicles driving by, but this was not a problem. The bathroom was newly refurbished with a powerful shower over the bath. Three towels (for the three beds) draped the heated towel rail. The room was adequately equipped for all my needs but storage space may have proved a premium for three persons.I didn't take the continental breakfast included in the rate, simply as I didn't have time in the mornings.The location is excellent. A couple of hundred metres from Queensway, with its cosmopolitan atmosphere, ethnic restaurants, ranging from Vietnamese to Moroccan - you name it and they are there. Plus Whiteleys shopping centre with more restaurants, a Marks and Spencer food store and cinemas. All the leading fast food chains are also located in Queensway plus a couple of Tescos for any quick provisions. The hotel is served by two Underground stations - Queensway (Central Line) and Bayswater (Circle Line). Also buses that take you to Marble Arch, Oxford Street, Victoria, Westminster and Notting Hill. Lovely Kensington Gardens is just across Bayswater Road. There are even a choice of churches in the vicinity, including Russian Orthodox. Altogether a very suitable hotel at extremely reasonable rates, given it's location.The reception on check out was efficient and courteous. I would not hesitate to stay there again if budget was priority.	
Apr 15 2005	Disappointing and overpriced hotel	I booked a single and a twin room under the condition not to have a room in the basement. Otherwise there would not be a booking. When we arrived we learned that for one night the single room was in the basement (near the elevator!) and that we would have a double room, although I had sent an extra e-mail before to ask for a twin room. My son and I do not prefer a double bed. Although the female administrator was unlikable in handling this case, we got a triple room. On the other hand the receptionist was very polite and kind. Some beds need new mattresses.Breakfast is sufficient but not of a good quality. The distance to London-city is a 15 min. walk or you can take the underground (about 600 m.).The price/quality ratio is insufficient.	
Feb 2 2005	Cold water in a cold winter	We stayed at the Bayswater Inn for 6 nights and read the reviews after having booked the room. So, arriving at the hotel we were wondering:&quot;Would it be true, everything told in those reviews?&quot; And the answer is unfortunately &quot;Yes!&quot;.The arrival at the hotel was ok, and the lady at the reception was kind and..english.The room was small, but on the 4th Floor, so, far from the street noise, and ....close to the noise of the elevator. We could also follow all conversations of the people in the room next to us. But hey, the color TV worked well, and with the BBC or ITV (that's it) it was not to difficult to concentrate on something else.The first morning we wanted to have a shower... Surprise: there was no hot water. At the reception they explained us that there was a problem with the boilers and that 50% of the hotel was without hot water. Ok, can happen.But on the second morning: no hot water. And so on... Until the last morning. Luckily, some afternoons there'd been warm water. However, we filled out a complaint on a blank invoice given by a rude lady claiming she was &quot;the Manager today&quot;. Last but not least, on the 5th day we discovered that our towels were never changed... and we had to go to reception to get a pair of fresh ones.Conclusion: believe most of the reviews on this hotel ready to become Fawlty Towers nº 2 !!	
Jan 24 2005	No complaints	After having read some reports about this hotel, I almost cancelled my booking, but I'm pleased I didn't. Ok, its not the Ritz but the prices aren't either. The room was more than adequate, both in size and cleanliness and maybe I was just lucky but the mattress looked and felt as new. Without doubt I would be more than happy to stay at this hotel again.	
Jan 12 2005	you get what you pay for	After having already booked and paid for our room, I then read the reviews and was really worried.As I approached the hotel I was really apprehensive. I was told to come back at 3pm because the room was not ready, and left our bags in the chicken coup as described in earlier reviews. We returned at 3pm and were given the keys to our basement room (oh my god earlier reviews going through my mind again). As I opened the door the cleaner nearly had a heart attack as we came in. Back to reception to wait for another half hour; things were not looking good!. Finally got into our room and was relieved to find it very clean and tidy. No bugs running around or mould on the wallThe only problem was that the bed badly needed a new mattress, as it was impossible to sleep on, so we slept on top of the sheets etc, and as it was so warm in the room this was not a problem.Woke in the morning, had a tepid shower and discovered I was covered in bites of some description!!. We went to breakfast really out of curiosity, to see if the previous reviews were right, and regrettably they were.However the hotel is well located, and has a busy friendly neighbourhood.All in all i`d say that if you are looking for cheap clean accommadation for one night only in a well placed location, then give it a go. Remember though you cant really expect 5 star services if your only paying one star prices.	
Dec 18 2004	sorry but only for deaf persons	After a long day trip, I finally reached the Bayswater Inn. Although I booked weeks before, they told me the were overbooked. They told me I have to go to another hotel, I should sit down and wait for the taxi.There only excuse were:&quot;You're not the only one!&quot;The taxi should come soon, but it took almost 1 hour and then 45 min. more to get to the other hotel. Two days later I had to come back, what costs me again 3 hours.The rooms are very noisy. You can hear every word what your neighbours say and every step they make. Not to mention what's going on if you are staying with two classes of spanish students in the hotel.The breakfast is pure impudence, rubber-bread with burned coffee, a little butter and jam, that's all.I could hardly sleep one night. After four nights in Bayswater Inn I need some more days two recover.Not recommended!!!	
Nov 11 2004	The good the bad and the ugly	After having already booked this hotel (for late May) and then reading the reviews, I must say that I was very worried! My family (mom, aunt, and cousins, we were a group of 5 women) and I arrived after a very long overnight flight from the US at 6:30 am. We were told that our rooms (they don't have rooms to accomodate 5 people so we had two rooms) would not be ready until 3pm, my mom complained and then they said maybe by 1pm. So, we were left to wander the streets of London having had no sleep. We were told to leave our luggage in a room that resembled a chicken coop, this was a room that all of the guests had access to and therefore did not seem like a very safe place to leave any thing of value. We put our bags towards the back because it was relatively empty, but by the time we got back, the room was so full that we had to pull out a lot of other luggage just to get to our own! We got in our room at 1:30, the rest of the family did not get in until later. We were surprised by a number of things in the room... the bad: very, very small (granted, being from the US I am used to very spacious accomodations), very hot and stuffy (no ac), very hard bed, no washcloths (we had to buy our own); the good: extremely clean room and bathroom (with a clean tub), no bad smell, no bugs (even with the window open all of thge time) working window, nice size closet, not noisy, and an alarm clock. I was very relieved at how clean it was, after having read the reviews. The staff in the hotel were all from non-english speaking countries and were very hard to understand, we often just got blank stares when we asked things such as &quot;what time does the tube start running?&quot; The main concierge (the manager maybe) was extremely flirtatious, much to our aggravation. But he did confirm all of our tours for us, and made one mistake. You have turn in your key everytime you leave, maybe that is standard? I want comment on the breakfast as it is thoroughly covered here. This hotel had a wonderful location as it was just a short walk to the nearest underground (Bayswater Station). Others have said that it is in a bad neighborhood, but we did not have any probelms even when we were returning late at night. Someone on the street even volunteered to take a picture of the whole group so that I could get in the picture and didn't run off with my camera! All in all my stay in London was the best experience of my life and I can not wait to go back! Do not be afraid to ask people on the streets or in shops for directions, everyone is very accomodating! I would probably stay at Bayswater Inn again because it is inexpensive. However, if I had more money I would probably stay somewhere else. Afterall, you probably won't spend much time in your hotel!	
Nov 4 2004	Absolutly disgraceful.	It has to be the worst hotel ive ever been to, we didnt even stay 1 night, we checked out as soon as seen the rooms. They were musty, smelled of B.O and very dark and depressing. We litrally ran out of the hotel, i cant think of anything nice to say about the hotel, it was just a nightmare. You Have Been Warned.	
Oct 18 2004	Good cheap accomodation	It's not bad as most of the reviews. The room was small but clean. Good location. Not the best hotel I've ever seen, but I suggest it for a good, cheap accomodation.	
Sep 28 2004	get earplugs!!!!	it was one of the worst hotels I ve ever been to. The worst thing is that you have to wait for your neighbours going asleep...you you cannot sleep because of noise,noise,noise!!!get yourself another hotel. if you already booked the hotel, you should definately cancel it. or get the newest earplugs!!!!	
Sep 11 2004	If you can stay somewhere else!	I stayed at the Bayswater Inn in April 2004 for a school trip, and found it to be a terrible expirience. Our room was cramped and un-inviting, and had an odd smell to it. Our view was non-exsistent; even though my room had a window, we were located on the basement floor, and when looking out of our window, all we saw was an air shaft. Most unpleasant. The linens did not feel clean and the towels were small, almost to the point that they became useless. While the rooms have their own bathrooms, they are more like glorified closets- Big enough to stand in, and that's about it. On our second day there, my roomate and I also discovered an entire colony of ants had invaded the room, and we had to go around shaking our clothes and belongings out as the insects were so many, and they had gotten everywhere. The staff is rude and cold, it seems more so to their American tourists. They did not help when asked to, and on the rare occasions that they would aid a customer, it would be done in a begrudging, condescending manner. This offended me particulary, because being only 16 and staying for my first time abroad AND without my parents, a little help would have been greatly appriciated. The lobby, while the furnishing is nice enough, is just as cramped as the rooms. I also adive to bring your own breakfast, especially if you're not used to eating a roll and water-and that's it- for your first meal of the day, because otherwise you'll find yourself exceedingly hungry throughout the rest of the day. The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that it has a nice, central location, and it right across from some rather pretty gardens. However, it is not enough to make me want to stay here again. If you can stay somehwhere, do! The Bayswater Inn in not worth your time or money!	
Sep 2 2004	Enjoy your stay. - I don't think so!	I don't think I have ever had such an unhappy stay in a hotel. The moment I walked into the Bayswater Inn I wanted to walk out. I was staying in London for 3 nights, while working, and I should have just bought a sleeping bag and slept under my office desk! I thought people in who worked in hospitality were meant to be hospitable. Check in was a nightmare, the 'reception manager' was having an argument with a potential guest and didnt even acknowledge that I was there, and the person who did check me in was extremely rude and was unhelpful when I had questions. I walked into my bedroom and could have cried, what a waste of money. The carpet was dirty, the room was dingy and cramped, the bathroom was a glorified cupboard and the window was non-existant! My three nights sleep would have been more beneficial if I stayed awake. The room was not sound proof and the constant banging of the front door and other guest noises kept me awake. The bed was hard and uncomfortable - it was like sleeping on gravel. I did not venture into the dining room after seeing the state of my bedroom - the kitchen cant be all that much better!The only good thing about my stay was walking out the front door for the last time. I will never walk back in there again - even if you paid me!Being British I feel ashamed that tourists come to visit London and have their stay ruined by staying here. What kind of a friendly, hygienic, lovable image are we portraying to our foreign counterparts with a place like this? Ive lived in London while at university and now work in the city. I love the city and wish that others can feel the same way. How can they if they visit this so-called hotel outfit?I am so sorry to visitors to London who had to stay here and I would not recommend this for anyone to stay - not even dogs!	
Aug 4 2004	you get what you pay for	We spent 4 nights at the Bayswater. The room was spacious and clean enough. When I went to take a shower I noticed that there was no curtain on the bathroom window and the glass was clear not opaque. There were other buildings that had windows that looked into the bathroom. On mentioning this at reception the manager instructed a member of staff to show us a specific room (I can't remember the number). This room was no more than a broom cupboard with a window. The bathroom had no window. We decided that we were not giving up the room we were in to move to the alternative offered. (I get the feeling the girl was told to show us that room as a way of saying be glad of what you have).In the end I had to ask for another bath towel to use as a screen for the window in our bathroom.We had full english breakfast which was adequate.The staff were polite enough. After the 2nd night we found ants in the bathroom they were crawling all over the bathroom floor.The location was good for getting to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. There was also plenty of public transport available nearby.At the end of the day we really did get what we paid for (except the ants and the lack of curtain in the bathroom)	
Jun 28 2004	Bloody awful	Start to finish, it was horrendous. Rude staff, poor quality food, extra cramped room with no towels and leaking toilet. Management were extremely difficult. Never would I ever recommend this place to my worst enemy. Not to mention, overpriced. Awful ruined my trip to London.	
Jun 24 2004	Cockroaches--need I say more?	I stayed at the Bayswater Inn for 5 nights during the first week of June 2004. The location of the hotel is excellent. It's a short walk to Kensington Park and the nearest tube station is about 5 minutes away. However, that was almost all that was positive about the hotel. It was cheap, but next time I'd spend more money and stay at a better hotel--perferably one without cockroaches. It was disgusting to see them crawling on the floor in the middle of the night. When I woke before the sun came up and went to take a shower I could see them all over the floor.The sheets were not changed during the 5 nights we were there and the material was very thin and had holes in them. This, along with the hot nights, made the sheets unpleasant after a few nights.The staff seemed to have difficulties speaking English--which was funny considering it is a British hotel in London. They were friendly enough, but I had difficulty understanding them. The breakfast consisted of rolls (which sometimes were stale) and orange juice. There was a computer in the lobby where you could pay for internet access. The size of the room we had was decent (it was a three person room) on the second floor.	
Jun 21 2004	Very Rude Staff	My husband and I stayed here during our second visit to London. The location and the area surrounding the hotel were not bad. I don't mind hotels as long as the room is clean, the linens fresh and the staff friendly. Unfortunately, the biggest complaint we had was with the staff. They are very unfriendly and not helpful at all. Stay away from the breakfast staff especially! They are extremely rude and the breakfast was HORRIBLE. The man in charge was extremely nasty!! 	
Jun 15 2004	Not Bad	I stayed at the Bayswater Inn for 7 nights. We never had a problem with bugs (in fact the only time I saw them was in Hyde Park). The room was small, but wasn't terrible to be in. I liked that they had internet access in the lobby so that I could email my pictures to my family at home. The breakfast was plain and often the bread was hard, but there is a Starbucks around the corner and a grocery store not too far away. I found the conceirge most helpful when I had a booking problem with transfer to the airport. My only complaints were the hard bed (which I was generally too tired to care about) and the fact that we were right by the door to the hallway and the teenagers up the hall would fling the door open so it slammed up against our wall. But, overall I enjoyed my stay there. I loved London!	
Jun 11 2004	Great Deal for the Money!!!	This hotel is a great value for the money. Based on reviews on this site, I requested a twin room on an upper floor, away from the elevator. Our room was lovely and spacious. The private bathroom included a tub and towel warmer. The hotel has internet access for reasonable rates in the lobby, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I can not imagine getting a better hotel for these prices.	
Jun 8 2004	Its just your average hotel	Stayed in London for 5 nights Our room was clean. we were on the 4th floor.It was a average size. One thing is the beds are hard,feels like your sleeping a park bench. It was just averageLoved London!!!!!!!	
Jun 3 2004	be warned!	Please do yourself a favor and pay the extra money (as I will next time) and stay somewhere else. The rooms are run down, our sink was full of some sort of caulking material to plug a leak. When walking back to the hotel, we were nearly injured when pieces of the building's fascade came crashing on the sidewalk below. Worse then than the noise that came from the other rooms was the COCKROACHES that were found daily and this was in February! NO THANKYOU!	
May 19 2004	Average!!!	We are the lucky ones. My family and I stayed in this hotel in April 2004 and we found it fairly good. The room was clean, linen ok, the bathroom decent and the CH worked properly. Besides that, it has an excellent location. The breakfast was rather plain but you will survive. Remember, not only in London but everywhere else you get what you pay. 	
May 10 2004	Do not go to this dump	First of all, DO NOT GO HERE.When we first arrived we were due to check in at 12pm, we had to wait until 3pm until the rooms were &quot;cleaned&quot;.Staff were unhelpful &amp; unfriendly especially the breakfast staff. The breakfast consisted of a bread roll, watered down orange juice &amp; disgusting tea. The reaction we received when asked for a slice of toast from the waitress was rude &amp; unacceptable. After paying £3 for scrambled eggs, one of our group got violently ill.Even though there was four people staying in our room, they only supplied us with two hand towels and a measley bar of soap for a shower. The bed sheets were not changed, which is unhygienic. The manager was very rude &amp; we would never stay here again even if it was free!	
Apr 25 2004	Bad Experience	The staff at the hotel were pleasant enough, but not helpful. We were shocked because our room was terribly small and hot (no fan or air conditioning) the bed was hard and lumpy, and the sheets extremely scratchy. We had a tiny TV with only about 3 stations. The noise level in our room was terrible, we could hear every sound outside our room, laughing and doors slamming into the wee hours of the night! We were given only 2 bath towels, we asked for washcloths or hand towels and were told none were available. There were no amenities, save soap and TP in the bathroom. The Continental breakfast consisted of cold rolls (which were good and they were fresh), with your choice of butter and Jam, the drinks were watered down orange juice and instant coffee...most days we had to go out for breakfast! If ever we were to visit London again, I would certainly stay at a nicer hotel!	
Mar 13 2004	Lumpy beds noisy rooms	The hotel was brilliantly located - easy to get to from Heathrow, and then 2 tube stations down the road were so convenient. The area is lovely and quiet with a vibey main road just down the way. Hotel was OK for the price with a few exceptions - beds were diabolical - full of lumps. The rooms were noisy from the residents... make sure you get a room away from the lifts. The &quot;continental breakfast&quot; is a bit of a joke...coffee, a bread roll and watered down orange juice. I'd definitely stay in the area again, but I'd give another establishment a try.	
Feb 18 2004	Great value 	The location could not be better. Residential area with great local Pubs and ethnic restaurants and markets. Nice shopping mall and tube stations only blocks away. Room on ground floor was a nice size with 2 twin beds - 2 windows although they could not be opened. Nice large bathroom with wonderful heated towel bar and deep bathtub (great for soaking tired feet). Very clean. Breakfast was very basic - but optionals are not very expensive. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Excellent value for the money.	
Feb 11 2004	Good Enough!	I stayed here on a tour with my cousin's college in December 2001. The rooms were small but clean. I did see ants the one night but I was also on the basement room. The breakfast was not to good, as everyone else said very stale hard rolls! The couple that run the bar with the young bartender were very very nice and sweet. They made the stay bareable when I could'nt take all the college kids. I would stay there again with no problems.	
Feb 5 2004	Mixed feelings	Arriving at the hotel we were unpleasantly surprised to learn that our room had been double booked, and they had arranged for us to be transferred to another hotel for the first night. Obsiously this was very inconvenient and we let them know as much. Once we had recovered from this debacle however, we did in fact enjoy our stay there very much indeed. Had a large, clean room and all was perfectly in order.I've noticed that the reviews on this site are very mixed - people have generally had either very good or very bad experiences at Baywater Inn. I think this may be because of a wide disparity in the quality of the rooms. We were on the top floor, and may have been given one of the better rooms because we complained a lot after the mayhem on the first night. The rooms elsewhere in the hotel may not have been quite as nice (this is just a guess - I have no way of knowing. It kind of explains why peoples' experiences have been so different though).	
Jan 30 2004	Time for new beds	The hotel is conveniently located for its price. However, the beds were really uncomfortable!	
Dec 2 2003	Hated it	This hotel is as bad as the reviews. They do have a few nicer rooms but not for singles, but after three stays the rooms keep getting worse. This time round I was given a tiny room right next to the lift machinery room - which would switch on whenever someone used the lift. The room was in the basement even after I requested no basement room when booking. They said they didn't know anything about it and wouldn't move me as I would take up a room someone else could have. Nice! I will steer clear of this hotel in future and any other apparently 3* ones in Bayswater. In my opinion the hostel down the road is better value and quieter.	
Nov 26 2003	Stayed twice good and bad	I stayed in this hotel twice and had both a good and bad experience. My first booking was through lastminute.com and I was given an excellent room on the first floor with my own balcony and spacious bathroom. It was quiet and comfortable. The second visit I booked through their website and was given a small basement room. The bathroom smelt like a blocked drain and the shower was like a jet taking off and was so powerful it wet the whole bathroom and carpet everytime. Like any basement room you could hear some noise from upstairs. The breakfast was awful, I only had it once and it was just toast and stale rolls with watered down orange juice. However the staff were lovely to me both times. I would go back only if I didn't get a basement room and only paying their cheapest £35 a night rate.	
Oct 23 2003	great value	stayed there earlier this year. excellant hotel trying to book another break there at the moment.	
Oct 14 2003	Not as bad as the reviews!	Stayed here last weekend, room was very clean, it was basic but what are you wanting for a cheat deal! Not as bad as some of the reviews on here, think some people over-react on some things. Very close to underground although I personally didn't think it is walking distance to Oxford St and the likes.	
Oct 6 2003	very good value for money	I stayed here five days last week. I think it's really good value for money, considering it's London.£55 for a double room which was quite spacious, clean, nice bathroom, TV, phone, radio and hairdrier. Decent breakfast. And in such a nice area, very near the tube, in a lovely square 5 minutes walk from Notting Hill. The view from the window wasn't exceptional (on the roofs, very limited view of the sky).as I said, money well spent. will go back
