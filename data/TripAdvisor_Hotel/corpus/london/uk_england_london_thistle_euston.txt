	This is a 3 star hotel	I booked for 2 rooms through superbreak and was very disappointed with the dated room and especially the bathroom. My friends room was even worse with very dodgy electrics and although the tv was reported it didn't work no one acturally went to fix it.We had to ask for soap which you would think would be provided! and the shower curtain rail was placed above your head, so when you had a shower it stuck to your body!The bar was very expensive with 4 drinks costing £18! however the restaurant was very good and helpful staff.When we went down for breakfast the queues were horrendous, waithing a good 20 minutes! although breakfast itself was ok.No way is this a 4 star hotel! I will not be staying here again.	
Nov 24 2009 	OK - but not 4-star standard	I had a one night stay in this hotel on a Friday night, and I can't argue with the location - next to Euston railway/tube station so you have easy access to public transport, and if you feel like it Camden Town and the West End are an easy walk away.First impressions weren't good, the building is a rather ugly 1970s concrete carbunkle and the front desk weren't exactly efficient. I stood in a line for 20 minutes whilst the receptionists didn't have the confidence to tell the rude people who barged in ahead of us to go to the end of the queue. The elevators were small and cramped.The room was big, the bed comfortable, but again there was this air of tattiness. The furniture was old, scratched, scuffed, and there was the odd cobweb up in the cornicing. The windows were draughty, saved for the fact that there was a sliding inner window.Then I got woke up at 4am in the morning by the guests next door who were engaging in, ahem.....nocturnal activities.....either they were having a right old time of it, or the dividing walls are paper thin. Next morning, there was a lack of towels for my partner and I, and the quality of the bathroom furniture and floorcoverings were old, dated and not what I would expect from a 4-star hotel.Luckily I only paid £90 for the experience, but the full rate is closer to £200 per night. And there's the problem - the Ibis Euston St Pancras (a few hundred yards along the street) has a top line rate which is £80 cheaper. Admittedly, it's a 3-star, and OK, the fixtures and fittings are a bit IKEA, but it is just as clean, modern and probably quieter. Overall, the Thistle Euston wasn't bad bad, just it didn't deliver what I would expect from a 4-star hotel.	
Nov 19 2009 	Noce stay at the friendly Thistle Euston	We are regular leisure travellers to London. Coming from Cumbria, Euston is our station and the thistle was really handy. Right from the front desk on the staff were friendly and helpful. Depends what you pay I suppose, we had a good price via Superbreak. What do people want or expect from a London hotel? I think there are unrealistic expectations sometimes. If you want a nice, friendly well located (it was surprisingly quiet) London hotel this the one. It's not sparkly new, but then neither am I! We've been in about ten London hotels over the past three years and this was as good as most.	
Nov 19 2009 	Dated 	travelled with my teenage son for shopping trip stayed here for 3 nights. Room size was ok and clean, but not a deluxe room as stated on my booking, flat screen TV. Bathroom dated, no where to hang the towels in the bathroom, stains on room carpets. Very noisy through the night even though we were on the 4th floor. Location suited us as we used Euston to travel everywhere and its only a couple of mins walk from Euston station. Breakfast was ok, quick service. No waiting at the lifts. nice reception area. OK as a base but don't expect 4* . Worth it if you get a good deal.	
Nov 16 2009 	Not a four star hotel	I read several reviews beforehand and wasn't expecting much. The hotel is indeed tired and the rooms need updating badly. There were no washcloths in the bathroom and the temperature in the shower was difficult to get below scalding hot. The staff on the other had were quite pleasant, although there is no fitness centre and they had no advice on where to find one, even though there are at least two within easy walking distance. The wireless Internet service in the room kept losing the signal. I told the staff and they did not offer to refund the 10 GBP fee. Breakfast was average but the staff again were very pleasant. Although it is very near a train station the hotel is very quiet, which is a big plus for central London. I got a very good price for this hotel on line and would have been very disappointed had I paid 200 GBP which is the published rate. If you want convenience, the price is low, and you expect a two star room then you will not be disappointed.	
Nov 16 2009 	very close to Euston Station - pleasant staff	If location is of prime importance to you then this hotel is great - the twin room that we stayed in had a hairdryer, iron, ironing board &amp; tea &amp; coffee making facilities. The breakfast was buffet style with everything you would want to set you up for a day sightseeing/shopping	
Nov 14 2009 	Tired	For £170 plus per night I expect something a little smarter. Whilst the room was a good size it felt very tired. Poorly decorated, bathroom had seen better days. The lifts are very small and can't cope with the volume of traffic at peak periods. On the plus side, they serve a decent breakfast and of course it is well located. Food in Brasserie 43 was well cooked and presented but bar prices are extortionate.	
Oct 28 2009 	Nice hotel friendly staff good location.	I stayed here on business so wasn't paying the bill myself and hadn't stayed here previously. I have to say, on the whole, the hotel is very nice and the staff very polite (a word of caution - none of the staff seemed to be of British origin but all speak serviceable English). My room was on the first floor and was a bit of a trek from reception and located around a courtyard. I was expecting noisy (after reading some of the other reviews) but it was quiet and peaceful. There is a nice park adjacent to the hotel. The bathroom was spacious and there was a nice selection of toiletries. The concierge staff were very helpful when I left my bag and retrieval was quick and efficient on check-out. Breakfast was just about acceptable. I had two single beds in my room and had a comfortable night's sleep. There was a flat screen TV in my room which looked fairly recently installed. The tea and coffee tray was generously filled. Hard to find fault at £123 a night, including breakfast for central London. A good location if you are travelling via Eurostar or King's Cross/Euston stations and the British Library is a short walk away.	
Oct 25 2009 	I loved the Thistle Euston hotel!	We stayed at this hotel as part of our post-tour accommodation and I loved it - I was wishing we could stay for longer. The room was a good size and the decor was lovely, and the breakfast was great. The location is fantastic too.	
Oct 24 2009 	Don't stay at thistle euston!!	Our first room had no toilet paper and no air conditioner. They didn't even offer a fan. I asked about it and the receptionist said they would send a technician over to look at our room. I figured we just didnt know how to turn it on. It was miserably hot though and there was no way I could sleep in the room. The technician came over and said the floor and several others didn't have air conditioning right now and he didn't know when it would be fixed. The receptionists didn't even know about the floors having no air conditioning! There was no communication between the hotel at all! Anwyays we had our room changed and the second one had puke all over the floor by the nightstand!!! They didn't clean other room. Who knows if they even wash the blankets!@! Don't stay here it gets worse! The hotel doesn't know what customer service is either and wouldn't even help me carry luggage when I asked because we had to change rooms with lots of luggage and carry it many floors away. The hotel is also very unluggare friendly. Not enough room to carry the luggage on the side of you.	
Oct 24 2009	Very nice beginning and ending to our 12 day European Tour.	After reading so many bad reviews about this hotel, I was expecting the worst! I must have been in a different hotel! I found everything to be fine. Very helpful and friendly staff. Room small but clean and everything I needed was there. Location was great. Two tube stations within an easy walk, we could get everywhere in a fast and easy amount of time. Breakfast was good, plenty to eat. Ate dinner there one evening and it was quite good. Another evening we asked about an inexpensive place to eat . They suggested 4 local pubs. We chose one about 2 blocks away, don't recall the name but it was covered with beautiful flowers . We had fish and chips and and a drink....perfect!! Will go back again for sure!	
Oct 18 2009 	Worth staying if you get a good deal.	We stayed at thistle euston for 4 nights on a special offer (though my bank account)which only cost us £350 so i wasn't expecting very much as you usually get what you pay for. The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from Euston station which was handy for us after a long train journey. Upon approaching the hotel it did look quite tired and could really do with a lick of paint, reception area was nicely decorated and modern we didnt need to wait to get checked in (we arrived at 3pm which was the check in time stipulated on the reservation confirmation) we stayed on the 3rd floor. The hallway in the 3rd floor was very dark and could do with a bit of updating the room itself was a decent size for the price paid and had a flat screen tv along with a 2 seater sofa the decor was a bit old fashioned but not a big problem as we where only using the room for sleeping and showering our room was cleaned daily although we did notice on the last night our beds had not been made properly. The bar area was pleasent and modern staff where attentive we had breakfast 3 out of the 4 mornings staying which was included in the deal we had a good selection of hot and cold food to chose from and where offered tea coffee and toast as soon as we sat down, the standard of food was good. I would recommend this hotel if you can get it for the right price and breakfast included. Our stay overall was good and i would stay again, especially if the decor was updated in the bedrooms.	
Oct 18 2009 	Convenient and helpful	Stayed last weekend- attending a conference and stayed an extra night. Contacted hotel prior to my visit as was concerned about reviews on here saying how small single rooms were. Was given a double and in a quiet area. Very satisfied. Good breakfast and excellent service. Asked for a bathrobe and was given one within minutes. Great access to tube lines and Euston. Will definitely book if go to conference next year. Staff were lovely and helpful. Thankyou to all. Julie Foulds.	
Oct 13 2009 	a little tired round the edges but clean	After reading the previous reviews we were really apprihensive about going to this hotel. I wouldn't say it was a 4 star hotel. the reception area was clean and tidy. the restarant was clean and modern. the rooms were rather tired and in need of decorating. it was however clean. we were on the 3rd floor and next to the train station, we didn't hear any noise from this. it was a good location only a 2 minute walk from euston station. the hotel was ok for what we needed it for, we went for a city break so only used the room to get showered and changed in and to sleep at night.	
Oct 12 2009	NEEDS REFURBISHING	Affordable Tours booked us in this hotel as part of the package. When we got in the room, we had to change because there in no water and the room was so small!!! No airconditioning, only a very small Electric Fan! Imagine, a 4-Star hotel with a fan??? The carpet is too old and needs replacement. Furthermore, for breakfast, they only serve Continental Menu, but if you want some hot food like eggs, bacon, hotdogs, baked beans, then you need to pay extra.The hotel is also far from London center, so you need to use the Underground and walk some blocks to get to the hotel.This hotel should be categorized as 2 or 3 star only! Lobby is so small for a big group!	
Oct 7 2009 	Charming 	This was our first trip to London &amp; we found this hotel very charming and romantic. Our first room was very small &amp; being a bit claustrophobic, we had to change it to a bigger room. The staff was very helpful &amp; did upgrade our room for a bit more (which was very reasonable). The location of the hotel was close to the tube &amp; was very convinient. Over all had a great experience. Thank you	
Oct 1 2009 	Only if you get a bargain price	Paid £59 through lastminute.com as one of their 4**** secret hotels for a single room. It is located at the side of Euston station which was in walking distance from Kings Cross. The hotel looks a bit old and tired from the outside, the lobby is quite fresh and elegant.We arrived at 12 noon to check into our rooms, not a problem in many many 4**** hotels Ive stayed in. However it is a problem at the Thistle Euston (as I expected by the refugee camp they had hosted in reception) you cannot get your room any earlier than 2pm - forget it!They stored our luggage, when we did come back later, the room was small - but clean - I was really expecting a minibar, there was a space for one! Had a shower, the A/C was much appreciated, flat screen tv... Had breakfast the next morning, only because when we enquired at check-in the lady offered us vouchers for breakfast for £7.50, otherwise wouldnt have bothered. It took ages to get a table, firstly you have to pay (most hotels would charge you after breakfast) while they seat people behind you in the queue - then lots and lots of items had run out - and there was certainly no rush by the staff to replace them.We overheard a conversation by some other people that had paid the £193 rack rate, I couldnt imagine this, because whilst it was worth the £59 we paid per room, it certainly wasnt worth a penny more!	
Sep 30 2009 	only go on a special offer	We only stayed for 2 nights and was very worried after reading the previous reviews. But since we got it for 2 for 1 offer decided to give it a try since our tour ended in that hotel. So paid 208 pounds for 2 nights including buffet breakfast. They had both hot and cold available and a good selection. Tea/coffee wasn' t very good though, so we just had juice. Service was average. Rooms were average. Very old. Not very sound proof as you could hear people walking and vacuum cleaners going. If you would like to leave your luggage with the concierge to pick up later, be sure to do it before you check out as they charge you if you have already checked out - I think it was 2 pounds for each piece or something. It's about 400m walk to Euston Station. Overall, an ok stay but I won't be returning. I think you could probably find other more worthwhile places to stay.	
Sep 30 2009 	Tired hotel in need of updating	Rooms were small and tatty, although clean. Bathroom was again in dire need of complete overhaul, shower was not easy to get to required temperature.Staff seemed disinterested, and service was at best adequate.Very expensive for what you get, stayed in better budget accomodation, luckily I was staying only one night.Don't book this hotel you will be dissappointed.	
Sep 25 2009 	Ignore the bad reviews	The hotel was booked through my company and having read the reviews on this website, I would say i was a bit nervious about the stay.however, from the moment I got to the hotel (about 3 minute walk from London Euston) i was met with pleasant and helpful staff, given a spacious and clean room which had fresh laundry every day. however the hotel didn't miss out the smaller details, complimentary shortbread to enjoy with tea before bed infront of a nice selection of TV on the flat screen TV in every room.The beds are comfortable and extra pillows are avaliable for those who need that extra support.Dinner and breakfast are both very well presented and the waiting staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help.So ignore the bad reviews, Its not a 5 Star hotel, but for what it is there for its perfect.	
Sep 21 2009 	Not Great	Stayed for one night very much as a last resort. Room overlooked derelict buildings and suffered from noise from everywhere: train station opposite, people in rooms next door, rooms above, car alarms going off all night etc. Seemed as if whenever anyone used the loo, all the plumbing in my room started to shake. They have invested in the bathrooms but left the rest of the rooms alone and they feel very old and dated. That said, the investment seems to have been unplanned - they screwed a shower pole across the bath in my room - purpose: to suspend the bath plug over the tub !! Still, they do have beans on toast on room service.	
Aug 23 2009 	Do not stay here	The helpdesk staff were unhelfpul and did put forward an important reservation requestThe reception staff were rudeThe room was tiny and very dated, the bathroom was not cleanThe breakfast upstairs was cold and for veggies - had beans and toast, that was it.I would not go back.	
Aug 14 2009 	Single Travellers avoid like plague if you want comfort	I have just come back from an over night in this hotel - just as well is was just an over night. I had booked a deluxe double on a web site thinking it was a 4 * hotel. On check in I was given Rm 226 there was a narrow corridor into the room and a very small wardrobe right in front of you - turn into the room very dark small and claustrophobic went down to the desk and got moved to Room 342 again very small room but it had better light - luggage rack folded up against the wall no room to open it out. If you want to watch the TV in the bedroom, your case is on the small chair so you have to get into the bed and watch TV with you head at the end of the bed!! Went out for dinner and that night and after spent the night in, again had to lie down at the end of the bed to watch TV. Room exteremly hot and what the control on the wall was for I don't really know as it was far from air - conditioning so I spend a night in watching TV on the end of the bed and the room exteremly muggy. I must say breakfast was nice and the staff were friendly. It's a far cry from the standard of the 4* hotels in Ireland.	
Aug 7 2009 	fine hotel good location good price	stayed here two nights with 2 teenage boys on a superbreak deal. Room on the 3rd floor adequate for our needs, had a single bed each. Very clean, bathroom in good condition and large flat screen tv. Quite noisy from the station but we did have the window open. Staff friendly and breakfast good. Had feared the worst after reading previous reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Would go again as had got a very good deal	
Aug 3 2009 	Tired hotel- very tired	The hotel is quite close to Euston station however it sits in the deadzone of North/central London. There are no bars, points of interest within 1mile of the hotel itself. The rooms are very tired. We stayed in a upgrade Double deluxe and to be honest their rooms are the same quality as the likes of Travel Lodge. The shower was woeful and fixtures etc looking like they had been there since the early 90's at least. We drove/parked under the hotel and I was utterly amazed at the access. There were a great deal of marks/gouges on the walls where drivers had caught their cars. Access is very very tight. I wouldnt recommend driving anything bigger than a Golf down there. You will either get stuck or damage your car. Even though we had booked a double-Deluxe we were told in the morning that we werent on the list for breakfast, which with hindsight I wish we werent. Positives? The lobby is very nice (80's marble-effect?) but beyond that there are far nicer hotels in London to stay at. In a nice way- avoid. It looks like a Holiday Express Inn in 20yrs time.	
Jul 28 2009 	Do not stay at this hotel	This is a motel quality hotel is not worth the approximately $250 USD per night rate. Terrible housekeeping - first room I checked into had used, wet towel in the bathroom and bad plumbing. Moved to another room , only to discover hairs on the sheets - apparently because the sheets were not changed. Asked for a wake up call, and the phone kept ringing - approximately 5 hours before the scheduled wake up call. Detachable shower head had hairs stuck in it. Also, the location is not convenient unless you have to be at Eustom station very early. There are no convenience stores, restaurants, or anything else nearby (to get water, snacks, etc.) and the guest shop inside the hotel only takes cash. Overall, totally overpriced for what you are getting.	
Jul 26 2009 	Nice stay - great location	Was apprehensive considering previous reviews but I thought it was nice. I got upgraded to an executive room so that might have helped. Bathroom was nice, with a nice strong shower, comfy beds and a good tv. Breakfast in the morning was great, lots of options and lots of it. It was also very easy to find from London Euston - which is useful for the geographically impaired.Nice place to stay all round	
Jul 22 2009 	Never again	The location of the hotel is ok and it's reasonably clean. And that's about it.The rooms are laughably small and crowded, the bathrooms are tiny, staff is not helpful, breakfast is a joke for the price, mattresses were old etc.The Ibis up the road looked a lot better. Never again.	
Jul 19 2009 	Awefulplease avoid...	Great Location, Thistle Name is overall good, but this hotel is a nightmare. Worst rooms, a maze to find it...moreover the staff are not welcoming. I would recommend that to enjoy the area, stay at the Ibis next door!	
Jul 11 2009	Okay but I'd stay at the Ibis hotel next door	Upon arrival at the hotel we were given keys to rooms that were still in use by other hotel visitors TWICE. We were upgraded to a special room however the only difference was an extra carpeted area. The rooms were pretty clean, old but only needed a place to sleep. The location was very good, right across from train and tube station, food places. Water in shower was very hot and uncontrollable. Breakfast was pretty good (bacon, eggs, sausage, toast, rolls, cheese, eggs, beans, tomato) but there was a breakfast cop who would only seat you when your whole party was down to breakfast so you couldn't eat until everyone from your room was there. Room walls were quite thin and could hear noisy neighbours. VERY expensive to use the telephone in the room. NO phones in the lobby or internet (they have a nice area at the Ibis next door) and no newspapers available in the lobby. Staff was mediocre. It was an okay place but I'd suggest staying somewhere else, the Ibis next door looked really nice.	
Jul 2 2009 	Disappointing	On arrival at 1pm we were told the hotel had been overbooked and if we wanted a room at that time we would have to pay extra for a deluxe room, or come back at 5pm when a room would be ready. After travelling we decided to pay the extra and as it was a romantic weekend thought it would be great to get a nicer room. I would hate to think what the standard bedrooms were like as this was a box room! Situated right above the Taxi rank on the first floor, it was noisy with the guests arriving/ leaving and the train station. The room had soap and towels but no toilet roll, there was no tea/coffee facilities and the air conditioning was broken, and at the end of June in London it was very hot and humid. We were told that we would probably not get breakfast (we had paid for it) as the hotel was very busy and we would have to be up extremely early to get in the Q. We did use the hotel restaurant once and i must say the food was excellent altho the service was very slow and we requested the dessert menu - we are still waiting!The location was OK to find if you had a map, the area wasnt so great but if you need somewhere basic and quite expensive to stay then this is your hotel!	
Jun 16 2009 	Do not stay here.	The reception is a nice area. The upstairs is absolutely dreadful however. Two of the floor tiles in our bathroom were not actually attached to the floor. There were no little shampoos and shower gels - there wasn't even soap at the wash hand basin. Location wise, it is on a dark little street and the flats around the corner would give you no confidence to be wandering around. I would absolutely never stay here again. the receptionist and barman on the night we arrived were pleasant if dozy. The receptionist told us the 2 bars were open til 12.30am while one of them actually closes at 11pm. The breakfast room staff were nice and did seem to know what they were at.	
Jun 6 2009	lost?!	The outside of the hotel and the lobby are well presented, but don't let that fool you. The hotel rooms are cramped, the batroom is dated and the bath had rusty taps, and the drains smelt bad. Try to find the room was not so easy. We arrived on the 4th floor then went down to different corridors, through one door, up the stairs then down another corridor! It was great exercise, especially lugging a couple of 20kg bags up a flight of stairs because there wasn't a lift on that floor!	
Jun 5 2009 	never stay again ever	very unfriendly staff dirty beds very expensive rates not worth going never again	
Jun 3 2009 	Thistle Hotel - Only at the last resort!	We arrived at the hotel early at around 11.30am and asked if we could check in. The receptionist took our details (name and booking info) and said the room would be available at 2pm onwards and said we could leave our belongings with the concierge and come back later when we were ready. We did this because we had a thames cruise booked with family at lunch time. After the cruise finished we made our way back to the hotel at around 4.30pm only to be told our room had been double booked. This didn't seem to bother the receptionist too much as she told us to speak to the duty manager. Arrangements were made for us to be moved to the Bloomsbury Park Hotel. A Cab was called but the driver didn't know where to go even though it was just around the corner - it took 30 mins to eventually find the hotel. Our room was at the top of the hotel and was far below the standard of our original booking (Deluxe 4*) - the room was sandwiched between two other rooms with only a door to separate them. Wallpaper was peeling away from the walls and in general was poorly kept. We got the distinct impression this was used in emergencies or used to house staff. Definitely 4* not a deluxe room. Thistle Hotels have definitely performed well below their brand values and well below what I expected. I honestly feel sorry for them and especially anyone else who is thinking about staying at a Thistle hotel. Be warned, a cardboard box would be more comforting! The actual week end was brilliant but the hotel was totally unacceptable especially the manner in which we were dealt with. I definitely will never use a thistle hotel again.	
Jun 2 2009 	COmfortable but overpriced!	We stayed here for one night before picking up a tour that left from the hotel next morning. It looks very posh in reception so expected great things, but the room was disappointing. It needs a few maintenance jobs - e,g. doors off hinges and a good clean. It was quiet though. It is not too far from St Pancras station, which we walked from to the hotel with our backpacks and bags. Beds were comfortable and rooms a good size. Breakfasts were good too with lots to choose from. As we had an early start next morning, we didn't get the chance to explore around the hotel and find out what else was close by. But otherwise, everything okay. We dined in the restaurant - great food and service. generally though, it is overpriced considering our room needed a few minor repairs and as we arrived late, couldn't be bothered asking for another room.	
May 24 2009 	Okay hotel	Stayed there with my son for three nights (the third night free-offer). Nice and clean hotel. Nice and clean room. view was not the best but we didnt visit London to look through a hotelwindow. Outside the hotel its smelled like a horse stable, but we found out that the London zoo was close to the hotel. Okay breakfast (not 4 star) but in the small room in the cellar. All in all a nice and clean hotel close Euston Tube station.	
May 22 2009 	Great hotel	We were pleasantly surprised to find out the hotel wasn't all that bad, after the stories told on this site. Actually, the rooms are very clean, not big, but not too small. They look cosy and warm. The beds, breakfast, service were also great. Its 5 minutes walk to Euston Station. Would surely stay here again!	
May 18 2009 	Tired noisy and impersonal	The hotel is located close to Euston's mainline train station, that's about all I can say in it's favour. One person on reception, so customers trying to book in or have any other issues dealt with were made to wait. The door card didn't work first time so had to traipse back to reception and wait again for another card, which this time worked, no words of apology at all. The view from the window was pretty grim too, a unnattractive Network Rail building with a sight of the railway tracks beyond. It was also pretty noisy through the poorly glazed windows. The bar was also short staffed, one member of staff only clearing tables, pulling pints and dealing with the food orders. Overall nothing uch to recommend in this hotel and I won't be in a rush to go back there.	
May 13 2009 	Pretty average needs a revamp noisy	Stayed in this hotel for 5 days. Pretty average hotel for London, rooms ok but rather cramped. I was situated next to a service lift which went on all night making a loud noise. I sleep through this very easily as I am a heavy sleeper so did not require to be moved rooms but others found it awful. One of my colleagues changed rooms six times due to a mixture of rooms without working heating and being situated next to lifts / stairs Breakfast was ok, location pretty good for Euston station. Wouldn't stay there again.	
May 11 2009 	Tourist group hotel	The great part about this hotel is the location. It's central and is located at convenient distance from attractions in London. The rooms are modest and clean, unfortunately the only problem is the noise caused by the dozens of tourist groups. SO if you can ignore the morning rush at breakfast time, it is actually quite a pleasant stay.	
May 8 2009 	Terrible - completely overpriced for what is on offer.	We were apparently in the deluxe room, in the back of the hotel. The room was completely cramped and all the fittings and furnishings were extremely dated.Totally unimpressed and very disappointed considering price and misleading website.	
Apr 29 2009 	Second time around a much better visit	My firm's travel office booked me back in the Euston Thistle and I had major reservations about staying there after my previous experience.I was upgraded to a double room on the 3rd floor which was in a much better state than my last tiny room on the second floor. This time the room was what you would reasonably expect in decor, facilities and size. The TVs are large LCD and offer a good range of channels including Sky 1.The reception staff were again excellent. However, i did not push my luck and eat in the hotel resturant after my very disappointing experience last time - maybe on the next visit! A much better stay this time around.	
Apr 29 2009 	Excellent value through lastminute.com secret hotels	Got a single room (which had a double bed) through lastminute.com's secret hotels. Guessed which hotel it was based on their description and saw that the tripadvisor reviews were very poor. I was perfectly satisfied with this hotel. It is right beside Euston so within easy reach on the tube to all london attractions, but the area around the hotel is what you'd expect around a main station rather than a historical area. The value was amazing, and although the lastminute booking didn't mention breakfast, I was given a full breakfast. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff very friendly. Granted the place is a bit run down and furniture and carpeting are old, but it is clean and if you get a good price it really is excellent value in central london. So it's all down to the price - if you are getting a single for £80 or a double for £100 you can't do much better than this, but at their rack prices you'll end up paying 4* prices for a 2 or 3* experience.	
Apr 28 2009 	Decent Hotel for London standards	Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, the staff was friendly, with the exception of one of the waiters during breakfast. The location is great.The rooms were clean, there was a bit of noise in the morning but i've had much worse.For London standards this was a good hotel for a fair price.	
Apr 27 2009 	There is NOTHING WRONG with this Hotel !!	Having read all of the poor reviews for this Hotel I was more than a little uneasy when I arrived to check in for one night on Thursday 23 April 2009. However I cannot see how some of these reviewers have reached their verdict - were they in a different hotel to me ? The room which I was given was a single so it was smallish but perfectly adequate and clean. Bathroom fine plenty of hot water and towels and toiletries. As my room had a connecting door to the next one I could hear their TV but it was not intrusive at all. I did not have to queue for breakfast at all and the food was plentyful and fine but when I came out at 8-30 there were about 5 people waiting to be seated. I have got to say that this is not the best hotel I have stayed in but it was a long way from the worst. Nothing at all wrong with it.	
Apr 27 2009 	ok for the price	recption staff very efficient as many people arrived at the same time.Our room on 2nd floor overlooked a backyard with the aircon units which were very noisy if you left the window open at night. The matress was torn but the bedding was very clean as was the room and bathroom. The room was areasonable size ,bigger than the Russell,the Ambassadors and the Holiday inn.The breakfast was good and was hot ,the staff in the dining room were attentive .I would say we had good ,friendly service.However Iwould not rate this hotel as 4star. but it was good value for what we paid for the whole package of firstclass rail travel and the hotel	
Apr 27 2009 	Definately not 4*!	I got a special deal on 2 rooms at this hotel - thank goodness I did. If I'd have paid full price I'd have been REALLY disappointed. Reception staff weren't all that helpful, rooms were tiny and smelt funny. For the price I paid I wasn't too disappointed as the location was good but if I'd have paid full price I would have been very annoyed.	
Apr 26 2009 	Glad I wasn't paying!!	The hotel itself is convenient for Euston station - about a 5 minute walk. The service as good - I had a couple of requests which were dealt with efficiently. The evening meal in the restaurant was lovely and breakfast was plentiful if a little cold. The main issue I had was with the size of the room - TINY!!! It was very clean and modern but there was very little room to move around. The advertised rates were £200 per night - I would have been gutted if I had been paying!!	
Apr 23 2009 	Disappointingly dirty	On the positive side, the breakfast (which was included in our price) was quite satisfying and, although it seems a bit out of the way when you first look at a map, the hotel's location is fairly convenient and accessible from a couple of underground stations.On the negative side, this hotel was filthy. Our &quot;non-smoking&quot; room stunk of smoke. Perhaps most suprisingly, the towels smelled the worst, so it's not like it was just the room had a smell left over from the hotel's smoking days. Really, I don't understand what they do to the towels, but apparently they don't wash them. The hairs on the bed sheets were equally disturbing. For the price, this hotel is not worth it. You can find much better accomodations elsewhere.	
Apr 22 2009 	WOULD NEVER go to this hotel again!	Breakfast was a shambles - tables full of dirty pots and nobody to clear them sometimes for as long as 25minutes. This was whilst a long queue of disgruntled guests were waiting and some of them gave up!	
Apr 16 2009 	Worst hotel we have stayed at in London. Definitely not 4 star.	If other reviewers have had decent rooms then what happened to ours? Small cramped room on the 4th floor, 3/4 bed pushed up against a wall, ( how my husband and myself managed in that bed remains a mystery) nice clean sheets but no top cover on the bed, threadbear carpets, holes in curtains, dirty windows and the shabbiest furniture I have ever seen. The bathroom was tiny with stains in the bath. One bath towel and one hand towel between us. Toiletries were cheap rubbish. The hairdryer was pretty much useless I only had it turned on for 1 minute at a time and it switched itself off, having to wait another 4 minutes for it to come back on. FREEZING DRAFTY BEDROOM. Could hear heavy traffic all night apparantly not from Euston Station but from a delivery depot at the rear of the hotel. Only managed a couple of hours sleep.Breakfast was reasonable but unfortunately we were served with green mouldy toast which of course we sent back. Thank god we were only there for one night. This was booked through a reputable large well known travel agent and was not cheap so need to take up matters with them.Would we go again NEVER. More like 2 star.	
Apr 13 2009 	Second time round	The last time we had the problem with the breakfast line. It was ridiculous. Standing, waiting and waiting. Definitely not for the elderly or frail. One old man had to give up. I guess he figured at his late stage in life he's only got so many years left and quite frankly the experience of the cramped waiting area left him looking quite ill. That was bad enough, but when we eventually got in we noticed that despite the amount of hotel staff present, there were loads of tables that simply hadn't been cleared and remained so right through our meal. That was really annoying.Otherwise we had no problems.This time round we decided to escape the breakfast problem by opting for the breakfast to be delivered to the room. It arrived, on time, but the disadvantage being that one can't actually 'pig-out' in preparation for a long day like would be possible at the restaurant.I found the sausages were, by the time the got to us, barely luke warmish, yet the croissant, which I kept till last was warmer.There is now a large sign at the reception warning guests about possible delays over the breakfast and the hotel has now devoted another eating area to combat this issue. As we left we saw no ques.Oddly, our room stank of smoke. Disgusting really. Next morning I noticed it was coming from the bathroom. The noise levels from the trains were far greater than we noticed first time round and the sounds from the adjoining room were too clear, i.e. I could hear the lady next door brushing her teeth, sitting on the loo, lifting the lid of the bin, putting something in..... everything and including her phone conversations.The shower in our room however was a joy to have. Brilliant.	
Apr 6 2009 	Better than most four-stars so why have reviewers got this one wrong?	Handy location for buses, tubes and trains, smart reception, attractive rooms and a pleasant view. On my experience (over a hundred four-star hotels in the past five years) this is definitely among the top 25%. I'd only booked because the rate was just GBP70 but having read the reviews after booking I was expecting nothing short of squalor. tripadvisor's never been wrong for me before so what's going on here? Well maybe a grudgeful competitor but more likely the rooms just vary a lot, perhaps some are in better condition than others. At first glance mine looked to have been refurbished during the previous few months, though on closer inspection maybe it had been a few years. Certainly some of the rooms overlook a little park (which the local Council were busy refurbishing with colourful flowers) while others overlook the side of Euston station, bit like the Berlin Wall.If you're in London on holiday/vacation, this hotel will never be the highlight of your visit. But get a decent room and it's better than many of its competitors. I could name plenty of London four-stars I wouldn't stay at...	
Mar 28 2009	Amazing time	Whoever said this is a scam is just stupid!!! The thistle Euston doesnt look very nice from the outside but it a beautifull hotel. Rooms are lovely with a big t.v,and the food is to a very good standard,staff are very good also! It's a really good location in London just 5mins from kings cross. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone and im booking to back fabulous weekend!!	
Mar 27 2009 	Don't stay there... Better hotels in area	( Room 205) small room, terrible bed (felt springs in mattress) Bottom of bed less than 1 foot from wall, no tissues, washcloths, or ice buckets. Staff has no idea about tour amenities or packages. Resturant service slow.. . Not a good place for 20th anniversary or anything else.  Having American Express look into credit card chargesDidn't see anything like the pictures shown here about the roomsAdvantage, next to Euston station for easy tube access	
Mar 26 2009 	What a scam	STOP. Do not book this hotel. What an absolute scam at $400 per night!! The lobby and bar look fine on entering, but the rooms are terrible. Ours was described as de-luxe. Would have hated to see the standard room. Could not swing a cat in the room. The queen size bed took up 75% of the room which left a couple of square feet for standing. Decor was old and shappy. Furniture was 30 year old junk. Bathroom was outdated with dirty tiles and smelled of sewage. If you want internet access, they charge an extra 10 pounds a day.We had booked a queen room, and originally we were given a twin, had to go back to lobby, where staff started to argue that we had booked a twin. Very poor customer service.If you continue to book this hotel you will be sorry.	
Mar 25 2009 	Good value for money	I booked this hotel at lastminute.com, and stayed there for 3 nights. The singleroom I got was a bit small but in very good condition. The bed was very comfy, and the location is exellent. Just a 2-3 minute walk from Euston Train Station. On the downside I have to say that the bathroom was very, very small!Even I who is quite tiny found it difficult to move in there.I can't say that the hotel is a 4-star hotel, but it was good value for money and I will may use it again	
Mar 24 2009 	Absolutely awful	Booked this hotel as a last minute and being in the travel industry for 5 years i knew thistles are known to have a good reputation so thought this hotel; would be at a good standard............i was wrong. The hotel itself is in a real; run down area and overlooks back yards, on check in the receptionist was very unknowledgeable and had us panicing as we had booked off last minute.com she said that sometimes you book it and pay for it and then there isent any rooms so shed have to check and if not we couldnt stay there!!! so obviously this put a downer on things staright away and if i hadnt of worked in the travel industry and of lknown thats not right, poor other customers would have been at their wits end!. The room was very run down with dirty towels but the beds were comfy which i guess is the only plus i have to say! Also this hotel; has plenty of car parkign spaces which is anothwer plus and the location is ok, however for future referencde to others id reccomend the ibis next door as it is lovely or the park inn euston.	
Mar 23 2009 	Absolutely no problems	Stayed for 1 night at the Thistle with my 15 year old daughter for a theatre break.The hotel was perfectly adequate for our needs.Not luxurious, but clean and well run with friendly staff.Despite being full there was no significant queue for breakfast and the room was well equipped with extra bedding.Breakfast was good .Overall better than expected and as efficient as some more expensive hotels I have stayed in .Close proximity to Euston tube was useful.	
Mar 23 2009 	not bad...	i stayed here for one night as part of a business trip. it is an excellent location - 2 mins walk to euston station. the reception staff are pleasant, and the standard double room was adequate for my needs - a good 3 star i would say. no luxuries - i'm glad i wasn't paying as it was quite expensive even with the corporate discount.i got a letter from reception inviting me to an 'informal drinks gathering' which i went to and was given a free drink of my choice - they've got a big screen showing footie etc, and the bar food was nice, if a little pricey.only probs i had with the room were i couldn't work the air conditioning out so was a bit cold, and there weren't any spare blankets/duvets etc - no doubt i could have rung down to reception to sort, but to be honest i couldn't be bothered.also halfway through the night i was woken up by a really loud banging for ages, not sure if it came from outside or somewhere in the hotel..breakfast the next morning was ok - good selection - but the bacon and sausage were very salty, and i never got offered any toast.when i was leaving the breakfast room (at 7.30) there was a huge queue of people waiting to be seated.. surely they'd think ahead to accomodate these people as they already know how many to expect!!i doubt i'd stay here again unless i wasn't paying. i prefer to spend a bit more and get something a bit nicer.	
Mar 21 2009 	I cant believe this is classed a four star hotel	On arrival we were pretty excited as the reception told us that the hotel was busy so we'd been upgraded to a deluxe room. Id hate to see a standard. My friends had to get there bedding changed as there were weird stains on them. A deluxe room comprised of two single beds more or less joined together. We were also told that breakfast was really busy between 9 and 10, what they forgot to say was that we'd be almost cued back to the top floor and the restaurant was in the basement. Once we finally got seated for our breakfast, we had to cue again because the hotel either ran out of breakfast and were waiting on the next batch or they ran out of plates. Although the staff were friendly and the breakfast was nice once we actually got it, i would strongly recommend not to stay at this hotel.	
Mar 19 2009 	There's only one way to put it - smelly....!	1st impresion was great, nice reception and helpful staff. Then I went to my allocated room. As soon as i opened the door there was a damp muggy smell. Lasted about 10 minutes and thought I'm not paying for this. Reception very hepful and moved me to another room. Obviously had the same problem as the cleaners had tried very hard to hide the smell by overpowering the room in air freshner!!! As it was late and I couldn't access my works travel agent, stayed the night, but never again. Also the room service meal which was promised in 30 mins took an hour and they didn't bring what I had ordered. Not worth the money.	
Mar 15 2009 	Very tired substandard hotel-if this 4*star I would n't like to stop in a Thistle 3*	I stopped here for one night in a supposedly Deluxe Double Room attracted by the location and full English Breakfast.I was warned on arrival that the Breakfast Room would be busy between 9-10am which did not worry me as I intended to breakfast at 8am. On arrival at the Breakfast room I was greeted by a disgruntled queque of about 30 people most of whom had been waiting sometime . I was then told that in the hotel bar you could get a continental breakfast . Here there was one poor hardworking server trying to deal with about 30 tables, so he could not clear tables properly, serve drinks and keep the buffet with food. There was very little food available.The room was very small, tired looking, had only one towel, and the television did not work work.I stopped on the fourth floor and while I had minimal luggage there were plenty of people with luggage trying to access what appeared to be the only lift (small).I asked at reception about making a complaint and could I talk to somebody,I was reluctantly handed a feedback form. As I was in a hurry I could not pursue the matter furth. This kind of place makes me very angry as it pretends to be a proper hotel -giving the British Tourist Industry in our capital city a bad reputation-Travel lodge, Premier Inn etc would be a much better option.	
Mar 11 2009 	Quite dissapointed	The hotel room was quite dated with large stains on the carpet, the bathroom was also looking tired. The location was good as just a 2 min walk to Euston station. The breakfast was nice, large selection. I wouldn't stay for longer than 1 night as the bed was uncomfortable - it did the job for our theatre break.	
Mar 5 2009 	I guess we were just lucky!	I really dont know what people moan about at this hotel. Its FINE!!! Location is perfect 2mins from Euston Station and we heard no noise whatsoever!The only problem we has was we tried to check in early about 12pm and they asked us to come back at 2pm which was what we expected anyway so our luggage was safely locked away.When we returned at about 5pm our room had been cancelled(!)but the quickly re-instated it for us no no drama there!Our room was on the ground floor no.60 very clean wide screen tv heating hairdryer fully functioning bathroom so was fine.Cleaned everyday beds nice and hard and a fully stocked tea and coffee bar!We were warned about the ques at breakfast by reception but still went down at 'peak time' 9am and the longest we qued was about 10mins so agin so major drama there either! Breakfast was of a good choice buffet style hot and cold all fine!Went to see Wicked again and Chicago both FABULOUS!!And also the London Dungeons which was great fun for all!so to sum up the hotel is FINE do not listen to these nit picking grumps on here ok its not a 4* but for what you pay certainly good value for money its clean and the location is perfecto! do not worry if you have already booked here at all!	
Mar 3 2009 	Lousy location poor information sharing	The Thistle Euston is located on a turn in the road near Euston Station. I frequently saw cars cross the white line in the road while racing around the corner. I'm surprised i didn't see and accident. It's also located directly above the station so we heard announcements and trains all day and night. The room was terribly small with barely enough room to get past the bed and a set of chairs and tables which made it difficult, if not impossible to open the drawers.The room was clean enough and the cleaning staff was very pleasant. Our first night we went to breakfast and were told it was not included. We knew it was and they called the front desk. They confirmed it was. The breakfast was less than pleasant and we suffered cramps for the next few hours. The fried eggs were disgusting, the scrambled eggs incredibly dense, and the toast, typical for teh UK, stone cold. They also had sausage, yoghurt, and other extras, but most of it was, at best, adequate. On my second morning I again went to breakfast only to be told it was not included. A call to the front desk proved no help and I was directed there. They produced a sheet saying so and which also said I booked through Expedia. We didn't. I only wanted a piece of bread anyway so I went to a local bakery up the way instead.There are several shops and restaurants nearby, but they don't look overwhelmingly of decent character. Most are vegetarian Indian. There are several buses coming up Tottenham Ct. Rd to Hamstead Rd, inlcuding night buses, but the walk to the hotel is a bit dodgy at best. The hotel was a good price for what we paid online. The rack rates are definitely not worth the level of service or location. We paid roughly $100. Rack rates started 200+ POUNDS, ($280!). I would not stay here again nor recommend this hotel.	
Feb 19 2009 	not a 4star	booked a weekend away in london on internet with rail travel from york, this hotel was ferther out of the center than we thought, 1 st check in was terrible we got there and they was 2 people in front of us and then suddenly a coach party came in and all just went to desk they was no organasation, only 2 very small lifts so had to weight 10 min to get to our floor, room was plesant but not what i would class as a 4 star , but it was the bathroom that let it down sink had a deep crack right from one side to the other and the toilet seat was broken was not very clean also bot is was a bed for the 2 night and it was cheep would spend a little extra next year and get a hotel more central	
Feb 19 2009 	Much better than we had expected	We stayed at this hotel as part of a weekend rail and hotel package. Our original hotel had been changed from the Thistle Grosvenor at Victoria to the Euston and having read the TripAdvisor reviews I was a bit apprehensive. I needn't have been. Arriving at Euston it was ideally situated. Go diagonally across the station concourse to the r/h side - exit by the Melton Street entrance and turn right into Cardington Street. The hotel is about 400 yards down the road - past the Ibis and the little park. Fom the grey exterior it looked a bit forbidding but the interior is fine. The reception staff were welcoming, quick and efficient. Our twin bedded room was a reasonable size. The bathroom is a bit cramped but it was adequate. The room and bathroom were spotless and there were two sets of towels. Also extra pillows were in the wardrobe - a pleasant change from having to ask for them. A bedside light bulb wasn't working and the concierge arranged a replacement whilst we were out. We also realised that the heating wasn' t working. Again, the excellent concierge asked if we would like to change our room or have an electric heater. We chose the heater - which was extremely effective. The beds were very comfortable and furnishings were modern.Although the nearby Ibis Hotel offered a 'seasonal buffet' at £7.95 a head we decided not to go out again and to eat in the hotel. Vouchers for free glasses of wine had been left in the bedroom which were an extra inducement! The menu was reasonably varied, we had no complaints about the food and the presentation was good. Staff were pleasant and efficient and at about £25 a head for three courses it was good value. Reception had warned us about the 9am - 10am queues for breakfast. Although we intended to get there earlier it was 8.45am before we arrived after a lie in. There was a short queue but we were seated within 7 minutes. On the Sunday mornng the queue was longer but we were still seated within 10 minutes, but as we were leaving the queue was quite long. Moral of the story is don't leave it too late to get there!. The choice was reasonable although not quite as good as the Hilton hotels! More fruit to go with the cereals (grapefruit etc) would have been nice. The bacon and sausage were good - tomatoes were undercooked but few hotels get those right. Mushrooms were disappointing and the scrambled egg nothing to write home about, but the fried eggs were fine. Having said that we had a good breakfast and had no real complaints - especialy not about the service. Also the orange juice was good - not the usual watered down hotel juice - and the pomegranate juice was an unusual option.It wasn't 4 star luxury but then we weren't paying for 4 star luxury and what we did get was really good value.An extra tip - if you are staying here and intending to go to the British Museum - don't get the underground. It is only a 20 minute walk from the hotel.	
Feb 16 2009	Imagine my disapointment	We booked this hotel as a 'top secret hotel' from lastmin.com. This was a blind booking but was supposed to be a luxuary 4 star hotel in the centre of london. We thought we'd treat ourselves rather then stay in a Travel lodge. The lobby was very promising, but our room was shocking!!This was absoutly the most disapointing hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was tiny and very tired and shabby. The bed was very uncomfertable, as were the covers. I didn't dare have a bath as there was years of grim round the tap end and the bathroom was all falling apart to you can only imagine how much dirt was trapped in all the cracks and chipped off bits. I switched off the air conditoning as it was very noisy, only to find that there was a loud noise emmitted from watter pipes in the ceiling/walls I presume every time one of our nieghbours flushed their toilet. It was loud enough to wake us up everytime! It was £6 an hour extra for internet connection! My advise would be DONT BOOK THIS HOTEL! We would have been 1000 x better off in a travel lodge/ibis/ travell inn because at least they have standards that they keep too and don't pretend to be something they are not. They also maintain thier hotels.	
Feb 16 2009 	Good location for Theatreland visits	We booked this hotel for a one night stop over to see Hairspray on 12th Feb due to it being very near to Euston underground station with good links to Theatre Land (in our case Shaftesbury Avenue) via the Northern line. We drove up because the hotel boasts a number of underground parking spaces accessed via a slip ramp at the side of the hotel, but the route to the parking is rather tight. Be warned not to take a long vehicle! Costs for parking are currently £20 per 24hour period arranged via the concierge. The staff are very warm, welcoming and professional...absolutely no complaints at all. The public areas all seemed well decorated and clean &amp; tidy. Our room, on the 4th floor, was an average size for a city centre hotel, but showed some signs of wear and tear, being in an older section of the premises the structure of which probably dated back to the 1930's. The wallpaper and ceiling could all do with refreshing, and the windows are quite old steel framed single-glazed &quot;Crittall&quot; type units with some flaky paint and limited opening. The carpet was fine and the limited furniture was functional and plain, but otherwise adequate. Similarly the bathroom is compact, utility grade, a little worn but very clean, and fine for a short break. The only other thing to note is the air conditioning. This heats / cools the room and is modern, quiet and adequate.The room was nice and peaceful and we slept very well.Our package (via Superbreaks) allowed us a complimentary bottle of wine and included breakfast. The latter was self service buffet, with the usual selection of breads, cereals, and full-bore-cholesterol-packed cooked items one expects. Lovely! Travelwise, it was easy to drive to, and avoided congestion charges if you're careful. It's no more than a 5 minute walk to the Euston Station and tube, and good bus routes, so most tourist areas can be readily reached quite directly.	
Jan 31 2009 	Bad breakfast 	We arrived at the hotel, and check-in was fine. The room was clean and a nice size TV to. The heating was on low, however the room was very hot and stuffy. We were only staying the one night, so this wasn't to bad. The location of the hotel wasn't easy to find when exiting Euston station especially when on foot, it was tucked away at the end of Cardington St. The breakfast experience was awful, we queued for over 20 mins to be seated, several managers walked by us, and didnt try and resolved the situation - we were warned by others in the lobby before we went down for breakfast that the queue was all the way up the stairs when they left, so we were in for a big wait. Eventually we were seated and all around us were free tables, this was annoying and fustrating as we had been waiting for such a long time!! The staff responded slowly and it wasn't all hands-on-deck to clear tables!! The managers just seemed to wonder around aimlessly, when we left they were at the computer on Outlook e-mails!!!!We queued up for the cooked breakfast, which took a good 10 minutes. The tables that was supposed to have breads and cereals was completely empty!!! By the time we got back to the table, our coffee/tea's were cold! The cutlery was dirty and the toast was cold . The food was not hot, only luke warm, which is concerning when eating meat! Both my Mother and I did finish our breakfast, as by this time it took atleast an hour out of our day!When checking out we told the staff of our experience in the morning, and asked to be refunded the full amount for a breakfast (13.50) The manager was having none of it! All staff lacked customer care.Another man on reception wanted to complain about parking, he was told by staff 'You'll be waiting all day to see the manager, mate' - as soon as he left, the staff were sniggering and laughing at him!I left the hotel feeling disappointed and disgusted.	
Jan 27 2009 	Bed too small for two biggies!	We booked the hotel as part of a deal including 2 seats to see Oliver! Seats were £45 and the deal was 2 seats + B&amp;B in a double room for one night coming to a total of £210. Great location for Euston station and underground. When we arrived we were immediately asked if we'd like to pay for an upgrade, which we declined. We are no fatties, but the bed can in no way be described as a double - we had to turn over in unison! Three-quarter bed at most. It was pushed up against a wall (stopped me from falling out) and there was plenty of room for a much bigger bed along the wall that the headboard was. Brasserie is very over-priced (try the Ibis next door for all-you-can-eat buffet, soup then main course for £12-50. Breakfast next day was excellent, but there were so many people the Brasserie could not cope and the queue stretched up two flights of stairs from the restaurant - they were still serving the end of the queue by 11.30 a.m.. Restaurant staff deserved every penny they earned for coping that morning.	
Jan 25 2009 	Disappointing Visit	This hotel has 4 star public areas and charges 4 star prices in the bar. Room was a good size, but decorations were not up to scratch, torn &amp; scuffed wallpaper, mould around window frames. We were a bath towel short and one light did not work in the bathroom, asked for this to be sorted at reception. Bath towel arrived but the light was not sorted, I think there may have been a problem with the electrics in the room as the fan in the bathroom did not work neither did one of the bedside lights.These are not 4 star standards.However the room was quiet and the beds were very comfortable.I have a suspicion that we were in a &quot;one nighters&quot; room which was a shame because I had booked the hotel as a traet for my 84 year old mum who had never been to a hotel before.	
Jan 15 2009 	CHRISTMAS FAMILY VACATION 2008	Thistle Euston is an excellent place to stay. Friendly staff, on-time cleaning schedule, honest staff, clean and safe environment. It is a short walking distance from Euston station (Tube) and some stores, restaurants just around the block as you come in from the station.Breakfast buffett was included in the vacation package but they are always the same menu everyday we stayed (6 breakfast days). Expect to stand in line during &quot;rush hour&quot; around 8:30-9:30AM. Expect a decent 5-7 minute wait before getting a seat. Some internet cafes are around the area north of the hotel and a bus transit station right next to the train/tube station.Very few taxi cabs pass by as Cardington St is a little bit off the main road on Euston St. Avoid the ground floor section where rooms are a little bit cramped. There are 2 small elevators to use and some nice area lounge to sit. There's bar/restaurant in the building. Concierge is very helpful, hotel price varies if booked individually, shop for the best price. This hotel is a &quot;tourist hotel&quot; so expect crowded lobby at times. The best thing is that it is quiet, safe to walk even at 2AM, and a good jumping point to anywhere in London City either by tube or bus. Hot water is always available, coffee, tea and hot water is always there if you need it. Cleaning is done EVERYDAY. About 40 minutes to LHR using a private car/taxi. Cost $135 converted. Negotiate.	
Jan 5 2009	Nice hotel but a very small room	Whilst I did feel very comfortable at this hotel, the single room that I booked was very small. However, it was functional and very comfortable for me as I was sleeping off my jet lag. Also, the reception staff were very friendly and the location was brilliant for Euston train station. The outside of the hotel doesn't look to appealing, but do not let this put you off - it is a nice, clean and comfortable hotel.	
Dec 22 2008 	Looks good on outside not so much on the inside	I have a mixed bag of emotions following my hotel stay at the Thistle. The location is indeed fab, but it's actually quite confusing to find, but when I tried to call the hotel to get directions no one answered the phone so eventually i had to hang up.Checking-in was fast, efficient and friendly. I managed to get complimentary check-out at 1pm which was good, and also got a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room. Well I would not like to see the regular room!! There was barely any moving space, with my boyfriend sitting on the bed, i could barely fit between the bed and the tv to walk around. There was tea-making facilities but no water (a BIG no no for me), there was no mini-bar which is also very frustrating, especially when you want a drink of water. The bed was comfortable but not huge, not what I would have expected from a deluxe.But my main problem was in the bathroom - while the shower worked pretty well, the side of the bathtub was clearly dirty, dusty, and there was also a small hair, which I can only hope was an eyebrow. All in all very underwhelming.The cherry on top was checking out the next morning, very rude hostess barely looked at me and treated me like I didn't deserve to be there.For the price £80 on lastminute.com, it was ok, which is about what you'll find in London for a 3-4 star hotel, but the dirty bathroom really brought it down for me. Also there was only one large towel though I said it was 2 people checking in - unacceptable. I would NOT pay full price here - they're going at something crazy like £200+. You can find much better hotels at this price in London.	
Dec 10 2008 	Not all bad but rooms very tired	I was booked in here for a short business trip and found the hotel a bit of a mixed bag. I arrived early, at 1130 and was expecting to be sent away but the friendly staff booked me into my room immediately so thumbs up for early check in!The room however was poor. It was a single room and although the bed was large enough for 1 the room and bathroom were both small and cramped, with really ugly views onto the rear of the station. The room itself was tired, with small rips in the wallpaper and the furniture and pictures on the wall all well past their best. It all just felt slightly tatty and last decade. The bathroom had the same feel but at least it was clean.I ate in the restaurant and used a free voucher in the room for a free beer to celebrate the recent renovation to the restaurant. In general I am not a fan of hotel restaurants but I thought the food here was surprisingly tasty and really enjoyed my meal.The hotel ended on a high note for me as they allowed me a late check out as i had a meeting that morning that over ran without charging me extra. The hotel is good enough for a quick overnight business trip but for a holiday stay I would look elsewhere.	
Nov 22 2008 	Not a Four Star	Stayed 2 nights from 20th Nov 08 and this is not what I would call a 4 star hotel. We paid £40 for an up grade over the 2 nights &amp; even then the room was not in my opinion executive standardMore of a 2 star and just about 3 star at a push.Breakfast was the usual food on a hot plate etcNoise from lifts &amp; others walking by.Search well and you will find better 4 star Hotels in London	
Nov 16 2008 	Give it a miss	Arrived late and keen to sleep, given a room on the ground floor, pleasant enough. Road outside adjacent to the window but it seemed quiet. Woken up several times by what I assumed were people walking past on the way home from a night out, as I heard bottles clinking. Also heard snoring so assumed the walls were thin and it was next door. Up early the next day, opened the curtains and got a great shock as a homeless man was wrapped in a sleeping bag right next to my window with his bottles of cider lined up for breakfast ! I had to close the curtains to keep my privacy. Then my breakfast arrived and I was gobsmacked when the guy asked for five pounds in cash ( no mention of this on the breakfast label that you hang on the door ). It was awful, all the hot food was cold, toast cold and limp, tea was cold, milk was warm, it was not the cereal I ordered, a plate of scrambled eggs which could have doubled for pebbledash. In fact I was tempted to feed the tramp through the window but I couldn't open it. He did sit up and have a drink before snuggling back into his sleeping bag. I took a photo and when I checked out showed it to the receptionist and also told her the breakfast was hideous. She had a radiant smile and maintained this throughout but didn't offer more than that. I won't return.	
Nov 4 2008 	very disappointing	We stayed 3 nights at this hotel and were very disappointed in the room .It was called deluxe but would not even be a 2 star room .It was nothing like the website pictures being small dark and next to the lifts which kept us awake half of the night .Breakfast meal would have been ok if it had been hot and evening meal at the brassiere was way overpriced for what was served ie British cheeseboard was danish blue, edam and brie .40 minutes wait between courses and the ribeye steak whe it eventually turned up was more like a burger.Needless to say we would never stay at this hotel again. This was booked as a special 60th birthday weekend and this hotel put a damper on the wh weekendole. Disappointed from Dover	
Oct 24 2008 	Not up to 4 Star rating	The location to Euston Station is very convenient and the buffet breakfast that was included in the price was great and the waiting staff very attentive but the room was very disappointing. It was very dated and the bathroom was a disgrace; it had pink mould all over the grouting, the bath was very badly stained, there were cracked tiles and the extractor fan didn't appear to work. When I mentioned these things to reception I was told that housekeeping would deal with it but when I returned some 12 hours later no attempt to remove the mould had been made. There were a few other issues I mentioned at the same time and none of these had been rectified.	
Oct 20 2008 	Only if you really need to....	The hotel is close to Euston station, which may be of interest to you if you have a train to catch or want to walk to the British Library. Otherwise there are plenty of districts of London that have more going for them than Euston. Having set the scene here are the 'highlights' of my stay.I booked 2 nights in a single room, upper floor requested. I arrived early i.e. lunchtime so was quite prepared to request that I simply leave my case and come back. later This was certainly what happened then, along with the complete indifference of the receptionist, which signalled the level of service that was to follow. I booked in between 5 and 6 in the evening, ground floor room allocated (!). The room initially looked not too bad i.e. very dated decor but reasonable size and clean, chipped tiles and enamel apart. I was becoming used to the rumble of the underground trains below when I thought to turn on the TV for background noise. This was entirely non-functional (cue Monty Python 'dead parrot' sketch).. I phoned twice to request that this be dealt with and receiving no response other than a promise, went in person to reception. The staff member seemed to know immediately what I was talking about (no apology for not attending to the 2 previous requests). She immediately told me how busy they were, expecting another coach load of tourists (you know the type of hotel as soon as you see a designated reception desk for Sunwings/ Cosmic . whatever etc, etc) in the lobby). She immediately informed me the hotel was full and I could not be moved. I had until then said nothing apart from pointing out that the TV wasn't working so this info was fed to me unsolicited. I think she could tell from my face that this response was unsatisfactory so she diappeared into the office and a male staff member appeared (?? duty manager). I reiterated the problem to him and politely proceeded to agree a plan of action to correct the situation i.e. had to go out for a short time, would someone go to the room and repair. He agreed to this.Fool that I was to believe that he had paid any attention. Returned later in the evening to find no-one had been to the room. Returned to reception in person, No-one had been delegated the task, person came along with me then, confirmed the TV was defunct (I suppose I might have been really dim and not thought to plug it in etc). (Pointed out on the way that the ice machine did not have any paper cups in the holder, this was never addressed over the weekend despite the staff memeber's assurance). Hurrah he said 'they will have to change you to another room'.Was phoned to say that I should pack up and come tback o reception. Was given a key then to a room just opposite the one I had left (!!!!??!!)., why make me trundle back to reception with my case rather than have someone deliver the key to me?. Problem was this was a smaller room, looked out into a grimy enclosed area and beside the main ventilation/extractor fans. Room looked really dated. I was the too tired and defeated to go on and went to bed. So effectively I was downgraded for the faults of the hotel in putting me in the first room!!!!!!Any good points? Some staff at breakfast were really nice and had manners, knew something about customer service ( all Japanese or Far Eastern races, simple observation).If you want the 'cattle' experience in an overcrowded, too busy, under-staffed hotel, this is the one for you. Alternatively you might look around to find one of the very many other hotels in London that might offer you better service.	
Oct 20 2008 	A Relaxing Stay	My partner and I booked a 3 night stay at the Thistle Euston Hotel. It was superbly placed, just 2 minutes walk from the Euston mainline railway Station and Underground with direct lines into central London in about 10-15minutes.On arrival we found the lobby very impressive, clean and upmarket. The hotel clearly has a new front section with old building at the back. We were given a room on the old section and the back of the hotel, but this was not a problem. The room was spacious overlooking a small park (where some teenagers gathered in the evenings). The bed was spacious, although we had specified a double room by phoning the hotel directly they still had us down for a twin room! This was luckily rectified at check in!The bathroom was small, but adequte. It was always clean and served our purpose. The room had a new widescreen LCD tv with Freeview so there was lots of channels to watch. The room also had good facilites such as hairdryer, ironing board and coffee and tea making facilities. We also had loads of drawer and cupboard space. There was also a safe for valuables.We did not book to have breakfast, it was £13 per person, so we just grabbed breakfast at Euston Station, it has loads of eating places. The TV/Bar lounge was relaxing with a massive TV to watch if you wished.Overall it was a good stay, both my partner and I found the room relaxing and the staff helpful and friendly. We look forward to coming back at night after a long day sightseeing knowing that we had a comfortable room! I would not be adverse to going back there again the next time we visit London!	
Oct 12 2008	did not enjoy the exprience	Arriving at the Thistle Euston exhausted after long flght from Sydney I was greeted by cold uncaring staff....when asking for advice to get around London they were not forthcoming at all. I would never stay there again.	
Oct 1 2008 	Nice hotel great location	I stayed for 3 nights in early September. I took a chance on the &quot;secret hotel&quot; deal on lastminute.ie and based on the description, I had a sneaking suspicion that I'd get the Thistle Euston where my friends had already booked into. I have to say, I was impressed with the price of 75 per night and knowing I'd be getting a single room, there was no disappointment on room size like I had with the Radisson Grafton. The Thistle's single room was bigger and roomier than the Grafton and the sound insulation was much better too! Breakfast wasn't included in my deal, but my friends who did were all happy with the fare. Check in took a while because we arrived along with a busload from Cosmos tours. Another receptionist would have been a help as the one girl trying to deal with the queue wasn't enough. Having said that, she was pleasant and polite to everyone.Iron, trouser press, tea/coffee facilities, toiletries all supplied. Comfortable single bed, bit wider than average with good pillows! Bathroom was compact and clean with a small bath, shower and ample clean towels. Nice big tv with a plethora of channels... not that I intended staying in and watching tv for my stay! No air con, but there was a fan. I'm not too fussed either way about aircon anyway!Bar staff were lovely to talk to and nothing was too much trouble. Closing time was a little early when you're used to hotel bars serving until all hours. We remedied that with a couple of rounds delivered to one of our rooms which we could pay with cash and not have to put on the bill for the room.The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from Euston and Kings Cross St Pancras is easily reachable on foot too. The hotel looked after our luggage for the day, after we checked out which saved us worrying about storage until we were due to fly home.If you're looking for a good base and not expecting frills, this is the place.	
Sep 22 2008 	Avoid!	I booked this hotel specifically due to its proximity to Euston station. The rooms are small and dark. I had requested a double but was given a twin room. The bath was tiny - I'm only 5' 4&quot; but even I couldn't sit with my legs stretched out in the bath.There was also a lot of TV noise from surrounding rooms - as if the walls were too thin.The final straw was on each night at 4am I was woken by the most awful clattering/crashing noise - as it someone had dropped lots of metal chairs from 4 floors up. On the second night I worked out it was actually the bar staff putting all the waste glass bottles into the glass recycling facility.I never ate in the hotel so I can't comment on the food.The check-in area was always very busy - it took over 10 mins to check in and out of the hotel and they seemed very under-staffed.The hotel is very popular with tourists who were charming in every respect but it meant that the lobby was always very very busy with tour parties coming and going.Overall I wouldn't recommend this hotel to someone on a business trip.	
Sep 19 2008 	Rude Staff	On arrival for my Cosmos tour the girls at the Cosmos desk were not very help and not willing to assist with anything more than what they have to do. The receptionist was also rude when I ask for his assistance in getting directions, as he told me that was not part of his job. The concierge was also rude and very abrupt to me when I ask him for directions to the British Musuem. He said just walk in that direction!!!! Breakfast was the same each day and my room had no a/c so I had to open the window which was on a busy street.	
Sep 15 2008 	great hotel	had a great three day stay at the euston thistle hotel, staff were very friendly and helpfull. on our arrival we were told that they could not give us adjacent rooms but had upgraded our friends to a better room.the breakfast was excellent far exceeded our expectations.the hotel is well situated for the we will rock you show 15 min walk away.very handy tube station 5min walk away. all round good choice hotel	
Sep 11 2008 	Very Dissapointing	I booked this hotel as a Theatre Break package and it cost me £170 for a twin room. This was a treat for a dear friend who has many personal problems, and needed a break. So the dissapointing room didn't please me.The beds were fine, tea/coffee ok, breakfast ok. The bathroom was in a terrible state. The bath had a dripping tap which had left a black stain on the bath about 2&quot; by 8&quot; the hard water deposits were discusting. There was a 2' long piece of chrome tubbing hanging loose across the taps, for no purpose at all. the toilet when flushed made an appauling noise. After our trip to the theatre we ordered a snack from room service, it took 40 minutes to arrive and then the order was wrong, when I phoned to ask for the correct order it was difficult to converse with someone with limited english. When the correct order did arrive it was 65 minutes from the original order, by then we couldn't eat it and wanted to go to bed. So all we had eaten was a chicken wrap that cost me £20. The next morning on complaining I got a £10 refund. And at 7.50am a maid came in to clean the room, we were still asleep. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone paying over £50 a night for it. I am not in the habbit of complaining but in this instance thought it necessary.	
Sep 11 2008 	Mediocre	The Thistle's location is a definite plus &amp; the first impression of the hotel's interior is that it's worthy of its four stars.Our bathroom worked fine &amp; cleanliness throughout was good.However, our room was small despite a king-sized bed &amp; had no in-room drinks facilities (more annoying than I'd have previously thought).There was a mistake over our booking via lastminute.com &amp; we were told breakfast was not included &amp; would be charged at £12.95 each.We ate at the hotel's bistro in the evening &amp; the meal was satisfactory, but overpriced, particularly the drinks. Service was v-e-r-y slow &amp; some of the staff struggled understanding English (with us &amp; with each other) which created some confusion over orders.If staying in the Euston area again I might use the Thistle if there was a good offer on the room price, but all things beings equal, I'd look elsewhere.	
Sep 7 2008 	Location is the best thing!	I stayed here in the only hot week in London this summer and despite the hotel advertising rooms as being air conditioned mine and my colleagues were not. To add insult to injury the window did not open more than an inch to provide ventilation and the rooms were small and dated. The hotel is one of the closest to Euston Station but I have got better rates and rooms at the nearby Novotel (halfway between Euston and Kings Cross Stations) and the Radisson Grafton.	
Sep 5 2008 	Shabby and poor value	Fairly typical London hotel in being pricey for what it was but not terribly good. My wife checked in having come from home in the afternoon to get ready for our evening out at the theatre, while I finished off at work. She found the staff were unhelpful, with a poor command of English, and the room not ready. Whenever anything was requested there were mutterings about surcharges but eventually she was given an upgrade.If this was a superior room I would not like to see the bog standard. It would be best described as shabby, with scuff marks on the walls and tired looking fixtures and fittings.I did not get to sample the breakfast offerings, as I had to leave on the first Eurostar of the day and was too early. However, my wife said it was very good.It is rather sad that we expect poor standards and value for money from London hotels. Other European capitals seem to do so much better.	
Sep 2 2008 	Over rated	We stayed at the Thistle the night before and after our Cosmos Tour , I was disgusted at where they put us(on arrival) -in the back of the hotel through corridors and fire escapes and in a twin room when I had paid for a double. only saving grace was the bathroom was large . We left some luggage at the hotel for collection on our return it took my husband 15min to explain to the Concierge who had little grasp of English it also cost us 14 pounds. On return the room was two twin beds pushed together the bathroom was small I was so glad to leave. I would say If going on a Comos tour stay somewhere else and meet at the hotel on day of departure.We paid over $600AUD for the 2 nights I expected more.	
Sep 2 2008	just ok	Excellent location near tube in central london rooms were a disappointment-very standard accomodation,basis bathroom compared to the rest of the hotel which was modernFriendly staff At breakfast there was certainly problems due to the large volume of people they found it difficult to cope,waiting in long queue to be seated then waiting again to get your breakfast.I have stayed in many hotels in london and whilst breakfast is usually a busy time,unlike the other hotels this one has problems coping with the volume of people.	
Aug 26 2008 	Overall a wonderful place to stay	What a great location! We had to book this hotel through a promotional offer. The reviews were mixed but when we arrived on the 1st part of visit we had a very small room for 3 people but all the amenties. Tea,coffee and cookies every night and a wonderful large breakfast everyday that would fill you up until lunch. Great Bar and cute cafe with a big screen downstairs to enjoy a cup of tea or beverage while looking out into the lovely park next door. There are also several good pubs within a few minutes walk from this hotel. The staff was very helpful and attentive as well. This hotel is steps away from Euston Station which will get you to the heart of london in 10-15 minutes time on the underground. Walking distance to the British Library, British Museum, St Pancras Station (Eurostar) is you would like to go to Paris or Brussels while you are in Europe. On our 2nd return in the same month we received a very large corner suite with a view of the park as well. This was a perfect room for the day before the long trip back to the states. There was only one drawback and that was no wifi or internet service ($20.00 for 24 hours on their WifI connection). I would recommend this hotel for weekend away or for families looking to experience all that London has to offer.	
Jul 30 2008 	Nice hotel with friendly staff	Excellent location near tube in central londonClean and nice rooms with flat lcd facing small parkSize of the room was good enoughFriendly staff speaking excellent english, I don't trust the other negative reviews at all..Only negative was that there was a rush for breakfast. I could take 5-10 minutes before getting somewhere to sit..	
Jul 26 2008	A good hotel	Stayed here for 6 nights and found it to be clean, updated, and very conveniently located right near the underground, with quick access to most anywhere you'd want to go in London. The staff was friendly and helpful. And the breakfast exceeded expectations and was wonderful!! I would recommend it to others.	
Jul 22 2008 	All great.	Either people have incredibly high expectations or the Thistle are really trying hard to turn things around.The room was perfectly nice and clean, with flat screen TV, en suite bathroom with nice toiletries. The front desk staff were friendly and professional, and genuine.This isn't a &quot;destination&quot; hotel but I paid around £50 for it, and its a stone's throw from central London. See what else you can get for the price, this is probably the best value you'll find.Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.	
Jul 21 2008 	Find somewhere else.	Average large chain hotel with average rooms and average service, twin room was 230 pounds per night which is outrageous even for the euston location (back of the train station so not even a nice bit of london). Breakfast was 12 pounds for english breakfast, music in the breakfast room was an interminable 80s CD on a short loop. Matress was ropey, linen was holed, limited tv channels, bathroom small, shower ok but soaps etc poor quality. Just lacks any of the things that should come with 240 pounds a night. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Jul 21 2008 	Fantastic	I have to admit after reading the reviews on this hotel I was dreading our weekend away we had booked through Omega holidays for a one night theatre break and had upgraded to this hotel as being nearest the west end from a choice of three....I was amazed when we arrived how beautiful the hotel was, with its highly polished floors and polite and courtious staff who spoke perfect English. We couldn't check into our room until 2pm and being only 11am we decided to go for a walk, the concerge took our luggage for us and told us to come back when we were ready to check in. We returned at 2pm and were promply shown to the room by the duty manager who couldn't do enough to help. The room was situated on the ground floor (Which seem to have the worst reviews) It was bright, spacious, clean and modern the only down side was that we had a twin bedded room not a double as requested, but i figured we would be that tired we would just fall into bed anyway...lol!!The bathroom was a little bit dated but clean with fresh crisp towels and the toilet was immaculate (something i am funny about!!)After a very comfortable, noise free night we ventured to the Brasserie 33 for our full english breakfast, this was hot and there was pleanty of it, the staff all had lovely cheery smiles and were very helpful..(they obviously appriciated the work!! unlike some people in our country!!)We checked out just after 9am even though we had til noon and left our luggage at the hotel until it was time to return for our train back home..In conclusion This hotel is idealy situated near all local transpotation Tube, trains, and buses. It is clean, modern and comfortable and the staff are friendly, helpful and extreamly polite.	
Jul 20 2008	high quality	A thoroughly pleasant stay Food good Room excellent Staff and managers care about customer satisfaction	
Jul 15 2008 	I liked it!	After reading all of the reviews we were very reluntant to stay at this hotel.We were booked through a promotion company as part of a free plane trip and had little choice as to which hotel we could use.We stayed 7 nights.We were pleasantly surprised that this hotel was fine.The staff spoke excellent English and were very friendly and helpful.The breakfast was great and we asked for a quiet room and got one that was very quiet (London is VERY noisy).The rooms were small but very clean.The location was next to the rail station and tubes and was in an excellent location.Every night was like coming home to our quiet home in London(the hotel is next to a park).The only negative was on July 5th a large tour group come in and was singing late at night and talking in the halls @ 3 to 4 in the morning.The banging doors were very evident that morning.The other nights were OK.I would return and enjoyed the hotel a great deal.	
Jul 5 2008 	Thankfully I wasn't paying	Hotel was paid for by my company (£175/night = $350). It would have been okay at $50. Indifferent/incompetent staff, hallways smelled of urine, rock hard beds, foam pillows, dark rooms. Besides the slamming doors coming from guests entering and leaving their rooms, the cleaning staff in the morning would set the dead bolt so they woudn't have to open the door as they went in and out, but would let it slam each time. Horrid racket. Can't really think of anything good to say about the whole experience. Couldn't wait to leave.	
Jun 30 2008	No vent no atmosphere	Stayed here as sold to us by 'Superbreak' as a 4 star hotel which it definiely is not.  The place is lacking from maintenance, from our expereince of 2 rooms lights dont work, room air con doesn't work, tap are loose.Basement bar has absolutely no atmosphere at night.	
Jun 15 2008 	Mediocre at best	This is the third time I've stayed here (I didn't book it myself) and each time they have put me in a room with &quot;an air flow system&quot; despite advertising themselves as having air conditioning. London in summer can be pretty warm and after a couple of weeks of old London buildings retaining heat it is pretty unpleasant. The bedrooms look like they were last updated in the early '80s apart from the &quot;jazzy&quot; new bedspread. Handy for the station but that is the only thing going for it.	
Jun 13 2008 	thistle euston london	Stayed here for 2 nights and then 1 night, Room down end of long corridor, tea &amp; coffee making facilities in room, plenty of everything. Bathroom clean and all necessary toiletries.Dinner was a little on the slow side coming, but no problem.It seems as though all employees are non English, but you get by.Very handy for Euston station and about a 10 minute walk to St Pancras International station.Would have no hesitation in staying there again.	
May 28 2008 	WHAT A DUMP	terrible room, more like a prison cell with dated unsafe furniture. Window wouldn't open, no tea/coffee or milk left. Bed can only be likened to a mortuary slab. Towels smelt damp. Pubic hair in bath. No staff about to report it to, and the member of staff I did find spoke very little english. Queued for over 30 minutes for breakfast, which was tepid at best and had to wait even longer for toast and coffee. Definitely one to avoid.	
May 24 2008 	Tired Hotel and poor service	Stayed here for 2 nights on business and wasn't impressed. Reception staff were not at all welcoming and check in took much longer than expected with receptionist tapping away on the keyboard and sighing an awful lot. Throughout the whole check in process she made no attempt to gain eye contact or smile...great start.Whilst waiting noticed a Cosmos desk tucked away in the corner which seemed odd in a business hotel.Room was small, reasonably clean but very tired and dated c1980's and in need of total refurbishment. Dodgy temperature control on the shower. TV reception poor and aircon noisy. No space to work on the desk as space was taken up by TV and hospitality tray.Went down to breakfast at 6.35am to walk into a room full of elderly holiday makers from the US and Australia ! (Cosmos desk now made sense !). Breakfast served in basement restaurant, dimly lit with no natural light.Staff were very abrupt and made no attempt to be welcoming and friendly. I was told that someone would take my order for tea or coffee.....I waited until I had almost finished breakfast, had to leave my table to find a member of staff and ask for tea and toast. Standard of breakfast buffet poor, especially if you didn't want English cooked breakfast, obviously aimed at the budget minded holiday makers.This is not a hotel for business people looking for good service and somewhere comfortable to stay.	
May 19 2008 	Never Again!	Ive stayed at this hotel on may occasions for business in the last 5 years or so but never again.My previous stay was in January and i wasnt impressed then, for various reasons. I decided to give it one last chance in April, mainly becuase of the close proximity to Euston which makes it very handy.this time i arrived about 8pm and was checked in my a poker faced woman. I am sorry to say that i am heartily SICK of being confronted by miserable foreign reception staff - usually eastern european - at London hotels. I was dealt with quickly but without any kind of welcome or smile, got to the room and was appalled. Hideous. Tiny, 70's bathroom, brown stained net curtains, rickety furniture and dingy. I know enough about this place to know that they have better rooms than this and just as i am deciding to go back to reception and ask for a change the fire alarm goes off so I have to evacuate.All guests were ushered out onto the street and instructed to walk down to the IBIS hotel and congregate there. Knowing full well that this was most likely to be a false alarm i wasnt prepared to walk down the street and stood a safe distance across theo road instead.I and other guests were then shouted at and harangued by various hotel staff insisting that we walk to the IBIS until i told them to stop trying to herd us like farm animals and that i wasnt obliged to move anywhere as long as i had evacuated the hotel. As expected, a minute later the instruction to re-occupy the hotel was barked out, so i took the opportunity to get first in the queue at recpetion for a room change.Same receptionist. i told her i wasnt happy with the room and that i knew there were better ones at the hotel. She tapped away and whilst looking for an alternative asked me what the problem with the original room was. As i began to reel off the list, I swear she raised her hand to my face and interrupted me with &quot;ok, ok, ok!&quot;. I was staggered and suggested to her that she had just asked me what was wrong and was now telling me to stop telling her! she ignored this and gave me a new key with the comment &quot;this is an executive......&quot; the unpoken message being so dont come back again becuase there's no chance of anything better&quot;the new room was bigger but still dingy and old. The whole place needs a total refurb. the furniture is like something out of a junk shop. No loo paper in the bathroom and no reply when i rang housekeeping, reception OR the concierge. I had to trek down to reception and report it in person. Terrible.The fact that there was a COSMOS holiday company desk stuck in a corner of reception covered in hand made posters for the sale of sightseeing trips, and the massive tv screen in the bar showing football says it all really. This used to be a nice hotel but is obviously now being used as a low cost package holiday hang out. It's a complete dump.Take a tip from me, you can stay at a premier inn or an IBIS for less than they were charging me at business rate for this substandard dirty and old room. I'll never go back.	
May 18 2008 	Great desk 	My wife and I stayed a total of 25 nights in this hotel.19 nights from april 11th. Ground floor/ basement room, low grade furnishing and heating, no table. The desk/ dressing table was not properly attached to the wall.After toilet was flushed it took 10/12 Mins to refill.We chose this hotel because it was cheaper than our last stay at thistle Marble Arch, we thought this was probably because of the extra distance.6 nights from May 8th. MUCH better room on 3rd floor, it made our first room look like a slum, it was more like what we have experienced at other thistle Hotels.Housekeeping overall was Very poor, as items were used they were not replaced i.e. shampoo, toilet paper, coffee and sugar.A serious problem was being unable to pay accounts using our &quot;DEBIT&quot; card, this caused several problems during our stays.Will we stay at thistle again? NO! NO! NO!Brasserie 43 food and service OUTSTANDING	
May 7 2008 	Absolutely Fine	This is not a bad place to stay, it is very well located and very easy to get to. The reception provided an efficient service and were very swift. The hotel is clean and very suitable for a brief stay in London. The room was a bit small, but again very comfortable and had TV/radio. The bathroom was clean and had no faults. Best of all, the price was actually very good.	
May 4 2008 	Better than expected	I think this is a very good standard hotel for the price in london. I booked a single room, and it was larger than expected and nicely appointed. The hotel staff were lovely - friendly and helpful - that includes reception and restaurant. The restaurant has been refurbished and I had an excellent meal there.The only downside was the huge queue for breakfast - breakfast itself was the standard hot buffet - fine. Will choose this hotel again on my next business trip.	
Apr 23 2008 	Very pleasant stay at Thistle!	For a short holiday in London, we booked a room at the Thistle. Although not all reviews I've read were positive, this hotel seemed to me as a good choice. After a quick check in, I was very pleased to have chosen this hotel. Rooms were nice (we booked a luxury room), although furniture, wallpaper and carpeting were a bit dated. More importantly, everything was clean and very tidy! Also in the bathroom (not too big, not too small) we had a nice shower and bath. And again; very clean and tidy. We booked a parkview room, which is recommendable. It's a nice view on St. James' Gardens in stead of a gray and ugly railway station. Breakfast is nice, nothing special (buffet, coffee/tea and toast is brought to your table), although a bit crowdy in the weekends. Service at the desk was good. The concierge offered very good and quick service by arranging top seats at a theatre show (the same night and a sold out show!) and gave us very good tips for nice spots to visit.This hotel is also very suitable for tourists (like us) who want to explore all the attractions London is offering. Just a 2-3 minute walk to Euston Mainline station and you have access to the Norhtern and Victoria underground lines, which will take you to all main underground stations within an instant (never spent more than 10 minutes to our destination). We were very happy to have chosen this hotel and will surely consider returning here if we'll visit London again!	
Apr 21 2008 	A Good Impression	My husband and I stayed at Thistle Euston for 10 days, after asking our travel agent to book a deluxe room and a full English breakfast at a hotel near an underground station. We were given a rooom on the first floor. Fortunately, it was big enough and we had quite a lot of space to move around, which was quite a relief, given the number of days that we spent there. Overall, the room and the bathroom were clean, and the maid changed towels and vacuum cleaned every day. It would have been even nicer if there were a hair dryer and a minibar in the room, which are kind of usual in the three-star hotels throughout Europe. It would also have been great if there was Internet access included in the room price, which is also customarily in the hotels of the same range in Europe.The hotel staff, including reception staff, waiters, maids and concierges were helpful and nice, despite the fact that the hotel has a huge number of customers who, of course, must be attended. This Thistle hotel is used for transit by many large groups of tourists going on tours of Europe and the UK. That is why it is no wonder that there were long queues for breakfast, mainly after 9. However, the staff of the restaurant managed not to keep us waiting for more than 5 minutes until showing us to our table. And if the jam jars, the butter and the cups for coffee were missing from the table, well, it was sorted out quickly. The only really annoying detail of our stay at Thistle Euston relates to the heating system which was very noisy, forcing us to turn it off during the night so that we could sleep. Also, it failed to produce the heat we set it for, with the result that it was always warmer on the corridor than in our room.To sum it up, the hotel lacks cosiness and what it takes to make you feel at home, but it provides the basic comfort for people who mostly want to spend their day out visiting London.***For the visitors who want to go on guided tours of attractions in London and the UK. We couldn't help notice the professionalism and care shown by the staff of the Cosmos tour operator, which has a desk in the hotel lobby. We didn't actually go on a tour with them, as we had pre-booked another company, but they were very polite and showed great concern for the well-being of their customers.	
Apr 4 2008 	brilliant hotel in our capital city	after travelling all over europe following liverpool f.c. this season on wednesday night we stayed overnight at this london hotel..pleased to say we were very, very impressed by the thistleeuston,from the moment we arrived the staff were brilliant,reception + bar spotless,the twin room overlooking the park would put some of the very expensive hotels to shame..returned after the game to a welcoming few drinks in the hotel bar,service was great,next morning full english breakfast was included,hopefully we will be returning to london in 3 weeks time for the semi-final,will have no hesitation in booking the thistle euston once again...	
Apr 3 2008 	Just Okay	We stayed at the Thistle Euston for 7 nights. Euston Square is just down the street so its very easy to get there from Heathrow, though it does take over an hour. Buses and the Tube are there, too, so getting around was easy. It's a ways out but we found that was a good thing. After a day of sightseeing it's nice to get back to a more quiet area. Our room was okay but the bed was absolutely AWFUL - too lumpy and very hard. We could hear some sort of grinding noise during the night. I assume it was the pipes. If you are a light sleeper, beware! The breakfast was okay - a good value if included with the room. We could hear the cleaning staff arguing quite loudly in the hallway many times - one time very early in the morning. Not very considerate if you ask me. There is a Crown and Anchor pub closeby and the food is excellent. We ate there twice during our weeklong stay. The hotel serves food but it seemed ridiculously expensive. Overall the experience wasn't awful but I'm not sure we'd stay again if there was something else available.	
Mar 30 2008 	Very average	This was the first time I had stayed in a Thistle Hotel and I was not overly impressed. My friend who I went with has stayed in Thistles before and thought it was no where as good as others.The room was &quot;fine&quot; and apart from the odd bit of old hair on the bathroom floor, it was clean. The room was basic.The location was perfect for our needs but don't stay here if you're wanting a picturesque location!The breakfast was lovely, just a shame we had to queue for 10 mins to be seated! The restaurant is currently being refurbished so eating takes place in various other rooms.The lady on reception was absolutely awful! There was a huge queue to check in, approx 20 mins. When we got to the desk, the woman (dark hair in pony tail) walked off and said she'd be 1 min. 10 mins later she came back and when we complained all she could do was moan about her working conditions. She was extremely rude and had no customer services skills. However when we left, the man of reception was first class.All in all, the hotel was fine but is a 3 star hotel not 4 star.	
Mar 24 2008 	Improving	This is my second time at Thistle Euston and I was booked here by mistake since I was not especially pleased last time staying. However this time I was happy and would definitely consider staying here again. This primarily due to the fact that the neighbourhood has improved. (!) No beggars seen outside the Euston station, more ordinary people moving around, the little garden next to the hotel over which my hotel room was facing was undergoing improvements. (Looked very promising) The front desk service was good and the breakfast staff excellent. Especially considering their somwhat stressful situation since the normal breakfast area was closed for refurbishment.The room was very spaciuos (considering this is UK) and bathroom clean.	
Mar 20 2008 	Relaxing stay	I'm quite fussy about hotels. I like large anonymous business hotels run by professional staff. I'm not keen on small boutique hotels or converted town houses. First impressions count and I found the receptionists professional, efficient and friendly.The room itself was excellent. The bedlinen and towels were clean and fresh. The room was well decorated and included a comfortable double bed, a desk, air-con, double-glazing, iron etc etc. Sadly, no tea or coffee making facilites were provided in the room. The bathroom was fine, spotlessly clean, and included a full size bath as well as a shower. The tiles looked fairly new. They really could do with some new fittings as the chrome had worn through in places.Overnight, I was not distrurbed by any noise from outside or within the building. It was very quiet.I only paid for a single room and this was definitely the best value stay I've had in London.	
Mar 19 2008 	Nice Hotel	Stayed at this hotel with work - attending a training course! All areas are nice, clean and staff friendly. Food was ok however menu was a bit limited. Venue at back of train station and bit far from main attractions not the best however if your looking for somewhere to rest then ok	
Mar 17 2008	Absolutely HORRID!!!	The Hotel was absolutely horrible. The staff was not acomidating at all. When we got here they lost our voucher along with our other vouchers to stay in other hotels in europe. The beds were too close in proximity I felt like I was on top my friend who is a male by the way. We asked for 2 beds not two freaking beds joined together. The sheets smell absolutely disgusting as if someone pissed on them. I by far would never stay here again.	
Mar 14 2008 	Mixed feeling about the Thistle Euston	The Euston was a mixed bag. The rooms are OK, no more. Small, but I have stayed in smaller in London. Reasonably comfortable. The staff is not terribly accomodating, but again, I have seen worse. It is hard to put a finger on just what is wrong. It is an acceptable hotel if you get a REALLY good price, otherwise you may feel a trifle cheated.The location is remote. i know it is on bus and tube lines, but it takes a long time to get anywhere., an it is a walk to either bus or tube.The breakfast is a typical Thistle breakfast. If it comes with the room, fine, but don't pay the inflated price they ask if it does not!In all, not terrible, but not good either.	
Mar 4 2008 	Too much noise too much people at breakfast	We stayed for 4 nights.The room was OK, not too many (5) tv channels.The roon was a bit noisy, we stayed at the &quot;stationsite&quot;The beds could be better.The breakfast queue far too longThe site was great, a few 100 meters from the underground northernlinethe staff was friendly	
Mar 4 2008 	Good mid range hotel	This is a good mid range hotel, location useful for Euston and the Circle Line, walking distance (30 mins) to Covent Garden. Unlike other travelers, we did not hear the station at any time, in fact this was a very quiet location in February.Rooms were comfortable, with what you would expect. Very clean and modern throughout. Buffet breakfast was execellent (nothing left standing for hours), as were the staff. We got this at a very reduced rate through a website arranging minibreaks, and it was walking distance to the British Museum to see the Terracotta Army exhibition.This was a good hotel compared to others of a higher class we have stayed at in London.An agreeable surprise.	
Feb 24 2008 	Not Worthy Of It's 4 Stars!	My family and i recently stayed at the Thistle Euston which i would point out is tucked away in a more residential area of London right behind Euston train station. The &quot;bing bong&quot; of the station announcements could be heard ringing out throughout the day. I would not reccomend you use this as a base for exploring the sights as there is nothing within walking distance of the hotel, you will spend a fortune in taxis and underground tickets. The hotel reception is very impressive and every bit what you would expect from a hotel advertised to this standard, the hotel bar however is very small. We expected to be able to have a quiet nightcap before going to bed after seeing The Lion King but the bar was very full, customers had even spilled out and filled up the reception seating area. Breakfast the next morning was much the same with an extremely long que to wait in before being seated. Breakfast selection was excellent, plenty to choose from and it all looked delicious. Tea and toast had to be requested from the few waiters that were available. Toast came back cold after having asked for it twice and the tea was abismal. It appeared we were afforded one tea bag for a large pot of water which of course turned out very weak tea.This may sound petty but for a hotel of this size surely there should be more staff and better organisation. There are two lifts in the hotel, which means there was quite a walk and a small set of stairs to climb to get to our rooms from the lifts. The rooms themselves were clean and tidy but not very impressive. Just what seemed to be standard rooms you could expect at a Travel Lodge and such. We asked for two double rooms and were given twins with no option of pushing the beds together. We were told there would be a minibar in our room but we were not afforded this either. I would also warn you not to use their hairdryer or any other appliance you do not need to. I turned on their hairdryer and a red flame appeared for a time, it then proceeded to break down and no longer work at all. All in all, i feel the Thistle is impressive on the outside but they haven't really managed to maintain that sort of quality throughout the hotel.	
Feb 23 2008 	My first stay at Thistle Euston hotel	I have come to London for more than twenty years. I have seen a lot of different hotels from good to very bad. Last week I had my first stay in the Thistle Euston hotel. I had a nice room (more space than ever for the amount of money I had paid). A nice quiet room with in front no heavy traffic (noise). The room was clean and well furnished. The English breakfast was great (assigned to an own table) with a lot of choices (English and continental). I will comeback for sure to the Thistle Euston in the next summer of 2008.	
Feb 20 2008 	Slightly Problematic - Don't eat your evening meal there	Don't get your hopes up, this Thistle still has a few issues.I've stayed once before a few months ago and had a similar experience, seems there is a bit of a trend and so worth mentioning...The room itself was ok, nothing special but as you might expect for this sort of hotel. The problems seem to stem from the staff presumably being over worked, and thus unable to give good quality service.There was a real delay checking in due to a big party and staff running around. Hair in the bath when I arrived- pointing at slightly slipshod cleaning.Both evening meals I had in the hotel were poor, bad value food, served late with minor mistakes (note that the main restaurant is shut at the moment).For one meal I had a hard job getting the bad taste out of my month!However the breakfast was fine, almost good!Finally the guy at check out had a hard job understanding a simple request for bill information, and was a bit obstructive.	
Jan 25 2008 	Great Hotel	After reading some of the not so great reviews on this hotel,we decided to book anyway. Were we ever glad we did. We arrived at 10:30 am fully expecting to have to just leave our bags and check in later. Much to our delight they checked us in right away.The room was a good size for London, the bed was comfortable and the hotel was very accomodating to our requests of a king bed, high floor, garden view. Some reviews complained of only a few TV stations, well sorry but if you are going to London to watch TV, save some money, stay home and watch BBC America.The hotel restaurant was pricey for dinner, however the full English breakfast which was included was great. Within a short walk were several nice pubs, and at Euston Station the Marks and Spencers Simply Foods had anything else we wanted.The location is great, a nice walk to the British Museum, well worth visiting and it is free; a good walk to Oxford Street and to Regents Park.All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting.	
Jan 16 2008 	Great location	I've stayed at the Thistle Euston several times over the years, going back to when it was the Kennedy Hotel. Each time I have never had any problems, always a good clean room, clean bathroom, nice hot water. The last time i stayed there, i was ill and they were able to help out and get a doctor in. They didn't charge me for checking out a few days early either. The location is very good, just a couple of blocks from Euston station and around the corner from two tube stops. Lots of busses on Euston road and Regent Park is only a few blocks away. There are lifts in the hotel but there are a few stairs in the hallways too so if you have mobility issues, make sure your room is not past the steps.	
Jan 1 2008 	Exceeded Expectations	We (family of 4) stayed at Thistle Euston between Dec 25-30. Having heard a lot of negative comments about the quality of mid range accomodation in London, we were a bit apprehensive. But, the rooms were great, the front office staff was very welcoming. The hotel is just a quick 2-3 minutes walk from Euston Station which is well connected. So, very convenient as well. Our deal included a full English breakfast. The breakfast menu had a lot of variety and was quite good.The only negative is the rush for breakfast room ...The bar is also very basic.	
Dec 13 2007	Only if you have to...	Stayed here for course and was booked by work. Have since got them to take this off the list.Rooms and corridors are dirty and dated. Does not feel safe at night. Do not take a ground floor room - the windows are barely secured (wire , an odd screw or piece of wire) and mine looked onto a park with bushes. Anyone could have got in which was a worry leaving stuff there and at night.Food was average.Only stay if you must, get a very cheap deal or need to be near the station (I have stayed in others close by that are much better).	
Nov 30 2007 	Stayed here a dozen times!!	I've been staying here on and off for three years which is a good sign. On the odd occasion I've been unable to get in, I've suffered. I arrive at Euston at 9.30, drop off my luggage and am on my way in minutes. I always request a room overlooking the park, south facing through tall trees, you wouldn't believe where you were. Excellent breakfast as well. When we booked a weekend for my wife and I we got the full treatment. Best value in London!!	
Nov 21 2007 	Clean safe good amenities great location	I didn't know what to expect after reading the other reviews, but the Thistle Euston turned out to be great. We had a double room, #317, and it was lovely. Decor was nice, the shower was excellent (no hot water problems at all), and I thought the room size was above average for a London hotel. The room came with some nice amenities, esp. for a European hotel: hairdryer (if you can't find it, look in the desk drawer), safe, iron and ironing board, clothesline above the tub, tea and coffee service (electric kettle, instant coffee packets and teabags, plus a daily Walkers biscuit). (In case you're wondering, the hotel also provides towels, shampoo and soap.)Breakfast was also above expectation. Our room included the full English breakfast, which is served buffet-style in the restaurant. The hot food was pretty typical of buffets - i.e., average quality - but there was a big selection of other stuff: dry cereal, fruit, cheeses, breads, porridge, pastries, etc.. It's quite possible to eat enough that you don't even need lunch (an advantage in expensive London).I also thought the service was good. We never had any problems with rude or unhelpful staff, although the hotel is quite busy so we did have to wait in line several times. The staff accommodated our every request, including making some reservations for us.The only complaints: * The bed was rock hard. I like a firm mattress, but this was way beyond that.* The walls are thin, but no worse than at other hotels. With earplugs, I had no problems.* We had problems with our keycard several times; it kept de-magnetizing. But the service desk was always very helpful with this.Overall, I would definitely stay here again, and I'd recommend it to anyone. And the location is fantastic - just a block from Euston Station.	
Nov 16 2007 	Come and stay at the Thistle Euston:	Room service includes such English favourites as - beans on toast, cheese on toast ...Irons coated in burnt nylon jumper to transform an ordinary white shirt into modern street wear (as modelled by numerous London vagrants - a catwalk view of which is available from the window in your room)Room security - Room service tray collection is intermittent and will remain outside your room beyond 8am as a booby trap for anyone entering or exiting the room during the nightFree TV service limited to 5 terrestrial channels (not even freeview) - this is enhanced by a selection of porn and pay per view 80's moviesDécor circa 70's (possibly 1870's)Hot water on demand - the water system will ignore any such requests in a similar manner to our staffStaff multilingual - except EnglishVery quiet neighbours - they are boarded up and/or condemnedLively neighbourhood - 24 hour muggings, vandalism, call girls, &quot;saunas&quot; provided for the discerning travellerIf I could give this hotel a rating below terrible I would have. The checkin staff didn't care and the checkout was slow - try standing in line for 40 minutes to paying more than you would at a centre of London Hilton.I'd rather take my chances sleeping rough than stay here again.	
Nov 15 2007 	good location	Stayed here for 2 nights whilst on a hen night. The hotel location is excellent, very close to Euston, 10 mins in a bus to the west end, close to Camden etc. Breakfast was great for hangovers - all that you could want.The rooms were clean if a little small - fab shower.If you had the window open it would be quite noisy. There also seemed to be a lot oof children playing hide and seek round the corridors in the morning - not great with a hangover!Also the hotel bar was very expensive and the service was pretty crappy - slow service, no lime for the corona etc etc.I would stay here again for a weekend in london, but we booked with a event company so we got a good deal - I wouldn't pay over £100 a night for this hotel - more like £70.	
Oct 24 2007 	OK but nothing more	This hotel is OK. The public areas are fine if a little dated. On arrival I was told there were no non smoking rooms left so I had to stay in a smoking room. The corridor to my room was very long and in need of decoration. The room itself was clean, but dated (i reckon early 1980s!) and obviously smelt smokey (I know this will not bother some people). I woudlnt chose to stay here at all, and will request my work does not put me here again.	
Oct 23 2007 	Comfortable Enough	The reason we chose this hotel was its close proximity to Euston Station and the fact that we would not have to carry our bags very far after arriving in London. The hotel is classed as a 4 star, but the rooms are quite small and average. They are comfortable enough, but just didn't feel like a four star hotel. The staff are very friendly and accommodating and the public areas are neat and tidy.	
Oct 21 2007 	Thistle Euston Nickled 	Hotel Only offers wi-fi internet access which was not usable on my laptop (my co. has not ok'd wifi for our laptops yet) but even to use it cost &gt;$12.00 for one hour and you must purchase cards from front desk. If you are booted out before your hour is up you lose the remaining time. Additionally, I was booked for 3 nights however I concluded my business in 2 days and when checking out the person at reception was confused about this (not native English speaking) and rather testy when I asked to ensure bill was correct for 2 nights vs. 3. As you might expect ANYTHING in London is EXTREMELY expensive even this mid-grade 3 star hotel.	
Oct 14 2007 	Shabby	The Thisle Euston advertises as a 4 star hotel, some parts are e.g. the reception but the room I was given certainly was not. It was desperately in need of decoration, the air conditioning was noisy on or off. The room was small, bathroom adequate. This certainly was not a 4 star standard even though that was the price I paid.Additionally for anyone approaching the hotel on foot from the Euston Station direction after dark , this is a badly lit street with a derelict park situated half way along.	
Oct 7 2007 	Very little to be positive about	My experience with the Thistle Euston hotel started when at 7pm of the day I was meant to check in I called to ensure that I would not forfeit my room through a late arrival. This was my first mistake as I ended up talking to a operator / receptionist with a limited grasp of English which resulted in me finally hanging up not particularly sure whether my call had been interpreted as a confirmation or a request to offer my room to someone else. So it was with a sense of foreboding that I finally arrived at the hotel. Whilst the first 'visual' impressions of the hotel were very good with the reception and public areas being decorated to a high and tastful standard I wish that this first impression had stayed as a constant theme in the ensuing two days. However the public areas were perhaps the only area of the hotel that did impress me and it is perhaps because I was kept queuing for 40 mins on arrival for the one receptionist to clear a coach party group that I had so much time to appreciate the public areas. Finally I was served by a rather bad tempered receptionist who couldn't quite seem to be able to handle my double barrelled name and therefore asked me several times whether I was sure if I had booked at the Euston Thistle as there were several other thistle hotels in London. Eventually she found my reservation and so I walked off into the depths of the hotel feeling extremely patronised and extremely exhausted. I was allocated a room on the fourth (top) floor and had to trek through an endless stream of corridors to finally reach my room. As for the room I can't say whether I was unlucky or whether the whole hotel was similar to the room I was allocated. If the latter is the case then I am unsure as to how they manage to justify the 198 pounds a night price tag with turned out to buy me a room with a bed, that was so hard that I did not manage to convince my body once to even try and succumb to sleep, a bathroom which was in a filthy state on arrival and had taps, which offered low pressure drips as an attempt to run a bath, and finally a television which did not work. In an attempt to be positive the room did contain several other features which although in no way redeeming did prevent me from somehow thinking I had checked into a hostel. These included an ironing board, telephone, kettle, safe and trouser press.However most worthy of a completely seperate paragraph is the attitude of the staff. Whilst I did encounter one 'customer service orientated' team member it was my experience that the rest of the staff were rude to an almost unacceptable standard and bad tempered. In an attempt to stay short of writing a book I will only give two examples. The first was at night I became thirsty and therefore after running the taps and seeing dark cloudy water come out I called to room service only to be told that they were unable to bring it to my room so could I just pop down and get it and could I bring my credit card. The second and most unforgivable example was when in the morning I called down to room service asking for some hot water with some lemon in only to have the individual reply flatly no as I had a kettle in my room and it wasn't worth his bother and if I wanted lemons to go with my hot water there was a mini mart nearby.Whilst this establishment has the potential to be a great hotel in my personal view it completely falls on it's face through the attitude of it's staff and what seemed to me to be a total disrespect for customers.	
Oct 5 2007 	We would stay again	My sister and I booked a 1-night stay at the Thistle Euston, as we had an early train to catch from Euston the following day. Whilst booking, we had requested 2 single rooms at a very discounted rate from the Superbreaks website, and so were very pleased at check-in to be upgraded to 2 double rooms. The rooms were some of the smallest double rooms that we have ever stayed in, but were completely equipped, even with iron and ironing board, and tea and coffee making facilities. The ensuite bathrooms were also very small, but provided everything we needed, including even a retractable washing line.The double bed in my sister's room was somewhat hard, and she had an uncomfortable night on the whole, but my bed was fine. There was a slight problem with the noise from the nearby Euston railway station - we could hear tannoy announcements for the first part of the night.Breakfast was a standard buffet fare with cereals, rolls, eggs and sausages. The fruit salad was certainly skimpy, and the orange juice tasted more like cheap orange squash with artificial sweetener in it. Otherwise, breakfast was adequate and would probably suit visitors from England, Europe or the States.	
Oct 2 2007 	Fantastic stay	We have just returned from a couple of days at the Thistle Euston. The hotel is average but we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go back home.On arrival we checked in to a Deluxe room which was small, outdated and depressing. I went back to Reception and spoke to a lovley lady (Katy I think) who was very helpful and apologetic and gave us an upgraded bigger room overlooking the park. Paul helped us with our bags and organized bargain Theatre tickets for us. Both were very pleasant and understanding. All the staff was very friendly and did their utmost to help us. The only negative point..........long ques for Breakfast so dont go down there hungry! All in all a great time in London. (Ask for Paul and Katy if you need anything!)	
Sep 16 2007 	great overall hotel	The hotel looks like nothing from the outside but inside is really beautiful.The reception staff are really helpful and the bar staff are really nice.The bedrooms are stunning and are really clean. The bed was so comfortable you did't want to get out it.The resturant was beautiful, dinner was great.Its presantation was good but was not very filling and the breakfast was edable but i've had better.So the hotel overall was nice.The other good thing was the bus stop was just around the corner and most buses go directley to piccadilly circus and westminster and all other big attractions. And most of all you walked off the train at euston station and a short wall to the hotel which was great for arriving and departing.	
Aug 29 2007 	Clean but not really a 4 star hotel	I probably got the wrong room. The hotel didn't looked a 4 star hotel at my eyes. the room size was good but fornitures and beds were dated and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.The room was clean but the bathroom was mauldy and dated.Bad experience for me. I won't surely go back.	
Aug 19 2007	Very Very Basic Hotel	The Hotel Thistle Euston is not in a particularly enticing location but most of London's attractions are within easy reach by tube. Expect very basic accomodations, nothing at all fancy. The morning rush at the breakfast room is intimidating: it's crowded, there's a line, and the room is noisy. That said, London's hotel rooms are very very expensive, and if you're unwilling to spend a considerable amount per night for a room, then this will have to do.	
Aug 8 2007 	 You Pays your money you takes your chances 	we booked this hotel as part of a theatre package ( train tickets , hotel , tickets for chicago)all for the princley sum of £375 for 2 night half board.I can say in all honesty it was worth every penny,the rooms were very clean,the service more than good( free paper in the morning),coffee and tea making facilitys in room,the room was a twin and very good size overlooking the little park,the half board consisted of full english breakfast ,cereals,juices etc but where it really scored points though,was the food,the cheff there knocked up some beautifully presented plates and the portions were substantial,the staff were very attentive and there was no long waits between the 3 courses.i like my grub and i have a bloody good moan if its not up to par,however this stuff was excellent and a good choice of dishes.the only things i found a small amount of fault with was the tv in the room had a bit of a ropey picture,the staffs grasp of the english langauge left a bit to be desired and the bar prices were extortionate( £2.30 for a half of biiter and £3.75 for a pineapple and lemonade,needless to say we only drank once in there!)but apart from that we had a very pleasant stay for very reasonable prices.( by the way........Chicago was brilliant !!!! )	
Aug 2 2007 	Great Price Great Hotel	We stayed in a double room for three nights, overlooking the park. The room was big enough for two people and all our stuff. It was very clean, the bed was good and big. Good location, next to the tube, and on a quiet neighborhood. Overall a great experience, and we will definitely stay there again.	
Jul 24 2007 	Cosmos owns all	I stayed two nights here during my Cosmos tour. I was first assigned a room on the first floor all the way in the back where I had to go through a byzantine series of hallways and down some stairs to get to my room. I normally never complain to management but I had just twisted my ankle on the plane so I asked reception to change to a room with no stairs in the hallway. I was given attitude by reception but was assigned a room on the second floor. No stairs in the hallway!Room was not bad size for London and clean. Continental breakfast was standard bread and yogurt and coldcuts. If you paid $200+ for a room here, it's overpriced.	
Jul 24 2007 	Thistle Euston - Mediocre at best	The Thistle Euston hotel is just not special.I stayed in a single room, which was actually reasonably sized (for a single, anyway). However, the air conditioner didn't work (after 4 requests, they brought be a fan), and the mattress really needed to be replaced a decade ago. It was not just lumpy -- it leaned. The part near the wall was a good 2&quot; thicker than the rest, and the head of the bed was a good 3-4&quot; below the foot!Other people in my tour group all had varying room quality. Some had rooms whose air conditioning couldn't be turned off, and thus they were freezing all the time (I offered to trade, I prefer cold to hot)The staff was not very helpful either... as I said, 4 requests to get a fan. My &quot;complimentary newspaper&quot; was delivered only 2 of the 4 mornings. Twice I had to go request extra towels, as the cleaning staff forgot them -- they would take the old ones out of the room, and then not leave clean ones at all.The event staff is no better -- we had a meeting room reserved, with some snacks, plus coffee + tea service.We requested the coffee + tea to be brought in 5 or 6 times... The first time, it was &quot;ok, be right back&quot;. Then, a half hour later &quot;oh... I didn't know you were supposed to have... hang on, I'll go get it&quot;. About an hour later &quot;The coffee's still brewing!&quot; Then, later &quot;oh, you have to order that stuff, and nobody's placed an order for you&quot; (at which point our tour guide showed the order confirmation and said that anyway, she's ordering it now!). Finally, 1 hour later, &quot;Oh... it's a weekend, the event manager's not here, and all the equipment is locked in a room, and we don't have a key&quot;.And then, about 2 hours later (by this time we'd all bought individual cups of coffee and tea from the bar, and long, long since finished them), &quot;Here ya go! I can't bring coffee, but here's a big thing of hot water and some teabags!&quot;	
Jul 15 2007 	Not too bad	Stayed for just one night in the Euston Thistle. My wife and I paid £70 for a double room (no breakfast). The hotel was nice and clean, and the location was good. Nothing over special about the hotel, but it was quiet and clean	
Jul 5 2007 	Give this Thistle a miss unless someone else is paying	I was sent to this hotel by British Airways due to all flights being cancelled. I arrived around 11pm armed with a BA voucher that I had been assured was prepaid and booked. On arrival the staff clearly had no knowldge of these arrangements and I warned them that BA were sending travellers to west London hotels and to expect more. On cue another half dozen began dripping in and a small queue formed. The staff seemed concerned but took it in their stride to find rooms for everyone and the man in charge was very professional in handling the situation. I was one of the first and had to wait around an hour. I have no idea about the rest of the crowd. I checked out the bar and it was the usual half in a room half in the hall, bland, souless bar that I would have passed on excepting the circumstances and the time. The young lady behind the bar (Polish, I think) brightened up the place with a friendly attitude but the choice of beers was poor and overpriced, but that is London in a word. When I finally got my room (49) I found myself in an endless narrow corridor below bar level and what appeared to be dozens of numbered doors all virtually next to each other on either side. Alarm bells were sounding in my head as it was clear my room was not going to be the Tardis. Incidentally don't expect anyone to get your bags either, I only saw 3 peoply in the reception area and they had their work cut out with the unexpected popularity of their hotel. On entering the room I was confronted by what appeared to be the smallest hotel room I have seen in a long time and I had just returned from staying in 3 others around Britain that boasted a few less stars than this. I dont wish to boast but I have a bathroom back home that has more space. Anyhow, twin beds a Tv and some teamaking facilties made up the room's compliment. The bathroom was something else. Boasting time again but I seriously do have a larger cupboard. However everything was clean but the general feel of the building was dated. I returned to the desk where I spied the room rates of £193 single or £211 double. At least someone had a sense of humour. They should move the sign to the bar where at least you can be half cut and it won't seem so bad. I stayed in a Ttravel Inn in Dundee the previous week for £60 and apart from the rubbish restaurant, everything was bigger better and more modern and does not deserve any of the critiscism here. Did I mention the view. Directly outside the window are steps leading down to a dingy basement with obligitory rails (I thought they were all requisitioned for the war effort in 1941) and a dark ugly street-no Torquay hotel view here. As I had not eaten and had been assured that room service was available 24hrs a day, I telephoned --and phoned ---and phoned----nothing. At around 0100 I went to reception. There were still lots of people sitting about (possibly more BA rejects) and the young, quiet chap at the concierge desk, took my order which he personally brought to my room some 20 minutes later telling me that he was sorry but it was very busy and could I pay for it now. I was slightly stunned at this but paid up and made a mental note to get receipt in morning. The next morning I was awakened bright and early by the sound of the housekeepers scurrying around outside and rummaging in their store which was located the other side of my wall 2 feet from my head. Breakfast is available in a restaurant below the hotel and was okay. Not the kind you get personally cooked for you in a bed and breakfast for a fraction of the price, but more the buffet style, this is stuff we prepared earlier, type. I dont know if this is standard for London hotels but for some reason service sector businesses in London seem to think that they should charge top rate for everything ( hotels, food, taxis, drink etc whilst providing a take it or leave it, we are doing you a favour type attitude. I will make an exception with many of the foreign staff that are being employed in the industry of late. They do, for the most part, make a genuine effort and don't seem to bear the grudges of working in a low paid industry that their home grown counterparts have adopted. On a general note, proprietors of large hotel chains in Britain should try their equivalents abroad, Dubai for example, where service is premium and prices by comparison are not, then they should hang their head in shame and come back and retrain themselves and their staff in how to provide top quality facilities and service at acceptable prices, but then why would they when we Brits continue to roll over and accept shoddy poor value at home.Would I recommend this hotel-not likely but mainly for its dull atmosphere, prices and rooms. The staff were doing a reasonable job but there are better places out there at less money.	
Jun 27 2007 	Above average overall	Overall I had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. I had a deluxe room on the second floor. Although not particularly big it was very clean, with powerful shower and tea/coffee making facilities.The air conditioning worked fine too, there was a safe and a TV. I was pleasantly surprised to see they had Sky Sports 2 and 3 as available channels from the bedroom which I really appreciated.True, the restaurant is in the basement and a little dated. But quite frankly the breakfast was perfectly fine. The bacon was very meaty, the sausages contained herbs and were a fair size. The staff were also reactive. Our only complaint would be they forget to put some tea spoons on our table.There was also a bar with a large TV screen which we didn't use but looking quite a nice area. FInally, I bumped into the manager when checking out. He looked extremely smart and was greeting guests who had come for a corporate function, he seemed proud of his hotel.In summary, for around 100 pounds per night you could go a lot more wrong elsewhere.	
Jun 18 2007 	horrible restaurant	Really dread being booked into this hotel for business (have no choice), Handy for Euston but what I really hate is the dated and gloomy basement restaurant with bizarre menu and very expensive wine. I'm definitely going to eat elsewhere next time even though my meal there is paid for. Also breakfast is terribly crowded and hectic in the same dismal location. Turquoise decor!! My room has been extremely noisy on both occasions I have stayed there recently.	
Jun 5 2007 	Reasonable	Following advice in a previous review I got a cheaper rate than the hotel website by booking through the Hidden Hotel section of lastminute.com. I paid £120 for a deluxe double instead of £169. I was there for 1 night as I had a meeting the next day. The room (221) was absolutely tiny and I find it difficult to believe that this was a deluxe room. There was no mini-bar and the complimentary toiletries were extremely basic. It is many years since I did my HCMIA (even tho' I never actually worked in the hotel indstry) but I can't see how this justified the description or the price. On the plus side, check-in was friendly and efficient. I was offered a choice of papers and a wake up call. The bar was a reasonable place to meet my colleagues for a beer before we hit town. I was gutted to discover that one of my colleagues had been upgraded to an executive King suite, which sounded absolutely fantastic (he paid rack rate for his booking as a single room - £169), and was upgraded as they weren't full and he'd paid full whack. Another colleague who had booked a bogstandard single room for £104 (NHS discount) was 'upgraded' to a double deluxe like my little shoebox. The bed felt too hard to sit on, but was extremely comfortable and I got a good night's sleep. The sheets were beautifully clean, and the towels were soft and fluffy. The water pressure wasn't great, but the shower itself was fine, and had the interesting effect of a shower of light droplets as there was a spotlight directly above - quite pretty! The room initially looked a bit dingy, and had a view of the rooms opposite, masked by nets which were filthy (but didn't smell at least!), but the carpets and soft furnishings were all clean.The room was quiet (well I did get in at 1.30!), but it did get noisy whe other people started getting up from around 0600 and putting the TV on, having showers etc. I didn't have breakfast (I took my own stuff), but it looked reasonable. Checkout-wise there was a big queue, but the concierge went through the line asking if people had anything to pay, and if you had no extras then they would just post the bill on to you, so no queue for me! The lobby was large-ish, clean and quiet (no Cosmos coach parties!). The bellhop wandered through periodically, picking up leaves blown in off the street. There was good camaraderie between the staff I observed on duty, which was pleasing to see.In summary; reasonable. Ask for an upgrade if you pay full price for a room. a no frills hotel that is perfectly acceptable as a pit-stop overnight.	
May 20 2007 	business not pleasure	i was staying at the thistle on a business trip - two nights midweek. the hotel check in was good - my stay was booked and organised through my company so this was easy really - turn up, tell them my name and get my room key - everything paid for!the room was MILES away from the reception and as the floorboards creaked and the fusty smell got worse i arrived at my room door - i opened it and found myself in a 'cell' - triangle shaped room with a small double bed (set for a single person) and a tiny bathroom - but clean and tidy.the restaurant was lovely - not a typical hotel restaurant and not full of loan business travellers! some tourists too and the restaurant had entrance from the street for anyone to use. food was fantastic - three course meal and service was great - even thought i asked for pineapple juice topped up with lemonade and nearly got a pint of apple juice! the first morning i decided to have breakfast in my room and completed the menu and hung it on the door know - as instructed before 2am! and when my breakfast arrived it looked like it had been prepared at 2am - all the food was covered in cling film - and the 'fresh' crossiant was so stale! minging!the second nights meal was not as impressive - food was good but service was slow and almost rude as the staff seemed far to 'busy' to deal with our dirty plates and serving our next course. the second mornings breakfast was much better - food was fresh and yummy but it was so busy and the tables werent being cleaned quick enough etc. check out was smooth but very busy so try and get there with about 15mins to spare otherwise you will be late for your meeting! haha!overall, average and if i had booked this hotel for tourist purposes i would be so dissappointed! we travelled by train to st pancras and its at least a 15-20minute walk to the hotel - and with bags and suitcases it was more like 25mins!	
May 16 2007 	Don't know what all the moaning is about	My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for me. Apart from us, we also had my brother and sister-in-law, and their two daughters in our party. After booking the hotel, my husband then read the reviews posted on this website. He was dismayed to see the awful reviews, and emailed the hotel in order to try to alleviate problems other guests had suffered. He asked for upgraded rooms from standard to deluxe. Rooms all on the same floor, and rooms that didn't face Euston Station.On arrival to the hotel, there were a lot of cosmos guests littered about the lobby with travelling cases, obviously waiting for their coaches, but we didn't find this a problem. Whilst booking in, the Manager approached me, and said he had received my husbands email, and that he had done everything we had asked for. We even had the upgraded rooms for the same price. My husband had mentioned the awful reviews on 'Tripadvisor' in his email, so the Manager had looked it up, and told me he was very surprised by the comments as he had been there five years, and had never heard complaints about the noise coming from the train station.We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, especially the Manager who went out of his way to give us everything we had requested. My brother and sister-in-law's room faced over the park, and was large with a nice seating area. My room, along with my neices bedroom were smaller and faced over the central courtyard area. The view wasn't particularly nice, but I didn't care, as we were only sleeping there. The beds were extremely comfortable, and we didn't hear a thing all night. Absolute bliss. The room was clean and the power shower fantastic, certainly woke me up.My thanks also goes to the conciege, who were extremely helpful. We had spent the evening in Camden Lock, and left it way to late to find a restaurant to eat. We came back to the hotel, asked the conciege to order takeaway for us, and even provided us with plates, knifes and forks. They even sent the delivery driver to our rooms with our food. They were polite, friendly and couldn't do enough for us. All-in-all, this hotel may not have the luxury of other 4/5 stars, but the staff more than make up for it. Finally the breakfast was excellent, and here again the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. I can't fault this hotel one bit, and would certainly come back again.	
May 14 2007 	Great hotel for price paid 	We booked this hotel for a 1 night stay via last mintue.com (secret hotels) and paid £79 for a double room (room only).The hotel was a 3 min walk from Euston Square tube station and about a 25 min walk to Leicester Square, so for us a very good location.Our room was small but very clean with a good bathroom - bath and shower.Reception and Bar areas were also clean and staff we meet were friendly.We would return to this hotel again at the right price.	
Apr 30 2007 	Be warned do not stay here.	Absolutely disgraceful. Booked into the Thistle Bloomsbury but was transferred her due to overbooking. We were promised it was a four star hotel and an Executive room. What a blag that was. It was awful, unfriendly with disorganised staff. The room was stuck in a time warp and was seriously in need of new furniture. A homeless hostel was more appealing.Do yourself a favour and walk right past this one.	
Apr 25 2007 	Is this Londons noisiest hotel? With the worst customer service?	Is this Londons noisiest hotel?I stayed at the Thistle Euston for one night earlier this week and it was very definitely one night too many. I was there on business as we had used a meeting room at the hotel one day and had another meeting planned there for the next day. The service provided by the staff in relation to the meeting rooms and all that that entailed was very good and I have no complaints about that. However, I hope my experience of the overnight stay serves as a warning to business and leisure travellers alike. I travel quite a lot throughout the UK for work and also love to travel abroad for holidays so Ive stayed in a huge number of hotels, including several in central London and I think I have realistic expectations. I KNOW that traffic noise is continual in London and that other guests may disturb you etc etcUpon check in (which was slowish but OK) my colleague and I asked for quiet rooms. We were told that the hotel was very full but that the rooms were not noisy as there was good sound-proofing. We were in no way the last to check in so we thought it was somewhat odd that the room allocation could not be changed. Anyway, we decided it was for one night only so to just go with it. My first room was 405. I do wish Id had a camera to take a photograph of the view of Euston station platforms to add to this review! The station announcements could be heard very clearly from within the room. However, I thought it will be OK when the trains stopped running and that I needed to be up fairly early the next morning so that Id be able to get enough sleep. The room itself was quite cramped  I had to sort of shimmy sideways past the bed but it was clean enough, there was plenty of hot water and a safe large enough to take my laptop etc. Overall, it was pretty bland and the bathroom fittings antiquated. Breakfast was very average and the restaurant cramped.After a meal and a few drinks in the bar that evening I retired to bed. Oh dear! At around 11.30 pm there was still considerable noise from the station tannoy and trains as well as from cars going up and down a ramp to the station car park. I phoned reception and asked for another room. Again I was told that the hotel was full and then two minutes later that I could have another room that would be better. I had to pack up my stuff, get dressed and go down to reception to collect the new key. This time I was given room 201. Frying pans and fires spring to mind.Although not directly opposite the station it was just around the corner and the noise from the station still clearly audible. I stuffed cotton wool in my ears and a pillow over my head and eventually at about 1.30 am managed to get to sleep. Room 201, though, is right opposite the lift and next to the doors by the staircase so that hardly helped. Anyway, at 4.40 am I was awakened by very loud, huge coaches parked under my window. These were left with engines running. This is because Cosmos use the hotel and have their own office in the hotel lobby.The noise from the coaches clearly woke whoever was in the next room and I was also treated to their television. Not only is the sound-proofing to the exterior windows inadequate but the adjoining door between the rooms (locked) had a 2 cm or so gap at the bottom. I have never come across such a flimsy interior door in a hotel as this. They usually have a kind of double door. Next doors' alarm call at 5.45 am was heard loud and clear in my room  although clearly nobody in either room would ever need such a thing! Then of course people started to use the lift, the traffic noise increased, the delivery vans for the kitchen began to arrive and the station kicked back in too so three hours sleep was all I got. I should say that my colleagues room was faced an interior yard and was unaffected by noise but many of the rooms in this hotel must be badly affected. I have stayed in numerous station and airport hotels and never experienced noise levels to this extent. The Thistle group should invest some money in decent glazing and should address the flimsy state of the doors between the rooms. In addition to the unacceptable sound-proofing, I was very unimpressed by the attitude of the reception staff. I complained politely about my allocation of room and the off-hand response was quite remarkable. To spell it out here in full would make this report unbearably long but, in essence, there was no apology, a grudging 10% reduction in my room rate (eventually) and the comments that they are not worried that our corporate business will go elsewhere in the future and that they have other priorities (I infer that means Cosmos customers). All in all it was a thoroughly miserable experience.Obviously we are following up this complaint with Thistle directly and, needless to say, our corporate business will go elsewhere in the future. My advice to anybody considering staying at this hotel for business or pleasure is to go elsewhere too. Its not the nicest bit of London and, if you really must stay round Euston, then try the Novotel which is not perfect but which has better soundproofing and staff who appear to have had some customer service training!	
Apr 17 2007	pass on this one	This hotel is mainly used by Cosmos tours. So whatever you paid for your room, your fellow residents paid half of what you did through their package tour. The lobby and puny elevators are constantly jammed with groups of 40 or more coming into the hotel from tour buses. The front desk is extremely unconcerned with any issue you may bring to them. I would guess that they are jaded from the long lines and crowds that they deal with on a daily basis. The included breakfast that is offered in the basement is bland and unappealing. The motif reminded us of an old hospital cafeteria. The rooms are small (so what else if new, it is London). We could hear the neighbors arguing next door. We asked that our bags be taken into the room and not left in the hall, since we waited for over an hour for delivery. The front desk said, 'of course they will be put in the room'. We came back to the hotel four hours later, our bags were in the hallway, not our room.The area of town is a little edgy. I would pass on this one.	
Apr 13 2007 	Not what I expected	Having seen the regular prices quoted for a stay at this 4* hotel, I was expecting much more than I got. Judging from the other reviews it seems I had an unusually bad experience, but I found the room, which according to my booking should have been &quot;deluxe&quot;, to be very small and with little natural light. The bathroom was OK but in the morning I found what looked like a medium sized cockroach waiting to greet me. I'm pretty sure I didn't bring it with me! Breakfast was good but the restaurant is in the basement with no windows and has a rather odd layout and decor. On checking out they tried to charge me for newspapers, which on arrival I was told would be complimentary. All in all, just about acceptable for the price I paid (£105 a night) but I don't plan to stay there again. Of course the key is to make a fuss at the time if you're not happy with what you're given but I just wanted a hassle and stress free stay so didn't feel like complaining to the unsmiling staff on reception.	
Apr 11 2007 	Great Location Poor Service!	The location of this hotel was perfect for our stay as it is very central, however the service was less than perfect. All the staff we talked to were foreigners who didnt understand us. We had a very creepy, preverted phone call one night and when we complained to reception, she didn't undertstand what we were saying and in the end all she could say was that maybe the phone numbers got mixed up! We asked concierge to book us a taxi, but he told us that we could hail for one from the street and then walked off! This is not the service that we expecte from a 4 star hotel and we were deeply disappointed. Needless to say that we will not be going back there again!!	
Mar 25 2007 	First Time in London	Two problems:1. The view from my room wasn't so great. I didn't spend much time there so it didn't make much difference to me, but that can be a major let down for the another traveler.2. The hotel's restaurant specifically at dinner time. Breakfast,which was included with my room, was fine-no problems whatsoever. Dinner, which I had to pay for, was disorganized and the pizza tasted like hot cardboard. Okay, enough of that.So I check in on Sunday and the process was smooth and efficient. (I like to use a travel agent so I don't have to play the credit card game with the front desk.)My room is good for a single traveler or a couple who intends to share the bed. The hotel is set up to accomodate business travelers. The room is quite snuggle friendly (read: tiny) by American standards. It's neat and tidy with maid service every day. The tea set is hidden under the tv and you can request a morning paper.The concierge is VERY useful. I booked a trip Sunday night to tour Paris Monday morning and he managed to get me a seat (stay tuned for my Paris review later). The tour picked up at my hotel at 6 AM-half an hour before breakfast starts-and he found me a breakfast box to take up to my room. He also arranged a wakeup call and made sure I had maps and directions to other attractions.The hotel is conveniently located near the Euston rail station, which is a pretty major train station in London for the Underground and British Rail. If you're using the Underground to get around town you'll need to walk about a block.The Thistle Euston was neat, clean, had a well organized front desk/concierge, and nice and quiet. I'd stay here again.	
Feb 27 2007 	Great for a short break	My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for a night away in London. We booked through lastminute.com secret hotels where you don't find out the name of the hotel until after you have booked and as such you get a cheaper rate. However we could tell from the blurb on lastminute that we were booking the Thistle and as such got a £60 deal rather than paying £90 - definitely worth it!Having read the other reviews on the site I was going expecting a mediocre 3 star despite the official 4 star rating. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and feel that our experience was a lot better than some others.We did have a deluxe room (429) and I had requested a quiet room - contrary to many of the reviews our room was very large and had a sofa area. It also overlooked the little park rather than Euston station and as such was very quiet. I think it was a smoking room (which we hadn't requested) as there was an ashtray on the coffee table. However there wasn't a noticeable smell and we didn't want to move. The bathroom was clean and the shower was lovely! The only thing i would say about the room is that on the surface it all looks quite plush and new but there are small details that they haven't updated so recently - one of these was the tatty looking window frame but this was behind the net curtain the whole time so you didn't even notice!The staff on reception were polite and helpful and looked after a bunch of flowers quite happliy for us while we went out after checking out of the hotel. The reception area is very swish which I wasn't expecting when we first walked in as the outside of the hotel is quite shabby looking. On balance I'd rather it be nicer inside than out though!The location of the hotel is really good - Euston underground is 2 minutes walk and there is a line straight down to Leicester Square. We were also able to park for free on the street outside all weekend which was great in central London! We were careful not to leave anything on show in the car though.Overall I was impressed with the hotel - probably mostly because I wasn't expecting it to be the standard that it was. I would definitely return.	
Feb 15 2007 	Great New Year Night!	Me and my fiance stayed in this hotel for new years eve and we really enjoyed it. we chose it because of how close it was to euston station, literally a 2 minute walk!the rooms were comfortable and very clean with tv and tea and coffee making facilities. very comfortable beds. clean bathroom with bath and shower. ice machine in the corridor so we filled the sink up with ice to chill our champagne for when we returned! the staff were very friendly and helpful at the bar and at reception. breakfast in the basement was lovely with cooked english breakfast, pastries, bread rolls, fruit, yoghurts, fruit juice, tea and coffee. all buffet service which was a nice start to the day. some rooms seemed to look over the the station platforms so might have been noisy, but we didn't stay in one of these so i can't really comment, just an observation.overall no complaints at all. i reccomend this hotel for a short break to london to see the sights due to it's fab location next to euston station which has great tube links.	
Jan 31 2007 	I would recommend this hotel to my best friend	I think this is an average hotel. Compared to hotels in Japan (I am Japanese), the facilities were a little worse than I am used to. For example, I wish there had been a fridge in the room. However, for the price I guess that a fridge is too much to expect. The location was very good. We could get to Eusron Station in 3 minutes on foot and there were several other stations within 10 minutes. It was convenient for visiting the big sightseeing sspots in London.	
Jan 14 2007 	Very clean 	In line with most other reviews of this hotel, we had no problems with it and are fairly neutral. On the plus side it is very convenient for Euston station, being only a 3-5 minute walk even with luggage. Despite some reports, the street leading to it is well-lit and you pass enough buildings including another hotel not to be worried about safety. We were dealt with very quickly and efficiently at check-in (and check-out for that matter) in a smart, welcoming reception area. The restaurant was closed whilst we were there so I can't comment on food although the room service menu looked ample and reasonable in price. We had a double room which was very clean and comfortable with a clean serviceable en-suite. However, it has to be the smallest double room I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. I reckon the main sleeping area was no more than 7ft x 12 ft (2.1m x 3.6m) and the bathroom was also small. There was a tv with minimal channel selection and tea/coffee making facilities which really was about it. So combine the size of the room with the limited facilities within the room and the hotel then you can see why I say that there's no way it is 4*. However, as a place to comfortably rest your head whilst doing the tourist bit in London then you would do a lot worse. Just make sure you book it through one of the discount websites to ensure you don't pay full whack; I would have been far less complimentary had paid the hotel's rates.	
Dec 6 2006	Clean basic accommodations	I booked it for a 3 night stay visiting friends who lived in the area. I had a twin room to myself - small but clean with a small, clean, modern bathroom with bath/shower . The bed had lovely new looking duvets/covers and sheets. The towel warmer was a nice touch and had plenty of hot water. My room was quiet (on a courtyard side so not facing the street) and pleasantly decorated if a old fashioned and small. The kettle, tea, milk and shortbread were a nice little treat.The staff was friendly although sometimes communication was difficult as no one spoke English as a first language.The negatives: uncomfortable mattresses and rock hard pillows. When friends called, the front desk took forever to answer the telephone or didn't answer at all which sometimes made making arrangements a bit difficult. I didn't try and use their business facilities so can't comment on internet, etc.The hotel was very convenient to Euston station. Although I didn't eat in the hotel the food looked to be quite average and there are many other options in the area. The lobby and bar was busy - it will be great when smoking is banned in public places this summer.I would stay here again if visiting in the area as it was reasonably priced.	
Dec 5 2006 	Decent but noisy hotel	I stayed in Rm 358, a large well-decorated room with a big bathroom. It was obviously part of a suite and had a (locked) adjoining door to the bedroom (or perhaps lounge) of the suite next door.In terms of decor this Thistle is above average and there was nothing wrong with my room whatsoever. The only problem here is the noise. The doors throughout the corridor bang very loudly which woke me up every morning at 7am when the maids start moving around. I could also hear the people in the room next door moving around and watching TV.The location is fantastic for getting to Euston station, only a couple of minutes walk. However, I wouldn't advise a single female to even walk this short distance at night as the road is poorly lit and has the rail station buildings all along one side and the small park on the other. I didn't feel very safe at all.The breakfast was usual Thistle fare, with plenty of choice.I would recommend this hotel to someone looking for a convenient base to crash out after sight-seeing in London. Just remember to take your ear plugs!	
Oct 30 2006 	Flea-pt literally	It wasn't their fault, really. They were courteous and immediately moved me to a superior room, but there's no getting away from the fact that I not only got bitten by fleas my first night at the hotel but now have unwanted guests at home.This is not a 4* by any stretch. It's down a dingy backstreet beside the station, it's cheaply decorated and the amenities are decidedly second-rate. Avoid, tripadvisors!!	
Oct 6 2006 	Basic but convenient	Stayed one night with my wife on a leisure break.Very close to Euston Station, our arrival point and close to 3 tube stations at Euston, Euston sq and Warren St.Reception and bar area fairly basic and not very warm or inviting.Staff seem ok and check in was efficient although we were charged for food we never had on our final bill.Room wasok for what we paid and we did have a view over park and not the Railway!We did venture in restaurant in the evening and then made a quick exit. 1970's decor, unfriendly staff, and olives that appeared to have been served up on numerous previous occassions-avoid!Okay and convenient for price paid but Im sure there are better hotels at this price.	
Sep 16 2006 	horse box hotel	The rooms were disappointing, 2 meters wide, 4 m long, walking around the bed to get to the other side is a challenge and only for well trained persons, the bathroom is so small that it is hardly possible to turn inside.Windows are not sound proof with construction works throughout the night.A/C was not working and room temperature at night was 33 Celsius!price for 2 rooms/ 2 nights Deluxe rooms 1372 $ !!Lousy hotel ,by far too expensiveif the rooms had not been paid in advance we would have fled.	
Sep 12 2006 	Very comfy beds rather worn out bathroom	We booked a deluxe twin/double room at the Thistle Euston to stay over while leaving our son off to college. Got a very good rate compared with rack. The location was ok-ish, convenient for tube, easy to find and on street parking available. First impression was of very nicely appointed reception /bar area. The room was clean, although view of the station yard and un-openable windows were a minor disappointment. There were only enough tea bags for two cups, and these were not replenished overnight. The cost of broadband internet connection at 50p/min is daylight robbery! The beds were extremely comfortable and we slept very well. However the bathroom was tiny, with a low ceiling and even though I am only 5'7&quot; I had to squat to get under the shower. The fittings were also aged and worn, and the extractor did not extract. There was no clear evidence that breakfast was available, except as an in-room service for which the grand sum of around £12/head + £2 tray fee would be charged for full English (why a tray fee???). I would recommend breakfast in Euston station @ £3/head. We did not use the hotel restaurant that evening as the menu was uninspiring but ate out in Tottenham Court Road (excellent Italian for the same price as Thistle's room service breakfast!). On returning to the hotel, we had a drink in the hotel bar and were surprised that there was a soft porn channel playing on the large screen TV in the bar - it made conversation with my wife a one-sided affair! One lift was out of order which made for a long wait when checking out. On leaving the hotel we discovered our car rear windscreen had been vandalised, along with another car in the street. This entailed a 5 hour wait in the lobby for the glass company to come out (they never came). During this time, the hotel staff were very unattentive, and offered little help other than to allow us to make a freefone call to the help line, and the use of a metal cosh and a dustpan to remove the glass ourselves (no thanks due to Autoglass here!). Overall, for the price we paid, it was ok, but would have been upset to have paid more than we did (£90). I would not describe it as 4*. The Ibis in the same road has a similar feel, lower price, has off street parking, and has newer bathroom fittings (have stayed there twice).	
Aug 18 2006 	OK but there are better places for the money	Stayed here on a business trip. Reception staff pleasant and no queues, I was told I had been upgraded to a luxury room - great I thought but the room looked no bigger than any other London hotel I have stayed in and the decor is dated. The bathroom was tiny and the air conditioning didn't work. What is the problem with air con in UK hotels?! The room was very warm and I couldn't open the window due to the noise outside so I didn't get a good sleep. There were fans supplied however which helped a bit. The breakfast was delivered to the room as requested and was good although the coffee was way too strong. An average hotel in a good location but needs refurbishment in a number of areas.	
Jul 31 2006 	Unfriendly Staff old hotel	I stayed at this hotel on business recently and would not envisage I'll be staying there again. It was what I have come to expect of most Thistle hotels - dated and overpriced.I had booked a double non-smoking room, but on arriving was only offered a smoking room. Not the best start. I also arrived very late so ordered a ham/cheese sandwich and a coke. It came to £9.20.I also ordered to watch a movie on my last night (Jarhead), but the channel on which it would have been showing was broken. When I phoned reception they were extremely impolite and had a &quot;what do you expect us to do about it?&quot; attitude. Regardless, they charged £6.25 to my room (twice); they then (the third time I phoned) told me it would be removed from my bill immediately. It wasn't, and the next morning was still there. I had to presuade the receptionist at checkout that it had been a mistake, and recount the whole story again.I would never stay at this hotel again. Don't make the same mistake that I did.	
Jul 28 2006 	Too hot!	Stayed at the Thistle Euston for one night on business recently and overall it wasn't the best.The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the restaurant and bar were good. However I was in a single room and while it was clean and furnished well it was very small and cramped and the bathroom was even worse. The worst thing about the room however was that there was no air conditioning (as it had broke 2 months ago) or fans so the room was stifling &amp; the traffic noise from Euston Road prevented me from having the window open.All in all the place is ok, but there are better hotels about especially for the price.	
Jul 8 2006	some good and some bad	We stayed in a twin room for two nights in july 2006. The room we got was in the back of the hotel on the third floor. Generally, I think it's an OK hotel, conveniently located near a tube station. However, the AC in our room wasn't working, and we had to use a fan to vent out London's summer heat. After a few hours in the room, I was really exhausted and felt a headache.If you've got a room without a working AC, be sure to complain to the front desk. Seeing a fan on the table when we got in, we had assumed that the room wasn't air-conditioned, so we didn't bother to complain. We found out later that all rooms there are supposed to be air-conditioned. So, avoid making the same mistake.	
Jul 4 2006	Ok but rooms more 3* than 4* standard	I also booked this hotel through [------------------]as a 4* close to Tottenham Court Road, the name was not given. It isn't too far from Tottenham Court Road but the far end of the road, certainly nowhere near the tube station. It's not a bad location really but a good 25 minutes walk from where we'd have liked. Book it as Thistle EUSTON and you won't go far wrong it's just round the corner from the station.The best thing this hotel can boast is it's staff - receptionist and porters were both friendly and efficient. We didn't eat at the hotel or use the bar so i can't comment on other service areas.The room was clean but the decor was tired, shabby and definitely more of a 3* standard. We were in the basement so no real views and windows you couldn't open. The bathroom was the worst area of our room - the shower curtain was fitted so closely that, even though i'm slim, the curtain sticks to you all the time you shower - yuck! There was also a nasty brown stain running into the bath from the tap so you could only shower you wouldn't have wanted to have a bath.We did book this at the last minute so all our usual choices were fully booked. If this was the case again then i would consider returning to this hotel at the right price but it certainly wouldn't be top of my list. An ok hotel, if there's nothing else or you get a good rate.	
Jun 8 2006	Love Love Love	I absolutely loved Thistle Euston and everything it had to offer. I stayed here with my two cousins in London for five nights. Not too expensive, because we booked with Cosmos. The room was comfy and cozy, and the porters made us feel right at home. Be sure to ask for Herbert, Michael, and Willem (guy who looks like Tin-Tin). They gave exceptional service and even gave us a lot of information on where to go around London. Would definitely stay there again. Only one bad thing, the food sucked, but we usually missed breakfast being that we woke up at 12 pm.	
Jun 6 2006	Not As Good As Usual	We stayed at Thistle Euston for 6 nights late May and early June. We booked the hotel through AAVacations as we always do. This time we could only book an executive suite as there were no supior rooms available. We paid quite a bit extra for the executive suite.Upon check in we requested a room on the third floor overlooking the park (it is nice and quiet there). We have stayed at this hotel several times - 2 times a year and have always had a room on the 3rd floor, park view. This time we were sent to a room on the 3rd floor that was smaller than the rooms we had previously booked as a standard room. I immediately went to check in and was shown 3 other rooms on the same floor. Two of the three were superior rooms and one was an executive suite. Needless to say I chose the executive suite as that was what we paid for. The room was nice and clean as usual and we had full English breakfast which varried from day to day. Only one of the two tiny elevators was in service most of the time. Each day there were several tour busses with hundreds of suitcases to be taken to rooms. Waiting for elevator was a constant problem - expecially when we went to check out. We were late because of the elevator situation. We requested a taxi to take us to Paddington Station (about 10 minutes away). When their car arrived the driver was reluctant to quote us a price. After insisting on a price he told us 25GBP, Outrageous! We took the underground from Euston Square and arrived at Paddington in plenty of time to get the Heathrow Express. We will be returning in November and I will give the Thistle Euston one more chance.	
Jun 3 2006	It's not worth to go there	There is no reason to stay in this hotel for this price! I had a room in the first floor. OK, nicely furnished. But the room is so soggy that you can smell the mildow. Or is it the rubish under the carpet?And the doors! The doors slam automaticly. While I was there, a group of Russian tourist came in at 3 a.m.. No chance of sleeping until the last one on my floor checked in. To point it out: it's not the fault of the tourist, it is the fault of the hotel, installing doors that slam automaticly so hard, that the building &quot;shakes&quot;. Here is my advice: stay away from this hotel, until you like grubby, soggy and loud places. There is a Ibis and a Novotel nearby. And I am sure, that for £ 150 you get better rooms there.	
May 31 2006	Better than expected	Surprised how nice this hotel was after reading reviews. Business quality hotel right next to tube. Beds extremely comfortable and plenty of amenities in the room including iron and board. Clean and pleasant stay. If cheap enough would book again. Didn't eat here so cannot comment.	
May 13 2006	Many pros but some cons	Stayed for 2 nights at the Thistle Euston. I thought the hotel was slightly above average given the price I got on priceline, 80 USD per night including taxes. However, the rack rate for the room was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 200 USD per night and would have been totally unacceptable to have paid. I will briefly go over the pros and the cons.Pros:-Very close to Euston Station, a quick tube ride to the central london attractions, and many food outlets in the station-Very nice lobby area and hallways-Beautifully done bathrooms-Nicely decorated roomsCons:-TV could only get about 6 channels that wasnt pay TV-Bed was the worst I have ever slept on, hurt spine when I sat down, and felt like I was sleeping on a slab of concrete. Checked the matress and was made in 1994-Floors in room and hallways were creeky, and unlevel. I got the impression that the carpet was layed down on top of rubbish -Poor view from the room of an old abandoned warehouse and the train yard-Very old windows with paint flaking offDon't know if I would stay here again. Even for 80 USD per night, it seemed like a bad deal for even London.	
May 9 2006	Try the other Thistles	It takes a bit of time to realise why you don't like this hotel but that's because it is a mix of things, the location is poor unless you like seedy parts of London, the room I had wasn't overly clean (the middle of the floor was well vacumned, the sides weren't), the staff seemed to see guests as an inconvenience, the bar was full of loud drunks, the plumbing had two settings cold, and colder and if you are going to have rooms looking over a light well don't dump stuff in it. I've found most Thistle hotels I've stayed in good but this one was really a shock.	
Apr 26 2006	Great Value 	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Thistle Euston , late March for 6 days booked via an AA air package- flight, hotel, with full English breakfast . Last year we had booked the same room overlooking the Euston train station. We love the Thistle. Considering our week US dollar compared to the British pound, this is a terrific value. The room was spotless, beds were comfortable, duvet comforter &amp; covers, a personal welcome announcement on the TV, bathroom towel warmer. The staff was extremely friendly. When we arrived early Thursday morning, they allowed us to check into our room. It felt great to rest &amp; shower. Full English breakfast was amazing. I normally never eat much but could not resist their delicious fresh yogart w/ mango &amp; berry sauces. My husband loved the bangers &amp; Danish bacon with poached eggs, tomatoes, cold cut assortment &amp; brown toast. Delicious fresh coffe was always served in large pots. Thanks Thistle Euston,. We'll be back!	
Apr 21 2006	Not a great hotel for the price	I expected much better from this hotel for the price you pay but was very disappointed. The room I booked was supposed to be an executive room but was small and pokey. Not very comfortable for business travellers, and service was very slow. Wouldnt stay here again.	
Apr 12 2006 	more than acceptable business hotel	We got a really good mid-week deal direct with the hotel for four deluxe rooms and breakfast. The hotel was clean and modern with light and very spacious rooms that were well equpied and smart. The double bed was the best I've slept in for years.The lobby was professionally run and staff were polite and welcoming. Breakfast was nothing special but more than adequate. The hotel was minutes from Euston and I personally did not feel uncomfortable in the area.I was irritated by the fact that the minibar key has to be requested from reception but this is a minor niggle.However be advised that we had booked a meeting room facility to present to a client. For the sum of £200 for the morning we got a bedroom with a fold-up bed. At one point we thought we would have to use a bedsheet draped over the wall in lieu of a projector screen but one was fetched.All in all the best Thistle I have stayed in.	
Apr 11 2006	OK if you get a cheap deal otherwise forget it	I booked one night via lastminute for an unnamed 4 star hotel, which turned out to be 3 star. For the price I paid it was adequate. The bathroom was a bit dirty, there was only lukewarm water left for a shower in the morning and the hairdrier didn't work. Otherwise it was a reasonable size room with a comfortable bed in a handy if not picturesque location.	
Apr 8 2006	Great Room for the Price	My daughter and I stayed at the Thistle as part of a European tour. We expected a tourist grade room, but were pleasently surprised by the size and cleanliness of the room. The location is close to both the train station and bus stops. It made it very easy to sightsee in London. I would stay there again.	
Mar 26 2006 	Nothing special but the bed was comfortable and Internet access was great	I believe they had recently rolled out Internet access when I stayed and that was the reason I did book a room there. I think it was 10£ for 24hrs access. Anyways, the room I was assigned had problems with the Internet access. I was moved to a larger room without asking. (I just needed access to work) The connection was quite fast uploading/downloading. The bed was very comfortable and room service was great even at 3am. (I believe it was 3:00am...it was late/early)Both rooms were very clean. Included breakfast was typical and I was able to enjoy some American Football on the tele in the hotel bar. Mmmm...bacon crisps &amp; Boddingtons.I believe I stayed for a week. Quick access to Euston Station, less than 100M if I remember right. It's also an easy walk to the British Museum. I would stay there again.	
Mar 21 2006 	Actually quite good!	Stayed for 1 night on business. Arriving at Euston station, the hotel is very convenient (although the short walk up Cardington Street late at night might be slightly unnerving for some).I'd booked a single room (company policy) and was asked at reception if I minded a twin room instead! No, I didn't mind...The room was quite small and the view terribly uninspiring. But it was well equipped and very clean. There's quite a lot of chrome everywhere and polished marble in the bathroom which I thought was quite nice.Breakfast was good (I resisted the temptation to have it delivered to the room but it's nice to have the option).Throughout,the staff was friendly and efficient and the brief stay was a breeze, to be honest. Nothing truly outstanding but comfort levels are higher than your bog-standard, economy hotel.I would recommend for travellers arriving or departing through Euston Station who are looking for that &quot;little bit more&quot; than just a bed and shelter for the night!	
Mar 9 2006	Don't bother!	I stayed here with my partner for a long weekend and I can hardly remember any positives about this hotel. The rooms were extremely dated and it was very expensive for what it was. The location was quite far from the shopping area of London (so wear comfortable shoes if you want to walk!). I found the staff very unfriendly and unaccomodating. It is not a safe area to walk in the evening, especially women on their own. The bar is really shabby as well, reminded me of an old peoples home. You will be able to find much better hotels for the price this hotel asks. On a more positive note, the lobby area is nice and make sure you ask for a free map of London if you are visitor to the area.	
Jan 29 2006	Adequate nothing special	We stayed here for a couple nights back in November and didn't think much of it. There is a subway nearby which is nice, but the rooms are awfully cramped with virtually no room to move around. It was clean, but not really comfortable. Our room was especially cold during November and unfortunately the heater did not work.There are some affordable Indian/Pakistani restaurants nearby that are walking distance, but most everything you will want to see in London requires you get on the subway or call a taxi. The staff were cordial and polite. If I had to come back to London again I would definitely pick a more centrallly located hotel.	
Jan 5 2006	Great place for the price!	My first visit to London, I was worried about staying at the Thistle after I had read some reviews. Overall our room was clean, good size and we had no major complaints. Check in was easy, they let us check in early with no problem, upgraded our room and check out was also a breeze. Two of the porters were great!!! Helpful info, good recommendations for restaurants, tourism info etc. The restaraunt was closed for lunch and dinner and the bar food wasn't great but the food in London isn't great overall so this was no big deal to us. The location was good b/c it was a short walk to two different underground stations. For the deal we got on this hotel, we were Very pleased!!! Don't believe all the negative reviews...the beds were comfortable, rooms were spotless and didn't smell, service was good....book it and enjoy...we did!!! The red haired porter who looks like Clay Aiken was very helpful and another tall man with dark hair, I think his name was Danny....both great!!!!!	
Dec 19 2005 	Truly awful	Billed as a see when you pay 4* by Lastminute (making me very skeptical of using LM again) this hotel was by no means that. I would say 2+, if. My room was pokey, which is familiar for London rooms, but more to the point REALLY DIRTY. Stains on carpet, bed, mould on the bath grout - the sort of place you wouldn't dream of walking barefoot in.Moreover - i discovered when leaving my room morning after first night, the door didn't actually lock ...You could push it open without a key card! The housekeeper was walking by, and seemed shocked and said she would sort it out. She seemed really nice and I was in a mad hurry so I left her to it. It meant my stuff was left in the room free for anyone to wander in and take if they realised, but I trusted her to solve it and luckily there was a safe so my passport, laptop etc were secure. However, I came back that night to discover it had not been fixed, and I had the clear sense from the very disinterested reception staff encountered the previous day that there was no point in bothering trying to do any more about it. I told them again at reception the next day as I checked out, and they barely shrugged.My sleep was not eased by the fact that even the inside door latch did not hold the door secure had an intruder wanted to have a go. Nor by the fact that my room was on the second floor looking out on the street - the noise all night was incredible - what seems like a more or less deserted street turns out to be some kind of depot which trucks seemed to have enormous difficulty accessing, meaning endless maneauvers and the noise of reverse indicators through the night.And one last thing, while handy for Euston, the hotel is a five minute walk down a not great road, and at night I would not be particularly happy walking there as a lone female.Give this one a wide bearth - and don't trust last minute ratings either if this is a yardstick	
Dec 7 2005	Personality-free office block hotel but with a comfy bed.	Booked lastminute, and stayed for only one night as my Wife and I made a weekend of our visit to watch England play Samoa at Rugby.We had a room upgrade free of charge, which was nice and unexpected, but even our upgraded room was just a box with a big, comfy bed in it. I travel a lot on business, and I am starting to wonder just how useful an indicator the 'star' rating system is. Four star facilities maybe but hardly a four star experience.Bar was expensive and not on SINGLE native English speaker did we encounter during our stay.The buffet breakfast was expensive and rubbish, the tiny restaurant was overwhelmed by Sunday morning breakfasters.For under £75 its a decent and convenient place to kip in London, but I'd go for breakfast at a cafe in Euston Station next time I think and save £20.	
Dec 2 2005 	I'd stay here again - nothing special but OK	It was the first time I'd stayed at the Thistle. I arrived at Euston quite late, so very convenient instead of going off the train onto the tube.Check in was friendly and efficient, room was clean and comfortable and as warm or cold as I wanted it, which is always a bonus. Iron and ironing board in room (two actually...) a good touch. Not a very good range of TV channels.Didn't try the bar or restaurant.Breakfast was the average hotel breakfast with nothing to complain about or write home about either.Check out was OK for me as I was charging the room to the company, but I couldn't get a receipt as their systems were down. I don't kow how this affected other guests.In short, a good place to stay if you are arriving late at Euston. Nothing to be scared of, but nothing exceptional either.As someone else said - your average business hotel.	
Nov 21 2005	What an awful kip	Booked this through wotif - usually a great site. Rated 4 star. Who rates these things ? The reception was renovated and the check in efficent but that was it . The rest of the hotel is a dump. I did not specify smoking or non smoking so I got a smoking. It stank. When I complained to the unengaged manager he said that as it was a smoking room I should expect it to stink. So I asked was that also the case for ------ rooms. (ie ones with bathrooms)He said &quot;dont use word like that to me&quot;.Any way the room was tiny, the curtains torn, the room noisy and past its sell by date. The hotel consisted of long long long corridors.My credit cards were stolen (not at hotel). I rang the reception, no answer, I rang the porter, no answer. I hit the emergency number on the phone - answered after a long ring, by someone who could not speak English. Got a taxi to my brothers for assistance.This hotel would get two stars anywhere else.Avoid - dump.	
Oct 30 2005 	All depends on how much you pay	My &quot;above average&quot; rating is due to the excellent value for money which one can get at week-ends by booking through the &quot;highlifebreaks&quot; website, a subsidiary of Thistle Hotels, I suppose. I pre-paid (not refundable) £39.50 (full English breakfast included - worth £12.95 if paid for separately) for a very quiet, clean (but very small) single room overlooking the park on a recent Friday night. Quiet at night, that is, since I can confirm that maids knock on your door at 8:00 sharp if you have omitted to display the &quot;please do not disturb&quot; notice on your door.The blue-rinse brigade, present in large numbers in the evening, prepares you for the worst as far as breakfast queues next morning are concerned, but I was immediately given a table and offered coffee by friendly staff that spoke good English - something uncommon in London hotels.The general environment is admittedly depressing, but at the price the room, facilities and breakfast offer unbeatable value in Zone 1 London.At the mid-week &quot;rack rate&quot; of some £172 without breakfast (+£12.95) for a standard single room, the hotel would of course be the usual London rip-off. But at £39.50 per night including the excellent English breakfast, I would unhesitatingly go there again.	
Oct 12 2005	Last minute bargain	Booked last minute, for a central 4 star hotel unnamed, think I got a 3 star side street hotel overlooking the station, but it was clean and comfortable and easy for train and tube connections. The staff were very helpful allowing us to book in early and leave our luggage when booking out. (Travel lodge hotels we have used will not allow this we have had to pay and queue for left luggage at the station before).Our room was long and narrow but nicely decorated, liked the idea of ironing board and iron as standard.The bathroom was small but adequate, the shower hot but the bath towels were tiny - large hand towels size only. Suggest you take your own!	
Oct 6 2005	Needs a review or space for improvement	A bargain if booked online through the usual late booking websites - a four star hotel in WC1 that will give you change from £75 a night at the time of writing. However, it's no place for the leisure visitor; the cleaning staff start work at 8am, shouting along the corridors, so a lie-in is unlikely. The room I was in was pleasant and a reasonable size for central London, but somewhat outdated in decor, an impression that spread to the public areas, so the place is probably due an overhaul. Local facilities are also sparse, with the (excellent) curry houses on Drummond Street and Euston railway station the only options very close by, and the hotel itself on a street behind the railway station that I would think twice about walking down alone late at night. So while I felt my stay represented good value, it didn't justify a four star rating by any criteria, although it's nothing that a bit of thought over the requirements of the balance sheet couldn't fix.	
Oct 5 2005 	Ask for an Upgrade	I booked this hotel through an internet company where you didn't find out until after that it was the thistle. All I knew was that it was in Euston but that it was 4 star I paid £75. Once I found out I went on trip advisor to look at reviews and panic set in so i was expecting the worst and moaned to my partner. He rang up to tell them I was traveling on my own and could he pay to upgrade me. They upgraded me for free into an amazing room 260 I think which was massive and an executive room. Had dinner in the restaurant the food was very tasty and well presented but the restaurant decor is quite something (you really have to see it to believe how awful). The staff were all foreign and seemed most to be in training but very friendly and helpful, one kept giving me breadrolls even when I was on my desert bless. I didn't have breakfast and went and grabbed something at Euston after reading someone elses comment. So all in all prob spent under £90.	
Oct 3 2005 	A standard businessman's hotel	As a fairly regular visitor to the Thisle Euston, but a recent convert to the information of TripAdvisor, this review covers many visits to the hotel over the last couple of years.The hotel is fairly standard among those that cater for the travelling business-person who simply needs a bed for the night inbetween meetings or travel.The rooms are generally a little on the small side but perfectly serviceable and clean, the hotel is arranged in a square around a service area, if you get a room overlooking the service area then you may get some noise from the air conditioning plant. Generally the rooms do not have air conditionning, but more on that down below. This sometimes means that in summer the room is like a sauna, but if you open the window can't sleep due to the plant noise.The restaurant is nothing to write home about but is good value (£14.99 for two courses) and is open late until 10:30 ideal if you have arrived late. The breakfast is always good with a selection of cerials, toast, pastries, meats, cheeses and fruits as well as the standard cooked fayre.My major grumble came a couple of months ago when I turned up at the hotel fairly late after stumbling off a train from 'oop north to be told that they were overbooked and I'd been transferred to the Thistle Barbican. I cannot fault the attitude of the staff, I was offered a drink in the bar while they called a taxi and was told that the Barbican was expecting me with an upgraded room.Following this episode, I wrote to the Thistle complaining and was promised an &quot;executive room&quot; on my next visit. This opportunity came last week and a got an opportunity to see how the other half live... The room was 2/3 times larger than a standard room with a king size bed and a living area with 2 chairs and a sofa bed, there was air conditioning (finally got to see what all of that noisy plant feeds) and the room overlooked the quiet park to the side of the hotel. Apart from that everything was the same, but the difference that the air con made was amazing.I only ever use this hotel for overnight stays and it is perfectly adequate, however I'm not sure how my views would change if I had to stay here for much longer.	
Sep 22 2005 	I wouldn't stay here again !	Stayed here for 4 nights and wished I'd gone elsewhere !The check-in staff spoke poor English which drew the whole process out.The decor in the public areas is OK, but as soon as you get away to the bedroom sections it was a different story. Very tired and tatty indeed.The bedroom was fairly pokey, although this is not uncommon in London hotels. The bed had clearly seen better days (many years ago) - how difficult is it for a hotel to offer its guests a decent nights sleep ?I never bothered with breakfast - there were queues like you wouldn't believe each morning.Check on Friday morning out was blighted by there only being 2 staff on duty and lonnnnng queues.4 stars ? Certainly not ! Spend your money elsewhere...	
Jul 25 2005	Old room Noisy maids - More 2-3* experience for us!	I suppose for the under ninety pound Internet price we paid for the room we can't complain too much. The hotel is in a transport-covenient and relatively quiet part of the north side of central London. We've done a fair few Internet bookings now however and expect a 4* room to at least be newly decorated. I think we were unlucky in that we got a ground floor room in an old, rear part of the hotel. This is nothing like the clean modern front and reception everyone else seems to have experienced! In this case we thought &quot;c'mon they could at least have updated the decor since the 70's!&quot;. Although everything was clean, the bathroom was poorly tiled and the shower is a museum piece (it felt like some dodgy poor motel) and the furniture and decor seems like it hasn't been changed since Abba hit the charts, including the matress and the wallpaper and fittings.We would have appreciated it if there had been some value in maintaining this 'timeless' decor but I'm afraid we failed to see it. Also the room maids couldn't stop shouting down the corridor at each other in the morning - aren't guests entitled to some peace and quiet too?!!The Ibis next door looks far more modern from the outside - better luck next time eh!	
Jun 6 2005	Great for price!!	Not a luxurious hotel, but a very good price and good neighborhood. You don't have to be worried about the location here. Not very close to sights (aside from the British Museum), but the transportation is great - so it's a non-issue.	
May 22 2005	Marred by bad service	I booked the Thistle Euston based on some good previous reviews and a good last minute price. I was hoping that this 4 star hotel would live up to its reputation, but unfortunately all I encountered was problems. For a start, we waited about 15 minutes to actually check in as there was only one person working reception in the middle of the day. Two other staff waited around doing nothing. We had booked a double room, only to find when we got there, they had just pushed two single beds together. Not to be daunted, we decided to make the best of it, but there were just more problems.The bathroom had two towels and no face cloths. For a supposed 4 star hotel, I don't know how they managed it. Their guest services directory boasted that fresh milk was available free of charge, but when I ordered some all that the housekeeping staff brought was the horrible UHT stuff. She seemed to have no knowledge that fresh milk was even available. Even upon check out, the service was less than pleasant. When I asked for a receipt of my stay, the man at reception stated he wouldn't print one out and that because I'd booked through an agent, I'd need to get in contact with them. When I pointed out that even though I had booked through an agent, there was no way of them knowing that I had actually stayed in the hotel, he just shrugged his shoulders and said he couldn't help.The rooms were clean and pleasant and the location was excellent, but I would never stay at this hotel again because of the service.	
May 20 2005	4 Stars? No way!	We were &quot;upgraded&quot; to the Thistle Euston after booking for the more modest 3-star Bloomsbury Park as part of a midweek theatre break. I really wish I had said no!We lost an hour of our trip getting checked in -- the front of house computers should have been skipped years ago, probably 486s -- and crashed several times trying to book us in.The first &quot;superior&quot; room we were given was so small you could only get one person at either side of the double bed, and you could sit on the toilet and brush your teeth at the same time!We complained and were given a bigger room, though still only average sized. The bathroom smelled strongly of bleach -- I daren't ask them why -- and the shower head sprayed water around the room rather than at you. The restaurant was also disappointing - the breakfast food was of high quality and hot, but you didn't get a spoon to stir your coffee with, or a plate to put your toast on. The butter was also congealed and unappetising.However in the hotel's favour the staff were very good, the front of house manager dealing with our complaints swiftly and fairly, so well done to them for that.Unfortunately London still has problems with hotel standards that compare unfavourably with other major cities I have stayed in (eg New York and Sydney) which is sad to admit as a Brit.If you can spare a little extra I would recommend the Thistle London Bridge which has lovely views, is more conveniently placed and is better maintained. For the same price you could stay at the Hilton Islington which is still well placed and is clean and modern.If you do decide the book the Euston then I hope you have a better time than us, and enjoy the beautiful city.	
Apr 30 2005	Good value at Euston	Hotel is conveniently located next to Euston Station (BritRail) and Euston Underground. Rooms and public areas have a gleaming new look; very polished looking and restful. Rooms are immaculate, clean, sparkling bathroom with black granite counters, white tiles, towel warmer, etc. Some rooms overlook a small but beautiful park. Area felt safe to walk all hours. Euston tube a few stops from Leicester Square and Covent Garden. Close to British Library and internet cafes. Continental breakfast was ok - no yogurt or cheese as promised, but lots of cereal, juice, rolls, jellies and canned fruit. English breakfast looked ok but did not purchase this.	
Apr 29 2005	Definitely stay here again.	Would definitely stay here again. The hotel was situated just a 15 minute walk from Kings Cross Railway Station, we managed the walk quite easily with our suitecases. Adjacent to the hotel is an entrance to Euston Railway station and adjoining underground, it couln't be handier. The hotel itself is at the end of a very quiet street, though only minutes from bars and restaurants. It has recently undergone refurbishment in a contemporary style. The rooms are modern, comfortable, and have all the amenities expected such as cable tv, tea &amp; coffee making facilities, bathroom toiletries, a trouser press and internet access. Breakfast was very good, food top class, and plenty of it, only drawback was the queue into the restaurant, everyone seemed to want to eat at the same time, but worth it when you did manage to get a table, which is alocated to you when you reach the front of the queue. We had a glass of wine on the first night in the hotel bar, very expensive six pounds a glass, though they were large, so we didn't bother drinking there after that. The reception staff were extremely pleasant and helpful when we arrived, and they offered us the use of luggage storage on the day we checked out. Though we used the underground station during the evening, it is a lovely walk from the hotel into central London passing several small parks on the way.	
Apr 28 2005	Excellent location	Stayed here as part of a Northwest Airlines package. the hotel has a great location, near several Underground lines. The British museum is within walking distance. The staff was friendly and helpful. The included continental breakfast was adequate although they did not have any rolls or bagels one day. The room was large enough and very clean, the water pressure in the shower was great. I would definetely stay here again.	
Apr 26 2005 	Mediocre not great area not great staff	I stayed here on business last year as it was close to Northern Line.I was shocked by the size of the room so asked if they had anything else. I had a look at three further rooms and they were the same so I stayed with the cupboard I had been assigned.I went for a walk in the evening (early spring so dark early), but didn't venture far as there were a lot of people hanging around the streets, and broken glass in the car spaces along the road (never a good sign). I wouldn't recommend you venture outside alone at night.Hotel is handy for Tottenham Court Road so there is a variety of restaurants to get you out of the hotel one!Would recommend hotel if you get a good deal, otherwise, try somewhere else	
Apr 18 2005	Great Place---Great Value	We stayed here on our trip to London for 5 nights. It's a great place because it's just down the road from the train station. Rooms were clean and comfy and average size. The bathrooms were really nice with great water pressure. This was a great value for a London hotel. Since it was close to Euston station (which is on one of the bigger tube lines) it was a good location. We never heard the train at night. It's kind of in a business area so at night it's pretty much dead. I'm sure a hotel this nice would have been MUCH higher had it been in another part of London. The buffet style breakfast was really tasty with fresh fruit, cereal and traditional English food. There's a nice bar downstairs, a small giftshop with cheap phone cards and other tourist items (yes, they were cheaper than on main streets in London). Also, there were elevators which is somewhat rare for London. All in all it's great for anyone not wanting to have to spend an obscene amout of money for a nice, clean room.	
Apr 7 2005	Loved this hotel!	My husband and I visited the Thistle Euston on our first trip to London. Although the room was small it was lovely, nicely appointed, and looked out on a little park. Hotel staff were very helpful; housekeeping was adequate, although we could have done with more towels. The food in the hotel was excellent. We were on an American Airlines package trip and at first scoffed at the idea of eating in the hotel to take advantage of the &quot;two for one&quot;before 7 p.m. What a mistake in judgement. The cuisine was excellent, service outstanding. As a matter of fact, we enjoyed eating there more then we did at other restaurants, and not just because of the price break! The only complaint we had was our mattress. It was something out of the Tower of London torture chamber. After two nights, we did complain to the desk and they immediately offered to change it. The new one wasn't much better, but the staff response was excellent. The hotel location is so convenient. All in all, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in a very nice hotel with great service and food at a reasonable price. We loved it. When we return to London next year, we are staying there again.	
Mar 24 2005	Good value clean and comfortable	My husband and I just returned from a six night stay (March 2005) at the Thistle Euston and found it to be a good, clean hotel with friendly staff. The rooms were small, but adequate and it was a quiet location. We chose the Thistle because it was near where my daughter was studying at Regent's College; It was also well situated for the train and subway stations. Just a word of caution: I booked our stay through Expedia and breakfast was not included in the price. While others here have raved about it -- we ate at the hotel only once. At 15 pounds for a continental breakfast for two (that's juice, coffee, toast and cereal for $30 U.S.) it wasn't a good value. There are many other less expensive options in the area, including nearby Puccino's cafe, which was fun. Overall, I would rate the Thistle Euston as an excellent 3+star hotel. If you are looking for reasonably priced, clean, and conveniently located accommodations, this hotel fits the bill.	
Mar 23 2005	Bad experience	Stayed at the Euston Thistle as part of a group of 10 on a business trip. The rooms were very small. Had to walk side step to pass the front of the bed as it was pratically touching the wall. No sound proofing so slept in and missed breakfast! Although this was a blessing in disguise. Everyone who ate breakfast fell ill that day - 8 people of the 10. Meeting was cancelled. Would avoid like the plague.	
Mar 21 2005	so close to euston station	There were 5 in our group, and we had 2 rooms.We stayed for 3 nights, rooms lovely and clean, there was 3 in our room and we all had plenty of space. Dining room for dinner was slow and my salmon was undercooked, but staff were very apologetic,and offered free drinks because of this. Very long queues for breakfast, but breakfast was enjoyable and we always had plenty, to keep you going till lunch. Staff were very helpful and by the end of our stay we had shown the bar staff how to make hot whiskeys the irish way! we would go back again and it was first visit to london for my uncle who is 80 and he really enjoyed it&lt;and so did my mom.	
Mar 7 2005	Not a bad deal	I decided to stay here as part of an air-flight package through American Airlines. I clearly wasn't the only one to think the advertised rate was a good deal as check-in turned out to be quite a crowded affair with many folks from the same flight arriving at roughly the same time. I noted similar conjestion on other mornings. The hotel is not in the most picturesque locale but it it is very close to Euston station which makes it a prime location for both business travelers and tourists. The downstairs restaurant can fill up quickly at breakfast and my party had to wait for a table both mornings we ventured in. The rooms were standard - nothing fancy but clean with basic amenities. I wouldn't pay full rate here but it would certainly be a good option if you can find a discount.	
Feb 26 2005 	Good for a business traveller	I got the room through lastminute for £93 a night for a standard double room (instead of the hotel charge on £180). I travel for business quite often, and the room I got was of good quality for a business traveller (e.g. contains bathroom with a bath), but there was no view (the view gives on other rooms). I found the broadband charges quite expensive (£0.50 by minute with a maximum charge of £15 for 24 hours).The location of the hotel is excellent, only few minutes walk from Euston station and underground.	
Jan 20 2005	Great location	Stayed for a few nights in December. Hotel is in a fantastic location for buses, subway and cheap food. The hotel room was well-fitted out and bigger than what I thought a London hotel room would be. Tea, coffee and hot chocolate facilities were provided in the room. Staff were great and there is a small gift shop in the lobby. Definitely would stay there again.Julie, Australia	
Jan 7 2005	BLAAAHHHH	Going to keep this short. London is awesome, this hotel is not! Got there on te 31st, New Years Eve, and found there were no double rooms available and were placed into two single rooms instead. After I phoned American Airlines Vacations and told them to fix the problem my room was upgraded for the rest of the trip but alas, no heat in that upgrade. No heat in January in London is not good. The room was big and te bathroom was also good but still doesnt matter if the room is freezing. After three days of complaints finally got a space heater. Concierge was awful and the room service was inconsistent at best. Will never stay there again. I would rather skip a vaction next year and save my money so that I can stay at the Ritz. Simply not worth my money. Again - London is awesome, the Thistle Euston is not.	
Dec 13 2004	Thieves	Staff attempted to double charge me for my Executive suite room, and only after I told them to go ahead and do that, I would simply adjust from back home (USA) did they realilze they were not going to be aboe to cheat me and stopped the scam. The rooms are very noisy, w/o beneifit of soundproofing between rooms, and the hotel staff are generally rude. My room was one of the 36 executives, so one would expect that for a room with a 221 pound rate, the service would be at least good. The free buffet is worth exactly what it coste. AVOID THIS ENTIRE CHAIN.	
Nov 30 2004	5 Star Treatment	This is a great 3 star hotel. You get the 5 star treatment from everyone - starting at check-in. Although our preferred room was not available the first night we were made comfortable in a substitute room. The next day while we were out sightseeing our luggage was transferred to our requested room. No hassle! The rooms are very clean, the breakfast was great and the best part is the convenience to Euston station and the tube. We have stayed at the Thistle Euston before on three occassions and would definately recommend it to everyone.	
Nov 13 2004	Nice place good location	Me and 2 of my friends stayed at the Thistle Euston in October. It was a nice hotel, they had a bar, free breakfast in the am, and the room service was excellent. Nice location, being right by Euston Station. We walked all the way to Big Ben and the Palace in no time, slowly shopping along the way. One thing, if you have 3 people, get a second room, we were pretty squished with three. All in all, a decent place to stay.	
Oct 20 2004	Evaluation of the Thistle Euston London ENgland	We were there Oct 7-13 2004.The rooms were very nice, well appointed and spotlessly clean. The hotel staff was very helpful in giving directions and getting tours.The location is not the best as it is out of the way except for the British Museum. There are few resaurants in the immediate area except for ones serving Indian food. It is close to good transportation so getting around was not difficult.We found the included breakfast both continental and full english, poor.	
Oct 16 2004	Very Good place to stay for the price	Clean, a huge full breakfast included in the price, and internet available in the lobby were the highlights. For the price, this is a very good place to stay in London compared to other places I've stayed in the past. Nice staff and near the Euston terminal so it is very convenient. The bed wasn't the greatest and the room was pretty small, but we didn't spend much time in the room. We had a nice view of a park near the hotel. I recommend it as a start if you've never been to London before and you're on a budget. If it's not to your liking you can always look around for more expensive places. Also, try the excellent vegetarian Indian restaurant nearby (I forgot the name, but it's excellent!)	
Sep 27 2004	Fine - no complaints	When we arrived here it was too early to check in, but they locked our luggage away no problem to enable us to come back later. It's only a 2 minute walk to the underground or buses at Euston Station, which is very convenient. Our room was small but perfectly adequate and spotlessly cleaned every day. Breakfast was very busy but there was always a seat, and a good choice of continental and English food.We didn't try the restaurant in the evening. The only thing against this hotel (and it's not much of a problem really) is that they take large foreign tour groups, and if you arrive at the wrong moment you can wait hours at reception!All in all, a good hotel in a fairly convenient location (public transport no problem). For what it cost, I would definitely go back.	
Aug 4 2004	Solid Hotel	This is a pleasant hotel in an excellent location. The room was small but clean and adequate. The staff was competent. There was a choice of cold or (for an additional charge) hot breakfast. Although the breakfast room was crowded, we were always seated promptly and never felt rushed. The location about two blocks from Euston station provides easy access to several tube and rail lines at three stations (Euston, Euston Square, and King's Cross) and multiple bus routes. Taxi cabs were always available, although we never used one. One can easily walk to Bloomsbury. It is but a short bus ride to the restaurants on Upper Street.	
Jul 23 2004	You deserve more.	The Thistle Euston is at best below average and is in a less than desirable location, particularly in the evening. Worst of all, the staff and management could not care less about their guest. Nothing in my room worked and the manager simply dismissed me. Furthermore, a later written compaint was not addressed. I will never stay there again, nor will I ever stay at any other Thistle hotel in the future.	
Jul 13 2004	Decidedly average with very poor room service	Positives: close to Euston station and underground;clean rooms; good breakfast selection (included in the price).Negatives: very poor room service timekeeping; room service meals were of very poor quality; reception was undermanned and it took a long time to be assisted; the bar was very small.	
Jun 29 2004	The Thistle Hotel at Euston London	Avoid this hotel like the plague. Poorly trained staff - asked for a quiet room and got a noisy one in an area being refurbished. If you want basic service this is the hotel for you. If you really do need to stay in this area and are travelling on a tight budget you might be better booking in at the IBIS which is close by.....	
Jun 20 2004	Great Value	Very good hotel for the money.Not very fancy or in the center of town,but still, very close to the subway makes it convenient. Very clean, big rooms for Europe/UK, good free breakfast, friendly service. I am on the road for business a lot and if your looking for a good inexpensive business hotel or have a family on a budget, this is a great deal.	
May 27 2004	Decent hotel	The negatives: The rooms were kind of small and the location wasn't great.The positives: Close to Euston subway station. Efficient maid service.It was nothing spectacular but o.k. We stayed here for 7 nights.	
May 1 2004	Great hotel - very clean	We stayed for 7 nights and were very pleased with everything. The room, while smaller than US hotel rooms had everything necessary for a comfortable visit. The bed was firm and the bedding was fluffy. The shower was better than the one we have at home, and there was plenty of hot water. The room was thoroughly cleaned and kept that way for the whole visit. We are picky about cleanliness, and had no complaints at all - it met our standards! The continental breakfast was just fine giving us a good start for our daily plans. The location, next to Euston Station was very easy for Tube and bus access. We would stay there again. We read reviews of many hotels and this one had the most positive ratings.	
Apr 7 2004	London Stay at Thistle Euston	The service was what you would expect for a three star hotel. Would stay closer to the center of town next time as we did before.	
Apr 1 2004	Had a great experience at the Thistle Euston	My husband and I stayed at the Thistle Euston for six nights, between March 23 and 29, 2004. This hotel was booked through an American Airlines travel package and after reading reviews on this site and others, we decided to schedule our trip. This was our first trip to London and we thouroughly enjoyed our stay. The Thistle Euston staff was very helpful and the rooms were above average for European standards. The beds were comfortable and rooms were quiet. We did not take advantage of the 2-for-1 offer at the Faya Restaurant, although it was available on a limited menu. This hotel was conveniently located to the Euston Station, where you could access the Northern Tube line and Bus Services (including the National Express to Heathrow Airport). In addition, the Euston Square was several blocks away, with easy access to the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, as well as the Metropolitan Tube lines. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any family and/or friends.	
Mar 27 2004	A fine hotel at a reasonable price	Room was small by American standards but very clean and attractive. Continental breakfast was outstanding - the coffee was especially great. An easy 2-3 block walk to Euston Station. We had a wonderful 6 night stay!
