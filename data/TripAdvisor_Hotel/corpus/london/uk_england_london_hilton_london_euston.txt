Nov 11 2009 	Ideal for Bloomsbury area	Having stayed in Hilton Hotels before we looked for one that was convenient for Euston (5 minute walk) and the British Museum (10 minute walk). The twin bedded room and bathroom were both a good size and the beds were extremely comfortable. We had an internal room overlooking the Fitness Centre and consequently there was no external noise at all.The Restaurant is in a conservatory and is attractively set out. The Table d'Hote was excellent and the chef should be congratulated on his innovative use of the food. Two minor comments: on the second night we were placed by a door at the far end of the restaurant and there was a draught - avoid that table! Secondly, after a good meal the coffee my husband requested was a bit of a surprise. He expected a small cup to finish off the meal - instead was served with a Costa coffee in very large, and heavy cup, - not at all the way to serve an after dinner coffee especially as he only drank about a quarter of the cup and the price was also high. He didn't bother to order one the second night but made one in our room.The breakfasts were - as always - of the standard you expect from the 'Hilton Breakfast'. Plenty of choice both hot and cold to set you up for the day (no porridge here though which was a pity on a cold morning). The service was very good and tables were cleared efficiently and quickly.All the staff were professional and pleasant and provided the quality of service that we have come to expect from the Hilton hotels. We will certainly return.	
Nov 2 2009 	Great location and everything you'd expect from a Hilton	The Hilton London Euston is conveniently located across the road from Euston station and maybe 5 minutes from St. Pancras station, making travel by tube or train extremely convenient to just about anywhere. It's also quite near enough to walk to SoHo for shopping and very good restaurants (especially Salt Yard).The staff and service was absolutely top notch; particularly the concierge who arranged a private car service for us to London City airport for only £35 the morning of our departure. Pure genius. Cheaper than other cab services and much much easier than hauling luggage on the tube.We booked a king room (for £125/night; quite reasonable for a Hilton anywhere) which looked into the atrium in the centre of the building. Initially I'd thought I'd rather have been facing the road, but the location made for an extremely restful stay as virtually no noise penetrated the room. I'd definitely book it that way in future. Further, the room was very spacious, very clean and looked to have been fairly recently updated.All in all, an excellent facility and definitely top of the list for the next trip to London.	
Oct 31 2009 	Aussie Family In London	We stayed at the Hilton twice during a broken stay in England (via France) due to its closeness to the Eurostar train. It's literally a five minute walk and very easy, even with bags.  We arrived at the hotel early, and left our bags with the concierge Jun, who we ended up forming a friendship with by the end of our trip. I stayed in a triple room with my two brothers. Although the room was not massive I never felt as though they were in my face.  I slept on the pullout bed, for the first stay it was just like a normal bed, however on the second stay it was much less, however within 5 minutes of making reception aware of this they had a replacement bed set up.  The fitness centre and business centre were of great use during our stay and the breakfast each morning was fantastic, a great way to start the day. The Hilton was also very close to Euston and Euston square tube stations which were def the best way to tour England. It was also less than 10 mins walk to the start of the London Bus tour route, which was fantastic. I also enjoyed its closeness to Lords, Stamford Bridge and all of London's main attractions. Staff wise, Neville and Jun were especially friendly and very helpful. The bar is also great, and although a little pricey, standard hotel prices and extremely convinient.  The best feature of this hotel is its closeness to some of the best bars in London. Im a huge football fan and loved watchin the EPL games on the big screen across the road before watchin match of the day in the hotel bar. Everything is a short walk or short tube trip Overall, really enjoyed the stay. Wasnt perfect but off hand cannot think of anything to sour my view on the hotel, the staff or the location. Thanks guys, look forward to seeing you next time I make the long trip to England	
Oct 27 2009 	Small room with a bit of noise	The location is pretty good, a short walk from Euston Station so there is easy access to the tube. No problems with checkin or checkout, or with any other staff members I encountered. The single room was small, but it was sufficient for one person. The size was an issue in the shower, which barely had enough room to move around, and it lacked a tray to place the soap.Noise was the biggest issue here. What sounded like delivery truck noise from outside came pretty early, and there were sirens throughout the night. As an older hotel, the window didn't do much to block out the noise.Breakfast was not included in my rate, and I didn't check to see how much they would have charged. Instead, I walked over to Euston station and got something from one of the many places there. Internet access looked pricy; I didn't pay for it.	
Oct 16 2009 	Terrible booking system	I booked this hotel via the website www.booking.com, choosing the rate that stated that it will be payable during my stay at the hotel. However, few days later I was contacted by the hotel and asked to pay in advance. I refused and told them that my booking confirmation states that I will pay during my stay. I was told that the hotel has a different policy that I should have checked on their hotel website (while booking it via www.booking.com!!?) I am not sure whether this is a confusion caused by the Hilton hotel or by the booking.com company. But I found this very unprofessional, cancelled my booking and will stay elsewhere.	
Oct 15 2009	Clean but very small room	I read most of the reviews prior to booking this hotel so I was not entirely unprepared for my stay here. The room was small as expected but it just meant that my son and I had to be extra neat and not leave a clutter about with unworn clothing, etc. The beds were very narrow, I felt as if I were sleeping on a canoe with a fear of falling off! Check-in was quick and efficient, the entire hotel staff was very pleasent and helpful. One complaint: The first night was very hot, opening the windows did not help much. This issue was resolved once the front desk was notified.	
Oct 14 2009 	Good location for Eurostar - shame about room size!	My Wife and I stayed here as a prelude to our weekend stay in Paris. We chose the hotel because of its proximity to St Pancras Eurostar terminal and because I had some Hilton Honors points. We arrived to a very friendly welcome; check-in was fast and efficient. Room was small and cramped, tiny bed! Definitely had the feel of a single occupancy room. Went back to reception to a request room change. Manager very politely explained hotel was full so not many alternative rooms available. She showed us round 2 similar sized rooms but with different layouts, we opted for one of these. We also told the manager that we were off the next day to stay in the Paris Hilton for our Wedding Anniversary, she very graciously had a complimentary bottle of wine sent up to our room, together with a card signed by, I imagine, the front desk staff - a very nice and much appreciated touch!To sum up - this hotel is OK if you don't intend to spend a lot of time in your room due to its size, great location for Eurostar (5 min walk) and reasonably placed for central London. Staff were very friendly and welcoming and customer service excellent.	
Oct 5 2009 	Good for a first time visit	The Euston Hilton is a good choice for the first visit to London. Out the front door and to the left you will find the tube station a couple of blocks down with friendly ticket staff to help you figure it out. Along the way is an Italian restaurant (Prezzo)-pretty good food and fairly decent prices-by London standards (we ate there twice and enjoyed it both times) To the right of the hotel, just past a small park, is an internet cafe (20 minutes for one pound) and a convenience store to buy the essential beer after a hard day of sight seeing. A little farther is a stop for both hop on/hop off bus companys-a good way to start exploring the city.The hotel staff are very helpful, friendly and efficient. Our room was clean and the bathroom spotless. The room was big enough. We had two single beds, but they were comfortable and we slept well. It also had a pot for making coffee and tea and a fridge. We liked it. The negative--it's an old building and the floor creaks. We could hear every step from the folks above us, as I'm sure those below heard ours. A room full of people staying up late could be a problem.The breakfast buffet was good. Lots of fruit and healthy things for my wife. Sausage, eggs and potatoes for me.We were on a four day package put together by Gate 1. Maybe a little too much crammed in to a short period of time, but all in all, not a bad deal for the price--except for the theatre passport. Not much selection there.	
Sep 21 2009 	Not the best certainly not the worst	Typical of one of the older Hiltons - not a patch on the likes of Hilton London Bridge or Canary Wharf. Room was clean enough, nice friendly service etc. Was upgraded to a decent sized room but it overlooked the internal gym so there was a bit of noise from there in terms of clanking of gym equipment and music etc. Thankfully this stopped reasonable early	
Sep 19 2009 	Great Location	Stayed here for four nights from 4/9. Good location for tube. Russell Square on the Picadilly Line direct from Heathrow is approx 10 minutes walk. Euston is only 5 minutes walk. St Pancras for the Eurostar is approx 10 minutes. Room was small but we were only there to sleep. Staff were very helpful. Our room was on second floor right opposite lift &amp; overlooking the road. Didn't hear any noise inside or out, except for a police siren once.The only downside was my room rate apprently included breakfast but that was not mentioned on the booking confirmation nor mentioned by the check in staff. Only found out on last morning when i opened the express checkout envelope put under the door. Would have saved eating at the dodgy cafe at Euston.Would definitely stay here again.	
Sep 18 2009 	Good experience/Family-King Hilton Deluxe room	Stayed at Hilton Euston for approximately 2 weeks in September. Took a Hilton King deluxe with breakfast and dinner included. Overall a good experience. The kids were 10 and 11 and we had a king bed and a sofa bed. The king bed was big enough to sleep 3 or 4. The room size was adequate and the service was good. Breakfast was good and quite filling. Dinner was good. There is a gym which is open to the residents and we used it almost daily.For moving around we took an Oyster card and did top ups when the credit came below five pounds. This card can be used on the underground/buses. Children below 10 need no ticket. Children 11 and above need a daily 2 pounds ticket for the underground.There is an option for good wireless internet service which came to about 30 pounds for 2 weeks. Other option is about 15 pounds/day for the wired internet. We took the wireless internet and was quite happy with its speed.	
Sep 5 2009 	Nice hotel at a reasonable price	My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Euston for 3 nights in August, and the experience was a good one. We got a great rate during their January sale so it was worth every penny. My only complaint is that the internet was unreasonably expensive (15 pounds a day). The mattress was also a little harder than I like it, but it wasn't uncomfortable either. The staff was super friendly and helpful so that was definitely a plus!I was a little worried about the size of the room reading previous reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. While the room wasn't huge, it was just perfect for my husband and I. Plus, the bathroom was lovely! Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel.	
Sep 1 2009 	Choose location of room carefully!	The Euston Hilton is a fairly basic hilton in a good location at generally reasonable prices. However, depending on where you room is located you will fail to get any sleep! Rooms lack sound proofing and if you are on the side of the road you will hear not only a lot of traffic but the clock of St Pancreas going off all night. So be warned, if you want to actually sleep ask the staff to locate you away from the street.	
Aug 30 2009 	Expensive internet and stairs at the entrance.	Many hotels provide free wireless internet - not the Hilton. It is time the Hilton moved into the 21st century. The room, the restaurant, the food and service were Hilton quality - very good. It is unfortunate that there are stairs to the entrance and my room was up internal stairs. You do not expect to drag heavy luggage up stairs. Excellent access to Euston station and the underground.	
Aug 24 2009 	EXCELLENT HOTEL	Stayed at Hilton Euston Hotel with my family in August for 3 days and had a very goodtime. It is a well situated hotel few minutes from the centre. Very clean and has a great breakfast. The staff very helpful. I would stay at Hilton Euston Hotel anytime.	
Aug 16 2009 	Brilliant location and very friendly and helpful staff	We stayed in the family deluxe room and it was quite spacious and very clean. The location of the hotel was fantastic, very close to Russel Square underground for 'Picadilly line' and just down the road from 'Euston'. We stayed bed/breakfast and evening meal, the food was very nice. The evening meals were particularly good and the atmosphere of the restaurant was lovely. ALL of the staff were very friendly and helpful and even when we left they were more than happy to keep our bags locked away for the day whilst we spent our final day around the fantastic city of London. I will definitely stay at the hotel again.	
Aug 16 2009 	This is not Hilton	This cannot be a Hilton hotel. Instead, it's a bleak looking older style building for lodgers. It simply looks like Hilton have purchased a derolict building, slapped on a few signs branding it as Hilton and hired incompetent non-English speaking staff.This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, without a doubt. Firstly, despite the freezing rain and taxi dropping me on the other side of the road, no one was available to help me pull my suitace up the stairs to the hotel. There is no ramp. There was no one to open the door, I had to enlist the help of a stranger whilst I struggled with two bags. The Reception was staffed by two bored clerks who looked like they wanted to be elsewhere.But the biggest shock came when I arrived at my room. I am convinced this used to be a store room. You literally walked in, sat on the bed ... and that's about all. It was a tiny hole in the wall. The bed was pushed up against the wall. The closet just managed to fit my winter coat and nothing else. I constantly bumped my suitcase when I got off the bed to walk to the bathroom. The 1970s yellow hairdryer on the wall has me further convinced this is not a Hilton Hotel. My room happened to be further away from the lifts but silence did not prevail as a result of extremely squeky floor boards outside my room and the one-inch gap below my door.This hotel really sucks - I cannot describe it any other way. Hilton should be ashamed to associate its name with a property like this. Rubbish.The one good thing about this place is its proximity to a range of tube stations .. that's it.	
Aug 15 2009 	What a disapointment	My wife and I had just completed a transatlantic flight and found our way to the Hotel which was not easy as the Hilton sign was not clearly visible. Our driver helped us get the bags out of the car and my wife took the smallest up the steps and I followed with two bigger bags. The Concierge was sitting at his desk just watching us trying to get through the doors. He did not move one muscle to assist. After check in, the check in clerk instructed him to assist with the bags which he did begrudgingly! The bartender served my wife a red wine which was hot, not room temperature as it had been sitting next to some mechanical equipment. When she asked for a cooler one he told her that red wine should be warm. He eventually gave her an ice cube to cool the wine down.The bedroom was small and left little room to get in on one side of the bed. The bathroom contained an old bath tub, the likes of which I have not seen since I was a small child living in England a number of years ago. It would be very difficult for anyone with even a minor disability to safely get in or out of the bath for either a bath or shower.I found the Hotel overpriced in all respects, room, bar and dining room! My wife did enjoy her curry which was about the only good part of our stay at the Hilton, Euston. We would not stay there again!!	
Aug 9 2009 	Disappointing	I have stayed about five times at the Hilton Euston and probably won't stay there again. The hotel is very close to Euston and St Pancras train stations and the building is quite attractive. However, the hotel does not offer value for money as most of the rooms are tiny and the service tends to be poor.Despite the potential of being a great hotel the rooms are quite disappointing at the lower price range. The single rooms are tiny and most people could stretch out their arms and touch opposite walls. Also the rooms without opening windows tend to be very hot and are uncomfortable to sleep in. When I booked at this hotel I would always contact them to request a room with an outside window that opened. Invariably this request would be ignored and I would be allocated an inner room. One night I had enough and sat in the reception for about an hour until 2am until they found me an alternate room. I complained but did not receive a response.The breakfast is good and offers a wide variety of food and drink, the staff are efficient but not what I would call friendly. Overall a good location but poor value for money.	
Aug 2 2009 	Comfortable hotel in a great location	Our room was quite big enough for three people, clean and well-appointed. The bathroom was large and modern. Breakfast was substantial and easily met our needs. My two teenagers and I particularly appreciated the great suggestions from the very helpful concierge for restaurants and the local markets that the kids enjoyed. The location was great - the Euston tube stop was a block away, St Pancras was a 10 minute walk to catch the Eurostar, but best of all was that this is a great walking area in Bloomsbury. We walked to galleries, the British Museum, Regents Park, and to the abundance of nearby restaurants.I would stay here again!	
Jul 28 2009 	Excellent hotel! We'll stay again!	We were delighted with this hotel and its terrific location. We stayed over a week for our son's wedding, and picked this location close to him and found its proximity to train stations, the British Museum and British Library, and tube access an excellent choice. It was so easy to hop on the bus right in front of the hotel, or walk just a few short blocks to catch trains. Getting around London and to day trips was very easy.The room was nicely appointed, very large, and had a large, nice bath, including a tub. Maid service was outstanding, and our room was always done up beautifully. The room was quiet, clean, and darkened well for extended sleep while we adjusted to the time changes from California.The staff was extremely helpful and always available. The concierge desk had excellent advice, especially from Yun, who always had helpful tips and expert ideas. A truly friendly place to stay!The restaurant had very good food and good pricing, although they change the menu only once a week. The choices are adequate, but lunch and dinner tend to be generally the same idea. Service at the restaurant was not as good as it could be, although it was friendly. A great place for a couple of meals, though.The breakfast included in our &quot;bed and breakfast&quot; choice plan was outstanding, with so many delicious choices we couldn't possibly eat them all. Breakfast was served in a special location for hotel guests, tucked away downstairs from the restaurant. The food was excellent. This was the full British breakfast buffet-style, with all the trimmings, and well worth the extra price for the room package. Hot cereal was provided quickly and with a smile when we asked for it, since it wasn't on the buffet line. Unlike some breakfasts we'd had in the past, there is ample time to enjoy this breakfast with several hours of open time.As for other ammenities: The computer terminals &quot;weren't working&quot; when we were there so we couldn't check the internet on their computers, but since this was a wedding trip it was not a problem. Had it been business, there were computer connections within our room. We didn't use the gym or go to the hotel bar, but both looked great.Overall, we would stay here again and recommend it to anyone.	
Jul 22 2009 	Room was the tiniest i'd even been in	Booked on the Hilton website Dinner B&amp;B package as we where going to a concert nearby in Camden. Main areas of hotel nice as one would expect of a Hilton. Reception friendly and functional. Room was ridiculous even for London standards- TINY!! A double bed pushed up against a wall, so i had to climb over my partner to get out...i have never been in such a tiny hotel room before. NOT what I expected from a Hilton. Only stayed one night so we coped. Didn't help that the air con was useless so the room was boiling and it was December...would not stay here again. Restaurant was from a set menu, a little boring considering you have London on your doorstep.	
Jul 21 2009	London Euston Hilton...watch the drink surcharge	Stayed here one night Sun June 28th 2009..Room was possibly not as good as some other Hiltons and evening meal was not buffet as the norm but a set meal.It was so so .Better with the buffet. One thing that did surprise me was the 10% stick on for drinks.I have been in other Hiltons and never charged this .10 % is quite a bit on their prices which are already high.This might be akin to London Hotels as I am not familiar with them in recent times but I felt this was an imposition. Breakfast was of the high standard of Hilton hotels but for me the Hilton in Glasgow knocks spots off this place.	
Jul 19 2009 	Did not let me down as I was not expecting much	So a company night out booked on a Friday in London and I was told to get a room at the Hilton Euston as three co workers were staying there and we could &quot;bond&quot;?Anyway, online booking system gave me one price that suddenly changed by the time I went to pay for it which (not thinking this could happen) I paid for without noticing. Much angry calling and Hilton res staff accusing me of being mistaken and not understanding how the internet worked followed until I sent them a screen shot of the summary page confirming I was correct and they then honoured my room rate. Well done HiltonArrived at the hotel at around six to find a room was ready but none of my room requests could be met on this occassion. Room itself was the usual Hilton chain box but also about standard for central London.Internet did not work and complimentary water was not in the room (35 mins from call for it to turn up) Rest of the room was fine and fairly well soundproofed but the road outside not that busy late in the evening.Hotel is very well placed for Euston station with its trains to Manchester etc, Kings X with trains to Newcastle, Edinburgh etc and St Pancrass for the new Eurostar terminal and not to mention good tube connections also at all three stations.Staff at reception were pleasant enough and cannot comment on breakfast as did not bother, they do not tend to be that good at this type of Hilton but you never know. (Steady though the price of a poached egg may go up after you order it!	
Jul 17 2009 	Very nice stay	Attractive hotel (older building with updated interior). Nice room with plenty of space between the twin beds. Good location. Helpful Staff. I have nothing to complain about. I would definitely stay there again. Recommend coffee/breakfast in nearby Russell Square - our favorite breakfast place of the trip.	
Jul 13 2009 	Perfect Stay with a Teen	We stayed 5 nights at the Hilton Euston while my husband was on business. We brought our 16 year old daughter along with us. It is not easy to find a room in London that accommodates three. Our room at the Hilton Euston was spacious and very comfortable (we had the comfy king bed and our daughter had the pull out sofa but she didn't complain). Our bathroom was very large by European (or any) standards. There was NO shortage of hot water. Room had lots of storage in very nice, contemporary cabinetry. The room colors were very nice, tasteful. I loved the heavy, black-out curtains. We had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the &quot;courtyard&quot; which is really the roof of the gym. The roof is a heavily frosted glass so there is no problem with people looking up from the gym. The gym, by the way, is one of the best I have ever encountered in a hotel. Lots of equipment (including 2 rowing machines) and very nice &quot;locker rooms.&quot; Our room was surprisingly quiet. There was a fairly rowdy family with young kids across the hall from us. We could hear them when we were in the hallway but as soon as we closed the door to our room we heard nothing. The air conditioning worked terrific. I liked the fact that it ran constantly instead of cycling on and off, providing good low level masking noise. The room lighting is great. Our room had a very large desk, work area with a very comfortable work chair. My husband found this very helpful. TV selection was very limited (not sure if that's just what you get in London). The hotel staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. They made excellent suggestions for restaurants and sights. My husband found the location idea for his business travel--close to Euston Station tube stop and not far from Paddington station. My daughter and I easily walked everywhere. It was about a 20-25 minute walk to Trafalgar Square but lots of fun stuff to see along the way.	
Jul 6 2009 	perfect for wembley staduim	We wanted a hotel in london to stay after a concert at wembley stadium. This was perfect, no tube change, just around the corner from Euston Square. We actually got back to the hotel within 25 mins, considering 80,000 at concert that was amazing (mind you we did put our foot get to the tube) Hotel staff friendly, room (twin) very spacious, clean, beds very comfortable. Even though on a main road we were did not hear the traffic. Breakfast was fantastic, plenty to choose from. Dining room looked amazing although we did not eat there. Location the rest of london not too bad, we waljked to Oxford street not too far if like walking, but plenty of buses.£2.00 single trip. I would defintley go back there,	
Jul 4 2009 	I highly recommend the London Hilton Euston	Centrally located 5 minutes walk to St Pancras Station (Eurostar), 2 minutes to Euston Station, buses across the street. The hotel was immaculate and the service great. Room good-sized by London standards. I had dinner and breakfast there (included in room price), both of which were delicious. Manager Angelika hosts a reception for guest on Wed nights with apps and drinks. Very nice touch.	
Jun 27 2009 	Worst Hilton Hotel I've Stayed In	I've stay at Hilton hotels all around the world for most of my professional life for both business and pleasure and the Hilton Euston had the worst room I have ever experienced - at ANY hotel. It was no larger than a walk-in closet, the room looked tired and old and I was nervous to walk on the carpet. The staff and breakfast were great, and the location is pretty good being close to the Euston tube station; however, none of that was worth the room.I usually rely on the good Hilton name to know the quality of experience I'm going to have at a hotel, but this experience will prompt me to research Hilton hotels from now on. If I were Hilton, I'd divorce my good name from this hotel.	
Jun 26 2009 	Friendly small Hilton good value	We stayed here for the weekend with friends and can say that the single room was really small, the twin was fine and the double room was great. Rooms are a bit tired and choices on TV not great but the staff are really good and the breakfast buffet very well run. The bar in the evening is relaxing and well staffed. I would recommend this hotel without question but not for a single room.	
Jun 20 2009 	Well Stay ! Better than what I expected.	We stayed at Hilton Euston for 3 nights on June 5-8 and were very pleased with the friendliness of the front desk staff. The hotel is very close to Euston Station (just a few minutes walk) and 10 minutes walk to St. Pancras International station and for the price of 85 pounds (inc tax, 50% Offer) come with breakfast for 2 adults and 2 kids is so hard to resist. Although the checkin hour was supposely at 3pm, I told hotel that I would be arriving around 12pm. I was very pleased to see that they were expecting me and the room was ready for my arrival. The checkin was speedy and the reservation staff is well professional. The room was surprisingly spacious, clean and very comfortable. Breakfast room was the basement and has a large choice of food, but it can be a bit crowded sometimes since it was small area. From my estimate, it can accomodate up to 80 persons. The restaurant manager seemed to prefer AngMo than Asian and my wife was not pretty happy with the poor service given. There are 2 computers near to breakfast area corridor, but it is payable.Other than that, the housekeeping was superb and the stay was pleasant. Upon checkout, we were again overwhelmed by the service rendered by the front desk, very professional. The tall chinese guy helped us to carry the luggage even though it was not needed. , opened the door and greeted us goodbye. Saving tip for tourist attraction:You can get the One days TravelPass for 5.60 from Rail station or Underground. But for 2 for 1 Offer, you need to buy the ticket from the Rail station, not The Undergound. Eg: A family ticket to Tower of London = 47, with 2for1, you only spent 17(adult) x2 and get 2 kids free.	
Jun 17 2009 	Absolutely Appalling	We stayed at the Hilton Euston London for two nights -an absolutely appalling experience. The room we were assigned to had one window. This window - horrors! - overlooked a &quot;courtyard&quot; which housed the gym. This meant that (a) there was no natural light in the room and (b) anyone working out in the gym could look straight into the room. Not a pleasant experience. So - a tip for anyone checking into this hotel - please check if your room overlooks a &quot;courtyard&quot; housing the gym or the restaurant. In addition, the airconditioning was terrible and the lighting in the rooms was at an atmospheric low - great for cosy restaurants, NOT good for hotel rooms.Unlike a lot of other places I've stayed in - everything at this hotel was an &quot;extra&quot; - including leaving luggage at the hotel for two nights. One night complimentary, the next night charged at 2 pounds a bag.Staff courtesy was pathetic. The on site restaurant fair. Location fine if, and only IF, you have business in the area around Euston. Would not recommend this hotel - not worth the price, and it certainly does NOT live up to the Hilton reputation. Given my experience, I don't think I shall ever book into a Hilton again.	
Jun 6 2009 	Unhelpful reception staff spoiled an otherwise good stay.	Stayed at this hotel with 5 friends on a recent long weekend to London. Despite having booked in February, we arrived from the airport (at 11pm) to find that there was, apparently, some problem with our booking (and that of another Liverpudlian gentleman who had also booked a family room for himself, his wife and kids). Neither of the 2 receptionists on duty seemed either willing or able to tell any of us that there was a problem, what the nature of the problem was or what they were attempting to do about it. Indeed, neither of them seemed to speak very good English or understand what we were asking them). They simply kept their heads down, muttered and punched information into their respective computers. We were all left sitting with our luggage in the reception area for 25 minutes and kept in the dark as to what was happening - despite repeated requests from us and the other gentleman as to what was going on. A duty manager floated around, seemingly unconcerned that there was a problem or unwilling to get involved. We eventually were given 3 rooms on completely different floors! The Liverpudlian gentleman (whose family were waiting out in the car) eventually gave up and left. After what had been a very poor start to our break, we found the rest of the hotel staff to be polite and helpful - especially the concierge. 2 of the rooms were fine, but one was on the small side with no natural light and the window looking directly into the hotel gym. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Hotel is situated just round the corner from Euston station and tube and makes access to all the sights easy. Value for money, but come on reception staff - treat your guests with a little more courtesy please!	
Jun 4 2009 	VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL	My wife and I spent 4 nights at the hilton london euston and were very pleased with the friendliness of the staff at the desk and diningroom. they made our stay most enjoyable. special thanks to the concierge,an Italian gentleman, whose directions helped make our bus and tube rides easy. The London buses to downtown stop outside the hotel and the subway is a 5 minute walk.the Our room was great and the food and service in the diningroom was great. Well done, Hilton Euston staff	
May 28 2009 	Very Basic Accomodation in a Wonderful Location	For a tourist, the location of this place is really quite good - it is very close to St. Pancras, Bloomsbury, and Russell Square. Indeed, one can walk quite easily from the hotel to the BM, Covent Garden, SoHo, and many good restaurants. All this being said, the location of this place was its only redeeming quality. Upon arrival from a transatlantic flight, it isn't unusual to have to wait to check in to one's hotel in London as they all get in so early in the morning. Most hotels are sympathetic to one's fatigue I've found and there usually isn't a long wait at all to get into a room. The reception at the Euston Hilton was not terribly welcoming - in fact, it was rather cold. Without even checking to see if a room was available, I was quickly told I had to wait until 3pm - about 6 hours later. I had to fight with the receptionist to get them to hold my bags for me while I went out and about to eat and kill some time at this point, which turned me off considerably. Physically, the hotel seems lovely from the outside and there is a beautiful restaurant on the first floor. The rooms are dull, drag, and the carpeting and furniture are CHEAP. The building is clearly old and one can hear everything going on, including the creepy creaking for the old wood floors. I had the good fortune of having a boxing class going on below my window in the building next door and woke up every morning bright and early (against my wishes) to the sound of fists to punching bags. The bathroom was sufficient, but I would imagine that anyone would find the shower/tub combo dangerous - it is elevated quite high off the floor and puts one in a rather precarious position when trying to get out wet! I do recognize that London is a very expensive city, but for what I would call very basic accommodations, the Euston Hilton is rather pricey, even by Bloomsbury standards. Hiltons in Europe can often be hit-or-miss and this one, for the money, is a miss, as there are other options right around the corner or down the street that provide higher-quality accommodations for similar prices.	
May 17 2009 	Nice hotel - good location - very friendly staff	Stayed here for one night in May for a friend's wedding nearby.Great location (a couple of minutes walk from Euston). Staff were very friendly and helpful (allowed early check-in and late check-out without question). Rooms were adequate but very hot and the air-con was quite noisy. There is also some traffic noise but less than other local hotels.Wired Internet access very fast but very expensive (£15 for 24 hours)Would recommmend.	
May 13 2009 	comfortable but there are better Hilton hotels.	Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. This hotel is typical Hilton has everything you would expect. Nothing to complain about but certainly not one of Hiltons better hotels. I suspect this hotel gets a lot of business traffic.I had a standard room, not overly roomy but plenty space - nice enough bathroom with all the usual hilton toileteries and hiltons usual complimentary bottles of water were provided.I had a nice meal in the attractive restaurant on first night. I believe there was a gym but I did not use it. The overall building is pretty old but had nice features and is well looked after.Would recommend for Hilton HHonors loyalty club members looking for a hotel in Euston area of London and anyone visiting London who will not be in the room too much. There are, however, nicer hotels around this area.	
May 10 2009 	It has location location and location	The service in the hotel was friendly, polite and efficient.Our room was on the top floor. The room was adequate, clean and quiet.The location of the hotel is perfect. We used the London underground a great deal and selected the Hilton for its proximity to St Pancras, the Eurostar terminal. The restaurant was a disappointment. There was no atmosphere and the food choice for diner was really poor although breakfast was fine. Our newspaper was not delivered in the morning as promised and there were problems with the TV in the room. There were few channels, which was surprising.The location is key while the restaurant needs to be reviewed urgently. It is overpriced especially for short stays.	
Apr 21 2009 	Weekend Break in London	Stayed 2 nights April 17-18 for break to see Mama Mia and Spurs. The room was large and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent, large choice and poached eggs and omelettes were offered and freshly cooked. Restaurant was very busy but we did not have to queue at 9am but there were queues when we left. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We arrived at Euston Station and the hotel was very close. We purchased day tickets for the tube and easily travelled about London by tube and bus from the hotel. Would definitely go back to this hotel again.	
Apr 6 2009 	NICE HOTEL - LOCATION JUST WHAT WE WANTED	We needed a hotel close to St Pancras to catch the Eurostar early the next morning, this hotel was perfect. Located across the road from Euston and only 7-8 minutes from Kings Cross/St Pancras. Our room was on a high floor so we had little to no noise from the street below. It was a good size room aswell for London as was the bathroom and all presented spotlessly clean. Breakfast was of good quality and there was a great choice. The staff were ALL very friendly, though porterage of our luggage would have been a nice extra touch. Can't comment on the dinner as we went just up the road to Prezzo which was very good. There are plenty of restaurants in the area like Pizza Express and some nice pubs serving food. I would absoluetly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.	
Mar 30 2009	Great location comfortable room and friendly staff	I've just spent 2 nights at the Hilton London Euston and was very impressed with the hotel. The staff were ALL very friendly, the room was spacious, quiet and very comfortable and the buffet breakfast was varied and of excellent quality. In addition to that the location is superb as it was within walking distance of the West End and other attractions.	
Mar 24 2009 	Good location - tiny tiny room!	Our double room was quite tiny. We stayed at the Park Plaza Hotel near Waterloo a few weeks ago and our room there was more than twice the size of the 'double' at the Hilton. So small it only had 1 reading lamp and ledge by the side of the bed. Also the paint was chipped in the bedroom and it felt like the whole thing is in need of a renovation. TV had suprisingly few channels for a Hilton. Location, however, was really great...From reviews on this site it looks like room size varies massively so it might be worth looking at a few rooms before you decide which one to take.	
Mar 22 2009 	Wonderful hotel in convenient location	I stayed at this hotel twice with my mother, once in a suite and once in a standard double room. Each room was clean, comfortable, and spacious. The bathrooms were also clean and spacious and contained small toiletries and hairdryer. The rooms each had a small fridge, television, closet, and sitting area. The hotel is across the street from Euston Underground and Nat'l Rail station, and 7 min. walk to Kings Cross St Pancras station. The hotel is also in the vicinity of UCL, so there are a number of dining options around. Overall, this is a high quality, comfortable hotel in an excellent location.	
Mar 20 2009 	Great staff	I frequently stay in hotels and I rarely get excited about the service I receive. The Hilton Euston made a big impression on me. I stayed in a delux room and for various reasons were shown three in this category which varied enormously. My room was excellent, spacious, clearn, lovely bathroom and good facilities. The price reflects the location.The big disappointment was the restaurant. The food and staff were again great but the atmosphere, decor and general experience did not match.	
Mar 18 2009 	A truly wonderful hotel	The Hilton London Euston is a reasonably priced high-end hotel that gives you value for your dollar - rather, your pound. Situated a minute away from an underground station and in the middle of a beautiful, elegant and safe neighbourhood just a few minutes away from the British Museum, the location is fantastic. The hotel is very new, with big and nicely decorated rooms, very clean and has great facilities. Service is great, and they even provide you with new glass-bottled spring and sparkling water every morning (which you will appreciate given the price of bottled water in London!). Our experience at this wonderful hotel made our stay in London very enjoyable and comfortable. Great hotel. I highly recommend it!	
Mar 7 2009 	Very Nice Hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights. Had a super deluxe corner room. Good size (2 adults &amp; 2 children). Very very clean. Has fridage an complimentary bottled water. Location is good as there is a bus stop practically outside the front door and Eustom subway 5 minutes walk. We had DBB. Dinners were a good 3-course choice meals of very good level. Breakfast too was good. Staff at D &amp; B were so-so. A lot of trainees and management seemed absent. Overal very good stay.Charming Victorian building and yes the floors creek but is part of the charm.	
Mar 6 2009 	"Fine" - not remarkable or special but suited my needs	Stayed two nights whilst on a business trip. Conveniently located to Euston Station (4-5 minutes walk) and both Kings Cross and St.Pancras are 10 minutes walk down the road.Room quality average for this grade of hotel in London but I do wonder what American guests must make of a Hilton brand hotel in London. If in the US I would say the room quality was more akin to a Hampton Inn, but smaller.Very helpful and friendly front desk staff.They offered a special of £12.95 on a three course dinner when I stayed (coupon required from front desk) which I thought very reasonable. We however only ate there for breakfast which was a standard English breakfast affair.Suited my needs but not memoriable.	
Mar 5 2009 	Great location small rooms	Booked a double room for 3 nights during Hilton's sale so got the room for £65pn before tax which was a great deal for a branded central London hotel. The hotel is literally 2 minutes walk from Euston station making it a great location if you're travelling by train. The hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. No complaints about the buffet breakfast - always a good selection on offer. The only complaint was the size of our double room which was really small. The bathroom was a good size but the rest of the room didn't leave much space for two people to move around in. It was pretty warm in the room as well so had to put the air-con on full blast in February! Other than that would recommend the hotel as long as you don't plan on spending much time in your room.	
Feb 27 2009 	NOT IMPRESSED	I stayed in this hotel for one night as i was on my own i booked a single room the room was very small and if you were selling you house you would call it a box room although it had a en suite shower room the ceiling sloped and when you stood up from the toilet you had to either bang your head or twist your neck and i am not tall. The room needed a lick of paint where the old curtain pole used to be and had been plastered but not painted. I was given a smoking room even though i don't smoke and the smell lingured and the fans that they put on made a lot of noise.Tv didn't work on all channels infact the only channel i could get was the football and the room had a wierd light switch system.Had dinner in the restraunt which was nice.	
Feb 27 2009 	Great Staff Great Location Great Price	This hotel made my trip! So convenient to the tube (Northern line) // train station (Virgin trains). Wonderfully clean rooms (I stayed in two). Fantastic staff all the way around, I can't say enough good things about the staff. They even held my luggage so I didn't have to lug it around when I left town for one night (I did come back the next day, but still, I thought this was extremely accommodating and made my trip that much better). Walk to British Museum. Rates were fantastic, I got very lucky and had one night for under $100 USD including breakfast. Breakfast was very good. Beds comfortable. I could not have asked for more. I look forward to staying here again.	
Jan 29 2009 	Great staff hotel convenient and comfortable	Don't often go to London but I picked this hotel as a nice convenient place for public transport. The room was really nice, very clean although maybe a little warm as the air con seemed to be either hot or not quite so hot. Had full buffet breakfast once and it was very good if a bit pricey so went out to the local Starbucks for coffee and croissant after that. The staff were all really nice and extremely helpful which is a pleasant change from some of the so called quality hotels in London that I've used for businesss over the years.	
Jan 26 2009 	Nice and cozy	Compared to the usual Hiltons, this is a relatively small property in a nice Victorian building. It is right across the street from Euston station which makes it very convenient to reach. The overall stay was good a part from the itch that they tried twice to bill me breakfast which was already included in the room rate - I think it was a genuine mistake due to my very late arrival so I was probably not in the &quot;right list&quot;.	
Jan 5 2009 	no fake smiles	we were expecting the worse, after reading through the reviews..and having stayed in the worse, took a gamble. So what a surprise...From the moment we arrived nothing could be faulted...I can only assume the grumpy reviewers had stayed in Buckingham palace before booking in here...	
Dec 29 2008 	good location and very nice bed	I stayed in a single room on busy street but still slept very well. The room is large and clean. the bathroom didn't have any heating so there is room for improvement there. other than that I really enjoyed my stay - staff is nice and smily, breakfast OK, concierge very helpful and gave my party the name and address of a really nice and cheap japanese restaurant in the vincinity (the Hare and Tortoise).for the deal I had (GBP60.00) it couldn't be better. but I certainly would think twice about paying more than 100.00.	
Dec 9 2008 	Nice Hotel with good access to public transport	We stayed at the Hilton London Euston for 3 nights from December 5-8. Booked at the Hilton Homepage at the nun-refundable rate including breakfasts and dinner st the first night.Hotel:The hotel is located in the Bloomsbury area, 5 minutes walking distance from Euston train station and 10 minutes walk from Kings Cross /St. Pancras station. This was ideal for us because we arrived at Luton airport with train shuttle to St. Pancras station. Euston Underground station is one blockaway and buses to Trafalgar Square start right in front of the hotel. The hotel is in a old, historic building, all areas are very well maintained.Rooms:We booked twin rooms, which were of very good size. Rooms are very well maintained, bathroom size was OK and all hilton amenities available. Water pressure was excellent. Only downturn is, that there was no room safe available, only lockers at reception. There is a nice, big empty refrigerator in the desk, I would prefer a stocked minibar. Our rooms faced to a inner court, only negative issue is the aircondition on the roof, we could hear the noise even when the windows were closed.Food:Dinner at first night was excellent. Starter and Desert can be chosen from the mnue, main course is buffet stlye with a selection of 5 courses. Everything was very delicious. The main restaurant is located in a stylish conservatory. Breakfast is served in a basement dining room. Since its quite small there were lines as from 9.30 Am, we arrived every morning at 8.30 and never had to wait. Good selection on English breakfast buffet.Summarizing, we would come back to the Hilton London Euston and recommend it to everybody not expecting a 5 Star Hotel or central location in West End.	
Dec 2 2008 	Clean comfortable and friendly staff	I stayed at this Hotel in a Deluxe King Room for 1 night last month during a short break to London, we walked along from Kings Cross Station which only took about 10 minutes. The staff were helpful and pleasant and the room was clean and comfortable. We were in a room with a wood floor which was quite nice. The bed was massive! The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and there was the usual Hilton robe and slippers waiting on us. The room was a good size. The best thing about our stay was the lovely breakfast the following morning. The waiter asked if my daughter would like chocolate pancakes and he went off and ordered some. A few minutes later they arrived at the table. There was a large buffet, including fruit, cereal, toast, pastries, bacon, egg, sausage etc..... very nice.All in all a very good experience and I would stay here again.	
Dec 2 2008 	Excellent location	Excellent location for many attractions but the reason we choose this was because we were using the Eurostar at St Pancras the following day.Staying one night only 2 adults and 2 children.Deluxe Rooms 2 queen bed put together but not a problem you would not know unless you hunted kids had sofa bed but still loads of room.Good size very clean and tidy. Complementary water and toiletries.Breakfast good variety pastries ham cereals cooked breakfast and pleasant staff.Staff all around we very welcoming excellent with the kids gave them chuppa lollies so they were more than happy.Very good stay	
Oct 22 2008 	Good location	We have stayed at the Hilton Euston several times and always been happy with the service. Our main reason is the location - close to Euston Station and Tube.The Hotel itself is OK, not spectacular, but certainly adequate for a 3 star. The rooms a quite large by London standards and well equipped. Try to avoid rooms at the front (it's a very busy road) and on the ground floor (occasionally the bar gets noisy)Breakfasts have a huge choice but the hot buffet is usually barely warms. My wife gets round this by asking for two poached eggs instead. The cold options are varied and plentiful.Dining in the restaurant is OK, with menus being quite interesting but the a la carte is expensive - as usual the wine prices have a huge mark-up!The best way to book your stay is by using a &quot;deal&quot; - especially such as those through Saga - like &quot;stay 2 nights with dinner on the 1st night&quot; - but these offers go very quickly, so book ahead.	
Oct 14 2008 	Overpriced - but excellent location	I stayed here for one night on a business trip to London. My office normally books me into the nearby Ibis or Thistle (as they're cheaper) but both were full at the time.It's in a prime spot just a stone's throw from Euston Station - which was handy as the rain was torrential when I arrived.The concierge cheerily greeted me and asked if I needed any assistance with my bag. The lobby area/reception/toilets are all very well presented and clean.The check-in staff were just this side of pleasant (only just though) but it was quick and I was in my room within 5 minutes of arriving.The room was a little on the small side but as it was a twin (and I was on my own) there was enough space to spread out.That said, it was only 'OK' and it was certainly overdue a freshening up. The bathroom was the same - quite small but functional but in desperate need of a deep clean and a coat of paint.The beds themselves were narrow singles and were far too 'bouncy' for my liking. The room was quiet though and the sheets and pillows were fresh and clean resulting in a good night's sleep (which, let's face it, is the main aim for a one night business trip!)The bar is modern (expensive!) but a bit bright. It's ok to meet people and read the paper but not somewhere you'd want to spend any time in. I didn't visit the restaurant but ate in a local bar. On my way out, the concierge made polite conversation while I stood looking at the rain and gave me an umbrella. Not a huge gesture but little things matter and I wish more hoteliers would remember this.Breakfast was very good and the service of the waiting staff couldn't be faulted.Check-out was as brisk and perfunctory as the check-in and there was no problem in leaving my bags in a secure room for the afternoon.All told, I have to say that I was a little disappointed as I have stayed in Hiltons before and found them to be a 'cut above'. This was no different than the Ibis or Thistle - but they're about £50 a night cheaper.If it was £100 a night, I'd have given it 4 stars - but at £160, it's too expensive for what it is.	
Oct 13 2008 	Great stay at the Hilton Euston	I spent three nights at the Hilton London Euston during my last visit to London. I booked it as a HHonors rewards and was highly satisfied with this property.The hotel's location is very convenient. It's in Bloombsbury, a nice and quiet residential area steps away from the British Museum, and there are many underground and train stations nearby (like Euston and King's Cross), so you can easily access any point in the city.The rooms are very well appointed, and quite big for London standards. The beds are superb as in other Hilton properties I've visited and our room also had a very confortable desk and a little table. The contamporary decor gave it a nice atmosphere, while the bathroom was also reasonably appointed. The only drawback was the lack of an in-room safety box.The staff is very helpful and friendly. The hotel also has a nice restaurant, a gym, a bar, a caffe and a small business center.I really liked this hotel and would certainly stay here again. A great location and a comfortable room made my trip to London even better.	
Oct 7 2008	Great location!	The best thing about this hotel is the location. Easy walking distance to Euston train/Underground station, St Pancras, and good selection of dining choices.All of the staff I dealt with were friendly and helpful. I had a little trouble initially getting in to my room, to which the staff was very appologetic and offered a bottle of wine to compensate me for my troubles.The hotel is in a nice, old building, which is asthetically pleasing and clean. The rooms were on the small side and some of the floorboards were in need of repair, but these are not completely surprising given the age of the building.I did not try the in-house restaurant, but the breakfast buffet was tasty and had enough variety to please almost anyone.All in all, I definitely enjoyed my stay and would feel comfortable recommending this hotel anyone heading to London.	
Oct 6 2008 	Not bad.	The Hilton Euston is quite a nice hotel in a good location. We were able to walk to most places we went in the few days we stayed there and there are a few tube stations within easy walking distance. There's also a few shops including a few small supermarkets/delis close by. The rooms are nice but are VERY small - as in the double bed is up against the wall and doesn't have bed side tables. The bathrooms are modern and there are double windows so the noise was at a minimum. We booked through londontown.com so we got a dinner and all breakfasts included. The dinner was a set menu and buffet style. The food was generally lovely but as a vegetarian I had to get the only vegetarian option which I didn't like, a bit annoying really. The service in the restaurant was excellent and the restaurant itself is gorgeous. The breakfast downstairs was also lovely with a wide selection.I'd certainly consider staying there again if the price was right. It wasn't amazing or memorable, but there wasn't anything wrong with our stay either.	
Sep 22 2008 	Adequate	I stayed here for one night in July on a brief visit to London. To be honest I was quite pleased it was just the one night - I found the hotel to be dated and a little shabby and in need of a renovation. The room was tiny and it was difficult to shower without completely covering the floor in water. And - bizarrely - a minibar with nothing in it?!!!!!I stayed at the Novotel earlier in the year (which is just around the corner) and found it much better value and a far, far nicer hotel. The hotel staff were pleasant but thats all this hotel had going for it really.	
Sep 21 2008 	Good Hotel	In a good location, Close to tube and if you dont mind a walk it is about 30 minutes to Leicester Square.The Staff were very polite and helpful. The room was a good size for a london hotel, very clean, nicely decorated, modern, massive bed.The only downsize was the restaurant for breakfast. We had to queue to get in - but going at 9.30 on a Sunday that can be expected. The restaurant was quite small. The food at breakfast kept running out. When we first went in I saw people waiting for food by the buffet and then when we went there was only 2 hash browns, 2 sausages, 2 vegetarian sausages and the scrambled egg was so runny I really dont know what they had done to it. I think there must have been pressure to get it out quickly so rushed it, I dont know. The other food which was there was tasty though.That is the only negative thing but other than that a great hotel, modern, good quality, friendly staff and I would definately go back.	
Sep 1 2008 	Ok for busisness and one night stay.	The hotel is just ok. the location is good, easy access and very closed to metro station.The staff is helpfull and friendly, not complaints at all, however we have been there just for one night so we didn't get in touch with them too much.Our room was modern but very small and it smels like dead people. It is situated in a quiet area, however we couldn't open the window due to a strange noise which didn't stop either at night or during the day. The good thing about our stay in this hotel is the breakfast, good quality food!!!We weren't that concern about our room coz we stay there just for one night but if it was for a longer stay we have had complaint.I would go back to this hotel just to have breakfast there again but not to sleep over.	
Aug 29 2008 	Great base for seeing London. Rooms not great but service excellent	Checking in was a pleasure. We arrived quite early but there was a room available and staff were very helpful. In fact staff were great at dinner and breakfast and were happy to sort out poached eggs for us fussy eaters. The free dinner on our tariff was excellent with a good choice. Breakfast was excellent too with a choice of pastries, cold meets, cereals and cooked breakfast. Something for everyone.The only downside was the room. I think my husband and I were given a single room with a double bed up against a wall, and like many others the lamp was on the headboard.. what's that all about??? There was not room to swing a cat (not that we would!). Thankfully we were only staying two nights, and my husband the gent volunteered to sleep the side with the light against the wall. Had we been staying for a relaxing break/ or for more than two nights we definitely would have asked to move rooms. Bathrooms was very clean with plenty of products and I can always cope as long as the bathroom is clean with a great shower - which it was.Would I stay again? Short break - yes but I would definitely make sure we had a double bed which we could get in and out of both sides and where you could move your head without bashing it on a lamp! The service and friendly staff made the stay worthwhile :)	
Aug 25 2008 	Functional and good value for money	Business trip X 2 nights, great location right across the road from Euston. Excellent for business travellers/ladies travelling on own. Stayed in a single room which is on the small side particularly the bathroom/walk in shower room however did the job for work. My usual moan about the crap hairdryer and a stupidly placed bedside lamp on the headboard of the bed (although I have noticed this in single rooms before)! So you crack your head against the lamp if you are a fidgeter :-) I was in a room at the side of the hotel and it is very noisy; ambulance and police sirens all night long but I guess I'm not used to the London noise these days. Bedrooms and reception area are a little tatty but it's clean and well positioned so you get what you pay for. My rate was excellent and included dinner on the 1st evening plus breakfast so overall good value for money. Good service, particularly concierge and in the lounge/bar which is a nice place to have a drink or a business meeting. Will use again for business trips or cheapy weekend shopping visits .	
Aug 13 2008 	Average (with issues)	While the staff at this hotel were very nice and helpful - the hotel itself - well specifically our room did have some issues. Our room - 216 - was very small and outdated. I can deal ok with this but then our toilet was clogged and would not flush, our fridge didn't work and myself and my husband were there 1 night planning to drink a bottle of champagne but couldn't get it chilled b/c of the fridge. So we called the front desk and told them about it and asked for a bucket of rice. This took 4 more phone calls/transfers and 20 minutes to achieve but finally the ice got there. Also - we got the desert that was liquid center chocolate sponge cake and it was average too.	
Aug 13 2008 	A Dump!	Stayed here one night and that was too long. Old, outdated hotel that simply slapped a Hilton sign on the door. Its small (not quaint), drab decor, outdated and boring. After staying at the Hilton Kensington (which was VERY NICE) this place should be a Comfort Inn instead of a Hilton and for $240(!) a total waste of money. My room (a twin bed) was so small, I had to walk sideways to get around the room. The bathroom only had shower (no tub area). The whole hotel was very tired. The staff was pleasant and the location is good (especially for getting around on the Tube (2 min walk). I won't be staying here again.... there are nicer hotels for the same price around.	
Jul 31 2008 	Poor hotel in reasonable location	Stayed here 2 nights on a business trip to London. Pounds 200 a night plus tax excluding breakfast.What I didnt like:Check in poor. Service staff had a &quot;couldnt care less&quot; attitude. Despite only myself and colleague checking in at 7am actually had to ask to be served despite one checkout clerk twiddling his fingers behind the desk.Got a smoking room (despite being a non smoker) which stank of smoke. Internet connection didnt work and neither did the A/C. Room was pokey with a single bed pushed against a wall. Wasnt able to move rooms as hotel claimed that they were full.Whats GoodGood choice for breakfast and service attentive. Not sure if 16 quid represents good value for money though.All in all, poor value for money. Poor room, patchy service. Does nothing to enhance London's reputation as a leading tourist centre.	
Jul 18 2008 	Great spot	Good location - could walk easily from King's Cross.First room was small and the bed was terrible (the springs had gone on my wife's side of the bed) so we asked for a change. This was done without a fuss which we really appreciated. Second room was much better - much bigger and more comfortable.Bathrooms were fine but the bath was tiny (as if most UK hotels - I don't understand why this so). Food was good and breakfast was adequate (very crowded).Floorboards squeaked a lot which disturbed our sleep - not sure if anything can be done about about this.	
Jul 3 2008 	good hotel	Went with my 18 yr old daughter for a 2 night sight seeing break. taxi was £18 from Victoria coach stn which was steep but thought the hotel was quite homely. They let us leave our luggage in a room as it was early and was nicely surprised to find the tube station was 5 mins away so went to madam tussauds for a few hours. When we checked in we had a spotless ground floor twin room. The evening meal was included and was delicious. Didnt use the bar it seemed a bit small and busy. Full english breakfast was also delicious with plenty of choice, The downside of the hotel is the noise of the emergency vehicles on the main road round the corner which woke us up regularly. Paid 199 for b and b and evening meal on 1st night. Quite expensive but had a good time.	
Jun 12 2008 	Not up to Hilton Standards	Staff were excellent, food was just OK. The hotel is old and the floors squeak not to mention that the walls are paper thin. I requested the highest floor (I'm a Diamond member) and was told that patrons were being allowed to smoke. Clearly a violation of Hilton policy. Would not stay there again.	
Jun 8 2008 	good location	We stayed at this Hilton because we used Hilton Honors points and it was the only hotel with a big room to fit us and our 2 kids.We liked the room with a huge king bed and a sofa bed.The bathroom was efficient and very clean.The breakfast was included and it was a great buffet every morning.Great eggs and sausages, wide variety of cheeses, fruits, yogurts,porridge, wonderful jams and great variety of bread as well.My kids loved the breakfast and rated it no1. The hotel had a gym on the first floor with a great glass facade opening to the courtyard formed by all the other buildings around the block.It was nice to see a garden view.The machines were new and top of the line. The hotel was 2 blocks away from the underground station, there was a grocery store on one entrance of the station. You could walk to British (10 blocks or so)but it was always raining, we took the subway.We were very happy with the front desk.We asked for a cab to the airport, our plane was very early in the morning, they made the arrangementand when we were leaving 4.30am nobody was around at the front desk but our cab ride was waiting outside.It was the day of Tour de France in London so the cabbie took us through the local streets in stead of getting stuck in traffic on the regular route to the airport, that was very considerate.	
May 26 2008 	Good base to see London	We got a late deal via laterooms and paid just 60 pounds for room only. Was excellent value for money, the hotel is modern, well located close to Euston tube/station and an idea base for seeing the sites. If I had paid more than £100 then perhaps I might have a slightly different view, but overall I couldn't fault this hotel. It's a Hilton so you know what to expect.	
May 22 2008 	Brilliant staff	Fantastic stay. Staff could not have been more helpful. Room was more than expected. Bathroom much bigger than normal size. Could not have wanted more. Even dining was a great experience. Thoroughly recommend.	
May 18 2008 	Geeat if you like shoeboxes	Stayed there on the 29th April as a stopover prior to going on the Eurostar from St Pancras.All staff very friendly &amp; welcoming.Booked a double room but was allocated a twin. When i went to complain they said they were full but offered to zip the 2 beds together &amp; offered us a complimentary drink for the incovenience.Twin room was adequate for an overnight stopover.My parents had been allocated a double which was just big enough to get a double bed against the wall. One person had to climb over the other occupant of they wanted to get out of bed or wriggle to the end of the bed &amp; get out that way.Bed was hard &amp; lumpy &amp; found sleep very difficult that night.Bathroom well equipped with Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products but there is a slight metal step into the bathroom which encouraged you to stub your toe if you were not careful!Bath was very deep &amp; could benefit from a grab rail to stop you from slipping on the tiled floor.Breakfast was vey good with very helpful staff &amp; plenty of choice. On checkout they tried to charge us for the drinks &amp; it took about 5 mins of explanation to the reception staff before they cleared the bill as nothing had been put on our room about the complimentary drinks.We payed about £188 via Tesco clubcard vouchers for the experience &amp; my parents payed £157(approx).In both cases i consider it poor value for money &amp; will probably try the Travelodge or one of the many other hotels in that area next time I need to catch the Eurostar.	
May 12 2008 	Good	The experience at the Hilton in Euston has been positive.The staff is very helpful and the location is quite good close to the Tube. The size of the room was perfect at the time when I stayed there they were repainting the doors so there was a bit of paint smell in the corridor but not in the room.I suggest this hotel if you are thinking to spend for a long week end in London.	
Apr 29 2008 	Enjoyed the stay	After reading some of the negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised with the room. There was plenty of lights, size of room was spacious (for London), bed was comfortable, the bathroom was recently renovated, plenty of towels etc. It was cold outside with snow on the ground, but temperature control of the room was well maintained, not to cold nor overly hot. Tv set was small with very few channels. Internet was very expensive $30.00 per day and was not dependable during my stay. Check in and checking out was fast and convenient, no errors or surprises on the bill. Breakfast was included , and was adequate and convenient, but nothing to rave about. The hot foods were greasy, the scrambled eggs looked like a pale mush, but there was plenty of alternatives including croissants, cereals, fruits, and cold cuts, etc. The floor in the room creaked really bad. Worse, the floor above creaked so loud, it sounded like someone was walking in my room. Nevertheless, you get used to it by the next day. The location of the hotel is close to the Tube and was a short walk from Pancras train station. I had traveled from Paris with Eurostar, and was able to walk with my luggage from the train station to the hotel. An atm machine was conveniently located across the street from Pancras. Overall, I would definitely recommend the hotel, however, I am pretty sure not all rooms are of the same caliber. I overheard some people complaining, and wanting to change their rooms, I was lucky.	
Apr 28 2008 	Good if You Get A Deal	Hotel is listed as a 4 star but to me its no more than 3. The location is good near Euston station.The check in area has a very tired look about it and the staff do not reflect that it is a 4 star hotel.I saw rates for £179 a night but I paid £63. For £63 its a good deal but not worth anything more really.	
Mar 25 2008 	Better than Expected	After reading some of the comments on this site we were pleasantly surprised with the Hilton in Euston. The staff were very helpful and friendly, the family room we had on the 2nd floor, towards the rear of the hotel, was ideal and quiet and the breakfast was excellent.The location of the hotel was first class and repesented good value for money at £124.50 per night over the Easter weekend including evening meal for the three of us on the first night.True there were squeaking floorboards, both from the corridors and from the room above and some carpets and paintwork could do with renewing but this did not detract in any way from our enjoyment of the Hilton. We would definitely stay there again.	
Mar 25 2008 	Q good value if you can get a deal	We stayed over Easter weekend. We had the same problem with a smokey room (it shouldve been no smoking but someone had not obeyed the sign!) Luckily they managed to move us as I am allergic to smoke and couldnt stay in the room. It was a bit hit and miss at reception but overall the hotel is very nice and has been refurbed. Nice big rooms and large beds, good bathrooms but small bath tubs. Good location, will definitely book again.	
Mar 22 2008 	Just OK	My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights over a weekend in March 2008. The hotel was in a good location close to St Pancras and Euston stations. We had requested a non smoking room, and, on arrival, were allocated to a room that stank of smoke. We went back down to reception an asked for a non smoking room, only to be told, that our request was only a &quot;request&quot; and that there were no non smoking rooms avaialble. After being shown a further 2 smoking rooms, we settled on the one that smelt the least, but it still reeked of stale smoke... yuk!!We had dinner included on our first night, so proceeded to the &quot;restuarant&quot; only to find out the meal was &quot;buffet style&quot; We opted for the vegetarian option as it was freshly cooked.... but it was'nt that great! Saying that, breakfast in the morning was lovely, and we couldn't have asked for any more. There was a huge choice and it was fresh and tasty.The following night, we moved rooms and got an upgrade to a King Size Deluxe room. The only difference we could see was a bigger bed, different curtains, and no smokey smell!! It was OK, but a bit stuffy and the air con didn't seem to do anything.The hotel was just ok, the best thing about it was its location, and we would stay there again but only if we could guaranteee a smoke free room.	
Mar 14 2008 	Great London Hotel in Great Area	I stayed at the Hilton London Euston on my first trip to Europe. I will admit I was expecting a small hotel room, with average everything from the reviews that I read about European hotels. However, to my surprise the Hilton London Euston was far from average. The hotel is located in central London in the area of Euston and Bloomsbury close to two tube stops (Euston Station and Euston Square Station. Yes, they are two different stations). I had a two twin room with enough space for my two suitcases and my friends luggage as well. The bathroom was nicely appointed and big as well. In my rate I had dinner on the first and third nights and breakfast on the second and fourth mornings and the rate was 99 pounds per night which is inexpensive for London Hotels. The hotel is central enough to everything is pretty much a twenty minute tube ride to all that tourists might want to do. Beaware though that everything in England will be double to those exchanging the dollar for the pound as the American dollar has lost alot of value. The only complaint is that, as probably all European hotels because of their age, the walls are thin. You can hear people as the walk down the hallway, other than that the Hilton London Euston is a great hotel and would stay there again.	
Mar 5 2008 	superb hotel	What a first class hotel, booked on hotel website, 2 nights b and b with dinner on the friday night....£189. Best deal I have ever had.Location couldn't have been better for an arrival from Kings cross. Upgraded to a large kingsize room from a wonderful lady on reception. Quiet room, all mod cons, excellent staff on reception and dining room. Breakfast and dinner were excellent. Sure we will be back.	
Mar 1 2008	very comfortable	nicely located near Euston Station, which is a good station to get to other areas of London, this hotel is in a quiet area, no real sightseeing or even restaurants near, which was fine with us.somewhat bland breakfast, but nice presentation and very friendly staff. beds very comfortable. good internet in rooms	
Feb 28 2008 	Pretty good hotel	Overall the hotel is fine. The location is great, and is really convenient for a number of attractions, as well as the tube.The room I had was fine for one night. It was pretty small but I had booked a double bed and was glad of that after reading previous reviews. The bathroom was small but clean and tidy, and I didn't get much noise from outside even though I was overlooking the street. There was a bit of noise from the creaky old floorboards, especially from upstairs rooms though.My only other beef was with the receptionists, who were a bit lacking in warmth and human spirit on occasion. I'm an HHonours member but booked through an agent to get the cheaper rates. When I arrived, I was treated a bit like a refugee when they saw who i'd booked with. When I mentioned my HHonours membership and asked how much it would be to upgrade to a better room, I was told rather abruptly that I could only have a standard because I'd booked with the agent. The way she spoke to me, I felt like a naughty boy who'd been told off by teacher!All in all though I'd probably go back because of the convenience of the location. I think i'd better book through Hilton next time though!	
Feb 12 2008	So Convenient	Stayed 2 nights at this Hilton Hotel last week, had no complaints and got value for money I felt. A real winner for anybody travelling by train to London Euston without too much luggage, 5 minutes walk and you are there, efficient concierge, though room was not ready we were an hour early, however we were sent to the lounge but not informed when the room was ready... a minor hiccup . Room and bathroom adequate and clean, downside was we were above the bins so were woken with that daily clatter and traffic was noisy.Food in both restaurants great, and, for mass produced fried eggs none appeared rubbery.Would stay again, got value for money booked direct on the Hilton website.	
Feb 8 2008 	Fine for a short stay	Just stayed the one night on business. Found everything first class. It's location would be okay for a leisure stay as well. Only yards from circle line tube direct to most main train stations. Room I had was extremely large and luxurious. Breakfast more than adequate plenty of choice hot and cold. Slept well couldn't ask for more. Small but well equiped gym with personal trainers.Couple of local pubs and restaurants.	
Feb 7 2008	Wouldn't Recommend	I was in London on business with a colleague and we stayed at the London Euston. We stayed 4 nights, and since I had booked late, I had to give up my double room after 2 nights to move to a single room the other 2 nights. Both rooms were shabby and worn. I definately didn't feel that I was at a Hilton hotel. The single room was tiny, I felt as if I was back in my college dorm room - although I think that was bigger. The bathroom in the single room was spacious and the toiletries were very nice, and the longest wall had windows running the length of it, which made the room seem a bit larger. The locations of both rooms were right off the street and the street noise and sirens were very disturbing. Some of the front desk staff were fairly rude - I wouldn't say that we were made to feel 'welcomed' in any way.I wouldn't stay here again.	
Feb 6 2008 	Awfully small rooms and A SINGLE BED!	Never before I have stayed in such a small room as this. My spare room at home was bigger. I haven't slept in a single bed since I was 15!!! Hilton won't have my business anymore.	
Feb 1 2008 	Overbooked room	I usually love staying at Hilton hotels and have usually had good experiences. Not this time. We booked a B&amp;B and dinner weekend package through the hotel website however when we arrived (at 8pm) we were told that the hotel was overbooked and we would have to stay at the hotel across the road or the Hilton in Paddington. This was even though we had paid online in full weeks in advance. We asked why we were not contacted and they said that they did not have our details even though they sent a confirmation email and all of our details were on the checkout form at the end of our stay. We decided to have our dinner in the hotel and then move to Paddington which was very inconvenient as we had plans centred around Euston the following morning. We got a taxi (paid for by the hotel) to the Paddington Hilton and were told that Euston Hilton had only requested a standard room for us (even though they told us it would be an upgraded room for the inconvenience). The Paddington people to their credit upgraded us without a problem and mentioned that Euston often overbooks.Our stay in the Paddington Hilton was fine and the breakfast was incredible however it was not where we had intended to be (breakfast at Paddington was better than at Euston). We got a taxi back the following morning to the Euston Hilton and were eventually given an upgraded room (which seemed like a normal standard to me). It was a nice room to be fair. On our way past the reception desk, another couple had also been bumped to a different hotel (for 2 nights and were not happy).On checkout we encountered more problems. We had something from the minibar and the receptionist was adament that we owed them over 80pounds. We spoke to the manager and he checked our room to find that we only owed 5 pounds. Apologies were not really forthcoming from anyone. Meanwhile another couple were being told the hotel was overbooked whilst someone else was complaing about being overcharged!Basically the service is non-existant and the staff seem to have very little regard for people staying with them. The hotel itself is quite pleasant and the location is great however I could not stay here again after this experience and could not recommend it.	
Jan 29 2008 	Good Location.Very small rooms	I booked this hotel because of the Hilton deals advertised to visit Tutenkamen. The hotel is very close to Kings Cross, close to Russell Square Tube and also on a good bus route.The hotel itself is fine but the double room we had booked was tiny- luckily as we were only there for one night so didn't have much luggage. The bed was pushed up against the wall and at the otherside has a wardrobe. This means there are no bedside tables etc. The only bedside light is over the bed. A standard lamp at the end of the bed meant the only way I could get out of bed was to climb over my husband or ask him to get out first!!I complained to reception staff who were very helpful. We were initially offered a complimentary bottle of wine which we declined and were then offered complimentary breakfasts.The hotel staff were very helpful and efficient.	
Jan 29 2008	god city hotel	Our daughter treated us to a London weekend as a Christmas present. The hotel is only 5 minutes from London Euston Station and Russel Street tube station. Part of the hotel deal included a 3 course dinner on the first night, the food was very good. We had a triple room and it was a decent size and very clean. Our inclusive breakfast was very good but there are queues in the morning around 9 the hotel does advise to avoid this time. You can easily walk to the city centre which we did to walk off the excellent breakfast.	
Jan 13 2008	Uncomfortable beds	Stayed for one night only - thank goodness!!! We travelled via Euston Station, upon arrival we were unable to find the hotel and so phoned them - The receptionist spoke limited English and found it difficult to give directions - despite it only being literally across the street and round the corner from Euston! The room was a good size but looked in need of refurbishment - the beds were the most uncomfortable we have ever had the misfortune to sleep on!! The room was hot, airless and stuffy and overlooked the gym, (no outside window) Despite near zero temperatures outside we had to have the airconditioning on throughout the night to try to cool the room down. The bar was dismal and without any atmosphere - apart, that is, from Sky sports blasting from a TV! The room service menu was limited and our first choice was unavailable. Staff were OK - got the impression that none of them were happy to be there - not very friendly or helpful but not quite bad enough to be called rude!	
Jan 12 2008 	Never Again	I was happy with the location and seeing the lobby for the first time - modern and sleek. However we reserved two adjoining rooms and were assured at check-in that is what we would have. However there was a room in between our rooms (not adjoining) and one of our nonsmoking rooms had a very strong cigar smell in it. When we asked to change rooms the front desk seemed insulted and angry that we would make such a request. They did not help in anyway and told us the hotel was full, take it or leave it!Our room was worn and the service level was minimal. Twice wake up calls never were given. The concierge was off and his replacement couldn't suggest any restaurant near the hotel. He just tried to push the hotel's restaurant. Our rooms had no outside view, we looked right into the restaurant and had to keep our curtains closed at all times.The breakfast room was always full and we had to wait in long lines to get seated. Often we just went down the street.Two computers for guests, but neither ever worked.The worst night was when the sprinklers went off and the hotel had to be evacuated in the middle of the night. The temp outside was 30 degrees. People were in their pjs, underwear and barefoot. We waited 45 minutes to get back into the hotel and the lobby was flooded. Never an apology from the staff or management and nothing to compensate for getting up in the middle of night and standing out in the cold. Hotel looks great and has a good location, but I will NEVER stay here again. It's really bad news!	
Dec 25 2007 	Lovely little hotel - friendly staff clean comfortable good value for money	This hotel is situated about 2 minutes walk across the road from Euston underground and train stations and about 5 minutes drive from King's Cross, St Pancras.It is extremely good value for money taking into account the location. I would definitely stay there again.The staff are extremely friendly - every single one of them greeted us with a smile; they were not stuffy and uptight.The rooms were clean and comfortable; and the bathrooms were good quality.The only &quot;bad&quot; thing I have to say is that the rooms are small; but if your only spending a one or two nights in London this shouldn't be a problem. If your spending more time in the hotel you may find the small size of the room a problem. We had no problems with noise.There is a car park at Euston station or you can park on the road beside the hotel (it's free overnight, but between 8:30 and 1:30pm you have to put money in the meter - and obviously it is quite expensive since it's London)We were very impressed.	
Dec 24 2007 	Great Hotel	Great Hotel, excellent location, Room was great	
Dec 15 2007 	Good and Bad	Stayed one Friday night having booked via a deal offered by a well known UK supermarket. The Good: Couldn't fault the friendliness of the staff, size, comfort or cleanliness of the room. Hotel is in a good location and the bar was comfortable and appealing.The Bad: If it wasn't for the fact that I had effectively paid one quarter of the superior room rate (£216) and were only staying one night, I would have asked to move rooms (from room 229) due to the noise disruption from an airconditioning unit(s) outside the room. The constant, loud buzzing was not dulled by the single glazing. The hotel is pleasant and the staff an asset but it is questionable as to whether it can be considered 4 star. Some of the decor (carpets, paintwork) require attention. That said, I would recommend it if you can get any sort of decent discount.	
Nov 30 2007 	Very good hotel friendly staff spotlessly clean throughout.	Just returned back from a weekend at the Hilton Euston and have to say I was extremely impressed and would certainly stay here again.I booked the break direct with the hotel on their website. I chose the deluxe room with a meal option that included both Breakfast and dinner.On checking in reception was very friendly and our room was ready despite the fact we were far earlier than the check in time.The bedroom (room 204) was spotlessly clean, with a huge bed (heaven to sleep on) and very modern interior, there were three large windows letting in plenty of light over looking the main street. I was very impressed with the selection of magazines left in the room as well as bottled water and the usual tea/coffee tray.We ate two dinners in the restaurant and found the food to be superb, on the second day the helpful staff even opened the restaurant 15 minutes early so that we could have another meal before our train home. There is a set 3 course menu available for £19.95 should you not have dinner included in your stay. Breakfast was excellent and one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had which such an extensive selection.We used the hotel bar on two occasions and found the prices to be reasonable for London, a good wine with dinner was approx £20.50 a bottle.Very good hotel, friendly staff, spotlessly clean throughout and only 5 minute walk from Euston station.	
Nov 26 2007 	Very nice hotel	We had a great stay at Hilton Euston. Whilst I attended a few meetings, my wife enjoyed the hotel, the fitness centre and other facilities. Great staff, for once we got what one can call personal service in a London Hotel. We stayed in a good size double room - great stay, will come back	
Nov 22 2007 	You can do much better in London	Just spend a night at the Hilton London Euston. On the plus side we had a meal in the restaurant where the food was very good if a bit overpriced. However, the reception staff were not very welcoming and it almost seemed as if it was an imposition to have to deal with you. The room was pretty tired in decor terms with a view of the restaurant. Overall, even for a short business stay you can do much better in London for the nightly prices charged.	
Nov 22 2007 	An average hotel but needs to improve service!	I stayed here for one night in November as I was attending a business dinner very close by. The hotel is located near Euston station and St. Pancras and King's Cross are not far either. A good location if you need to be near any of these stations. The check-in process took a while and the lady who served just did the bare minimum. She wasn't smiling, she didn't welcome me to the hotel or offer any extras even when I have a Gold card with Hilton. She was meant to check something with Customer Services for me and call me to advise. However, I never heard from her, I had to go to see her to find out what was going on. The hotel itself was OK, nothing special but nothing too bad either. I had a ground floor room that was fairly nice, a bit small but all the furniture was in a good working order. I didn't use the facilities or even drink or eat at the hotel. They had a bar area that looked OK.	
Nov 21 2007 	Avoid and watch your Bill!	I booked in to the Hilton London Euston as a last minute thing and really wish I hadn't now. I booked a standard single room through the Hilton website and got a confirmed non-smoking room. When I checked in at the hotel, however, I was in a smoking room which smelt musty. After 20 minutes of complaining to the front desk I was eventually moved into a twin room (non-smoking) which was far better.To be fair to the hotel, after this initial hiccup I was able to get a relaxing night's sleep without too much bother...although whilst I was settling down I was disturbed by quite a lot of corridor noise.In the morning I checked out at 6am to get a flight from Heathrow. Upon examining my bill, I noticed that I'd been charged a different rate for the room than I had been told during my reservation. This took 30 minutes of discussion with the front desk staff (and me getting my laptop out to show the reservation details I'd been emailed by Hilton) before a manager was called to resolve the issue.Overall, the location of this hotel is good. But the staff seriously let it down. There are many good Hilton hotels in London, and I don't think I'll be visiting the Hilton London Euston again anytime soon.	
Nov 20 2007	Not impressed! Not good value for money!	What a disappointment. I always thought Hilton was synonymous with luxury! I booked this hotel through Tesco Deals Vouchers for £197. I asked for a twin room for myself and my daughter but despite booking many months before the arrival date, was informed that there wasn't one available. The room was tiny and matched the so called double bed! The heating/air con didn't work properly and the walls were paper thin. The bath was quite high and slippery and without the aid of a bath rail made getting in and out very precarious. However the room was very clean and breakfast acceptable but nothing to write home about. I had to run around looking for knives, bowls etc. as the staff didn't seem to be very organised.The positive side to this hotel is that it is very well located and particularly the proximity to Euston Station which is only a short walk away.I can only say I am very glad I didn't pay the £197 out of my own pocket as I feel that would have been a complete rip-off.	
Oct 22 2007 	Little to complain about	Booked via Teletext (TV Ads) on the internet. Paid £269 for 2 nights B&amp;B plus dinner on first night, for 2 adults and 2 kids. Excellent dinner ( although bottle of mediocre white wine , 2 soft drinks and bottle of water cost £27, but hey, it's central London!), and excellent breakfast with very attentive and friendly staff, cheers Vincenzo!Room was fine, clean bathroom(and shower curtain!), clean sheets and modern decor. Have to admit, paintwork was tired and 'scuffed' looking, and definate remnants of previous smokers in the room. 11yr old son had apparently 'accidently' found an 'adult movie' on the room tv, but staff on desk at checkout were happy to deduct £11 for same!Same 11 yr old also forgot to take his backpack with Nintendo DS plus a good £100 worth of games, plus set of keys and odds and ends. Housekeeping staff very kindly (and honestly) forwarded it on to my home address.Fantastic for Euston Station and connection on Original Bus Tour.....jeeze...wish we could afford to stay in London for 2 weeks to do it justice. Big Ben is just sooo stunnin!All in all, we were happy with what we got for our money!Ellen Pearson	
Oct 15 2007 	nice size rooms easy access to Euston station	This hotel really gets some mixed reviews, I almost didn't stay here becasue of that. I'm glad I went for the convience though.  My daughter and I were departing on a Train out of euston station on a weekday am with luggage. So easy access to the station was important. We moved hotels and booked one night at the Hilton Euston Personally I thought it was great. The staff was efficient, friendly and attentive. The rooms were large by London standards and the beds were very comfortable. Nice size clean good bathroom.Convienent to Euston station and also an easy walk from Russell Sq on the picidilly line. We attended a play that evening so we took the picidilly down to conent garden and came back that evening on the nothern line from Licester SQ to Euston station.The morning we left for our train it was raining and we were at the train station so quickly we barely got wet!This is simply a good hotel in a good location with reasonable size and comfortable rooms! I slept well and enjoyed my short stay that is why I've given it an excellent rating!	
Oct 14 2007 	Convenient but needs a revamp	The hotel is in a very convenient location, just opposite Euston Station. We had a triple room, and it was not a cheap deal, and we all agreed that we expected something a little more special for the price and from the brand. However, it was totally mediocre, bland and boring. The breakfast was fine, the room was OK, but nothing to write home about. I have seen in other reviews that a number of people have been getting £50 deals. That's very cheap for central London, and they bagged a bargain, considering that Gower Street B&amp;Bs are close to that price. I would certainly not complain if I had a room at this hotel for £50! The staff were very nice, but the place itself could do with a re-vamp.	
Oct 2 2007 	Just about OK for the price	My son booked this for one night on laterooms.com for £50, which was a bargain for the location. I would concur with several other reviewers who have commented that it would most certainly not have been acceptable at anything like the full price. A twin room was booked  they gave us a double. My son and I last shared a double bed when he was about two years old, and hes a bit bigger now. To be fair, they grudgingly changed it after implying that it was his fault. The replacement room was a bit bigger and had a window that opened onto the gym! Not wishing to feel like voyeurs or goldfish we left the blinds closed. Another result of not having an external wall was poor mobile telephone reception. The shower was probably the best feature. Breakfast was not included (unsurprisingly at the price), so we declined the warmed-up egg and bacon selection at £15 a head in favour of a short walk to the excellent Sunrise Café in nearby Caledonian Road for one of the best Full English I have had in a long time at £5 each. For £50 Id stay again just for the convenient location, but this is really not Hilton standard.	
Sep 23 2007 	Enjoyed Hilton Euston	My wife and I stayed at the London Hilton Euston Sept. 6, 2007 for 5 nights. I booked it online on Hilton's website in January 2007 for 108 pounds per night which included tax and breakfast. The location was convenient to Euston Station and we took the tube everywhere we went so I don't know anything about the neighborhood. I don't think there were any restaurants close by. The room was excellent and the A/C worked great. This allowed me to keep the windows closed so I didn't have to listen to street noise. The concierge was helpful when I booked a driver to Heathrow at the end of the trip. The breakfast was excellent. They had fried and scrambled eggs and lots of sausage, fruit, bread, cereal, etc. Great orange juice. Best room I've ever had in London. They had an exercise room which looked nice but I didn't use it. They also had a nice restaurant but I never ate there. They had an iron and a nice TV which got good reception. They had a computer desk downstairs where you could use the internet for a fee and they also had wireless access but I never used either. It's not a 5 star hotel but it is a great deal at 108 pounds a night.	
Sep 4 2007 	VERY DISAPPOINTED	So i only paid 50pounds for one night and 60 pounds or another, irrespective of this - as this sort of price for a central london hotel is very good - but this was the HILTON and this was quite frankly disgusting - even at this price - this is the kind of single room u get in those terrible hotels around Paddington. VERY VERY SMALL - not comfortable to be in - VERY PISSED OFF - didnt have the energy to question the hotel about this - there should be certain standards about sizes of hotel rooms.I booked this room from Laterooms.com and thought i had got a wonderfful bargain as the price for a night after I had stayed went back up to 190pounds - im not sure if this was true - or a clever ploy by the Hilton to get rid of rooms that they certainly couldnt sell or give to anyone other than those who only pay a bagain rate (therefore could not complain)But i would have made a big problem if i had paid 190 a nightOther things about the hotel were fine - lounge area - seemed to be a nice dining area - and also the breakfast area.Excellent location - (bloomsbury area - close to british museum - Eurostar - Covent GArden etc) but i needed a good comfortable room	
Aug 28 2007 	Not hilton standard	we booked our room through last minuted.com and paid £50, and while this represented good value for money at our price I must warn you that if you pay full price I would be very much aggrieved, the rooms were small the walls were unbelievably thin the windows were not double glazed so all in all the room was one of the nosiest places I have ever stayed in and thats including hostels.But on the good side the rooms were very clean and the hotel is really centrally located, the check in staff was also really nice.To sum this up this hotel is defeniatlly not hilton standard, more travel lodge with nicer stuff and a gym.	
Aug 27 2007 	London's Worst Hilton?	This hotel has not improved since I was there last in April. It remains dated and in need of a major facelift. The only improvement is that the lobby no longer has a strong smell of tobacco smoke since the law has changed to ban smoking in all hotels in England. The staff (and the hotel is understaffed) do their best but many have English as a second language and have heavy accents so is difficult to be understood there often. The room was small, smelly, had stained carpets, noisy and had nothing positive really. As an hhonors diamond member I did not even get a comp bottle of water. The Air Con did not work properly and was noisy.I walked by the side of the hotel and saw rats running around the staff smoking area outside the breakfast kitchen. That was disgusting. This is a dreadful hilton and an embarrasment to the chain. The Metropole and Paddington Hiltons are excellent. I plan to never stay in this dump again. If the company send me there I will definitely arrange an alternative place to stay myself.	
Aug 18 2007 	okay -- good value	- carpets need updating- breakfast was the same with little variation- internet wired is so expensive / use wireless and save- double room is good size - nice fitness center- bar is decent / good help- a/c could be better- inconsistent cleaning ( people seem okay)- great central location for business and near the british museum- close to euston train/underground station- stayed for 14+ days- decent price	
Aug 17 2007 	Just OK	I booked one night at this hotel through lastminute.com as a top secret hotel so only paid £50 - i think the normal rate is £115 and i WOULDNT have paid that much for it. The room was tiny and there was barely enough room for the furniture let alone for me and my boyfriend. It was also really hot and the adjustable AC didn't really seem to be working. I couldn't get the plug to come up in the bathroom and the pole holding the curtain fell down. On the plus side the bed was really comfy and there was a kettle for tea and coffee along with 2 biscuits...but that's all i can really say! The location is great and a 2 minute walk away from Euston station.But i wouldn't necessarily stay here again......Not impressed....	
Aug 16 2007 	Could be improved	My partner and I booked a Delux room at this Hilton. we found the staff to be very good,however I wouldn't call the room delux. The bin in the room still had 2 used cotton ear buds in it. The room wasn't exactly spacious. The T.V channels were not exactly tuned in correctly e.g Sky sports1 was Sports2 etc. The beds were very comfortable and clean,our room overlooked the rear of the hotel so it was peaceful.The bar/restaurant were good as well and the staff were polite and heplful.I probably would not stay at this Hilton again.	
Aug 12 2007 	Convenient location good service	This hotel turned out to be better than I expected. While it is not in the center of action, it is conveniently located to the Euston rail and tube station, which means that the rest of London is easily accessible via the tube. Kings Cross station is not very far, either. The fabulous British Museum is within easy walking distance. Our hotel room was clean and comfortable and had plenty of room for luggage, etc. Hotel staff very helpful with our luggage and airport transportation. Breakfast was good and plentiful. I would definitely stay here again.	
Aug 1 2007 	Loved the hotel didn't love the room	We booked a night at the Hilton as it was such a good deal online and was actually cheaper than a taxi home to west London after a night in central London. We did have a little difficulty finding it as the directions provided by the hotel were difficult to understand because of the thick accents of the staff, but our fault for not bringing Sat Nav! The hotel itself is grand and impressive looking and the staff very helpful. We were allocated a smoking room, not a problem as we are smokers, but the room really smelt strongly of cigarettes to the point it was incredibly unpleasant. The room itself had to have been the smallest hotel room I have ever been in, there was just about room for two people. Many of the fixtures where also shabby and tired looking. It was as if the room was in another hotel as the rest was so nice. It served our purpose but not sure we would stay there again.	
Jul 24 2007 	Wonderful	Amazing place- absolute Central London in a quiet side street, lovely people at reception, wonderful room with fluffy pillows and duvet, extremely comfortable large double bed, power shower, sat tv, free robe and slippers, complimentary use of gym and sauna, newspapers in the morning, lovely breakfast with freshly squeezed orange juice- all for 50 Euros per room per night! Can't believe we got such a good deal (laterooms). It was so lovely to sink into such a nice bed at the end of a long day shopping and sightseeing. Would love to stay there again.	
Jul 24 2007 	Great Location Great Price	Book the hotel through laterooms.com for great value prices. Stayed there a Saturday night with a friend for only Stg£86. Hotel is only 2 minutes away from Euston Tube Station and therefore great access to anywhere in Central London...and it's only 2 stations away from Camden Town (great pubs/bars and best markets). Our room was very clean and spacious enough. Only thing I would do if I would stay for more than one night is to request a room on the upper floor as our room was literally with a view into the restaurant (strange I know). But since we were out and about for the two days we didn't mind this. Again for £86/125 it was definitely great value for money!	
Jul 19 2007 	Not bad but not great either . . . . a beige hotel (?)	LOCATIONVery convenient for public transport. Walking distance to tube and British rail stations - Euston (closest) also Kings Cross/St Pancras (bit of a hike with luggage). Rooms facing Woburn Place can be a little noisy (sirens etc), but nothing too bad.ROOMAccom. for 2 adults, 2 children. Very large room, equipped with all the standard features. King size bed - yay! Double size sofa bed for the kids, which was already made and set up when we arrived. Excellent bathroom with good freebie toiletries. 4 bottles of water were provided (ice machine in the hallway). Internet connection was a little tricky and time consuming. STAFFReception staff were very friendly and helpful, unfortunately no porter was there to assist us up the entry stairs with our luggage (not a huge issue, but I guess you expect it at a Hilton).OVERALLWell located hotel, spacious room and great bathroom. Can't comment on the food as we ate out. The following two nights we stayed around the corner at the Novotel Euston (as Hilton was booked). This turned out to be a bonus as the Novotel offered MUCH better value for money, and a room better suited for a family. I know we only stayed a night, but overall it was a fairly impersonal and non-descript hotel. It was reasonable value and the location and room size were a bonus.	
Jul 2 2007 	I don't believe this is a hilton	I always read the reviews on this site before I book a hotel. The only reason we booked anyway is because my uncle was coming to London from the U.S. for a conference and this is where he booked. I warned my Fiancee that the reveiws for this hotel were awful but we didn't have a choice if we wanted to see my family (we only went for 1 day).If we had booked a 3 star no name boutique hotel in London, this hotel would have been fine. BUT, we booked a HILTON (for 159GBPs a night) There are things we have come to expect with HIlton and None of these things were at this hotel...As a Gold Hilton member we have come to expect a bottle of water in the room or breakfast or interent provided when there is no executive lounge. We were offered nothing.The room was tiny and not that clean. The carpet was old and dinggy. The window would not stay open. The bed was pushed against the wall. A bed pushed against a wall in a hotel room, personnally grosses me out - I'm sure they do not was the wall where other bodies/people of slept all night. ICK. The room did not have a hair dryer, lotion, a mini-bar (although it did have the fridge so we could by our own things and put them there). There was also no safe. And no top sheet on the bed. To conecct to the internet was ridiculously priced around 25-30 GBP for 24 hours.There were also coffee/tea making things in the room. That was the only thing the room did have!The other thing that really grossed me out was we went back up to the room to grab something when the maid was cleanning the bathroom. I whittnessed her &quot;cleanning&quot; (really just rinsing out) the glasses &amp; coffee mugs just with her hand under water. No soap. Not very sanitary. We were checking out that day and the room should have been more throughouly clean for the next person.The hotel staff didn't seem very friendly or helpful. The conceierge is also the bell hop is also the person checking you in... I'd say they are a bit under staffed. This was not the &quot;hilton experience&quot; we have grown to love and be loyal to. We were VERY disappointed in everything about this hotel.	
Jun 23 2007 	No problems with Euston Hilton	We booked two rooms at the Euston Hilton from June 7 - 13 and again on June 17-19 and we experienced no problems at all. I used Hilton Honors point and booked a King Deluxe with an extra cot for my daughter. The room was on the second floor and was very quite. We never heard sirens or church bells. The room was an excellant size and the bathroom was LARGE, and not just by European standards either! The mini-fridge was empty, so you could store your own drinks or food. There was also a device for warming water and a selection of teas and coffees. We had the continental breakfast given to us as an upgrade and it was more than adequate. There was cereal, fresh fruit, juices, coffee, milk, bread, waffles, and even eggs, sausage, bacon/ham. This is normally pretty expensive, so we really appreciated the upgrade. The location of the hotel was great as well. If you walk out the hotel and turn to the left, it takes you to Euston Station where you can catch a train or the underground using the Northern or Victoria lines. The station also has a small grocery store, a money exchange place, restaurants, a tourists booth, and a Boots (like a small CVS). If you turn right at the front door, you can fnd an internet cafe called Rex's. Pretty handy when you need to print out your plane boarding passes. They charge 1.99 for twenty minutes or the cost of a coffee and 20 pence per copy. Also down this way is the British Museum; it's about a ten minute walk or you can take the tube to the Russell Street station. Our other room was a twin guest room. It was smaller than our room and on the side of the hotel where the traffic and church bells could sometimes be heard. This didn't seem to bother them, so it wasn't a problem. When I mentioned I wanted quite rooms when we checked in, the receptionist said they were aware of the noise complaints and even mentioned this website! He said they were trying to get permission to install better windows, but that it was a challenge since the hotel is a historically registered building and they had strict guidelines they had to follow. They only problems we had at this hotel was that the hand-held shower device kept falling out of its holder and the hotel tried to charge us 24 pounds to store our luggage for the four days we went to Paris. I mentioned I was a silver card holder and thought this was one of our benefits and he let us store the luggage for free. This was great since hauling large pieces of luggage to another country would have been a nightmare. Overall, our experience with the staff was great. We didn't eat at the restaurand or use the gym, so I can't comment on them, but we did use the lounge, and it was nice and effecient. My last parting advice, don't be concerned about this hotel, it was pretty nice, even compared to the category 6 Paris Hilton we stayed at during this trip.	
May 10 2007	Average - which means not bad	I think some of the other reviews are a little harsh. This hotel is very cheap for a Hilton; I paid £125, including breakfast. The area is fine and the staff friendly enough. Sure, it's not the Metropole, but you pay twice as much there. However, I wish they'd shut the church bells up overnight ...	
May 7 2007 	good 4* hotel	A good vaue 4* hotel close to mainline stations of Euston and Kings Cross/St Pancras. We had a delux room which was a good size for a family with a massive bed for us and a comfy sofa bed for the children. The sofa bed was made up which is not the case in other places I have stayed. We paid £129 a night for 2 nights and this included dinner on the first night and breakafast both mornings. Dinner was great and they had a good healthy kids menu as well. The waitress, Hull (i think that is what she was called) was lovely with our children. Breakfast was good - buffet style with fruit, croissant, cooked etc.Only downside was the sirens as this hotel is close to a fire station. The bells seemed to stop when we went to sleep!	
Apr 25 2007 	An average Hilton stay	Stayed at the Hilton Euston for one night, mainly choosing the property for its excellent location near Euston train station. I arrived earlier than the standard check-in time and was surprised to be able to go to my room, definitely a plus point! I was allocated a single room on the first floor which overlooked the road. The room was standard Hilton decor with a single bed (pretty comfortable). The bathroom was spacious and had a high standard of decor with a powerful shower and good water pressure. When I went to sleep I did find that the window insulation was not too good and the traffic noise was quite substantial.The next morning I went down to have breakfast and found I had to queue for about 5 minutes before being able to be seated. The quality of food served for breakfast was very good, although the serving staff seemed to be so busy that it was hard to get their attention and order hot beverages.In conclusion I probably would stay here again if I needed to be close to the station. However if I was returning to visit central London then i'd probably choose somewhere else.	
Apr 18 2007 	One of the worst I've stayed in	I was running a project in London and needed a place for the team so chose the Hilton Euston. As a hilton honours member, this seemed like a good choiceOn arrival I was given a room that was on the first floor and along the main road, there is no double or seondary glazing so the noise from the road was incredible. The single room was also strangley shaped more like a storage room with things pushed against the wall just to fit it in. I immediately asked to be moved and was given another room on the third floor just off the main road. The room was again very small and the noise only slightly better. I managed 2 - 3 hours sleep after listening to the traffic, binmen, bell chimes, bathroom noise. I complained and was offered a complimentary breakfast (something I'd already paid for) Customer service I found was poor and the food in the evening was OK I guess (I've eaten worse)All in all, I would not stay in this hotel again even if I really wanted the points. The idea of a hotel is to rest/sleep. If this was my only choice of hotel, I'd rather travel the 300 odd miles back home than to stay there again.	
Apr 18 2007 	Basic hotel	I stayed here on business for 3 days. On the positive side, the hotelwas clean and the staff friendly. However, I would agree with previous comments on this hotel. It needs a facelift!! It is not as a good as other hiltons. The main problem with this hotel is the noise. The hotel has old fashioned sash windows which do not block any of the outside traffic noise. There are also Church bells ringinguntil about 11pm. I think there are better hotels in London - I would not return.	
Apr 12 2007 	Don't bother	Don't bother staying here...save your money.I've read other reviews about how poor this hotel is and I agree with them wholeheartedly.The staff are clueless. If you do stay here and ask any of the staff anything, please double-check it as I've stayed here several times and I'm still waiting on a complimentary newspaper....This is like a training ground for hotel employees.For the money, go somewhere else.	
Apr 10 2007 	A good 3 star hotel	The hotel is rated as a 4 star but it should be a 3 star - clean, good location, decent sized rooms but very bland - no pictures on the walls - similar to a travelodge. We expected a 'Hilton' to be a bit nicer. The floorboards are VERY thin and you can hear the people upstairs as well as the cleaners - have never experienced this in a hotel before.	
Apr 4 2007 	Good very nice hotel but noisy...	I do not understand many of the reviews listed on this site, but maybe it has something to do with the recent renovations that hilton has been doing to this hotel. I visited many hiltons,in different country's, there is a huge difference witht the Euston Hilton if you compare the hotel with Hilton Brussels or the Paris Hilton for instance. The room (Deluxe room) was nice and big,bigger than exprected in London or maybe I was just lucky that we got this big room. The dinner was excellent value and quality, the Woburn dining place is very chique and elegant and a really nice restaurant. The breakfast room seems also to be renovated and is also nice,the breakfast cannot be compared with the normal hilton breakfast in their 5* hotels. The only negative that we experienced were bad matrasses and the windows let all the sound in. If this would been renovated this hotel is definiately worth a stay and a excellent choice in London.	
Apr 2 2007 	when the bells toll	Booked a standard double for myself and girlfriend , room was very clean and tidy with mini fridge iron ironing board tea and coffee ect, the room was classed as a double but the bed was pushed up against a side wall so there was no room to walk around the bed or side clothes draws ect, although we only used the hotel as 1 night stay in London we was put on the 2nd floor overlooking the main road , the traffic could be heard and was even very busy at 3 am in the morning, there is a church nearby and the sound of bells every hour didn't help, the Hilton needs to fix double glazing ASAP to all rooms facing the road as the noise got rather loud at times,so my advice would be to ask for a non facing road room,£60 was a fair price for London we didn't use the bar or breakfast room so cant comment.	
Mar 6 2007 	Good Location	I got a great deal on laterooms for 1 night at the Hilton Euston (£60 for a twin room) which is unbelievably reasonable for a hotel in Central London. The rooms themselves are nothing special (and expensive if you pay full price), although they are comfortable, clean and have great beds which is all you really need for a base. The bathroom was spotless with a good shower. The only issue I had was with the air conditioning which didn't appear to work very well and the room was roasting through the night - really, really warm even at the beginning of March. The staff were fine and the location was great - 5 minute walk from Euston, 10 mins from King's Cross and 10 mins from the Bristish Museum. I would stay again but not for full price!	
Feb 19 2007 	Good business hotel	Driving to this hotel my taxi driver warned me I was staying at the worst Hilton in London! Fortunately he was wrong. The hotel is in a good location with very attentive front desk staff.I was upgraded to a deluxe room at the front of the hotel. There was quite a lot of traffic noise but it wasn't intrusive. The room was large and clean, the only problem was that the AC didn't seem to be working properly - it was 27C during the night and the windows didnt stay open.The bar was full and lots of smokers so went into the restaurant which was very impressive to look at and the food and service were both good. Breakfast is served downstairs and there is a reasonable selection of hot and cold food.The concierge wouldn't hail a taxi for me so we ended up walking down the road in the pouring rain to find a taxiOverall a very good business hotel	
Feb 5 2007 	Much better than Expected	After booking this hotel and then reading some of the reviews on this site I must admit I was scared. I'd booked it for a romantic weekend with my hubby and I kept talking it down to him so than we wouldn't be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised.The hotel is centrally located and only a 5 minute walk to the British Museum. The room was clean and the decor pleasant. I really loved having a street view and hearing the church bells in the morning- although hearing the bells is some people's idea of a absolute nightmare.I would definitely recommend this hotel.	
Feb 5 2007 	Average in a good way	Only stayed one night but had no problems. My third floor room at the back was a reasonable size and looked like most provincial Hiltons. Room was warm but the window opened and noise wasn't a factor. Decent sized bathroom with ok shower.Breakfast was the usual Hilton buffet selection with a wide range of everything. My rate including full English but if yours doesn't then don't worry as their are plenty of cold cuts, fruit, juices etc to sastify most appetites.The staff that I was in contact with were friendly enough although I noticed a concierge struggle with the English tongue when talking to a Japanese couple.For a one night stay at £92, the Hilton Euston did it's job.	
Jan 5 2007 	Shabby but adequate	As a Diamond Hilton Honors member I was upgraded to a superior/executive room. Well, if that was the best they had to offer I dread to think what the standard rooms must be like! Furniture looked like it belonged in a budget hotel and the upholstery on the chairs was extremely dirty. On the plus side, the room was large and the staff very helpful.	
Dec 21 2006 	ideal base near to kings cross	This hotel was perfectly adequate for a short stay to visit London. We went to see a Sound of Music, and this was handy to Kings Cross and The Palladium. Loved the nearby church bells, and our family room was a great size. Restaurant, though, was on the chilly side. Bar was nice and cosy, however. Buffet dinner was okay, but was included in a fairly competitive rate, so can't complain. The Italian reasuarant, Prezzo, up towards the main road ,was a better choice for a n evening out with young children. Nothing flash, but a good base, if that's all you need for reasonable cost.	
Dec 10 2006 	Not much to say	There isn't much to say, there's just nothing special at all. Great location, staff didn't seem to be happy but they were effiicient. Room was very small with cheap ugly furniture. Was more like a budget hotel. Not what you would expect from a Hilton.	
Dec 4 2006 	never again	My relatives booked a 2 night stay direct with the hotel but could not travel due to ill health, so my wife and I took their place. However, when I read the reviews on TRIPADVISOR I was concerned to say the least.Because of the TRIPADVISOR reviews, I decided to ring the hotel on the morning of arrival to say I was worried about the bed sizes. I was politely upgraded to king size deluxe room... free of charge. On arrival the change was all in order and the room was just right and also in a quiet part of hotel (still heard fire sirens though).However everything else about the stay was unpleasant. The breakfast catering staff were lethargic and the breakfast room is grotty and too small for the hotel size (long queues both mornings). We had 1 evening meal in the restaurant which was poor. Slow service, resulted in 2 cold soup starters which had to be returned. More slow service for main dish and slower still for dessert. We will not be returning.	
Nov 14 2006 	The smallest room in the world !	Of the hundreds of rooms I stay in a year.........this was the smallest ever.Despite paying £165 this was not really worth the money. The bed was a single miniscule mattress.Spent most of the night tring to stay on the bed while sweating in the heat without an efficient air-con unit (not normally a problem in london in November), and if you opened the window the noise from the street was unbearable 24hrs a day....so no sleep for me !!The laptop broadband in-room connection didn't work at all, but the £15 was charged to my room bill which I had to ask to be removed.Although the bathroom was spotless.No complimentary newspaper outside my room in the morning......I would not stay again unless I booked a suite at a good price....Ithe only bonus was that I got Hiltion points	
Nov 10 2006 	You Can Do Better	Medicore hotel with awful staff. With the exception of the concierge (who was actually quite good) the entire staff seemed to have no clue. They must use the place as a training ground for other Hiltons. The breakfast was bad. The building is old and creaky. Decent location. None of our cab drivers knew the hotel existed. For the price, I am sure you can do better in London.	
Oct 28 2006 	Wouldn't stay here again	Used my Hilton HHonors points to book this stay and wouldn't stay here again.Cons: -Not a great area of town, no really good resturaunts within a block or so, had to walk all around to find somewhere to eat. -First room we were given had 2 twin beds (when we specified one bed) and it was a smoking room (on the smoking floor) when we'd requested non-smoking.-Were moved to the only other room choice they had available, a VERY small room (about 1/2 the size of previous room) with a double bed overlooking the front street. We slept in this room only one night until something else opened up. The traffic noise from outside was terrible as there is some kind of fire station nearby and we heard sirens 2 or 3 times that evening. -Concierge closed at 5 pm so when we were trying to figure out what show to see in the evening and where the theaters were we were out of luck-Bar was near the front door so we had to walk through a haze of smoke anytime we left the hotel.-Breakfast was outrageously expensive 11 GBP for the cold stuff, 15 GBP for the hot buffet and wasn't that great. It wasn't included in the room price.Pros:-The third room (the one the pictures are of) was lovely and we stayed their the last two nights. -Walking distance to 3 tube stations and British Museum-Manager and hotel staff were very helpful in providing assitance in moving rooms and also helped me with a special request when I needed to use a printer and allowed me to use their front desk computer. They also were very accomadating in refunding my stay cost after my points certificate was late in getting to me.Summary: For Hilton HHonors members it was ranked as a 4 star but has been upgraded to a 5 star, but it definately is not worth the 5 star, and only made a 4 star because of it's location (in London city limits). Great staff, but the inconvienences made it not worth it to go back. We also stayed in the Thistle Marble Arch and I wish we'd stayed there the whole time. Would be a good hotel for a business traveler (as long as you aren't in one of the outside rooms), but not for a vacationer.	
Oct 22 2006 	Does the job...	We had stayed here 18 months ago so knew it was in a good location.The room was good,very clean and nicely presented.The bathroom was brand new and spotless .We stayed for two nights with dinner on the first night. Although it is very convenient to eat in the hotel, the meal was disappointing.Inclusive dinner guests eat in the basement (no windows) restaurant which is not nearly as nice as the other restaurant at the hotel. As soon as we entered the dining room the smell reminded us of school dinners and the main meals were being kept under a hot plate. We waited for some fresh Chicken to arrive but by then,the fish that my Sister wanted was very dry and past its best. Not really what you expect from a Hilton and we were also shocked that a small glass of wine cost £6.25!Breakfast however,was very good,plently of choice and good service. We stayed at the back of the hotel and it was very quiet,no view ,but being quiet suited us better.Finally,our prepared bill stated that we owed double the amount we really did.It was easily sorted out at Reception but it was a pain to have to get them to see to it .Incidently,we remember this happening the last time we stayed at this Hilton,so check your bill!	
Oct 8 2006 	poor for hilton	great location....now i am done with the positives. Staff didn't have a clue what they were doing, i'm sure the hilton just went into the street and asked anyone passing if they wanted to stand behind a desk for a few hours looking gaunt. The room was ok at best, however, at 11.45 they turned the electricity off to get us out! Also left a book and a charger in the room which they said wasn't found and trust me, the room wasn't big enough to lose a penny let alone a hardback book. Stayed at the hilton at dubai creek and was one of the most advanced hotels i have ever had the pleasure of staying at, shame i trusted them again.	
Oct 3 2006 	Great Location for Euston Station and The Underground network	I chose this hotel for its close proximity to London Euston Railway Station, it is literally just across the road from the Station entrance, from getting off my train it took less than 5 minutes to be walking into the hotel reception area. I was allocated room 332, this was a complimentary upgrade for being an Hilton Honors member, the room was very comfortable and clean with tea &amp; coffee making facilities. The only gripe was that the room overlooked another property that was undergoing refurbishment and work on the property began promptly at 8am, this didn't bother me because I was up by 730am for business meetings that day, but if you were staying for a relaxing break the work noise would be disturbing! My room rate included Breakfast, I chose to have this delivered to my room, the Breakfast card which you fill in said there was a charge of £3 to have Breakfast delivered to your room, however, this was never added to my bill, if it had I would have been happy to pay it, the convenience of having breakfast in your room really is superb. All staff seemed extremely helpful, especially Robert the South African reception Manager. The Bar area was clean and tidy with a very pleasant bartender. The location of the hotel is ideal for London Euston Station which provides train services to the Midlands, North West of England, Cumbria and West Scotland, the Underground's Northern and Victoria Lines are also within Euston Station so you can literally get all over London with great ease. Overall this is a good hotel in a convenient location, I was lucky to get an upgraded room and therefore I can't comment about the standard rooms. Book a stay here and I'm sure you will enjoy it, I certainly will be returning for my next trip to London!	
Sep 30 2006 	Great value with Saga	Parked cheaply underground 200yds away. Room superb. Deal superb with Saga (got to be over 50!). Breakfast was a disaster...the staff seemed poorly managed/TRAINED with tables uncleared and staff walking past them CARRYING NOTHING. The 'manager' didn't do a thing...result long queues outside. I tipped the waiting staff at the bar following good bar service in the evening only to find a 'service charge' added to my final bill. When I challenged this at checkout it was quickly removed. Staff were friendly and helpful. CHECK THE BILL CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGED TWICE FOR SERVICE	
Sep 17 2006 	Great place to stay in London	We managed to get a special deal at 69 pounds per night from the Hilton website. For it's price, it exceeded our expectations.It is close to 2 underground stations (&lt; 3 mins walk) and the British Museum. For most of our days in London, we even managed to take leisurely walks all the way to Oxford Street, soaking in the sights etc...The rooms were clean and had everything we needed to make our stay extremely comfortable. The service here was great and the staff even helped to arrange a day-tour to Bath for us. We loved this place and will definitely stay here again if we return to London.	
Aug 13 2006	Definitely not going there again	I stayed there last month for 4 nights and I must say that the hotel was disappointing. Checking-in was quick but the fake, forceful smiles of the receptionists and the concierge could be a total put off. The room was small and filled with bulky furniture placed at random without any sense of aesthetics. The room also overlooked the gym... which was not that bad as there wasn't any outside noise but the room was indeed dim. I was also later mailed a bill from the hotel informing me of a charge for goods consumed from the mini bar on the day of departure - goods that I had obviously not consumed. So either I was being charged for consumption by later customers or... the hotel staff. Who knows. Internet at £15 for 24h is a complete rip-off especially in England where I know I can get a £15 *monthly* deal for my broadband. Checking out was as quick as checking in. Luckily. Thanks goodness - wasn't I in a hurry to leave. It does seem to me that the only thing that was nice was the breakfast but I doubt it'll be enough to bring me back to Hilton London Euston again.	
Aug 6 2006 	More like a Hilton Garden Inn in quality	Perfectly acceptable and comfortable. Very convenient location. My main issue was that the hotel charges 15 pounds (almost $29!)/day for internet access. That's a bit steep.	
Jul 30 2006	Convenient Location to Euston Station but	The Hilton Hotel, Euston Station was convenient to the train and tube stations but, the beds were nothing that I would expect from a Hilton. You could run your hand along the top of the mattress and feel the springs. Obviously, when lying on the mattress it was worse. Upon check-in, our family was offered two single rooms. I had reserved for four people through Hotwire. Their information showed two guests. It took a little time to overcome the manager's objection to the rate we were given, but we were sufficiently satisfied with the number of beds in a very short amount of time. The size of the rooms was adequate as was the bathroom. The concierge was very helpful. The rooms were quiet, too. Overall, it was a good stay, but get rid of the beds!	
Jul 12 2006	Ejoyable stay at the Hilton Euston	We stayed at this hotel June 27th-June 30th. We were a little worried after reading some reviews complaining of noise, size of beds etcThe Hotel does have a small lobby that leads into a comfortable sitting area next to the bar. The staff was warm and friendly and held our bags until our room was ready, well before the afternoon check-in time.The room was furnished nicely and was very clean. Towels and marble bathroom were immaculate. Our room was in the back of the hotel and VERY QUIET! Beds were a little smaller than we are accustomed to, but very comfortable.The conceirge was extremely helpful in giving theatre information, and best ways to get around town.The breakfasts were great and the dining area very nice. Lots of variety of breakfast foods to choose from.Alli in all a charming hotel in a good area.	
Jul 3 2006	Dissapointment	I booked this hotel through a last minute web offer when the hotel was known as the Euston Plaza. On arrival, the receptionist tried to charge me the full rack rate and wasn't happy when I handed my booking confirmation over to him. He left us waiting for 30 minutes and when he returned, apologised and said because of the misunderstanding we would be upgraded to a superior room. I can only imagine what the original one would have been like if the room we were given was superior! Very small, shabby furniture, dirty and towels with dried blood on them. I do hope that as this hotel has now changed its name that the standards have improved but I will not be returning to find out.	
Jun 24 2006 	More pros than cons	With other trip advisors reviews with various opinions about the hotel in mind I was interested to see how the hotel stay would turn out for my daughter and myself . We stayed two nights in June.Upon arrival at 6.30pm the room was not ready...But it would take only ten minutes the front desk promised and it did. We were given free drinks in the bar and a bottle of wine as compensation. We were also as Hilton gold members invited for snacks and drinks the following night by the hotel management. However due to business we were not able to to drop in but it was a nice guesture I think. The room was average size and did not feel small. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Soap and hairproducts from Crabtree Evelyne. The room however faced- the interior of the gym! So no daylight! Don' t pick that one if you are a bit Claustrophobic! But the hotel ofcourse had other rooms that faced the street or back yard. However the advantage was that there was no noice at all. As we only used the hotel room to sleep in I must say it was one of the most quiet rooms I have stayed in when in London. In our package first nights´ dinner was included. The menue had numerous dishes to choose from and the choices we picked were good. The meal was served in the lovely conservatory. Breakfast too was plentiful with everything from fruits to haggis. It was served in a breakfast room in the basement without no windows so it was a bit on the dull side.The staff at front desk was very helpful and friendly considering the large number of people coming and going. The concierge also provided us with the information we needed and the pre orderedHilton transport to Heathrow arrived prompt.So overall it was a good stay and I can consider staying there again.	
May 29 2006	Okay Hotel	We stayed here for one night and I'm glad it wasn't any longer!!The room was very nice and clean, the bed was tiny!! and it was right up against the wall on one side so if I wanted to get out before my boyfriend I had to either climb out the bottom or clamber over him.Our room faced the main road which was noisy all night long!! and hard to get to sleep!! We could also hear banging from the room above us , we are still baffled to what they were doing for over 2 hours and from 7.30am he next morning!!The park across the road from the hotel was always full of drunk homeless people too!We would not stay here again	
May 20 2006	Very nice hotel	We stayed at the Euston Hilton from May 8th to the 16th 2006 and found it much nicer than the reviews gave it. We stayed in room 303. While it was plainly decorated with standard hotel furnishings it was very clean and spacious. We had a king size bed with a roll out bed from the sofa. The bathroom was all brand new and was very clean. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful whenever we needed anything, especially Maxsson the conciege. The breakfast was wonderful and served in a very nice dining area. Nothing like one of the reviews stated that it was served in a &quot;basement&quot;. We would not hestitate to stay in this hotel again.	
Apr 18 2006	Better Options for the Money	The main trouble with this hotel is the fact it is flying under the Hilton Name. I too am a Hilton Gold member and stay in Hiltons all over the world. As a group Hilton should have a minimum standard, and not fall below it. This hotel was disappointing. On arrival the outside looked very promising. I liked the building and the location very much. The building is very old fashioned, with lovely window boxes cascading flowers. It is beautifully lit at night. Once inside the building I was instantly disappointed, the reception area is a soulless box. The actual desk is set to one side, they can't see the comings and goings from the door, making it less secure. There is a desk, set for a concierge perhaps, but I never ever saw anyone sitting there.The reception staff were friendly, young and foreign, mainly trainees. Our room wasn't ready but they took the suitcase in and we went off to enjoy our day.When we saw our room, I was very disappointed, the furnishings are very 70's travel lodge. We had room 331 at the back of the hotel, which was the only upgrade we were given as gold members. The bed turned out to be 2 zipped together, with a very uncomfortable join up the middle, which ruled out getting cosy for any length of time!There were tea/coffee making facilities in the room, a TV, Safe and Iron Ironing board. A mini bar was provided, but it was empty. The bathroom had nice toiletries but was on the small side.Our room was clean enough, only that. Our towels were dirty with something encrusted on one of them, we had to get them changed, and the toilet was dirty around the hinges, the shower curtain wasn't the cleanest either. Our bedroom curtain wasn't attached to the rail all the way across, and the air conditioning was no use at all, the room was a stuffy 21.5 oC, despite our constant efforts to reduce the temperature.The corridors have very squeaky floor boards, and have a shabby look, you can also hear people in their rooms, if they don't go to bed when you do!ON THE PLUS SIDE..... it wasn't all bad, the hotel was quiet at the back, no road noise, and I liked hearing the church bells on easter morning. It is easy walking distance to Euston or Kings Cross. BUT I think there are far better hotels for the money, this one is only OK, nothing special, just somewhere to sleep. I would not consider going there again. For me, it represented poor value for money.	
Mar 31 2006	Immaculately Clean and Very Friendly Hotel	Less than a 10 minute walk from Kings Cross, we found this hotel perfect for our two night stay in London (20th/21st March). The staff couldn't have been more polite or helpful when we checked in. Our room overlooked the beautiful St Pancras church (the bells only added to the charm of the location and didn't disturb us one bit!). The room was immaculately clean with a modern decor...as was all of the hotel. We walked down into Covent Garden a couple of times (about 20 mins), but also used the Russell Square tube station to take us further into the City. The hotel held our luggage from check out in the morning until our train at 7pm. We wouldn't hesitate to stop here on our next visit to London.	
Mar 29 2006	High's 	I am Blind, so at the time of booking, I requested a ground/first floor room. I followed this up with a phone call two days before my stay. Both times I was told my request was noted and I had been allocated a ground floor room. Surprise, surprise, on checking in, I was given a second floor room! This was finally sorted and I was given a 1st floor room!Room was clean and adequately equiped. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food on first night was good and served hot.Decided to eat in the main restaurant on the Saturday night - BIG MISTAKE!!! The restaurant wasn't busy but the service was diabolical! Took an hour for the waiter to take our order and bring our meal. Then another hour to get our sweet. When we complained to the waiter, he said it was the chef's fault!!!!!The exterior noise was as you would expect in any city.One thing the hotel need to fix is the broken step in the downstairs restaurant - very dangerous to sighted as well as blind residents. Access in the main restaurant is not good for blind/visually impaired as there are stupid pillars blocking movement. The hotel should also make it clear when booking that the inclusive Friday meal is not in the main restaurant but in the downstairs restaurant. I would stay here again but wouldn't eat in the main restaurant.	
Mar 21 2006	Not as bad as everyone says	I stayed at this hotel twice, even after reading all the horrible reviews - I am a Hilton Gold member and wanted to be close to King's Cross Station. I was very nervous about this place after reading the reviews but I really believe that the reviews are a tad harsh. Yes, the area can be loud and there is a church across the road but the staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are very clean and well maintained (but the floors are a little creeky). As far as the price goes - all of London is frightfully expensive so I don't think this hotel is out of line with the area. The location is great in regards to the proximity to Euston Station. It made getting around very easy.I had no problems with check in or check out - in fact, the front desk held on to my bags for me after checkout until my train left.On my first stay I wasn't upgraded (I received a fresh fruit plate instead) and my room was quite small and over looked Woburn Place. I heard the some of the noise people were commenting about but I guess that comes with a big city. On my second stay I was upgraded to a larger room in the back where it was very quiet. This hotel isn't the most wonderful place I have ever stayed but it doesn't deserve all of the horrible things that have been said.	
Mar 6 2006	Not to Hilton standard	My husband &amp; I stayed recently at the Euston Hilton. Having stayed at many Hiltons worldwide we expected the standard Hilton quality and not the poor quality of this hotel. What a 'Cinderella' it is, having seen better days, it is badly in need of refurbishment to cure the shabby internal appearance, squeaking floorboards everywhere, poor A/C, etc. The final insult was the toilet seat falling off. As Hilton Honors gold members we expected at least bottled water and robes, which are normally in our rooms on arrival, but this time we had to contact reception twice before they appeared.Our included dinner on the first night was served in the windowless basement. The starter, a tepid vol-au-vent took 40 minutes to arrive and the whole meal, served school dinner style, took almost three hours, even though the restaurant was less than half full. We couldn't face this the second night and ate out.The buffet breakfast was nothing like the quality of a 'Hilton Breakfast.' The congealed fried eggs under the heating lamps were most offputting as were the tinned mushrooms floating in a greasy grey liquid. Even the muffins and pastries were stale. We did not expect to have to make our own tea at breakfast with a teabag in a beaker. Whatever happened to their teapots?As a UK citizen I feel ashamed that tourists from other countries will return home with a bad impression of London based on their stay at this hotel.	
Feb 21 2006	forget this	We arrived at 7.50pm friday 17/2 and tried to check in but were told that our room wasn't ready because some people &quot;overstayed&quot;, so we were asked to wait for 20 minutes. We were very tired after a long flight, so when we showed our disappointment (after all the room was supposed to be ours from 2pm) we were given a free dinner for that evening. Finally the room was ready only at 8.30pm.The night was terrible, the a/c wasn't working properly and it was horribly hot in the room despite we set the temperature to - 4°C, we didn't sleep much, we couldn't even open the window because it wouldn't stay open: the room was very noisy as well because it faced the main road so we heard sirens and cars all night through.The following day, after my boyfriend complained over and over, we were told that they would have fixed the a/c and window during the day. At our arrival in the evening the situation was the same; only after calling reception we were finally re-roomed because the technical person could not fix the problem of the airco (we would have appreciated some honesty, rather than having to ask them again). So we left our packed suitcases in the &quot;hell room&quot; and went out. When we came back the new room was fine and located in the back of the hotel, therefore quiet as well.Despite the location I do not advise this hotel to anybody.	
Feb 17 2006 	Too much noise	This hotel is next to the Euston main road and all the time you get to hear police car sirens, as this is a very busy road. The only pleasant sound was of the church bells, of the parish church opposite it. Porter services are not very good too!	
Feb 14 2006	Muck up with room	Well, we arrived just after 3 and were told that no twin rooms were available (even though we had booked one in December) as there was a large group with a late checkout that day. We were offered a double room to use until a twin room became available which was a complete pain. However the man on reception did offer a complimentary breakfast for myself and my friend because of the inconvenience. We were told that as soon as a twin room became available our bags would be moved (which was a pain as it meant we had to make sure our bags were all packed up)We went off to the London Eye and came back a couple of hours later to find that we still didn't have a twin room, we were heading out just over an hour later and advised we needed our room then, at 1830 (after 1 1/2 hours wait) we called to be advised that the room would be available within 20 mins, we were due to go out so advised this wasn't acceptable and then two mins later a room &quot;became&quot; available. Moan over, the rooms were of a good standard, beds comfy with lovely soft duvets and pillows. The toiletries were nice and everything was very clean. However, our room was in a weird location (rm 82), looking out of the window we had a view of the restaurant and people in the restaurant could see us too!!! Very bizarre. Would stay here again due to the location and cleanliness.	
Dec 31 2005	noisy!	This hotel is very close to Euston Station (5 mins walk). The main problem with the hotel is that the rooms offer little noise protection. it probably didnt help that we had a room right next to the lift. The lift noise was bearable but the floorboards on the corridors were extremely creaky and you could hear every person who walks by your room. You could also hear walking from the room above. I would certainly recommend a room on the top floor which would solve some of these problems. On the plus side, the rooms are clean, a reasonable size and the food both breakfast and dinner were good. Mamma Mia made up for the lack of sleep. A Fantastic show which i would recommend to anyone!	
Dec 5 2005	Ok Hotel	We have recently stayed at the Hilton Euston, nice and handy for the station and public transport. Hotel was quite nicely decorated. We were told on arrival check in was 3pm our confirmation said 2pm. We also had booked a quad deluxe room and were supposed to have dressings gowns.We called for them and was told they didn't have any.!!!All in all quite a nice room, but beware we faced opposite a church and the bells rang constantly early Sunday am not good after a night on the town!!!!Good hotel for transport links.	
Nov 29 2005	give this a miss	listen very carefully when you book in , as there is no info in rooms,the doorman greeted us at the door (he was leaning against the wall and grunted as we pulled our luggage through}. check in was quick. room good but the rooms at the front of the hotel are very noisy, we stayed on a inclusive first night meal deal, which i have done at other hiltons on many occasions, there is a lovely restaurant on site with a lovey menu, but inclusive guests do not use this , we were taken down below stairs to a small windowless room, were we were given choice of three main courses. beef , chicken and fish in sauce , two veg ang rice served school dinner style. yukon the second night we needed a quick pre theatre meal it was suggested we take the buffet beef,f ish or chicken yuk as they could not say how long the food on the bar menu would take, we ate out.i did ask reception to call us a cab but we were told to stand outside and flag one down.used quick check out very efficient.give this a miss	
Nov 22 2005 	Very average	Spent 4 nights here on a business trip in October. As a previous reviewer noted, it's not very big and the cab driver had never heard of it and had to be given the full address. I'm not sure what happened to the promised &quot;Swedish designs featuring a light wood decor&quot; but it was nowhere in evidence on the 2nd floor which featured swirly carpets in the corridors and bedrooms straight from central casting. The breakfast was mediocre and served in a windowless dining room. The staff were pleasant and the location is fine. However if you want to stay in the Euston area I think the Novotel on Euston Road is better value - the rooms are bigger and the public areas much more spacious.	
Oct 23 2005 	Enjoyable business trip	Hilton Euston - Great stay - really enjoyed this hotel, great service and excellent staff, one feel more like a guest than a room number here.Fantastic restaurants, both for breakfast and the conservatory one.... Will come back	
Oct 20 2005	Overpriced tiny noisy room	Room decoration was ok, but boy was the room tiny even by london standards. The room didnt even have a bath which wasnt mentioned when booking/checking in. If this room was cheap i wouldnt have minded, however this cost 190gbp. staff were friendly. theres certainly much better around for that amount of money. room was the nosiest i've ever stayed in - appeared to be right above where they dump the bottles from the bar - no double glazing, and a church right opposite with chiming bells every 15 mins. Not my best nights sleep ever. Breakfast was ok, however these days for whats a 3/4 star hotel i really do not believe its acceptable to provide water down orange juice. The tea was awful too.	
Oct 11 2005	good for the money	Me and two friends stayed three days from 7th-10th October. This is a fairly small hotel, and quite easy to miss unless you know where you are going. Check in was efficient, and the staff friendly. Our rooms were on the first floor, which had to be changed, as this is a non-smoking floor (we are all smokers). These rooms however, were very small and traffic easily heard. We were then given rooms on the 4th floor. One of my friends had a corner room, which was bigger tham those we originally had. My other friend had an adjoining room, which again was quite small, as with my room down the corridoor, with a view of the courtyard. The rooms themselves were all basic in design, but funtional. Breakfast was good, with a wide selection to choose from. The only real fault here is that the staff could have been a little more attentive. Euston station is a few minutes down the road, where you can get some food and drink from m&amp;s if you don't fancy eating from the hotel.In conclsion, an ok hotel, and as previous reviewers have said, you get what you're paying for.	
Oct 10 2005 	Very nice!	I have no complaints about the hotel at all, everything was just fine, and actually for a London hotel great. The location was very convinient for me having a meeting near by. It also quite close to the British Museum and even within a walking distance from the downtown (if you like walking, that is).The check-in was rapid, and I loved the express check-out: the bill was slipped under my door, I signed it and just left it at the reception, which took 15 seconds. The staff was all the time friendly and welcoming.The breakfeast was good, and the breakfeast room (as well the bar and the lobby) nicely decorated in a contemporary fashion.I stayed in a superior room with &quot;view&quot; to a small court yard. The room was not too big, actually to my eyes more of a normal size, but it wasn't small either (yes, the rooms are usually very small in London hotels). It too was decorated in a modern and practical way.The bed was big, and there was a duvet, which I found to be to hot (and the air conditioning was not very effective; I must admit that the idea of having a too hot duvet and then use air conditioning at the fist place is a bit strange...). A church bell could be heard every now and then, if the window was open.The bathroom was spacious, very modern and clean.So this hotel took care of its business smoothly, and with this single experience I could recommend it. If you are looking for something else than just a practical and convinient hotel (luxury, romantic settings etc.), this is not for you.	
Sep 17 2005	Nice Hotel for the Money	We stayed here for 7 days in the first week of September. The first night was not a good start the bed was uncomfortable and the Sirens going by kept us up most of the night (we had booked a double room off of the web site and no upgrades available when we checked in). Being a Hilton HHonors member I went to the front desk the next morning and was upgraded to a king size room. They even moved our luggage while we were out exploring the city! The upgraded room was spacious and could not hear a peep outside of our room! The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was even larger and best of all AC. Rest of stay was great. Only other issue was misbilling but when I brought it to their attention upon check out and should them my receipt from the web site they change the rate. The hotel is a block away from Euston Station on the Northern Line and several stops from Trafalgar Square (we walked it in 15 minutes). Make sure you bring receipts like this with you on your journey! Over all the hotel was a great experience for the money. This hotel was half of all the other hotels I was looking at.	
Sep 14 2005	Wonderful Hotel with Hilton Name good early rates	August 6 - 9, 2005 Hilton Euston Bloomburys, LondonWe booked in April 2005 at a $65 GBP room rate for August 2005.Called a paid upfront no cancellation rate.The service was very good at reception and meals, room had a large double bed , was modern , clean and bathroom was newly re-done with granite counters and lots of room overall.We were on the second floor overlooking Wolburn street, windows are older so noise would come through but not a lot. Main buses go down this road.Breakfast is continental or full English Breakfast, about $12GBP or 16GBP for one or the other , selection though in either case is fantastic. One could fill up for the day. Meals in Bar or loungs are also well prepared but as in London the price will surprise you, one adjusts.British Museum and Tube are all in walking distance, Internet access is available and computers, shops during week are in walking distance around so you can buy a drink, sandwich elsewhere or return to Hotel.We will return to this hotel and recommend to our friends.Rob Holloway	
Sep 9 2005	A pretty good deal	My wife and I stayed here for a week long vacation in June of 2005. It was a reward stay because of HHonors. We arrived at the hotel at 8:00am and they did not have a room ready (not that we expected them to), but they took our bags and we went to explore. We returned around noon and were able to get a room. It was small by American standards, but okay. The bed was lumpy in places. We were upgraded the next day to a very large room with a very comfortable bed. This room faced a side street, which was quieter. Great access to Euston Station, which makes getting around very easy. But there are few places to eat nearby. The staff was very nice and accomodating, they let me use the internet for free for a few minutes. Overall a good experience.This hotel has not always been a Hilton, but it is up to the standards that you would expect from them.	
Aug 17 2005	Mixed Reaction	Stayed here for a week in March 2005. The room was clean and big. Floors are squeaky and we heard every move our friends made who were staying in the room above us. However, generally pleased with the room. The reception staff were mixed -- there is a woman from the US who checked us in and who was very helpful. The rest of reception staff were lukewarm at best. The bar is a pleasant place to relax and has a nice menu but the staff seemed put out that we wanted to order food, that we didn't order alcohol, and that we were even in the bar at all. Made it unpleasant to even go there. Finally, we asked for a reservation on the airport van that the concierge advertised but they &quot;forgot&quot; to make it on time so ordered us a &quot;town car&quot; instead. There were 4 of us with luggage (which we told the porter) but we got a tiny car with a rude driver who got us all crammed in the car and started off before telling us he would charge us 10 pounds more than what the hotel told us because we had &quot;excess luggage.&quot; Not a pleasant experience. So, the stay was mixed but a bit more positive than negative given the generally acceptable room.	
Jul 12 2005	Pretty decent hotel	Overall this was a very nice hotel - they did not have an upgraded room for me (i am gold vip), so they comped me some internet access, which to me was worth more. Room was actually quite nice, very clean, typical hotel room. Bed was nice -- room appeared to be remodeled in the last 5 or so years.There is a firestation across the street and you can hear the fire engine at times during the night. This didnt bother me coming from NYC.The hotel is in a transit area - not many shops, however there is a sainsbury within about a 10 mins walk down euston st.Overall I would say this hotel is worth the stay and not a bad choice whatsoever.	
Jul 6 2005	Pleasantly suprised	We booked this hotel based on the Hilton name and location but were perturbed by the number of negative reviews we subsequently read. However, we found the hotel to be great.Our standard room, which I had telephoned to ask for one at the back, was impeccably clean and very pleasant. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The location for tube and buses is excellent. We had breakfast in bed one day and buffet the next. Both were first rate.Considering the price we paid compared to other hotels offering the same or lesser facilities this was great value for money in London for the quality of hotel.	
Jul 6 2005 	Well done Hilton Euston	I constantly travel in Europe and US. I must say it is one of the best Hiltons I have ever stayed in, here you are not just a room number but a lot of attention to detail and attentive staff. Great rooms, especially the bathrooms. Fantastic Restaurant, really could not find anything wrong here.	
Jun 30 2005	Fine for Weekend Break	Partner &amp; I stayed at Hilton Euston in June for a weekend (Fri &amp; Sat). We had the Hilton Deal Offer 2 nights with full breakfast &amp; dinner included on the first evening (£189). For the deal we had the price &amp; location was fine. Check in was no problem, staff were friendly &amp; helpfull we had a double room on the 4th floor in the corner which was a fairly decent size, the hotel has recently been redecorated so room was clean and the bathroom was modern. Room was on the corner of the hotel, it was bit noisy due to clock tower being opposite and the fire station close by which is situated on a busy set of traffic lights so they have to sound sirens every time they leave the station (which was on a fairly frequent basis). Neither the clock tower or fire station made as much noise throughout the night (probably due to main road not being so busy so fire engines not needing to put sirens on).Our evening meal on the first night was in the restuarnt which is layed out nicely. It was a 3 course meal included in our price, starter &amp; desert you ordered off the menu (which was very enjoyable) and main course was a buffet which taste very nice and the portion sizes good but it could of done with being a little warmer. Restuarnt was not that busy so staff had more time to serve us so the they did rush us a little, we asked for them to come back and take our desert menu after a break from main course. Full Breakfast on both mornings was great. Location: Taxi from Paddington cost us about £12 on the Friday. The Saturday we walked to Oxford St which took about 10 - 15 minutes. There are three tubes stations near so you can access different lines without changing. Euston is the nearer. Sat evening/sun morning (1.30am) we managed to get a night bus back from Lecister Square to the top of Tottenham Court Road and walk back to the hotel without any problems. Think a night bus does go closer to the hotel but we had not looked into this.Overall for what we paid a nice, clean &amp; comfortable hotel.	
Jun 21 2005	maybe 4 stars but of the lowest luminosity	Following the advice of a colleague, I requested a 4 star hotel in Bloomsbury, and this hotel accepted my admittedly modest bid. I don't know how stars are assigned, but Frommer's Sidestep site gives it 2 stars, which is more accurate. It came as a surprise when we were asked to move to another hotel upon arrival, even though we had paid in advance for our full stay. The hotel had overbooked. They found a room for us only after I threatened to call the Priceline hotline. Our room was very small (ca. 9 ft X 12 ft). The double bed was accessible only from one side. The staff was good, and the bathroom was up-to-date. Breakfast was not included, but was available for an additional $30.00 (sic!)/person. In my 50 years of visits to London, this is the first time that a full English breakfast was not part of the room rate. Maybe that is why they so readily accepted my bid? We probably got decent value for the money, considering how expensive London is.	
Jun 20 2005 	Good breakfast good staff bad room	Just stayed one night on business. Good breakfast, but terrible room. On the ground floor. Tiny single room. Road noise. Bells from the local church every half hour! and cigarette smoke from the staff outside my window having a fag break! Would recommend, but ONLY if you have a room on a high floor.	
Jun 12 2005 	Not that good...!!!	If your looking for a good night sleep, good luck. My advice is to make sure you get a room that is not looking onto the front or side of the hotel. The traffic, clock tower and fire station will wake you up easily. The food is much to be desired, salad with everything and not very hot. The rooms are basic, very unlike the hilton and my opinion is that its not worth the money that they charge. Service is slow in the resaturant, but Staff are very efficient though and do try there best.	
May 24 2005	Very Nice	Stayed here in the middle of May 2005. It was very nice. My room was very sunny and large. It was very clean. Breakfast was excellent and the staff was very nice. The only possible thing that was bad was the dinner at the resturaunt and even that was not terrible.	
May 18 2005	A good choice	A smaller-scale Hilton handily placed for Euston, the University, Bloomsbury &amp; the British Museum, the Euston Hilton offers pleasant rooms and a decent restaurant at cheaper rates than most other Hiltons in London. Rooms overlooking the internal courtyard dont have much of a view, but they are uncommonly quiet for hotel rooms in the centre of London. All-in-all, the Euston Hilton is a good choice.	
May 16 2005	Three Star Hotel for a Three Star Price	This is not a four star property. It was rated in my guide book as a 2 star, but I would say it is more worthy of 3 stars.The name Hilton Euston might first conjure up something a little grander in your mind, but the location should give you a clue that this is not going to be on a par with the Hilton Park Lane. Overseas visitors can be forgiven for their ignorance on this. Prices in North America are also generally lower, than here. While this is no bargain hotel, it offers a fair deal with the reassurance of a reputable brand name.I often post a review on Trip Advisor to vent my anger when I feel I have an axe to grind, because I have felt I have not had what I paid for, but my motivation today is more positive. There are many rip offs in London and so I am pleased to have found a place to stay that offers some degree of value. It also helps my karma account!I had a room on the 3rd floor, spotlessly clean, simply yet functionally furnished. The single bed might not to have been to everyone's taste, but it was a business trip and I was also spending most of my time out of the room with my son who is a student in London, So for me, the trappings of a more upscale property were not required. I did not miss them, or expect them, and I certainly did not pay for them.The bathroom was modern, and the room had air conditioning, something that many hotels in this property's league and price are without, in the U.K., not least London.Breakfast was the usual standard fare, but the service was adequate, even though the staff were very busy.I paid £109.00 including VAT for the room, through Hilton's reservations service. I notice that other reviewers have commented that their rates excluded taxes, but it seems to me that it is somewhat foolish not to have checked this first, as I do when I travel, particularly when I am visiting a foreign country. Las Vegas hotels add all sorts of extras, even energy taxes, so I think we do pretty well in the U.K. not be misleading.Would I stay here again? Possibly, the noise from the traffic was a little discomforting to a sound night's sleep, but I feel I got a fair deal, and I think it is a case of getting what you pay for.Other hotels I have used for these trips have not been as good, but then I paid about £90.00...........and had to put up with cramped rooms, sagging beds, dated furnshings, and staff that could not speak English!	
May 4 2005	not exactly 4 star...	Stayed here for 5 nights. Wasn't awful, but not exactly what you'd expect from a four star hotel - creaking floorboards in all rooms to wake you throughout the night as fellow guests return/get up, old flattened pillows (and three phone calls to housekeeping and a trip to reception to get more than two), lumpy mattress, no minibar (!) or robe/slippers etc. Obviously was re-furbished in a hurry as there were yellow paint marks all over the door frames/ceiling etc. Front desk staff needed help operating the fax machine, which they overcharge for using.I preferred it when it was the Euston Plaza - it might have been a little bit more shabby then , but at least it was honest and you didn't have this overbearing feeling of it trying to be something it just isn't.Still, it was pretty cheap, and you can't say that often in London.	
Apr 5 2005	Never judge a hotel by its architecture	This beautifully restored Regency building looks very attractive and is conveniently situated for Euston Station, numerous Underground and bus routes, and lots of wonderful pubs and restaurants at low prices beyond the tourist gaze. I once lived in the area and have passed it frequently since then, and have always thought I'd like to stay there someday. The opportunity arose in the summer of 2003 when we were in London for one night for the theatre; and my travel agent found us a good deal. We paid less than half the 180 pounds b and b rate, and we were promised a King room. Sadly, disappointment and poor service accompanied our day in London; thank god, the play was worth it.Our King room turned out to be the smallest room in the house, in the attic where servants once slept! The room was so small that the double bed was against the wall, and in spite of there being air conditioning, it never worked; and it just so happened to be one of those oppressive August days when it would have been nice. In spite of our agent telling us that breakfast was included, it wasn't. The maitre d' loudly went through the list of rooms, so that the whole restaurant could hear, to say that our room was not included; but for 14 pounds each we could have breakfast. I loudly told him I knew the area well enough to find a cheaper and much better breakfast! When finally paying the night's stay, we were politely informed that the room rate did not include VAT. I am used to sales taxes being added in North America, but never have I had to pay VAT on top of a charge in Britain. Well, there is always a first, I guess. Even with VAT I told myself that the 'room' was still a bargain. If I had been paying double, I could have broken down into hotel rage! My later letter of complaint drew the typical bland form letter that word processors are famous for which levelled the blame at the North American tour company that my agent booked through. Thank you for the opportunity of using this type of media to register my complaint, and to tell fellow travellers to be cautious and read reviews beforehand.	
Mar 18 2005 	Surprisingly stylish	Given its fairly recent change of hands and the fact that it's in London--possibly the worst hotel city in the developed world--I wasn't expecting all that much from this Hilton. So I was very pleasantly surprised when our room turned out to be completely up-to-date, with brand new fixtures and a sparkling, even stylish looking bathroom. Our room was very quiet, possibly because it faced a courtyard rather than the street, and the bed very comfortable. The staff, moreover, were uniformly pleasant and well trained--housekeepers wishing us &quot;good morning&quot; in sequence as we passed down the hallway, desk clerks happy to make change or give directions. The front desk staff is young and still a little unfamiliar with the computer system--it took three of them to figure out how to check me in on a free reservation using Hilton points--but it was all handled in good humor. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but it was very beautiful, with a fairly priced menu and an attractive, atrium-like setting. In all, this was a very positive experience. Visitors who want to be in Bloomsbury or near the businesses or railway stations on Euston Road (Euston and St. Pancras) will find this location especially handy.	
Feb 15 2005	Best hotel for the price	Stayed over the Valentines weekend and booked through Superbreak so got a much better deal than if I'd booked through the hotel directly.Rooms were excellent, clean and modern, nice big TV, good size bathroom, tasteful decor, nothing like the pictures on Hilton's website which put me off.Service was impeccable, reception staff, so often the bain of my life with their indifference and damn right rudeness were the complete opposite at this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble.Negative points were that I'd booked a double room but they gave us a twin with the beds butted up against each other, which made for a sore back in the morning. We moved to another room where the floorboards were squeaky! Breakfast room was a bit on the small side but the food was ok, just the standard fare.Overall very good.	
Jan 17 2005	Too noisy to sleep	My company regularly use the Hilton Euston (as it is now called) so this was my second visit. The first time I stayed everything was fine I had a clean large room on one of the upper floors. This time however, I was given a street facing room which was very noisy. The windows were shut but I could clearly hear the traffic, street noise and chimes of the local church every few minutes. Can honestly say I had the worst nights sleep of my life there.Breakfast was good, but the room service left alot to be desired. Trying to have a conversation with a person who has very little grasp of English to order your meal late at night is frustrating. When the food came (tuna mayo sandwiches) it was sloppy and some of the napkins had been used.I will probably end up staying there again on business (as have no choice) but will definitely ensure I have a back room!!	
Jan 11 2005	Excellent break.	Just returned from two nights staying in this hotel. The accommodation was excellent and for a London hotel, lived up to 4 star expectations. Our room had a small balcony, a good sized and comfortable double bed and was spotlessly clean. Continental breakfast was included in the price and again this was excellent with a varied choice of foods. (Cooked breakfast is extra). The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is only a few minutes walk from Euston Station. We would definitely stay in this hotel again. For sightseeing, the bus tours have a stop just up the road from the hotel which again is very convenient. The only negative comments we would make are that there is only one lift currently in operation, there was some traffic noise in our room from passing ambulance, police sirens etc. and the reception staff seemed unsure wether or not we had eaten a cooked breakfast but decided to charge us anyway. This matter was quickly rectified by them when we checked the bill.	
Dec 8 2004	Changed its name to Hilton Euston; Not Great Not Bad	Had a pleasant one night stay here but wouldn't seek this hotel out again. I checked in late on a rainy November Saturday, left early on a rainy Sunday morning and all I wanted was a good, safe, clean place to sleep which I got.Check-in was efficient as was check out. I didn't eat the restaurant or bar.Went with Hilton because it's a known brand and rate on the web site was decent. I stayed at the Euston Hilton because the London Hilton Kensington, which is even cheaper, was sold out.As a single traveler paying a single rate I was not surprised when I got put in an extremely small room with a single bed. Not the first time this has happened to me in London so I wasn't miffed or surprised. Just not the kind of thing that has happened to me ever in the U.S, getting placed in a tiny room because you're solo, but has happened to me in Italy, France and the U.K.	
Nov 7 2004	OK but watch out	We stayed at the hotel a few days before the conversion to Hilton. The rooms are OK, the rest of the hotel was being refurbished. Watch out - the night front desk tries to substitute its own expensive car service over regular cabs, bills for newspapers never received and did not 'recall' our discounted room rates for the weekend nights, upon checkout. The location is just a little bit too far from everything to really be convenient.	
Oct 13 2004	Wonderful 4 star hotel excellent location great beds!!!!	I stayed at the Euston Plaza end of September 2004. The location is just perfect! Walking distance from Covent Garden and Camden city, the British museum is just around the corner and if you choose to use the metro, Euston station is just 3 minutes walk away from the hotel!Concerning the rooms &amp; services, rooms were excellent, very-very clean (trust me, I am very picky), the bathrooms were just super (even the hairdryer was just perfect, didn't use mine!).The only thing not being perfect was the elevator, they had only one working and it took long everytime... And the receptionists were efficient, but not really giving you personal attention, which I understand &amp; accept from a 4 star hotel.	
Aug 10 2004	Nice and Very close to Euston Station Late July 2004	We had a nice 2 nite stay in London at this hotel. We arrived by train at Euston Station and then walked across the street to the hotel. The hotel was being painted on the outside so the place looked odd with the scaffolds set up. There was no noise. We choose the hotel because it had A/C. We like A/C in areas that could be noisy if we had to keep the windows open. Our room looked down on the hotel restuarant which as not an issue. The wireless internet cost was very affordable. The breakfast was okay because we choose not to pay extra for the hot portion. Mario was very help as the Concierge. We simply walked back to Euston Station and took the tube to places we wanted to go. We also took the Big Bus Tour from a pick up point just down the street. We just couldnt get over the cost of everything in London.	
Jul 29 2004	Good Staff Good Location...But Not the Place For A Vacation	I booked the Euston Plaza a day before we were due to stay there, so we weren't expecting the best rooms. But I was pleasantly impressed by the helpfulness of the staff and it was very convenient for where we needed to be that night.Like other reviewers here, we were in a fairly small room on the street side of the hotel. I don't know if they've changed the windows/double glazing or something recently, but you couldn't hear the traffic with the windows closed. The room itself was fairly small (particularly the bath tub) but it was comfortable and big enough for our needs, as we were only staying the one night. Where the hotel really shone for us was the quality and efficiency of the staff. They were some of the nicest and most helpful people we've come across at an English hotel. My partner is disabled and they pretty much saved our night out, so thanks very much from Mark and Sally to the hotel staff, particularly the maintenance man. The room service, too, was very quick (despite the fact that it says 'please allow 20 minutes for room service' in their brochure). Even at 2:30 am, they were fast, pleasant and not at all put out. Also, the bar by the entrance and the terrace bar were very pleasant and the prices, I thought, were pretty good for central London.So, if you are stopping over in London for a night or two, I'd recommend this hotel as a good place to stay. It would work well as a short stay business hotel for European travellers also. However, if you are American and are used to American size hotel rooms and amenities and are coming over to London for a vacation, then this probably isn't the place for you.	
Jul 21 2004	Very Good Value for Money	I booked this hotel purely on reviews from this sight and was not disappointed. I travelled from Edinburgh to Kings Cross and this hotel is ~ 5 minutes walk away from the station and easy to find. The room was small but very clean with lovely bathrooms. I would book it again for business travel as it is so close to trains and tube links.	
May 11 2004 	Super hotel - Great deluxe bathroom facilities	We booked 5 rooms and was very pleasantly surprised. Great big rooms and all rooms had new bathrooms. Staff very nice, except in one of the restaurants, but overall a great weekend stay in London.	
Feb 18 2004	Way off the information superhighway.	not a bad location, fairly centrally located; reasonable price; clean; recently renovated bath. BUT: poor internet connection for businesspeople--kiosk in lobby &amp; &quot;dataport in room&quot; means you're unplugging the phone to jack in.	
Jan 17 2004	Nothing fancy but ok on a budget	I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an average place. We got a great (for London) deal even after the 17.5% tax. Less than half the rack rate. The rooms are pretty small, as to be expected, and the acommodations less than glamorous, but decent and clean by European standards. Staff was pretty rude, but again, as to be expected. The location is convenient to the Euston underground Station and the area is fairly safe at night, as well. Worth it if you get a really cheap rate somehow.p.s. breakfast wasn't included in our rate!	
Jan 13 2004	Bumped	Arrived to find that our super internet rate was apparently too good to be true...we had no room at the inn! We were shipped off to a another hotel around the corner. Made us wonder if they had a racket going on?	
Jan 4 2004	This is what I like!	Well done Euston Plaza, you have great staff and a lovely hotel. Sparkling new bathrooms and furniture in all three rooms we occupied - Great gym even though we only went there once. But most of all we were always welcomed with a smile, wherever we went. Rare, but nice to experience	
Dec 17 2003	We enjoyed our stay	We moved to the Euston from a tourist class hotel in Bayswater that had tiny rooms. We were very comfortable at the Euston. Our room was nicely decorated and fairly large with twin beds and a lovely large bathroom with plenty of shelf space. There was a lot of storage space so that you didn't have to step over your luggage to get around the room. The fold-down ironing board was very convenient. The continental breakfast was decent, but not remarkable. Book the room via the Internet: you'll get much better rates than their posted rack rates. All in all, we were happy at the Euston Plaza for six nights.	
Dec 11 2003	was charged too much	We stayed 4 days in this hotel. The rooms were average and the continental breakfast could have been better but certainly no reason to complain. The location is good, only a short walk to the Euston subway station. The hotel ended up charging us more than we were quoted from lodging.com We paid 114 Pounds a night for a room that was quoted 65 Pounds on our reservation. The hotel was not helpful to resolve this issue.	
Nov 28 2003	Visiting London? Stay at the Euston Plaza Hotel - A great hotel!	What can I write? I travel regularly around both in the US and Europe, this hotel has got some great staff, good large rooms and a solid gym. Try it out yourself!	
Oct 12 2003	Booked this hotel - Got a Great deal	We spend 5 days in August on a Learning Tree training course. Booked a great deal through an internet agency Hoteladvice - Checked in and found our rooms had just been refurbished with very nice bathrooms. We spoke to many of the other delegates and they were staying in hotels without Air-condition and could not sleep etc. So we were very happy with the Euston Plaza. Great rooms, nice friendly staff and great cooling when London is Hot.
