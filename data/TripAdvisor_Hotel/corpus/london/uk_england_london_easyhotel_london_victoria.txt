Oct 23 2009 	BED BUGS AT THIS HOTEL	Will never stay in an EasyHotel again - I have at least 10 bed bug bites - reception staff entirely uninterested.l	
Sep 6 2009 	Small room	If you are planning to stay long in london, then this is not the room you are looking for, its really very small for asian size. But the location make up for it. its walking distance to burmingham palace, near victoria station.	
Aug 9 2009 	Clean well located and cheap but basic	When booking at easyHotel you should know what you expect. We were looking for an affordable accommodation in Central London and we stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel is well located in a good area and close to Victoria station (convenient for connections). The room was basic but clean with a private bathroom. Of course do not expect too much comfort, the rooms are a bit small and some of them have no window but if you are away the whole day and just need a clean place to stay for few nights that's good enough.	
Aug 4 2009 	A good deal- not for a long stay though!	This is exactly what it says on the tin, cheap and no frills- and extras will cost you (e.g television). The hotel is within easy walking distance of Victoria station/tube from which you can pretty much get to anywhere in London. We paid £42 for a small room with a window. The room was tiny, literally the bed was touching all four walls, with a small space to hop into bed. The ensuite was much the same, you could sit on the loo and shower at the same time...if you wanted to of course!The positives of this hotel was of course the price but also the room was incredibly clean, crisp sheets, fresh towels. They even provided soap and shampoo-which i was not expecting!The downside was, even if you book a room with a window (something i paid £5 extra for the luxury) it does not guarantee it will be worth it. Our room was in the basement, so having a window was pretty much pointless as the brick wall directly infront of it blocked out and light we had hoped for. Another real annoyance was the constant air conditioning, which we could not turn off. Be warned, we couldnt open our window, and so we ended up extremely dehydrated from the constant blasting of cold air. Had we stayed for longer I would've spoken to the hotel staff, however we were only there for a short stop over. All in all I would consider staying again, however I would try to iron out the problems before booking again. For the price, and a short stay I couldn't really ask for much more, however I would not even think about staying here for longer than 2 nights!	
Aug 3 2009 	Very good quality budget hotel if you're not interested in frills	I have stayed in some really *really* bad budget hotels in the Victoria railway station area during a three-week trip, but I found this one to be a good mix between price and quality. If you don't mind having a small room without windows, then you can get a good room for a phenomenally low price by London standards. You do have to pay for Internet, TV, and subsequent housekeeping visits (beyond the one from the first check-in), but these are no trouble. I'll be staying here again on future trips to London.	
Aug 2 2009 	indescribably bad	I used to like Easyjet - you know you'll get no fuss or frills but neither will you be belittled and despised as you are when you travel with Ryan Air..........at least that's what I thought. So I booked my Easyhotel online expecting cheap, small, clean, no-nonsense accommodation. What I found was a cupboard and a portaloo in a run down building that resembled something out Taxi Driver. The walls were bright orange. The room was so small it could accommodate nothing other than a bed......nothing, not even a stool and the floor was industrial grade black plastic lino.I have worked most of my life in the hotel business so I tend to be on the side of the operator but this is a piece of brand extension that actually does a lot more harm than Stelios understands. Not only will I never go near one of his hotels again but I have just booked my family on Flybe when I could have used Easyjet.	
Aug 1 2009 	cheap and clean	Stayed for 3 nights with my partner and found the hotel to be extremely clean with very friendly staff.We weren't sure about booking an easyhotel but will happily do so in future. The prices are attractive for Central London, and that usually costs a ridiculous sum of money. It's in a great location, very close to Victoria station. The rooms are small (and the bathrooms tiny!) but for 50 pounds a night we thought it was great value.	
Jul 19 2009 	Just 3 IFs	If you have your clean sheets pillow cases m with you (We asked for new clean sheets but it was not clean at all)If you are planning to stay not MORE than 3 nightsIf you are ready to spend the whole day out and just come back to sleep (I mean you can come back to the hotel just to set down and relax)Then this is a value for money hotel	
Jul 17 2009 	Absolutely avoid this one low cost no value	Climb narrow stairs to an orange painted room the size of a jail cell. Two hooks on the wall to hang clothes. A bathroom the size of what you find on a plane. Extra charge for a room with a window, a tv remote, having the room cleaned, an extra towel, leaving luggage in the lobby while waiting to check in at 1500. You cannot get a refund when you tell the desk that the room in unacceptable and cancel the remaining nights, you get a credit you use or lose in the next twelve months. The additional charges make this room as expensive as rooms far, far better in the neighboorhood	
Jul 10 2009 	It is what it is cheap 	I was only spending one night in London with some friends and I didn't want to spend as much money as them. Just somewhere to crash after a big night out. This was perfect as I was going on holiday the very next day and just wanted to be able to have a shower and then just get up and out. No hanging around no messing - perfect!Chose the location well too as on my last view visits to London I have had problems on the underground at weekends.Also I dont like having to change trains on the underground either. Easyhotel is literally a two minute walk from Victoria Station &amp; the Victoria line was working so everywhere I wanted to go was within easy reach, My friends were staying in Mayfair so one stop down to meet them, we had a night out in Covent Garden, also on the same line and then a few stops up to Kings Cross to get the train to the airport the next day. I studied this and I have definately come to the conclusion that this is the best located out of all the Easyhotels in London for me.The room itself, check-in was quick &amp; easy as was checking out. Room itself was tiny as was the bathroom and I could hear everything from the other rooms. One negative point for me was that I was on my own on a saturday night and there were large groups of young people hanging around outside until very late which could make some people feel uneasy. I just wanted to get back to my room &amp; sleep!Massive plus points for me, Very comfy bed and bedding &amp; the shower, if a little small was great.Minus points I wouldn't have wanted to spend a great deal of time in the room and when I got up I didn't want to hang around I was very glad that I got ready to go out for the evening at my friend's posh Mayfair hotel though as I found the Easyhotel a bit cramped just for me. If I was with my husband it would have been very cumbersome us both getting ready!Taxi fares weren't bad here either. We had such a good night in Covent Garden we ended up missing the last tube and getting a taxi back in the wee small hours from Leicester Square. To give you an idea of fares it cost £15 to drop my friends off in Mayfair and then me off at the Easyhotel.To summarise, If you are on your own and just need somewhere to crash this place is perfect considering I only paid £50 in central London! I'd splash the cash if I was with my husband.	
Jul 6 2009 	Cosy	Cosy is definately one word for the rooms! What the website says is what you get - a basic room, with bed, toilet and shower.The room was clean, the bed was comfy. To be honest, we didnt spend much time in the room - who does in London when theres so much to do, plus we went to see Tina Turner in the O2, so we literally only used the room to sleep.If you are going to book this hotel, what I would advise is to pay the extra £1-00 or whatever it is for a room with a window. The window made a huge difference to us - just to get some natural light in the room. I cant imagine how claustrophobic the rooms without windows must be.All in all, a clean friendly basic no frills hotel. it served a purpouse, and will definately use them again if we go to London for the night, and just need somewhere to get our heads down. Were else can you get a room 2 mins walk from Victoria station at such a low price??!!!	
Jul 3 2009 	Would definitely stay again	Stayed for 3 nights with my partner and found the hotel to be extremely clean with very friendly staff. No breakfast but what can you expect for less than £30 each per night!! The only downside about the room was it's size....it was tiny!!! No room for luggage, just a bed on one side which filled nearly all the space, the rest of the space we used to stand the suitcase up in and a bathroom with shower. It didn't really matter because we had said as long as the room was clean; and it was; then it would be fine. We were on the back so it was very quiet until the noisy neighbours checked in! The walls are thin and we could hear them talking/laughing quite a bit. Even so we would certainly consider staying again.	
Jun 24 2009 	Clever concept	Two and a half square meters of bed, one and a half square meter of bathroom and possibly one square meter to stand up and get dressed. Its simple and its brilliant for the solo explorer who needs just that. Just leave your claustrophobia at home and you will be fine. I have only one wish; please offer free wifi!	
Jun 15 2009 	Does what it says on the tin	We weren't sure about booking an easyhotel but will happily do so in future. The prices are attractive since most of the time we're just looking for somewhere to sleep in London, and that usually costs a ridiculous sum of money. With the bedroom menu that they offer, you know what you're getting. And contrary to my worst fears, the hotel wasn't in some horrible slum; it was in a great location and was clean and tidy throughout. The staff were efficient and helpful (but not five-star luxury smiley, which was fine by us). We had a standard room with no window - absolutely fine, imagine small rooms are not much more than a bed surrounded by four walls. Bed was fine (pillows could have been better), bathroom was one of those pods much like you get in an Ibis, pretty tight but functioned and was really clean, and to my surprise had shampoo and shower gel dispensers. There was no furniture other than the bed, so if you're staying more than one or two nights be prepared to live out of your suitcase. The floor was lino like you get in schools and hospitals - not cosy, but at least clean, and preferable to manky carpet. I could have forgiven them if they hadn't branded the room by painting one wall bright orange, but that's to be expected I suppose. Overall, a decent place to lay your head and grab a shower in the morning, saving some pennies for the train journey and a nice breakfast en route. Wouldn't hesitate to use again, and have booked their Kensington hotel for a few weeks' time.	
Jun 14 2009 	You get what you pay for	Stayed here for 2 nights last month and it is perfect for a few cheap nights in London. It's in a great location, very close to Victoria station. The rooms are small (and the bathrooms tiny!) but for 50 pounds a night we thought it was great value. We were glad we splashed out the extra 5 pounds a night for a window as I think it would have been a bit claustrophobic otherwise and if you have a lot of luggage you might want to get one of the slightly larger rooms. The beds are also small and it's a wee bit noisy so fine for a few nights but perhaps not much longer. However, it was spotlessly clean and the front desk staff were really helpful and friendly. There are lots of restaurants and pubs close by. We went to a Thai place on corner of Tachbrook and Charlwood Streets that was excellent.	
Jun 12 2009 	Great inexpensive place to lay your head near Vic Station *Book Early for discounts*	This is a great place to stay if you are just looking to crash for a night. It is cheaper than a hostel and is private and very close to the train and bus station.	
May 22 2009 	Exactly what it purports to be.	It's small (and I mean TINY), there are no stairs, no window, no elevator, and absolutely no extras. This is exactly what they said it would be on the website. A very clean room to have a good sleep in and to get a hot shower...a very short walk from Victoria. If you're looking for luxury, boy are you looking in the wrong place! But a clean room THAT close to Victoria, $166 US for three nights, in LONDON?! Excellent value. I was barely in the room anyway, so this is just what I needed. Not recommended for those who are claustrophobic; seriously.	
May 21 2009	Clean basic hotel. Great value for money.	Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor and the hotel's website, I decided to risk easyHotel. I was very glad I did. My mum and I were in London for two days to see some shows and were in the hotel for a total of 8 hours, 6 of which we spent sleeping. So it really wasn't worth spending £100+ on a more expensive hotel.On arrival, the receptionist was very friendly and we were given a (standard, with window) room on the ground floor, close to reception (which was handy when we couldn't work out how to make the lights in the room stay on...the nice man on reception told us that the key card needs to be left in the slot next to the door whenever you're in the room or the lights will go off!). The bed was lovely and comfy and the bathroom clean. What more do you really need when you're in the room for such a small amount of time? The only problem for me was that there was nothing to put smaller items (watch, jewellery etc.) on overnight. It was just a bed in a room, no little tables or anything. The hooks on the wall were useful for hanging clothes on though. It would have been nice to have the option of a twin room rather than doubles only, but that is only a small point and we didn't mind sharing for one night.My mum hadn't read the website or reviews so possibly wasn't as prepared as me for just how basic it would be. I had to keep reminding her of how little we paid. I would recommend that everybody who stays in this hotel reads plenty of reviews so as not to get too much of a shock.We agreed after checking out that we would not want to stay for more than 2 or 3 nights but that we would definately return, and have since booked again for the end of May.The pricing seems very fair to me. You pay a small price for a very basic room, but have the option to spend more money on extra towels, pillows, a hired hairdryer, television, to make yourself more comfortable.Give it a try, but go prepared, and remember to bring a sense of humour!	
May 2 2009 	basic cheap and very good!	We booked a basic room without window at the price of around 46 ponds a night per room. We got an attic room, very tiny but clean, good shower, good bed, in fact everything you need in a city like londen! excellent value for money!!!!	
Apr 29 2009 	Cheap and cheerful!	Like the rest of the easy group, the easyhotels seem to do exactly what they say on the tin! As others have said, the rooms are tiny - more like a ship's cabin, and the bathroom is more like an aeroplane loo, but they're clean and comfortable and good value for money. The London Victoria one is in an excellent location - you'd struggle to find anywhere else nearby for the same price! I don't think I'd want to stay in one for a week because the rooms are so small, but for an overnight stay, they're ideal. Worth paying a couple of pounds extra for a room with a window though - I think the ones without windows would get very claustrophobic!	
Apr 21 2009 	God awful!	A friend and i were going to a festival in london, so we needed somewhere cheap to stay, easy hotel seemed to be the right sort of price, and i read reviews and all seemed average, then it was booked.Got to the hotel, as we were checking in there was 2 people that complained about the toilets, and the hotel staff seemed to shift them off until they had dealt with us. Got to the room, oh dear.Literally walk in, confronted with a MASSIVE orange 'easyhotel.com' wall and a double bed.I wanted to walk out straight away, i know it was going to be basic but the room was SOOOO tiny! The toilet is a small door in the wall, and the shower is also in this space, its like a 2 in 1 little cupboard. It was shocking! I've stayed in better hostels than that place!Anyway, expect to pay for extra pillows etc...oh and a remote! They give you a TV in the room but you have to pay for the remote! Haha.The only good thing about this hotel was the location..5 mins walk from victoria station.If you are wary over this hotel, trust me over other reviews, it's really bad!	
Apr 3 2009 	value for money	Excellent hotel in a convenient location . Provide great value for money as you dont pay for extra services that are not needed. Found it very clean . Staff were nice	
Feb 27 2009 	very good value!	i stayed in this easyhotel for 5 nights.room 117.it was just good!you have to pay anything extra such as a remote control for the tv which is 5pounds for 24h(i took the remote with me back to greece though!!!!!!)clean sheets and fresh towels is 1pound each...extra room clean is 10pounds per day....and the wifi connection to your room is 5pounds per hour but you dont have to do that because both pret a manger and starbucks have free wifi zones inside and its absolutely free for 1h and is within 10 minutes walking distance from where you are....very close to victoria station(connection to gatwick airport, london underground and victoria coach station)small rooms good prices though!you can t find these prices in london and in such a central landmark!recomended without doubts but be prepaired for tha stairway because there is no elevator!!!i will definitely stay to this hotel again!	
Feb 20 2009 	couldnt swing a hamster in the rooms never mind a cat	just come back from a 3 night stay at the easyhotel,now obviously you get what you pay for like anything,we were not expecting anything brilliant but they are so small ,and little things seemed so expensive, eg £15 for a late check out is very expensive when you compare it to a premier inn etc,also the tv and internet prices were not very competative.however the rooms and hotel in genaral was very clean and the staff were all friendly,i just think the website needs updating shall we say with more clear pictures (and bigger). also it says the avarage size of the room was 6-7 square metres,but without measureing i would say the room we stayed in was nowhere near that; more like 6-7sq. ft (l.27) on basement floor). privacy isnt an option, you can hear everything in the rooms, including next door flushing the toilet and having a shower. for a one night stay this would be adequate but for anymore it realy is to basic as we were tripping over our suitcase (was lucky we managed to cram all our clothes etc in the one case as there would be no room for 2) and also the bathroom was a little to small, and became completely soaked anytime we had a shower.without going on, i was disappointed with the lack of sound proofing, as each night of my stay i was woken by people in the surrounding rooms and the corridor. something also should be done about the lack of air conditioning in the room, the vents, which neither the staff nor customer had any control over, were simply not effective.	
Feb 8 2009 	was just ok	well ive stayed in an easyhotel b4 (earls court) so knew exactly wot to expect, the room was super small but cheap and functional, for those who have not stayed in one b4 a small room with no window is about the size of 2 double beds together, but has one double bed and a shower toilet pod in there , it was clean altho must be one of the first ones as its getting a bit tatty, (shower pod sealant pealing and that sort of thing) the earls court one is much more fresh, i would say is an apprpriate word, and i feel the staff were bettter at earls court, not that there was anything wrong with them at the victoria, i just felt had anything gone wrong at the victoria they would not have been inclined to of helped, the only other thing i didnt like about it was the lower standards of security, at earls court the main door was locked at all times and need your pass to enter, ect, however after i got back from my night out, about 1 ish, doors here were still open, and a word of warning the walls are not real walls just private partitions you can here everything that goes on, but then ya get proper hotels like that so dont think it should affect ya booking ,the location is good, was only £7 in a taxi from shaftsbury avenue in the west end to hotel at 1am thought that was cheap,the bus train and tube station is just a small walk from the hotel (just at end of road)enjoy your stay in london this is a very cheap way of seeing wot london has to offer, if ya book early a room for £25 more than makes up for all that it lacks	
Feb 6 2009 	You get what you are promissed!	I stayed in EasyHotel Victoria for 3 nights, and I believe that the whole experience is quite honest. Mainly if you read carefuly their website, you know what to wait for. Rooms' describtions are absolutely accurate and they don't lie when they say eg you get 2 hooks to hang your clothes in the room or your room is 6 square metres or whatever they say. It's exactly like that. Room was clean and bed was very comfortable. Dut to rooms' size, I wouldn't advise people with lots of lagages to stay there, and I think that rooms will be better used by a sinlge person than by a couple.Obviously there is not luxury stay. It's a cheap room, that will save you some money and at least will definately be clean.My room was G10 (standard with a window), had a large window facing buildings behind the hotel, and the radiator could be turned on and off from me, so it was practical! If you don't have a computer and want to use the one in reception area, note that they charge GBP 2 for 15 minutes (!) and they don't allow access in sites such as youtube and facebook!!!!	
Jan 8 2009 	Bit of a mixed bag	I stayed at the easyHotel Victoria for 4 nights early January for work. All in all, the hotel experience was perfectly pleasant. I'll join the chorus that the rooms really *are* tiny - which is fine if you are using it as a place to sleep and wash, but not much fun if you fancy spending an evening relaxing in your room.I booked one of the small windowless rooms for £25 a night, which was situated on the lower ground floor in the basement. The check-in staff were friendly and efficient, although the corridor in the basement was a bit musty and smelled of spicy cooking. The room had enough space for a double bed, which you accessed cabin-like through a gap of about 2.5 feet from the main 'room'. There were two plug sockets, two hooks on the wall, and a full length mirror. There was hardly any floor space in the room proper - to open my suitcase I had to stand in the bathroom, and to leave the room I had to store my case on the bed. The bed itself was comfy, and the whole room was clean if a bit grim in an underground bunker/cross channel ferry type of way. Two thin pillows, duvet, sheets and two towels are included, although you pay extra for housekeeping. There was a flat screen TV on the wall with adequate reception, but you pay extra for a handset to watch it (£5 for 24 hours). The bathroom, although tiny, was very efficiently laid out with a toilet, sink and a decent shower, with soap and body wash included and space to store toiletries. Hot water was sporadic, and ensure you close the bathroom door if you don't want to flood your room!My main complaint was the central air. When I arrived it was very cold outside, but in my room it must have been 30c from the hot air blasting out of two vents in the ceiling! After asking for the heating to be turned down twice, I was provided with a desk fan - which wasn't ideal in a room with no surfaces except the bed. 4 hours later, when the heat was making me feel incredibly claustrophobic, I complained and it was turned right down and remained comfortable throughout my stay. The room itself was quiet enough at night, with not much bleed from other rooms and only the rumble of the underground trains below.The main plus point of this hotel - beside the price, which is comparable to a hostel bed - is the location. Close to Victoria Station and tube, and about a minute from a bus stop, it's also in easy walking distance of many restaurants, pubs, shops and a Sainsbury's supermarket. All in all, it's an efficient place to lay your head and store your belongings while you spend much of your time out doing other things, and doesn't pretend to be otherwise.	
Dec 13 2008	Tiny room but good for the experience	I stayed for two nights at easyHotel London Victoria, mainly for the experience of it, after hearing how small the rooms were. So, I intentionally booked a 'small room' (with window, £45 per night).It did not disappoint - in fact the room was even smaller than I expected. The room was literally the size of a double bed, with a bit of space for opening the door and to access the bed. If I had a lot of luggage, I wouldn't have been able to get into the room unless I put my luggage on the bed. I thought it was quite hilarious and took photos for my friends. Some of the walls were orange and so was quite a bit of the bathroom. So if you have a pathological fear of orange colour, this hotel is definitely not for you. The room, including the bathroom) was very clean.Watch out if you are not physically strong and have a heavy bag. There is no lift and stairs are quite steep.Location is pretty good, with Victoria station nearby and with basic shopping facilities (e.g. Sainsbury's) and cafes within a short walking distance.I don't think I could have coped more than two nights there though because of the orange colour and the claustrophobic feeling (even though I booked a room with a window).If you want a cheap accommodation in central London location and don't mind a small, very orange room, it would be a good place to stay. It's also quite fun for the experience of a tiny room and I'd quite happily recommend my friends to try it out for a bit of a laugh as long as they know what they're letting themselves into. I would use again it if just I need a bed for a few hours during transit or planning a late night followed by early departure, at, but personally, I wouldn't use it for a normal hotel stay. Once is an experience and I didn't mind it at all, but I think I prefer to stay at a 'normal sized' hotel with a lift.	
Dec 13 2008 	Budget hotel on a great location	If you're looking for luxury and a spacious room, the Easyhotel Victoria is not for you. But if you're aiming for a clean hotel room with bathroom (really tiny, but with shower and lots of hot water) and a confortable bed on a budget, look no further. I stayed with my boyfriend on room 101 with a window. It faced the back off the building and it was quiet. I usually travel with airplugs, because i'm a light sleeper, but i didn't use them.And everything is like it says on the web page. The room is small and has online two hooks where you can hang close. I think it needs, at least, a little tabble (from ikea, maybe). It had a big mirror, central heating and also a portable heater that we didn't use. We had room to our two bags that rested on the floor and we could move around.When you arrive at the hotel, they give you a card. It's the key to your room and necessary also to activate the lights. You've total freedom. You come and go as you please. In the reception, you have machine with chocolats and other goodies and hot tea and coffee.The hotel is very near victoria station, where you have train (including the gatwick express), tube, bus and taxi. You also have in the station a lot of stores where you can eat, ATM, store to exchange money and even a store where you can place bets on any sports. Before 9.30 the tube is very crowded.Returning to London, most certaintly will use this hotel again. It's central location and price are unbeateble.	
Dec 7 2008 	Budget hotel for short stays	I have lodged at the Easyhotel in Paddington previously, so I knew what to expect when I booked Easyhotel in Victoria. I chose the Victoria hotel since I was travelling by coach. The service is quick and firendly and the room was very clean. However, it is much smaller than Easyhotel Paddington. The room is literally fitted around the bed. If there are two of you travelling with large suitcases you will struggle for space in the windowless rooms. Also, there is no independent air conditioning for the room and I found it very hot on my second night. All that said, you won't find a better budget hotel chain for a couple of nights in the capital. Just plan ahead and book early for the best price.	
Dec 4 2008 	would stay again	I booked directly with easyhotel as they don't come up on searches. I was only wanting a crash pad and to be honest for the price (£53) i wasn't expecting much. Was happily surprised when i got there, the reception staff were friendly and polite and the room was better than i expected. It was clean, warm and bigger than i thought it was going to be! The bathroom was compact but enough room to do what you need + the shower was hot. Word of advice, when ur not using the toilet, keep the lid down as if u drop what your using - it'll fall in!My boyfriend usually stays in more expensive places, but he thought that this was perfect for a one night stay.Will book again.	
Nov 20 2008 	Ideal for a one night stay	I was in London on business and needed to stay over after attending an evening function close to Victoria Station. I was not keen to pay the outrageous prices of main stream hotels and thought I would give the Easyhotel a whirl at £35 for a room with double bed, small bathroom with shower, just needing bed for the night.Not expecting too much I checked in at 16.00 with a very helpful member of staff who asked if I would prefer a ground floor or 3rd floor room as they had no lift. I went for the 3rd floor and the best way to describe the room is like that of a cabin on an car ferry to France, very small, a &quot;pod style&quot; bathroom like the French motel chains and very clean.I had a small overnight bag and my laptop which I could charge in the room and after coming back to the hotel later that night slept soundly in a bed that for me was pefrectly comfortable. A great location in the middle of London close to the &quot;bright lights&quot; and I will use Easyhotels again, OK the room is &quot;functional&quot; rather than spacious but if you just need a great value stay you cannot go wrong.	
Nov 12 2008 	Nothing for free	As it says on the hotel website...the rooms are small, so we were expecting that. However we were not expecting to have to pay GBP10 to store our bags for an hour. The pillows and linen were also crap. The pillows were as thin as cardboard and you had to pay extra to get another one. You also only got 1 duvet and had to also pay extra for more. Also don't expect to be able to turn around in the tiny shower without turning the water off. If there are two of you in a room don't expect to be able to move around without bumping into each other. Good location though.	
Nov 12 2008 	easy hotel Victoria : A Great Launching Pad	Better than expected. Was prepared for a clean, albeit SMALL space that would serve as a resting place during our tour of London. In that capacity, it functioned more than adequately. No lifts .. the 2 days on the front end of our trip were spent on the 3rd floor -- a major piece of work getting luggage up there! Learned from it, and requested ground floor room during the 2 days prior to our UK departure -- so nice. Everything is planned for efficiency -- a very futuristic design. LOVED the magic duvet -- minimum weight and perfectly warm, even when the room was a bit cool. So many great little restaurants/bistros/cafes in close proximity, plus wonderful access to a couple of the greatest theatres in the city.	
Oct 13 2008 	As expected	Just returned from a two night stay here in room 31 on the first floor. The room was a standard with window, it was about 8 ft wide and about 10 ft long with a bathroom cubicle in the corner. The bed was fine, thin pillows but you can rent more for £2 each and extra towels are £1 each. You do get 2 towels with the room. The shower was good, plenty of hot water, in fact, the little cubicle ended up like a steam room!! Do take the tolilet paper out the bathroom before you se the shower. With the door closed the shower room dried out overnight. Only 2 pegs to hang stuff on, could have done with a little shelf or even a table. The room has one orange wall, and pale peach or the others, so not that bad. Would I stay again - maybe for one or two nights, as just a place to sleep. You just have to remember the room could be small and youget no frills. Oh the shower did have Lux shower gel and handwash.	
Oct 10 2008 	small small small	This is a hotel for low-budget travellers, definitely! The rooms are soooooooooo small that it´s hard for 2 people to walk inside it with the suitcases on the floor. The bathroom loooks like an airplane toilet, so small it is. But it´s clean and the location is awesome, steps from Victoria Station ( one of the main metro and train stations in london) and a lot of touristic sites.	
Oct 2 2008 	Wouldn't Reccommend	Overall a disappointing stay at Easyhotel for us. Friendly staff which assisted somewhat, however be prepared for the stairs! Very Narrow and difficult lifting so I hope you are fit! (We had 20kgs each in two bags).On arrival we noticed what seemed to be a small cockroach in the room, I killed it without much more thought (thinking you get what you pay for). Sleeping that night was uncomfortable as I felt like I was being biten by mosquito's. In the morning the harsher reality was realised - BED BUGS! They had raped and pillaged me all night. Blood stains on the blankets were evidence of this as well as a few of the cretins crawling in the sheets when we stripped it down. Complaint to the desk was well recieved (as I brought a few of the dead freeloaders with me!), so they moved us to another room (another floor up, more difficult navigation on the stairs!). This compounded with the inadequate air conditoning to keep us from sweating all night (even though the temperature was only 20 degrees outside! Which is cold!) No further complaints on the actual hotel really. It was clean. BEWARE THOUGH- with the size of the rooms (we had a normal room with a window - rooms are as tiny as they say 8 square metres!) not even enoguh room to have both our bags on the floor open at the same time!!! I won't be staying in another Easyhotel again. Shame as the credit they issued for our inconvenience can only be used in the form of credit on a future booking!!!	
Oct 1 2008	Everything you could need	Maybe its a little strange to rate this as &quot;5 Star&quot;, but we love this hotel in Victoria. It was very clean, comfortable, and quiet. The Victoria location is great, and because we booked 3 months ahead, it was only 38 pounds per night. Yes, it is very small. We got the absolutely smallest room we could, just so we could have the full &quot;Easyhotel Experience&quot;. It was fine, It calls for a little manuvering - who wants to get out of bed first, because there really isn't room for two people to be standing at the same time. We didn't feel claustraphobic, because the ceilings are suprisingly high. We stayed here for our first two nights in London, before we traveled up to Manchester for a week, then coming back to London, we decided to treat ourselves to a last night in a Hilton. Sure, the Hilton was great, but it costs one hundred pounds more - I think there are just lots better things to spend money on than a hotel room. As an American traveling in Europe, all of the hotel rooms seem small anyway, so the petite size was just no problem. This is a great way to save some money, and we will be staying here the next time we return to London.	
Sep 19 2008 	would definately return	I stayed at this hotel for one night,i booked a room with a window,it had 2 beds and 2 shower units,so i was pleasantly surprised as i was a single traveller,it was quite spacious.The check in was quick, pleasnt and polite.Check in was 3pm you could leave your bag £5,checkout was 10am,they are quite keen i was knocked at 10.20am no lie in...The hotel is only a 8 min walk to all transportation systems at victoria station.underground,coach and rail.There are numerous restaurants and pubs and supermarkets nearby,M&amp;S simply food(victoria station),Tesco metro, for sandwiches and snacks for travellers on a budget .The hotel is ideally located for sightseeing,I managed to walk to Buckingham palace ,Trafalgar square,Westminster Big Ben and the London Eye (£15.50 a ticket) in a short space of time.I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel,remember it is no frills but its only a place to rest up and shower,Where else could you stay at this address Belgrave Road SW.1 for £59 a night.	
Sep 9 2008 	A comfortable bed and an en-suite what more could I need?	I had a single night stopover in Central London, and a limited budget - easyhotel.com looked to be cheap and a good option.The standard rooms listed on the website as 'small' are just that - standard and small, exactly as widely advertised.The bed almost filled the room, and was comfortable and welcoming. The en-suite shower had plenty of pressure and heat, and was much appreciated.The hotel does offer WiFi connectivity for an additional charge (like everything else), and although I didn't take it up, the signal appeared to be strong and reliable.A stay here is ideal if you want a decent bed for the night, with no extra frills and a low price, which is what the easy group offer and deliver.There are plenty of local amenities in the area if you want food of supplies, and the hotel is close to underground stations and both Victoria Railway &amp; Coach stations.	
Sep 6 2008 	Cheap but small small small	Does exactly what it says on the tin! Good stuff first:- price is excellent given the location, just around the corner from Victoria station(s) so handy for all the main tourist sites, pubs and breakfast places. Helpful staff and clean room.Onto the bad stuff- our room consited of a small double bed, walkway to bed and shower room. And we had one of the larger rooms, with a window! The shower room is more a wet room with a curtain that keeps some of the spray in. There is no room to dry yourself in there, in fact safely turning a full 360 circle in the shower can be difficult (I bumped the tap and got a nasty burn as a result).Two wall hooks are for storing your belongings as you'll need to maximise the floor space! We had to co-ordinate drying and dressing time after our showers!. Guests are provided with one towel each and one small pillow, you have to pay £5 pday for a tv remote and also to leave luggage before or after your stay.We only stayed two nights and literally spent no more than sleeping time there. We're happy with basic accomodation and while this wasn't bad but I wouldn't recommend it to a mate. For an extra few pounds per night you can get &quot;luxuries&quot; like two pillows, loads of towels, room to be untidy, unlimited tv and free left luggage.	
Aug 15 2008 	You can do better	I stayed here with my 10 year old son. London is very expensive so a $79 room seemed great. My request for a not-top-floor room was not honored, but I knew this was possible. I also knew everything would cost extra ie TV use, maid service, etc. The staff were not unfriendly but most were not helpful either. My last night request for a wake-up knock was answered with &quot;Don't count on it&quot;. The deal breaker for me, though, was the cold water. The water is only cold, not warm, not hot, not warming up. It's only cold. Our front room was noisy, the rooms are super-tiny. The window opened about 6 inches, the breeze was nice. The a/c was on, and the comforter was warm. This hotel is on a pleasant street, near Victoria stations and several restaurants, etc. We walked home safely at night. Although the tour books and websites stated other hotels on this street had higher rates, I saw several vacancy signs with lower rates posted. If you have no luggage and don't need a shower, this easyHotel could be for you. But you can probably do better. We won't go back.	
Aug 14 2008 	Warning!	WARNING!If you book with easyHotel, check the small print on their Contract. They do not give any kind of refund, and indeed will give you a &quot;credit&quot;, which is then designed to be difficult to use, and will rapdily be reduced by various hidden fees.Needless to say we had to change a booking with easyHotel due to an unforeseen circumstance, and then was refused any kind of refund.Cheap and nasty operation. Avoid.	
Aug 10 2008 	Small Inexpensive in Pleasant Convenient Neighborhood	I stayed in the London Victoria easyHotel in early June 2008.Because I was traveling solo for the first part of my trip, I merely needed a small, inexpensive hotel room in a safe, convenient neighborhood.I was very happy with the easyHotel.As advertised, the room was very (VERY!) small, windowless and in a basement area of the hotel . However, this was not a problem as I did not spend much time in the room. The room was mostly clean and the rest of the hotel was also decent.My high-speed Internet connection worked perfectly and allowed me to stay in touch with work back in the United States.The hotel is a very short walk from Victoria Station and the neighborhood consists of nicely-appearing economy bed &amp; breakfasts. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance, as well as a coin laundry two blocks away. For a meal, I was very happy with The Jugged Hare.The hotel is also very convenient to all of London's sightseeing. Each day I set out on foot to explore the city. Whether walking, by bus or by train, it is easy to get to anything from the easyHotel.HOWEVER...as much as I was pleased with the easyHotel accommodations, I know that my wife would not have found them acceptable. She would have loved the neighborhood, but the room was far too small for her comfort. For the budget traveler, room is great...but I wouldn't choose the easyHotel on a honeymoon!If traveling solo to London again (on my own $$), I would definitely give consideration to easyHotel Victoria Station.	
Jul 30 2008 	Awful and dirty	I stayed in this easyhotel on New Years Eve so thankfully i wasn't in it very long. The first room (small no window option) we were given was filthy...it had dirty marks on the bed and little hairs all over the sheets!!! the second was a bit cleaner but the room was incredibly small with a bright orange wall. It was difficult to sleep in and it was also very noisy as the door was paper thin. For one of us to go to the loo the other one had to either stay in the corner of the bed or leave the room.I know that size and day is what i paid for but the quality of the rooms in the easyHotel in Basel are 100 times better. I would not reccomend using this hotel but i would not condem all easyhotels.i think it could possibly be a 'London' thing as many hotels take the mickey in London.On the plus side the hotel was a short walk from Victoria station.	
Jul 6 2008	Cheap and Cheerful	This is our second visit and this time we went for a larger room with a window rather than the smallest room below ground without a window. Although more expensive, there was a lot more space and well worth the extra. Hotel clean and staff extremely pleasant and helpful. Would certainly use again.	
Jun 1 2008 	Does what it says on the tin!	Have stayed here many times now as a crash pad in London. Amazed to read people complaining about it! READ THEIR WEBSITE BEFORE YOU BOOK!! It tells you everything you need to know in detail so no-one can be surprised about the size of the rooms, the lack of windows in some of them, the lack of free TV and other 'frills', etc. etc. Apply exactly the same principles to booking this hotel as you would to booking an easyjet flight and don't expect the frills!Positives:- It's cheap! Cheapest I've paid is £30 which for a room in its excellent location is fantastic. The most I've paid is £60 on a very busy evening. The earlier you book, the less you pay...- It's clean and modern. There are other places in the vicinity which are as cheap, but you take your chances with the cleanliness and state of decor- It's surprisingly comfortable. The beds in particular are very comfortable ... and even though the bathrooms are the size of the ones which you get in cross-channel ferry cabins, they are clean and every room has an ensuite- The location is excellent - right near the stations and very near to some great pubs and restaurants to pass the evening inThe negatives are that one or two of the tiniest rooms on the lower ground floor are stifling, as people have pointed out, and the air conditioning is controlled centrally so you can't do anything about it. My advice: don't book the smallest rooms (the web site gives you room dimensions, so they're easy to avoid).Also, if you book a room without a window you should expect that it may feel claustrophobic - but book one with a window instead if that's a problem for you! The smallest rooms are just bigger than ferry cabins, but the largest (e.g. the special needs rooms) are surprisingly spacious. Actually, if all you're after is somewhere to put your head down, the windowless rooms are quieter as there is no road noise. The only noise problems I have found, though, are in rooms near banging doors, so take ear plugs as a contingency.Yes, the decor could be more uplifting (e.g. there are no carpets in the rooms, to avoid the costs of cleaning them, I suppose), and the grey and magnolia paintwork coupled with the 'easygroup' orange is not the most attractive ... but if what you're after is somewhere in a great location to put your head down for the night without costly 'frills', then look no further!	
May 23 2008 	cheap clean	Cheap clean nothing to write home about unless to say how cramped it is. people who say you dont want to spend your time in a hotel room, yes that is true, but you also dont want to feel like you are in a coffin when you are asleep. very cheap and clean but wouldnt recommend a stay over 2 nights. we did 5 and it was painfully cramped, we spent most of the time laughing that if one person wanted to get off the bed, the other person had to literally leave the room.	
May 21 2008 	The Pits!	This place is awful. For the cost you can get a decent hotel, if you shop clever. If you really want to know how prison feels, book away! Otherwise avoid. The room was no bigger than a cleaners cupboard, there were no windows, one uncomfortable bed and a TV up so high you get neck ache. Not even a bed side table, shelf or plank of wood to put you stuff on let alone a wardrobe!	
May 6 2008	You get what you pay for!	I've given this hotel 4 out of 5 as you get excellent value for money - £60 a night in the centre of London. I stayed here for two nights over the early May Bank Holiday weekend. Both of which were fine. The location is perfect - just round the corner from Victoria Coach Station and Victoria Rail &amp; Tube Stations. Yes, my room was small but I was well aware of that before I arrived. Yes, the bathroom was tiny and a little awkward to manage, however, easyHotel's website also made me aware of this fact. The room though, was spotlessly clean, relatively quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable - something I've never been able to say for Travelodge! I didn't appreciate having to pay £5 for 24 hours of TV access, however, that was my choice. I barely used the TV so saw the £5 as a waste of cash. I didn't bother for my second night. Basically, don't cough up the £5 unless there's something you really want to watch on TV. I had a second floor room with a window. The heating seemed to be permanently on in the room. This made the room a little stuffy. Being able to open the window was a huge help though. The noise from the street was a little annoying but better than sweating all night. I can't imagine what it must be like without a window! Not good, I reckon. Take the toilet paper out of the bathroom while you shower. I didn't and it got wet. Luckily they had provided two toilet rolls so all was not lost.The left luggage facility was useful. I left my bags in the hotel for almost 12 hours after I checked out. At £5, it's cheaper than the left luggage office in Victoria Train Station! I think Victoria Coach Station may be comparable in price though. The staff were helpful and friendly, however, I didn't need their assistance in between check in and check out. I stayed in the room alone. It may have been more of a tight squeeze had my partner been there too. But at least the bed would have been comfortable.For £60 in central London on a Bank Holiday weekend, you can't do much better for the price - unless you get a great deal on priceline or somewhere else. I haven't posted any pictures as the ones on here are already a fair depiction of easyHotel in Victoria.	
Apr 26 2008 	Small but clean tidy and a bargain!	We expected the easyhotel standard size room (went for the smallest) to be small, and yes it was. we literally had 3 1/2 walls surrounding our bed and a little corridor to the bathroom and door.But despite this, was it was cheap, great location and extemely clean!Although next time we wont fork out £10 for a window as it was a tiny line of a window at near the cealing, - i couldnt even see out of it standing on the bed, but we were on the top floor.For a stopoff overnight for a concert etc if was perfect!	
Apr 25 2008 	Compact Central Surprisingly OK!	Had a night out in London planned so booked here to avoid long train journey home. The room was small, the shower and toilet were cramped but the bed was really comfortable, the room clean and as everyone says for the price you pay for staying in central London I dont think it can be beaten. Would definitely stay here again should the need arise!	
Apr 20 2008 	Aa lighter shade of Orange.	Warning Consumer Alert. EasyHotel delivers.Our room was actually quite big. We were expecting a box, but got more of a lovely Orange infused rectangle instead. We were promised a window, and got a whole working French door. Fab!Bathroom, basically a capsule but perfectly suitable as long as you remembered to take the toilet paper out before you start your shower. But still wet toilet paper does the job.Bed was pretty good however pillows were only 1 ply. So we popped down to Argos and picked up a packet of 4 pillows for 5 pounds. If you love Cod and Chips served on a plate with your choice of amber fluid, head down to the Maquis of Westminster, 2 min walk towards the Thames. Close to Victoria station which is your gateway to London. There is also busses and those black cabs. It aint SoHo, but if you take advantage of happy hour you can always get the last tube home. Cheers.	
Apr 18 2008	£35 - bargain	Absolutely fine... spotlessly clean, bed linen and towels nice and fresh and comfortable bed. Booked a special needs room (with window) for more space and glad I did so. Even so, I would stay in a smaller room because it was such good value and great if you have to be at Victoria early in the morning. Slept like a baby...	
Apr 2 2008 	Does What it says on the Tin!	Hotel room with window...in Central London, 2 nights ... £70...Enough said?!Oh , ok then. While I respect peoples opinion I am baffled by some comments on here. Yes everything is extra..cleaning, TV, Luggage storage etc etc. But for the price I paid you cant even get a travel Inn for one night in central London never mind two. Its clean,basic and relatively quiet, great location 5 mins walk to Victora train and Tube.If you want fluffy pillows, the TV remote to watch SKY and air con controls in your room then dont come here. If you just want a place to put your head down, thats clean tidy and efficient do come here.Gave it 4 stars because its great value for money.	
Mar 31 2008 	Did you say tiny	It is tiny, that is certain. But I booked it because I thought is would be clean and safe. It was neither of these.We had a a drunk guy try and get into our room very late at night. He was certain it was his room and tried very hard to get in.Any out break of fire and the place would be our tomb. And this was the only place in Europe I got bitten by bed bugs.	
Mar 29 2008 	as advertised	Best price we could find for such a clean room and bath, comfortable bed, good location. We had a standard room with window, 2nd floor (3rd floor american). I would recommend the window option, it gives the room some more life, control over temperature if needed, and could save your life in an emergency. This hotel wouldn't come close to passing code for life safety in the USA. There are no sprinklers (some rooms also have no windows), only one exit, their fire doors are made of wood and will not contain a fire for very long. They did however have a fire alarm system which did go off once in the middle of the night for a few seconds-woke us fast, must've been a false alarm.Overall, I feel this was the best hotel that we could afford. The room temperature was perfect even without opening the window. The room was quiet, clean. Downsides: no place for a bag, staff mostly unfriendly except one fellow, no free tv (buttons don't even work unless you pay the extra), no housekeeping unless you want to pay something like 15 pounds extra (bath and room gets dirty in 5 days). I would stay again, especially if it were for a 2-3 days. Maybe you could book twice with a room change to cover more days and get a free housekeeping?	
Mar 5 2008 	Hot hot hot at Easyhotel	If you pay peanuts...then you'll get what you expect - a tiny little broom cupboard with a bed in it.We chose the cheapest room which meant we had a basement room with no window. We kinda liked the novelty value of it - the airline-style bathroom cubicle and compact bed, and we knew not to have any expectations - we only wanted a cheap bed for the night.But we just couldn't stand the heat - it was scorching! All night long, the vents blew hot air on us, and with no window or controls, we couldn't do anything about it. We ended up attempting to sleep with the main room door locked open against the bathroom door as it was unbearable, with my partners socks blocking in the vents!!!Pay more and get a better night's sleep somewhere else!	
Feb 15 2008 	Exactly what it's advertised as	I read a lot of reviews before I booked this place and some of them had me a little worried but really this place is exactly what it says it is. It's tiny - a bed and a bathroom, but hey - who wants to spend their time in London in a hotel?? All you need is a bed and bathroom! Some people metioned problems with heating, bed bugs, noise, cold showers and I think I remember someone complaining about location.The heating could be a problem as you have no control - but just go for a room with a window and that's sorted! As for bed bugs - fortunately there were none - the place is pretty clean. Noise is a factor but if you are a light sleeper just go out and buy some ear plugs! Or better yet just walk all around London all day and you'll be so tired when you get back that you'll sleep through no matter the noise! The shower did start a little cold but just give it some time and it warms up no worries! As for location - it was fantastic! It is so central everything is close. We only ever used the subway to get to and from the airport. You can easily walk to all the big tourist sites.All in all I was very impressed with it!	
Jan 23 2008 	What a dump...	I think the pictures posted by other reviewers on tripadvisor make this hotel look alot nicer than it actually is. I've stayed in nicer youth hostels! I could only decribe this place as a prison. The room was soooooooooooo tiny (and yes i expected it to be tiny) - there was the bed....nowhere to place any objects and only 2 hooks on the wall. The bathroom was just like an aeroplane toilet with a shower - basically it's a wet room so when ure in the shower the whole 'room' gets soaked. It was sooooo cold in the room, there's a few vents blowing a gale but there's a sign in the room saying that the temperature can't be controlled by guests or reception...great.Cold, depressing, tiny, dark and souless - you can find better for the money! You can get good last minute deals at a Holiday Inn Express for the same amount!!!!!!!!!!!	
Jan 20 2008 	Cheap and Charmless	I'm a regular at Budget hotels and I've always been a staunch defender of Travelodge who I think provide adequate rooms at a very good rate....but the Easyhotel was a step to far for me.Cheap, yes; clean, certainly but when they say basic they mean it. A bed.....basic bathroom facilities and thats it. You can use the TV if you pay the extra £5 for a remote control! - I found that a bit irritating. There is a very cold souless feel about the place.If you literally just need somewhere to sleep, then its perfectly ok but its not a place you would want to spend any other time in. The location is very good for central London and in fairness, the bed was comfy but I'd advise others to book early and get a good rate on a Travelodge if they can.	
Jan 5 2008 	Seriously orange but a great budget option	I've stayed at this hotel (same room) twice now and will definitely go back again next time I'm in London and need somewhere clean and cheap to stay.I booked a disabled room (with window) which is probably the largest room in the hotel. It was very basic but clean, comfortable and SO cheap for London. Hopefully the photos will give you a better idea of what the room is like.The hotel is very discreet looking (not bright orange outside!) and very near to the Victoria coach &amp; train/tube station.. just a five minute walk. There are plenty of shops (incl a sainsburys supermarket &amp; starbucks) and a pub nearby and the hotel has a handy vending machine selling sweets/crisps and drinks.The reception staff on both visits were very friendly and helpful and even printed off a map for us as well as giving us directions.	
Jan 1 2008	The smallest room ever - but amazing value!	We stayed here for 2 nights in early December and the room cost just under £90 for 2 nights, which I thought was amazing for London and previously we had paid over £100 per night elsewhere.The location is good for Victoria coach station (less than 5 minutes) and the train station/tube just 3 minutes away.The room we had was the most basic one, in the basement so no window. When we first arrived we were early (check in after 3pm) so we had to pay £5 to store our bags. We returned after midnight and when we opened the door to the room the hot air just hit us - I went upstairs to the reception to complain and there was a sign on the wall that said that the reception staff couldn't control the heat..not true! Thebuttons were right there on the wall and when I asked him to turn it down he did so immediately, it had been on 28 degrees!! He said other guests had complained it was cold..so I guess you could be in an unlucky situation where the temperature isn't right for you and you end up battling with the reception staff/other guests to get it to an acceptable level. In the basement there are obviously no windows to open if you get too hot! The room was the size of a double bed and about a metre square of space as you walk in, the bathroom 'pod' was straight opposite the door, and was about the size of a small bathtoom in a caravan - but very neatly done and most importantly it was clean. There's a full length mirror and 2 hooks to hang things on, plus we used the door to hand things on too. Not ideal for getting ready to go out, my partner had to sit on the bed whilst I got dressed and then we swapped round -but it was cosy!For the money I couldn't praise it highly enough and we would stay there again, but I probably wouldn't be so tight and I'd pay for a room with a window!!	
Jan 1 2008 	The worst hotel I have ever stayed in - don't stay there!	I knew this was going to be basic but even the cheapest of hotels has its limits.The room was in the basement - freezing cold and despite asking several times for the heating to be put on, it was cold and felt damp. No carpet meant it felt even colder and like a hospital (or perhaps a morgue!). Shower was cold in the morning so couldn't even warm up with that.even on a budget, there MUST be better places to stay than this - it is SO bleak, SO small, SO awful that I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone.easyGroup - you have got this SO wrong!	
Dec 31 2007 	Very small but fine for one night or two	Room was clean, bed was comfy. Shower was powerful and warm. Don't pick it if you are a large person, or have a lot of luggage, or have mobility problems as there is very, very little space. But for one or two cheap nights where you only plan to sleep there, it is fine.Main part of the room is literally the same size as the bed. The shower room is a small cubicle thing probably designed for a boat. The only space for luggage is the lobby area between bed and door or the window sill (if you have a window). The &quot;standard&quot; room we had was no bigger than the small room we had apart from extra lobby space.	
Dec 21 2007 	Ideal Location but really really tiny room	We stayed in a no window room for 1 night (for just about 7 hours) before we catch another plane from London to other parts of Europe. The rooms is really so small, smaller than we imagine from the photos of the hotel website. However, its location is just too great, just 5 min walk from Victoria subway, train and coach station. It is also located in a safe area.Its an ideal choice if you just need to take a shower and have a sleep. But dont expect anything more than that.	
Dec 19 2007 	cheap small but clean and handy	It is what it is- small, clean, close to everything London. Book the disabled room- same price and more room. DOnt book if you want to spend time in your room. For over night business stay its clean and cheap.	
Dec 15 2007 	Do Not Sleep In 201!!!	Booked a small double with window - on arrival the 'window' was a 6 inch strip under the ceiling that didn't open - actually I don't know if it could open, you couldn't reach it to find out! We figured it would do for the one night we were staying, until we pulled the bed back at 2 am...YUK YUK YUK ok in the interests of good taste I will just say the bed sheet (actually there was no sheet, just a matress protector and by god did it need one) was as disgusting as it could be. (Oh I can't resist - 'Curly' hair from top to bottom of bed, every 2 inches. Yellow stains - I counted 10 seperate stains....I'm not exagerating I promise!!!!)A swift visit to a helpful reception got us a new room, bigger, with a proper window that opened on to the street (oh the luxury!) and a clean bed. Reception honestly did not seem suprised that the bed was full of - well, pubic hair, let's be honest.Just avoid 201 at all costs! And if you are unlucky enough not to be able to change - don't expect to sleep on the floor as there's not enough room to stand, let alone lie down on it! There are loads of hotels in the same street so my advice would be to go somewhere else!Oh, and the coffee machine in reception has without doubt the nastiest coffee I have ever drunk, but there are good cafes just round the corner.	
Nov 21 2007 	Nice folks serviceable rooms but BED BUGS!	The easyHotel was everything I was expecting, and for the price was definitely a deal in London. The staff were friendly, the location great, and the room was precisely as advertised (just as tiny as you think 6 square meters is).But I was eaten alive while I slept, with itchy bites to show for it for days afterward after I checked out (including one that bit me on my eyelid). Until this trip, bed bugs had always been nothing more than a good-night saying to me (&quot;don't let the bed bugs bite!&quot;). I'm sorry to have been enlightened as to the truth of the matter. They're not fun at all, and the bites take days to go away.If the management can get rid of the bugs, this would be a fine place to stay. I'm afraid that I've been scared away, however. I'll fly EasyJet any day; but I'll be looking to stay somewhere other than EasyHotel next time I'm in London.	
Nov 13 2007 	Great for Crashing but No Bigger Than A Rabbit Hutch	Hotel was basic but clean, near Victoria Station and all tube networks - a great place for crashing if you are single or with a partner whilst in the big smoke. We had to get a window otherwise we would have felt like we were in a cell.Would stay here again but only for a couple of days as the rooms really are small with no wardrobes or drawers and it would start to grate on you after a while plus the shower is so small and crammed you literally jump and and jump back out as its too much like hard work!Value for money 10 out of 10 though.	
Oct 24 2007 	Cheap	I stayed in the easyhotel in Victoria for 3 nights in October. We booked a disabled room because my sister has collapsed spinal muscles and has to daily exercises on a flat hard floor. We initially felt really guilty that we might be taking a room from someone who really needed it. When we got to the hotel, there is no way a wheelchair user could have accessed the hotel in a dignified manner. There are steps up to the hotel and down from the fire exit. The room was small so not much room for manouvering.The bedroom was small and the bed was enclosed on three sides so difficult for two people if one person needed to get up in the night. There was a small TV on the wall but we didn't use it. There was also a decent sized sash window. The bed was clean. There were two coat hooks for hanging things, luckily because we got the room we did there was a corner where we could shove our cases out of the way.The bathroom was quite small and all orange, like a wet room. it was only when it got wet that you realised how dirty the floor was. There was no window in the bathroom and it got quite hot and steamed up.The location of the hotel was good, near to Victoria Station Victoria Coach Station and close to lots of bars and restaurants, shops and theatres. It was also walking distance to Buckingham Palace and the surrounding areas.We paid £142 for three nights so £71 each, which seemed very cheap in London. The area felt safe enough to walk around and there are lots of hotels on the same road so lots of tourists. We were on the ground floor, in G7, and it was quite noisy as our room looked out onto the street and busy road. The location definitely makes this hotel worthwhile. Also, I would recommend getting a special needs room. I can't imagine how small a standard room would be. All the rooms around us were special needs but I didn't see a wheelchair user - probably because of the badly planned access!! If you want a romantic getaway I wouldn't recommend it but it was ok for me and my sister - better than a grotty B&amp;B.	
Sep 19 2007 	A matchbox with great value	When you step into your room at the easyhotel, you stop. Because there just isnt enough room to take another one. At approximately 7 sq.m, our windowless room (we acted cheap  rooms with windows are available, but slightly more expensive) was the smallest weve ever been in. But considering we paid only 29 pounds a night, it was a fantastic deal. The only problem we had was because of the check in time - you can check in to your room only at 3 pm, and we arrived early in the morning, so we had to pay 10 pounds to store our luggage at Victoria station. But even if you add the 10 pounds to the room rate, 39 pounds is still a good deal for a spotless room in central London. The easyhotel Victoria is very well located  its just a five minute walk from Victoria station. Its also spotlessly clean. The bed is quite comfortable and the bathroom is smartly designed  they manage to pack everything into a capsule thats as big as a very small sumo wrestler. Overall, its a safe, clean and cheap place for a night in central London  you definitely cant get a room with your own bathroom for that price in any other hotel.  Its a good option if you dont plan to spend too much time in your room - and if you manage to fit into it. We know people who cant.	
Sep 18 2007 	No frills no thrills	I booked a regular sized room without a window. The hotel is very close to Victoria station, also the shops., while being located in a pleasant looking fairly quiet street. I was there for the weekend in late May.Room was clean, in good condition. Not much in the way of extra space beyond the path to the bathroom and door from one side of the bed.The bathroom was very small, so small I didn't want to chance using the shower in the morning. There was little hot water the night before.No in room controls for the air conditioning so I found myself waking up feeling cold at several points in the night. Or too hot when the AC wasn't on. There didn't seem to be very good soundproofing to the room, I frequently heard toilets flushing in other rooms.TV was good quality model with good selection of channels. However, it cost extra to view the tv via a £5 remote control purchased from reception.No dining facilities at this hotel, so come prepared (plenty of places to eat or buy food nearby). All the hotel has is a vending machine in reception and that was mostly empty when I saw it.In spite of the negatives, the room was quite good value for the £25 paid and the £5 for TV. Definitely recommended if you're on a budget and don't mind the lack of extra amenities that might come at a slightly higher price at other hotels.Not one for the claustrophobic or those spending the evening in their room though.	
Sep 12 2007 	Suited our needs would stay here again	I and a friend were in need of cheap accomodation not too far from the centre of London. We stayed in a standard room without windows, for two people. The bed was large enough for two friends to share without any uncomfortableness. The room was small, we knew this, but we managed to place our luggage on the floor anyway. The bathroom was small but fine, it is rare to find such a price AND have your own shower and toilet in London.We ordered access to the TV in our room for around 12 pounds in total (stayed there 4 nights), which worked fine.When we left, we had a wake-up knock on the door (no phone in the room), and the hotel got us a cab for heathrow.All the people we saw who worked there were friendly and helpful, and it is located in a really beautiful street with wide pavements in a very nice part of the city, a couple of minutes walk from the Victoria station.The only drawback that for me would be a reason to NOT stay here, is that you can not regulate the temperature in the room, it is the same for all rooms. The first day it was really cold, but the next three days it was really warm, which was fine in the daytime, but during the night we slept without blankets because i9t was so warm. People who are very temperature-conscious should have this in mind.
