	Peaceful stay in London bustle and hustle	The Beaufort feels a bit like home. Very nice staff, a complimentary bar with soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, a liitle lounge, quiet street, so close to Harrods, Knightbridge and even Piccadilly.We had a Junior Suite with King size bed, sofa bed and a rollaway, were we stayed with 2 adults and 2 teens. The bathroom was a bit small and there was only one washbassin. But that's the charms of the houses the Beaufort is settled in, I guess.	
Nov 15 2009 	London in a Storm	My wife &amp; I stayed @ The Beaufort and had a wonderful time. The staff were great as was the room. The only problem was the storm!! Will use The Beaufort on our next trip.	
Nov 12 2009 	Atrocious stay with very poor service and substandard rooms/breakfast	We stayed at the Beaufort Hotel in July for 1 night and unexpectedly one of our family members was seriously injured just prior to our stay at the Hotel. We required a change of rooms to ground floor and 2 rooms beside each other to help the family member walk/dress, enter/exit their room. Unfortunately, the hotel staff could not accommodate our needs and this necessitated our moving hotels. We requested a refund of the remaining nights given the emergency situation and were refused. For the 1 night we stayed we had a basement room, which is not only very small (unsuitable for 2 people), loud (you can hear the people upstairs and in the 'business lounge', and there is no ventilation. We also had a junior suite, which was a lovely room but the breakfast we ordered with the room was awful. Cereal in a box, plastic pre-wrapped muffins, cold coffee, bruised bananas and it was delivered late. The staff at this hotel were not only unsympathetic to the injuries of our family member, but they berated this person and made them feel unworthy and very uncomfortable (they were crying in the lobby and the staff just said they couldn't help with anything). We ended up moving just down the street to the Beaufort House (different from the Beaufort Hotel) and had a fantastic stay!	
Nov 4 2009 	Enjoyable but Surprising	The Beaufort is in an excellent location in Knightsbridge. The rooms are fine, though I would not stay on the basement floor as you can hear footsteps above from the lobby. The hotel offers free beverages alcoholic and non, which is particularly nice. The staff is helpful, well-meaning and friendly, but virtually untrained in professional hotel service. it was surprising that a hotel of this price and caliber had all Eastern and Central European staff.	
Oct 18 2009 	Lovely hotel in a very European style	My boyfriend and I spent three nights at the Beaufort and absolutely loved it, although it did take a bit of getting used to as it is definitely not an &quot;American&quot; style hotel. This is not a bad thing at all!! But can be a little unsettling for folks who generally stay in American-based chain hotels. So please keep an open mind as you settle in. We were given a basement-level room, which I must say put me off at first but I got over it quickly, because the room was gorgeous, with a big bay window, stylish and understated furnishings, and a very nice big bathroom. Also this is probably the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in, perfectly spotless from floor to ceiling. There is a bit of foot-traffic noise from the hallways above and outside the room but that is to be expected in a building of this age. The smallest details were taken care of (housekeeping left a single rose in our room one night, which was a sweet touch, and welcome chocolates when we arrived). The hotel has free wi-fi which really didn't work in our room or the lower level lounge/business center but worked fairly well in the lobby lounge. If you are going to try to get some work done you may do well to request a room with strong wifi signal. This was a blessing in disguise on a holiday though. The bed was also not the most comfortable but the linens were fresh and crisp and clean so that made up for it.Scones and tea made a lovely afternoon treat; the scones were freshly made and delicious and warm and came with a pot of clotted cream and jams, very nice treat. The open bar was a nice touch too :) Perfect location, steps away from a fantastic dim sum house, Lebanese restaurant, and Nero for coffee, as well as a long selection of shops and restaurants that we did not have to try, but the street itself was pleasant, quiet and clean.We will gladly recommend!	
Oct 9 2009 	Wonderful location very friendly and accomodating staff just a lovely boutique hotel.	When we arrived after an overnight flight, we were delighted to be able to settle right in to our suite. After a short resbit, we were awakened with a tea service and a tray of scones.We made this hotel our home for a week, and it was like coming home every day, after seeing the many wonderful sights of London. The staff were very accomodating, and welcoming...would get us anything we needed. The suite was modern, spacious, and clean. I especially liked the computer lounge, where we could plan our sightseeing. Very pretty neighborhood, it was exactly as pictured on the internet.	
Oct 1 2009 	Lovely place in fab location	My partner booked this hotel as a surprise for a romantic trip to London. It was expensive (£200) a night but worth it. We had booked a deluxe room through Secret Rooms and upon check in had been given a free upgrade to a junior suite. The room was big with a small sofa, plasma TV, comfy bed, and bathrobes. It was very nicely decorated. The best part for me was the afternoon tea which is free and served between 3pm and 5pm to your room, the scones were delicious! There is a free (help yourself) bar until 11pm with lots of choice including spirits, wine, champagne, beer and soft drinks. There are no tea or coffee facilities in the room but you can dial reception who will have a pot of fresh tea to your room within a minute or two - excellent service!! We had no problems with noise and the staff were very friendly. The only dissapointment was that continental breakfast was £14 per person, for the price we paid you would expect it to be included in the price. We chose to go for breakfast at Harrods instead!! We would definately stay there again.	
Sep 26 2009 	Awesome service great staff perfect location in Kensington perfect!	This is a great hotel in a perfect location, roll out of bed to luxury and a staff that responds to every need in an immediate manner. The open bar in the late afternoons and evenings is wonderful and the fresh tea and scones in our room made us smile from ear to ear. From the momment we walked in to the momment we checked out I felt as a welcome guest in a friends home. What a perfect experience for us. I will be back to London and this is now my favorite London hotel.	
Sep 21 2009 	Perfect Location Lovely Accommodation Wonderful Stay	We booked to stay at the Beaufort Hotel for a birthday celebration and a night out in London. The Beaufort is clean and contemporary and finished with nice touches such as the complimentary afternoon tea. The scones were served warm to our room and were delicious. It is in a great location with Harrods and Harvey Nichols and the designer shops at your fingertips, great restaurants and amenities close by. We had a lovely dinner at Mon Peliano located directly across the road from the hotel and would recommend this to other visitors.I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to all.	
Sep 2 2009 	Nice local lacks attention to detail you would expect	Stayed at this hotel in late August for a holiday with my wife. Well presented modern looking room with good facilities. Location is perfect, near the Knightsbridge tube station, shops and restaurants.What disappointed me with this place is the lack of detail to service. The staffs are pleasant enough however they appear to hide away out the back. Things I would expect this hotel to do:- the downstairs lounge/business room was not cleaned regularly. Complementary drinks and nibbles are great: I just don't like eating chips, nuts and olives that have been left out for days on end. The tea and coffee facilities are POOR. The milk on one occasion had turned into a solid... especially disappointing when I was dying for a cuppa as the rooms do not have tea/coffee facilities in the rooms. This is unacceptable. There should be at least a wet bar for this offering with spot checks done for this area.The lock on our door was damaged and we had to SLAM the door at least 3 times to get it to lock... (the room above must have had the same problem as they slammed the door four times in a row at 4am, no doubt to catch a plane)Simple little things like this which can be rectified would make this Hotel a must to return... Not for me however.... I hope they lift their game....	
Aug 21 2009 	Nice oasis surrounded by some good restaurants	Spent 3 nights with 2 rooms on the 5th floor. My teen sons actually had the nicer of the 2 rooms, facing the very quiet street. Hotel was quiet, rooms were large enough for us, and nicely decorated. My room smelled slightly of smoke at first ... it is a smoke-free hotel, but someone could have sneaked to the small terrace off the room. A great location -- loved being close to the parks, we were so busy we didn't make it to Harrods!! Lots of restaurant selections nearby. Staff were friendly and very willing to assist when needed.	
Aug 11 2009 	Poor Value for Your Travel $$	My husband and I love London and have stayed in the city more than a dozen times in the last ten years, staying in a variety good-quality hotels. We were very disappointed in the Beaufort Hotel. Though billed on its website as a small, luxury boutique property, in fact it is not.We booked the &quot;superior double&quot; room, and were very surprised on finding that room was terribly small and shabby, with cheap furnishings, lino floor and press-board walls and doors. Storage space was completely inadequate for two people. The closet was hard to access as doors could not completely open (due to being so close to the bed). There were no drawers in the room and we ended up having to fold most of our clothes into cubbies provided inside the closet. Given the iron and ironing board that were supposed to be provided were nowhere in sight, we were a rumpled mess for most of our trip. The room was very difficult for two people to maneuver in. When my husband asked staff if we were in the correct room, he was told it WAS a &quot;superior double&quot; and that &quot;hotel rooms in Europe are smaller than in the States.&quot; He replied that our room was unusual by European standards too but got no satisfaction. Having paid in advance we were stuck.The room was on the 3rd floor and could not be directly accessed by the lift as the lift did not stop on the 3rd floor. We had to go up to the 4th and down the stairs, or walk up all the way. I am usually not against a walk-up but had injured my foot in transit and could really have used that lift. When we did walk up, access was via a very narrow winding staircase and then a warren of short corridors with multiple fire doors -- very confusing (I couldn't help but think that in the event of a real fire, we'd be doomed trying to get out of that maze). Many times going up or down, we had to sidle past piles of used linens, food trays or even a vaccum cleaner in the stairwell.The bathroom was large and bright but the tub was slippery to the point of dangerous without a no-skid mat, and my husband did in fact slip once getting out of the shower. Amenities were OK but those that we used, like soap, conditioner, and washcloths, were not replenished until we prompted the maid with a written note (we had to do this twice).Basically, the room was quiet until someone moved in upstairs. This person came in late and kept us awake pacing until 2 or 3 a.m. This was very audible as the floors were very creaky and noisy. Sometimes we were reawakened at 5 a.m. when &quot;Bigfoot&quot; resumed walkabout. I presume somebody was ill as we could hear coughing through the floor too. Result was that we were very tired the last 3 days of our trip.Free drinks were a pleasant boon but the guest lounge was too small to spend time in, so we drank ours up in our room. The overall effect was one of claustrophobia.Pluses of this hotel are its location near museums, restaurants and shopping. The staff were friendly and pleasant, and free wi-fi was convenient. However, I am a seasoned enough traveler that I recognize luxury, whether in the US or Europe, and this ain't it. Had I paid the full rate of nearly $500 US I would have been absolutely sick over it. We got a &quot;discount rate&quot; and I was still unhappily aware throughout our trip that I could have had a better experience at another hotel for the same or less. I guess we paid a premium to be near Harrods (where we can't afford to shop). Quaint can only excuse so much -- buyer beware!	
Aug 11 2009 	Just as expected: Great Location.... Great Service	This was a very good pick for us. We had two grandchildren with us ages both 10 years old. The Jr. Suite #43 was roomy enough and the bathroom big enough so that we were comfortable for 6 nights. There is plenty of space to hang your clothes and use the drawers. The free breakfast was adequate until lunch. The location can't be beat, near the Picadilly tube line, across from Harrods, near many restaurants and on a quiet tree lined street, away from all the hustle bustle. I would stay here again next time we come to London. Also since everything cost double for USA travelers it was nice to have free water and drinks before going to bed. Also free internet in the lounge. Europe is very expensive for us right now so be prepared!!!!!	
Aug 5 2009	Very nice but not deluxe by any means	Recently stayed at this hotel - and as a boutique hotel I expected luxury, and spacious minimalism. I was also expecting somewhere quiet. I booked a deluxe room, which was no bigger than a standard Travelodge double, and had a small table and two rather plain armchairs plus the bed. This made it rather cramped when having tea in the room. There was no room service menu nor was any offered, although the website implies room service to be available. On our second night we returned at midnight, not having been advised the front door would be locked or how to gain access when it was, and had to knock loudly to get the night porter to let us in. On returning to the room, the tea tray was still there, the beds had not been turned down nor the room prepared. I would expect more from a hotel that claims to be offering a &quot;deluxe&quot; room.The bar/sitting area is small, if you had more than 10 people it would be full - hence we took drinks back to our room, although I found out later we could have taken them into a downstairs basement room. The complimentary drinks are nice but range of drinks offered is limited.The deluxe room was on the ground floor, but not quiet. It had air con units outside the main window which looked out onto a small yard with some plant pots and a sort of sculpture. The bathroom window looked out onto some kind of fire escape steps into a lower yard area and (we think) a communal toilet, as we heard flushing, water running and banging doors late into the night.On the plus side the reception staff were friendly and helpful, and the porter was very smiley and friendly. if you need to be close to Harrods, and you like sleek minimalistic wooden floored rooms, then this hotel may be for you. If you are looking for luxury, real comfort and all the extras a real deluxe experience offers, then maybe not.	
Jul 20 2009 	Home away from home	This was our fourth year to stay at The Beaufort during our annual visits to London; it was also the longest (10 nights) and the best. The rooms are well-decorated and comfortable (yes, small by American standards, but if you want a suite, go down Brompton Road to the Mandarin Oriental). The staff are familiar from year to year (the same desk clerk and bellman from our first visit), which means they recognize us and frequently upgrade our rooms. The amenities--complimentary water and beverages, extensive breakfast, and afternoon tea--offset the price (we only have to pay for one meal out per day). And the location (thanks to proximity to Knightsbridge tube station) can't be beat. All in all, the Beaufort is a favorite stop!	
Jul 19 2009 	Worth it	I have stayed in several hotels in London, and this is one of the best for the money. It is more expensive than some, but a lot less than others and the perks put it over the top. We skipped lunch and enjoyed afternoon tea with champagne. The open bar is a real treat for those of you who will enjoy a few before heading out for the evening. The lobby is rather small and the &quot;bar&quot; is really just a sort of cupboard by the reception desk, but it is well stocked. We were not shy despite glares of the staff and took our glasses up to the room and took turns getting refills. The female staff could use a few lessons in treating the guests a bit more friendly. They treated my huband and I as inconveniences as they sat in the back office chatting. Perhaps our frequent trips for refills at least gave them something to discuss. LOL! As for location, it is perfect. You can easily walk from the tube stop at Harrod's and of course you get to enjoy Harrod's! The rooms are a very nice size and the bathrooms are huge! Overall, a real treat if you are going to take advantage of the extras. We overnight in London a lot traveling in and out of England so we've already done the tourist stuff. If you plan on sightseeing and not spending time in the hotel, stay elsewhere unless you get a really good deal. It really is a lovely place in a fantastic location.	
Jul 13 2009 	Great little hotel	My husband, brother-in-law and sister-in-law and I stayed here for 4 nights in May. Lovely, warm place with wonderful friendly service. Nice breakfast served in room, tea service upon request and free bar till 11pm. Free use of internet also. First trip to London for all of us. Would love to go back and would love to stay there again.	
Jun 22 2009 	Cream tea and champagne	This hotel is in a fabulous location - Beaufort Gardens is only 1 minute's walk from Harrods but it is so quiet, you could be in suburbia. You are near Knightsbridge and South Ken tube stations and you can get plenty of buses on the Brompton Road.I thought the complimentary cream teas and bar were really nice touches - and you are not talking about own label beers, but with branded sprits and other drinks, including champagne on ice. It was very civilised indeed. There was no proper bar area to sit in to have a drink, but the reception had comfy sofas and was not that busy - although they do have muzak! Free wi-fi was good - and available throughout the hotel, which helped me to plan my stay. You are also in close proximity to many cafes and restaurants. I had breakfast in a local Pret but there were plenty of places to splurge if you didn't want hotel breakfast. There were also a range of dinner options if you were eating locally and despite the location, they were not all expensive.I booked a room through lastminute.com and got a good rate. I think if I had paid full rate, I would not have been pleased with the room i had. I was originally given a room on the ground floor which was spacious but didn't have much of a window - looked out onto an internal &quot;courtyard&quot; - more like aircon units or something. The receptionist kindly moved me to an upper room but if I had travelled with someone, we would not have been able to move round the room. The comments made in other reviews about the safe being in an inaccessible part of the wardrobe are correct and the same could be said about the mirror. The room was not that well maintained, in that the windows were not in repair and the bedside table drawer was broken. On the plus side, the room was very clean, the bed was comfy and the bathroom was big and well equipped. If you are not planning on spending a huge amount of time in a hotel (and why would you in London), then this is a pleasant hotel in a great location with nice staff. Just don't expect lots of facilities. I would stay there again.	
Jun 19 2009 	Lovely hotel near shopping and museums	We stayed at the Beaufort during our London stay of our trip to the UK. Lovely hotel. Very small room but well appointed, comfortable and clean. We were one block away from Harrods but the hotel is on a cul de sac and was very quiet. Tehy have an open bar in the lobby until 11 pm and the staff was very helpful. Would definitely stay here again. I especially loved that it was in a restored townhouse and had a homey feel to it.	
Jun 12 2009 	A wonderful retreat in the heart of the city!	The Beaufort provides a welcome respite after a busy day of sightseeing and shopping . The quiet, tree-lined street is just steps away from outstanding restaurants and shops, and provides easy access to many of London's major sights. We particularly enjoyed the open bar provided in the reception area, where we could relax, discuss the day's activities, and make plans for the evening. The entire staff is eager to ensure a wonderful stay in this little jewel of a hotel.	
Jun 11 2009	My adult son and I stayed here three nights and I think this hotel is overrated.	I feel this hotel did not live up to the reviews. It IS a makeover of a townhouse, our room was exceptionally small, hardly large enough for one, much less two. The bathroom did not have a make up mirror, lighting was very poor. The Business Centre was well appointed and pleasant. The lobby is very small and one couple is about the most it will seat comfortably.The staff was most hospitable and helpful. I blew a fuse turning on the AC, and was asked if I had been using the hairdryer. ( I wasn't). The location is wonderful, convenient to shopping and restaurants. It was quiet and the bed was comfortable, but I would probably not stay here again.	
Jun 10 2009 	The Beaufort is in a great location in a beautiful setting small boutique hotel with good service!	I stayed here for 6 nights with my daughter. Before I left I was trying to decide if we should stay in Kensington or Knightsbridge. I am glad I chose Knightsbridge and The Beaufort. The Beaufort is right off a main street. So you can walk to many things, the tube, Harrod's and lots of shopping, buses, restaurants, etc. The hotel room I choose was a deluxe room which was not large, but nice for London since London rooms are usually small. The bathroom was very nice and spacious. Great towels and robes. Our room overlooked the street the hotel is located on, so a beautiful view since The Beaufort is on a quiet tree lined street. The staff was perfect, there but not in the way. Delicious scones are brought to your room in the afternoon, if desired. Complimentary bar from 3-11pm. I chose a summer package that included continental breakfast in our room which was perfect to get us started in the morning. And we would not have to waste time going out. I would recommend this hotel to friends, and I would return there as well.	
May 30 2009 	Excellent Boutique Hotel in London	My husband and I recently returned from a 3 night stay at the Beaufort. Located on a quiet, charming, residential street, just steps from Harrod's, great shopping and many good dining options, the Beaufort is an excellent boutique hotel in London. The accommodations are modern elegance and meticulous maintained. Nice size, modern bathrooms with Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products. Ask for one of the rooms on the front of the hotel for nice lighting and charming street view. We had breakfast included in our rate, which was very good (continental). My favorite was the delicious hot croissants every morning! Complementary open bar in the afternoon/ evenings and cold drinks available 'round the clock was great value. Great selection of everything from wines &amp; liquers to sodas &amp; juices. Always had cold drinks available for guests in the lobby and computer room. Above all, the staff at the Beaufort was GREAT! Very accommodating and willing to help with everything. Always a smile. In particular, Svetlana was wonderful. After checking out and heading for Paris, we realized we had left my husband's leather jacket at the hotel. Svetlana was kind enough to have the jacket shipped to us in France (at our expense) with no problem. We had the jacket within a few days. This really made us appreciate the level of service at the Beaufort. Truly an enjoyable stay. We would recommend to everyone going to London. We will be back for sure next time we're in London.	
May 21 2009 	locationclean boutique hotel	my vife and my son enjoy staying in this nice boutique hotel.Very clean,excellent service,quiet.All around with nice restaurants,very near to Harrods,Harvey NicolsSloane Street...etc.	
May 20 2009 	Fabulous Staff Excellent Service and Awesome Beds!	My husband and I spent the weekend at The Beaufort for my 50th birthday. The staff at the hotel made it a truly memorable experience. From the &quot;Happy Birthday dog&quot; that greeted me from atop the bed upon our arrival (assembled by the staff from bath towels. It needs to be seen to be appreciated!) to getting us a last minute dinner reservation at a popular Knightsbridge restaurant, the staff delivered flawless service.The hotel is located on a quiet street in the heart of Knightsbridge. You have immediate access to Harrods, dozens of boutiques, great restaurants, a nearby Tube station and excellent bus lines.Our room, a junior suite, was comfortable and spacious. The decor is pleasant, but it's time for an update. My only complaint was the shower; minimal pressure and never truly hot. But the comfort of the bed more than made up for any other shortcoming! It was absolutely one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.While The Beaufort is not inexpensive, considering its location, the staff attention, and the complimentary offerings (full continental breakfast, afternoon tea and scones, and wine and drinks in the evening), I would rate The Beaufort good value for the money	
May 19 2009 	Wonderful stay at Beaufort	Lovely, clean, quiet boutique hotel , a few steps away from Harrods and a wonderful shopping area. Staff were helpful and pleasant at all times. Having your breakfast and tea served in your room on impeccable Wedgewood china was a welcome plus. Will definitely stay there again on my next trip to London.	
May 18 2009 	This was our 20th Wedding Anniversary - EVERYTHING just HAD to be RIGHT!	And the Beaufort certainly did not disappoint us. From check-in to check-out this hotel exceeded our expectations. The location is on a side street &quot;just around the corner&quot; from almost anything either a leisure traveler or business traveler could possibly want. The Knightsbridge Tube station was just a couple of blocks away. Even as &quot;first-timers&quot; using the tube, it was our favorite way of getting around London in only a matter of minutes. The Beafort's central London location, combined with it's proximity to the tube made it the perfect launching point for any of our daily excursions. The staff were incredibly helpful with dining suggestions. ALL OF THEIR reccommendations were spot on for our tastes. We've only been home for a matter of hours, and we're already looking at our schedules to see when we can return. And when we do, there's not another hotel choice that we would consider.	
May 17 2009 	lovely quiet centrally located	My daughter and I stayed at the Beaufort for three nights. The staff were gracious and helpful. The hotel, though small, felt large. Staff makes every effort to make you feel at home. Close to Brompton Rd and tube stop, but quiet and relaxing. Rooms have everything one needs. Absolutely lovely. Nancy Kahn	
May 15 2009 	charming hotel with a welcoming atmosphere and with generous complimentary benefits.	This is a quite a find in the centre of London's fashionable Knightsbridge. The rooms are small but very tastefully furnished with a very comfortable bed . The bathroom was large and well fitted out. with a powerful shower. Our room was quiet and we had a very restful overnight stay. The staff were helpful and friendly and ensured that we knew all about the complimentry, cream tea served from 3pm - 5pm delicous! plus complimentary drinks served from the bar from 3pm until 11pm- amazing! The hotel has two small lounges-both charming although I preferred the reception lounge . there is not a dinning room so breakfast is served in your room on a tray , this is not included in the room rate and is extra. The hotel is very convenient for museums and shops and situated in a very pleasant road. We will be visiting again.	
May 14 2009 	Highly Overpriced B	Just spent 4 nights at this small b&amp;b. This is not a &quot;hotel&quot;. The Beaufort is billed as a top boutique hotel however this is simply not the case. While it is in a great location in Khightsbridge and the staff are very good, you will be staying in what was once a residential townhouse. The only facility to speak of is the combined reception/lounge/self-serve bar on the ground floor. A small windowless sitting room with computer is located in the basement. That's it!!!The small rooms are clean but very basic. Comments regarding our stay in a fourth floor room are;Bath amenities very basic, just a small selection of the usual shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion with a sewing kit and 2 bars of hand soap. One burnt-out light bulb in bathroom was never replaced. Half roll of toilet paper not replenished and no extra roll placed in the bathroom. At USD325/night, simply not acceptable. Floor boards very noisy and while the room is very small, as soon as you walk to the bathroom, sqeaky noise and cannot be avoided. Small safe is located on the floor of the wardrobe and you can only use if on your hands and knees. Basic wardrobe with plain shelves. TV is a small computer-type monitor and needs to be replaced with proper size lcd tv. One day you get a couple of chocolates, another day not. Going to basement to use internet was surprised to see hotel supplies stored in the corridor. Nice open bar set-up in the small reception area and afternoon tea with scones are good. Beaufort is nearby plenty of restaurants. Highly recommend the Brompton Bar &amp; Grill for upscale continental as well as the Cafe Rouge for Frehcnh bistro fare.Room Service comes from nearby outside restaurants.We would not return to this &quot;b&amp;b&quot; and prefer a more typical &quot;hotel&quot; with facilities to match.	
May 5 2009 	lovely hotel	Visited easter weekend. Coffee, Tea, and open bar were delightful amenities. Also received complimentary &quot;Easter Egg &quot; in room. Roomy accomodation, updated bathroom, near Harrods and tube-all in all a good value in a city known for over the top expense.	
Mar 31 2009 	Charming Lovely 	My husband &amp; I have just returned from London where we spent three wonderful nights at the Beaufort. This is the most charming, lovely boutique hotel in the most perfect location with an incredible staff to assist you with all of your needs. To be exact the hotel is about 1 block from Harrod's. We had a lovely room that looked like it was almost brand new. Very clean and nicely decorated. There were lovely fresh flowers in the room every day. We had booked the &quot;King Deluxe&quot; room. The room was a very nice size with a lovely modern bathroom on the fifth floor. It was very quiet and we slept so well every night. I would say that the room was quite large by European standards. We had a king bed (very comfortable) with a a cozy little sitting area with a small couch and coffee table. There was also a nice writing desk in the room and a little alcove with a mirror . The room was always freash and clean when we returned every evening.One of the best things about the Beaufort is the breakfast brought to you room every morning, afternoon tea and an open bar where all the liquor is included in the cost of your room. How many hotels have a complimentary bar? It was very nice to have that option. There was always wine, champagne and a very nice variety of spirits. I forgot to mention the delicious homemade scones served in the afternoon. They just melted in your mouth. I returned one afternoon looking very tired and the first thing they said at the front desk was &quot;may we bring some hot tea and scones to your room&quot;. Of course I said yes. Lena &amp; Svetlana at the front desk were very helpful in making dinner reservations for us and getting us theatre tickets at a good price. I just can't say enough about the staff at the Beaufort. They are all wonderful!! They made us feel so welcome and made our trip to London very special.As a travel agent I would recommend the Beaufort to all my clients and definitely stay there the next time I trave to London.	
Mar 22 2009 	Perfect Stay	I traveled to London for a long weekend with two friends. We shared a double room with an extra bed and we still had plenty of room. I was pleasantly surprised to see that we never had to ask for a third set of anything. There were enough towels and toiletries and they were replaced each day. We were on the basement floor and had a lounge on the floor nearly to ourselves; it was almost like having a two-room suite. The only drawback was some work being done just outside our window which was quite noisy. The Beaufort's afternoon tea (which is included) was wonderful! It was served in our room (you could have it in the lounge, also). There was a pot of tea, milk, fresh scones, jam and clotted cream. It was a relaxing afternoon break, indeed! Day or night, we could help ourselves to drinks which were included in the room price. There is a fridge in each lounge and you simply help yourself to whatever you'd like. (The fridges are stocked with water, sparkling water, sodas and juices) Alcoholic beverages are also available in the evenings. Breakfast is served in the room each morning. Coffee, juice, cereal, fruit and toast were all included. We paid to add on eggs and they were cooked perfectly.The location of the hotel is fantastic. You are steps from Harrods and other boutiques in Knightsbridge as well as the tube. Very convenient. Three women traveling alone we felt very safe, even walking home late at night.This is not for bargain shoppers, but it was a good price for all that we got. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to London.	
Mar 16 2009 	Location Location Location	I stayed at the Beaufort from Mar 7 thru March 15, this hotel was a great experience, it is a small boutique hotel, the service was impeccable, the breakfast was great, the scones and tea service wonderful. They offer free drinks from 3-11pm. I had a wonderful experience there and would 100% recommend this hotel. The location is superb, one block from the tube station and one block from Harrods and the fabulous Sloane street which is full of high end designers. Great value and worth the money. My only complaint is the lack of television stations to view, but really who travels to watch television.	
Mar 16 2009 	Oasis in Kensington	The Beaufort Hotel , in Beaufort Gardens, just a few hundred yards down from Harrods, is centrally located and in a peaceful location. The hotel is clean, staff are very attentive to all needs and accommodation is brilliant. The hotel offers a complimentary cream tea each day between 3.00 and 5.00 pm. A free bar offers alcoholic drinks from 3.00 till 11.00 pm, or soft drinks all day. The continental breakfast is very nice either served in your room at no extra cost or in the residents lounge. It is a small hotel, but this is in its favour as it gives it a nice cosy feel.	
Feb 10 2009 	Lovely hotel great location!	Me and my partner stayed at The Beaufort on the 7th of Feb and had a great experience.When we arrived we found our room had been upgraded to a suite on the 5th floor! Although not as large as I had expected, it was still very decent and had the most massive bed which was very comfy! The only thing that stops me rating the hotel 5*'s was that the quality of the rooms was not as luxurious as I imagined from the website. Saying that, they were decorated with a contemporary style and were very clean, cosy and relaxing!We tried the amazing complimentary afternoon tea and homemade scones which came out freshly baked-delicious! There was a free residents bar from 3-11pm in the reception area and you could help yourselves to a wide selection of drinks including champagne (pink+white!). This alone, makes it such good value for money!Thestaff were friendly, attentive and unassuming and on top of all this we were just seconds away from Harrods - perfect!	
Feb 6 2009 	One Of Londons Best Kept Secrets!	We just returned from a weekend in London staying at the Beaufort Hotel and had the most wonderful time! The Beaufort is a lovely small hotel with excellent service from the minute we arrived until we left. We never wanted to leave the hotel to go shopping or to a show, but as we were there only a short time, we had to. The afternoon tea is one of the best I have ever had and breakfast in your room overlooking the square is a lovely experience. What I also liked was that although the staff were there, they never bothered us yet were there to help if we ever needed anything! ALL IN ALL WE HAD A WONDERFUL STAY AND I WOULD GIVE THE BEAUFORT HOTEL 10/10 and we are definitely going to go back whenever we arrange a trip to London again.	
Jan 28 2009 	Don't look elsewhere that's the best...	3rd trip to London, always had bad experiences with the hotels, it always has been too expensive and not enough &quot;nice&quot;... This one was definitely the best for a young swiss like me. I stayed with my girlfriend, we're both 20 years old and we loved this place. It's lovely for couples of young people, and it's so close from Harrods and other great places. We're there for sale time, and we're served. Check the special offers, there are always some interesting things if you buy directly from their website (I paid 20 £ more than with a booking website, but I had a 50£ voucher at harrods and I've been uprgraded to a junior suite for free..) Thanks again again and again :-)	
Jan 13 2009 	Lovely hotel	The Beaufort is propably the most perfect place to stay in London. Beautifully furnished, clean, very good beds, large bathrooms. Hidden in a quiet cul de sac of Brompton road just 5 minutes from Harrods and Knightsbridge tube station. And let's not forget the complimentary drinks...	
Jan 11 2009 	pleasure to stay herer	I had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful hotel last week, albeit for just one night , but I was not disappointed, From the reception desk to the facilities it was faultless.The room was warm and bottled water chocs and biccies. The room was spacious, and the bathroom was huge, with lovely towelling robes.The afternoon tea was sumptious with home made scones. and a free bar, we had to pay extra for alcholic drinks , but soft drinks were included. The business centre had free internet access with nibble of olive etc in the room......staff were very friendly......... overall a wonderful expereince plus it was two mins walk to Harrods and the Picadilly line.... will certainly stay there again	
Jan 7 2009 	Our favorite London hotel	We have stayed at The Beaufort for a week in each of 2007 and 2008 and have absolutely loved it each time! The staff were always friendly, helpful, and service for tea and scones (included in our room price) or breakfast (also included with the Christmas special rate) was prompt and courteous. The breakfast and tea/scones are absolutely delicious! We could not recommend this hotel more highly! The staff helped us plan things to do and restaurants to go to during the week of Christmas all via email. It is two blocks from Harrod's. We really cannot imagine staying anywhere else in London.	
Dec 1 2008	The Beaufort was delightful	It was a lovely, quaint, comfortable place for my first visit to London with my daughter. Would definitely stay again.	
Dec 1 2008	Good Small Hotel in Good Location	A nice small hotel of 29 rooms, located in Knightsbridge a block south of Harrod's in a quiet cul-de-sac. Hotel inviting, with personal service from a nice young staff. Clean and well-decorated.Tea and free drinks are available in the lobby lounge from 3:00pm on. A small lounge/reading room is downstairs, with free coffee and a computer for reading e-mails.The hotel is located in two connected townhouses, which makes the interior full of small passageways with a somewhat confusing interior layout. Our basic room was rather small, but with a large modern bathroom. Room was nicely decorated, and everything in the hotel is very clean.The location is quite good, with all Knightsbridge outside the door: the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Museum of Natural History, Kensington Palace and Park, etc. We found several very good and moderately-priced restaurants near-by.	
Nov 18 2008 	Perfect Boutique Hotel	Spent one week at this wonderful hotel! As one of two couples staying here, I can honestly say that all four of us were pleasantly suprised at all the amenities and courtesy we recieved. Svitzlana (asst mgr) made reservations, gave us travel advice, booked train tickets, gave wonderful advice on local pubs, and was an important part of the reason we loved our stay! Every employee was concerned for our comfort and extremely friendly (thanks, Svitzlana and Uri). The lobby area (where the bar is located) was always full of nice people and we met many interesting travelers. This boutique hotel, located on a lovely tree-lined cul-de-sac, was very quiet and had no traffic noise. Centrally located, we had no problems getting anywhere by underground or on foot.Our room was large, clean and very comfortable, even though we had to walk stairs from the 4th to 5th level, as the lift only went to 4th floor. This was no problem!I can't compliment the staff enough, and we will definitely stay here again. Thank you Beaufort Hotel!!	
Oct 28 2008 	Hollyday in London	The hotel have a cosy atmosphere. The services are good, the localization is fantastic, saving money from transport. The employess are lovelly and helpful.	
Oct 26 2008	Beautiful but beware the basement rooms!!!	We have just returned from a weekend at The Beaufort and on the whole have to agree with all the other reviews.It truly is a beautiful hotel, very well located and with the little extras such as the complimentary bar and cream teas (delicious).However I would advise anyone to check which room they have been allocated before confirming a booking. Room 4 is a very small basement room, only room for a bedside cabinet on one side of the bed. It did have a small window which looked out onto ventilation shafts and drain pipes but we were unable even to tell what the weather was like. The mobile signal is non existant - important when you have left children with a relative. There was one fresh flower in the room and two after dinner sized chocolates. The bathroom was lovely, however the flooring in the bedroom was &quot;cheap&quot;, poorly laid laminate, the bed was comfortable but one of the throws on the bed had stains on it. We were able to hear the guests in Room 3 using the bathroom facilities and guests in the lounge talking late into the night. We did ask to change rooms but apparently the hotel was fully booked.All said a great hotel but do avoid the basement rooms	
Oct 24 2008 	Enjoyed the Beaufort Hotel great location...	We just returned from London where we had a wonderful stay at the Beaufort Hotel in Knightsbridge. Very comfortable, welcoming staff.The room was small by American standards but very nice. While I would have preferred to have better control of the temperature, opening the window worked just fine. Free bottled water in the room, chocolate in the evening with a nice turndown service. We are still not that crazy about English showers but it was alright at the hotel. I like a bit more water pressure though but I am being nitpicky.We stayed on the third floor at the back of the hotel with a view over the roof tops. One word to those who are claustrophobic, the elevator is very, very small. Two people maximum with out luggage... believe me there was no room for it. But it works fine and the staff brought up all our bags.Nice extra's, cream tea in the afternoon included, wine and beer in the evening included, use of the computer in the lounge and we could print our boarding passes.The hotel took good care of us and we would definitely return.	
Oct 10 2008 	Excellent location	Excellent location, great staff, excellent value for money. I f you are lookig for a casual and friendly atmosphere, that's the place to stay ! We'll be back for sure.	
Oct 9 2008	Great for a 'Special Day'	This is my third stay. Well worth the cost for a special occasion such as an anniversary if coming to London, going to a show and visiting Harrods. - Food (Breakfast / afternoon tea) top knotch and plenty of nice touches.	
Aug 14 2008 	Great short break	A well priced, small Hotel in the exclusive shopping area of Knightsbridge in London. The rooms are small in size but stylish in design and amenities. It is run by a very helpful, cheerful and courteous group of people. Our stay there certainly added to the enjoyment of our short break in London.	
Aug 13 2008	Beaufort the best	We stayed at The Beaufort Hotel last week.Our staying was wonderful.The hotel it's very nice ,clean,the front desk it's excellent,and very helpfull,to give you recommandations anddirections. The rooms are very beautiful and quiet.If you come on vacation or for work it's very nice to stay in a peaceful street.The location is the best.Right next to Harrods,ready for shopping!! We will be back atThe Beaufort and we will recommend this hotelto everybody who want an unforgettable stay in London.Ilaria Gabbrielli-Marco Donati( Florence Italy)	
Aug 10 2008 	absolute luxery!	i recently stayed at the beaufort for mine and my partners anniversary!! from the moment we got their it was beautiful and peaceful, and very romantic with the music playing in the room when we entered! We loved it so much we wish we hadn't booked to go to see the lion king at the thearte, all we wanted to do was relax! the complimentary bar was amazing, sipping on champagne before going out. We only stayed there for 1 night and i wish we could of stayed for more. absolutely enjoyed out stay.	
Jul 28 2008 	lovely charming very friendly and helpful	My daughter and I stayed at the Beaufort for two days in July, the staff made us so very welcome, the room was small (as expected) but very comfortable. What great bathrooms! Tea was lovely. The staff made us dinner reservations, show reservations etc. I would highly recommend the Beaufort to anyone. Location is PERFECT!!! Cant wait to return for a longer stay!	
Jul 3 2008 	A welcoming small hotel in Knightsbridge with cream tea and bar	I really enjoyed by one-night stay at The Beaufort. I got a very warm welcome when I arrived and was shown to my very comfortable room. The reception gave some helpful suggestions about where I might go for dinner. The hotel runs an open bar so on my return I poured myself a generous whisky and retired to my bedroom for a hot bath and then bed with a good book.The following morning for breakfast I had a delicious freshly made omelette delivered to my room at the time I'd specified. I managed to squeeze in some shopping into my schedule so I was relieved to be able to go back to the hotel in the afternoon for the complementary scones and tea..... the scones were so delicious that I even asked for the recipe.This is a small hotel with a very homely feel very close to Harrods. The staff are very helpful about checking out and finding parking spaces.Thoroughly recommended.	
Jun 9 2008 	London Visit	Booked through IAPA and enjoyed our nights stay very much. Nice room - complimentary drinks, tea/scones and breakfast included. Our son was inlcuded in the complimentary drinks.Comfortable but small room with wi-fi and large bathroom. the staff were very efficient and pleasant.	
Jun 9 2008 	Great little hotel	Travelling as a family, we booked a junior suite (295 pounds/night) with use of the sofa bed for our teenage daughter (extra charge 40 pounds). This was a perfect choice for a 2 night busy shopping&amp;theatre weekend in London. We loved this hotel, but it's a very easy-going style of hotel. If you like the flashy luxury 5 star style, look somewhere else.Positives: I had requested a room on a higher floor, with view and away from the lift and this had been taken into account. Our room No 43 overlooked the Beaufort Gardens cul-de-sac and was situtated as far away from the lift as possible. The room was pretty small for a junior suite but OK by London standards. Very nicely decorated and with trendy cusions and nice darkwood modern furniture and a flat screen TV. The location is excellent, just 1 minute away from Harrods and the busy Brompton Road but removed from the noise and very quiet. We slept with the window open and didn't get disturbed at all by the traffic. The complimentary 'bar' (= help youfself fridge/cupboard in the lobby) is a nice touch instead of expensive in-room minibars and we enjoyed a glass of fresh white wine - which we brought up to our room - upon our return from a busy day. Reception staff was very friendly, smiling and efficient and helped with all our restaurant bookings, taxis etc.Negatives (although very minor):On our first night we came back from dinner to find the sofa bed was not prepared. After a call to reception, housekeeping arrived literally within 2 minutes to fix it - so no big deal. Housekeeping staff was very apologetic.The bathroom was a bit on the cramped side and could do with some refreshening (paint peeling of on corner of furniture). Also, there not very much cupboard space for 3 adults - enough for a short stay though. Breakfast is not included and added at 8.50/per person is just the very basic choice. Also the breakfast room is small. We opted for breakfast in one of the many coffee shops on Brompton Road - good choice, convenient and mcuh cheaper!	
Jun 3 2008 	LOVED THE BEAUFORT	we found the hotel to be very comfortable, unique and quaint. it was located on a quiet side street, close to harrods, restaurents, museums etc. the staff were fantastic, they took such good care of us, which was no easy feat as we were eleven ( family trip)	
Jun 3 2008 	Fine hotel but when is a suite not a suite?	We stayed at The Beaufort Hotel in Knightsbrige for 2 nights this past weekend..The staff were friendly and helpful, the room clean, the hotel in a fantastic location if you want to be in the middle of London and just around the corner from Harrods and Harvey Nichols without the usual traffic and noise you'd expect.The only issue we had was we were booked into a king sized suite which from the virtual tour on the website suggested it was significantly bigger than it actually was. (We chose it because we have two children) The sleep sofa was about the most uncomfortable we have ever seen with a really cheap internal design. For £375 per night we were disappointed but would recommend the hotel if you are a couple looking for a lovely location and cost is not an issue for you.	
May 4 2008 	The Perfect Stay	We absolutely loved this hotel! Modern, clean, customer oriented. The homemade scones and tea in the lounge were relaxing plus the evening cocktails and drinks were fabulous especially when you are sight seeing London with a 4 year old and 7 year old. Location is perfect! A must stay and a great value.	
Apr 30 2008 	centralelegantfriendly	went on holiday to london and cannot recommend a better hotel than the beaufort in knightsbridge.so central..easy access,very friendly staff.upmarket modern finishes.extremely comfortable.highly recommended.5	
Apr 29 2008 	Coming back for more	Last June I stayed at the beaufort and throughly enjoyed my stay. Firstly the location of the hotel is brilliant, right in the heart of london town.But more importantly I was impressed with the service and tranquilty of the hotel. The room was cosy and reminded me of home. The internet room ( I do apologise to the management for taking advantage of the free flow drinks and snacks that was provided, but the feeling of home was felt) was easy to access. The scones are delicious as well.I will be heading back to London in June and the beaufort will be my choice to stay again. Thanks guys for everything see u soon.	
Apr 21 2008	Overpriced and shocking customer service	We were very optimistic when we booked our stay at the Beaufort Hotel. The location can't be faulted, but the hotel doesn't quite execute it's great ideas.The staff were aloof and I was told at check in that breakfast was included in our rate - so it should have been at just short of £1000 for three nights! We carried on with our stay, hardly taking advantage of drinks in the lounge, which was so small that we preferred to stay in our room.Our room was in the basement and lacked attention to detail. Complementary chocolates - whilst correct is a little misleading. It should really say one small square chocolate each...We had the breakfast in our room and commented to one another, that we were very glad it was included - we would never have paid for it were it not included in our tariff.... When we checked out we were presented with a bill for £75 for three mornings of breakfast. Shocked, we explained that we had been told it was included otherwise we would have eaten out - we were in London at an exhibition with our business and had already found an excellent, value for money eatery near Earls Court.The receptionist didn't seem to know how to deal with our issue and before leaving the hotel, I requested that my credit card not be charged with the £75 that we disputed.Since then, the hotel manager has implied that I am a liar, and that we created this situation in order to avoid paying for their substandard breakfast! I have also been told that we were rude and that we walked out without paying - a complete fabrication!I read many reviews before booking hotels, and I would like to advise other travellers to think carefully before booking a stay at the Beaufort - there is much better value for your money available, with a higher standard of customer service, and where you won't be grossly insulted!	
Mar 26 2008 	Excellent place Excellent location Excellent people	This a really excellent hotel. This is the kind of hotel you are supposed to stay when you travel to London. Rooms are big enough. Breakfast was excellent. Staff is lovely and discreet. The window of our room didn´t close properly but it wasn´t an obstacle for an enjoyable weekend in London	
Mar 22 2008 	overpriced	Stayed for three nights in a suite, which was a very small room to be entitled 'suite'.There was obviously some form of staff accomodation above our room as we were woken each morning very early by someone getting ready - noise of shower, walking on creaking floorboards etc - not ideal for a leisurely break.Beware the 'sales pitch' on the Hotel website such as - chocolates in room on arrival - this consisted of two small after dinner sized chocolates !!! On the first day only !!No tea/coffee facilities in room !!!Guest lounge where you can get drinks and can also have breakfast is full if more than about 6 people occupy it at once - again very small.Cleanliness of room and hotel were very good but very overpriced indeed.Excellent location for Harrods, selfridges and Museums but thats about it - very disappointed.	
Mar 11 2008	Home Away From Home	In January 2007, my two adult daughters, 24 and 29, joined me on a 9 day trip to London and we stayed the entire time at The Beaufort. I was very nervous about the trip as this was my first trip abroad but to my absolutre delight The Beaufort was perfect. The service was excellent, the junior suite comfortable, clean with modern decour. The entire atmosphere was wonderful and before I knew it, I was referring to The Beaufort as &quot;home&quot; - I had initially planned to book our trip at a 4 to 5 star hotel but found The Beaufort to be a much more enjoyable stay and felt as though we were the center of attention. We especially enjoyed the afternoon tea and scones - actually I am still talking about the joy of having tea and scones brought to our room on a tray of china. The wine and other refreshments were an added bonus.The staff was more than helpful and very thoughtful. The neighbor of Knightsbridge was quiet and less tourist than other areas. We felt very much at home.A year later we are still talking about our great trip to London and The Beaufort stands foremost in our memory. We miss them. While we have opportunities to stay at other locations - I'm positive that we will return to The Beaufort and I highly recommend it as a great boutique hotel.Close to Harrods and the underground so you can easily get around the city and visit all the sights.It made our trip to London an experience of a lifetime.

Mar 10 2008	Loved the Cream Tea!	We enjoyed our weekend stay very much. The hotel location was very central for us, being just down the road from Harrods and just a few minutes taxi ride from the Royal Albert Hall where we were visiting that evening.The hotel staff were very welcoming and the checking in process was speedy. We arrived just after 3pm to be told that our cream tea would be brought to our room - what a treat and, together with a free residents bar downstairs, was included in the price of our stay.There is a lift, but beware if you are claustrophobic as it is tiny and there is only room for two people and no luggage, or for one person and luggage! However, it performed its function perfectly well so no complaints.Our double room on the third floor was compact but well furnished with modern decor and air conditioning and it had a lovely, spacious en suite bathroom, which was immaculately clean.Breakfast the next day was brought to our room - again no extra charge for this service - along with a Sunday paper so that we could have a relaxing morning.As we were only staying one night and had arranged to go out during the evening, we did not spend time downstairs in the guests' lounge, but this looked comfortable and inviting, so next time we stay at the hotel, which we plan to do this summer, we will make sure we make full use of this facility.Overall we both felt that the hotel offered good value for money and we fthought it was far more personal than a number of others at we have stayed in central London.	
Mar 10 2008	Quiet retreat in the heart of Knightsbridge	I picked the Beaufort because of the Trip Advisor reviews.I was taking my parents to London for a few days sightseeing - they are both in thier 70's. I wanted somewhere quiet, resonably priced but central to West London and West End - and I got exactly that.The staff are superb - afternoon team is a great addition to an already nice hotel experience and the free guest bar made my dear old mother very happy because she had a free afternoon aperatif! (sorry about the spelling). I do agree with one reviewer's comments that decor is starting to look a little tired and without attention this could stop me staying again at some point in future. However - right now, I am a real fan. London can often be an overpriced, overblown and dissappointing hotel experience.The Beaufort does not disappoint. Oh and did I mention, its in a really sweet and quiet cul-de-sac and only 2 mins walk from Harrods and Knightsbridge tube?.	
Mar 5 2008 	Finally a high-end boutique hotel in London! An Oasis!	After years of trying out various hotels in London, paying incredibly high prices and getting terrible quality and service, we finally found an oasis in Central London!We've stayed at the Beaufort about 4 or 5 times between November 07 and March 08. It is unmatched. The rooms are very clean and very well appointed. The lobby area, though small, is very comfortable and welcoming. The staff are some of the best we've ever come across.The only not-so-perfect thing that we've noticed in the few rooms we've stayed in is that the windows are old and not well sealed, and sometimes it gets a little drafty if it is windy outside. However, this is a very minor item in comparison to the excellent standard of everything else in the hotel. This is our first and only choice when visiting London. Well worth the price they are charging!	
Feb 22 2008	loved the Beaufort	I spent 6 nights in the Beaufort with my wife. we had a junior suite . the Beaufort is really a boutique hotel. the staff was great and the service was exceptionaly good. the only glitch was the size of the room which was too small for a suite.	
Feb 4 2008	very good but getting tierd	I agree with other reviewers - great location - rooms very good - but getting a little tiered - needs new carpets and a lick of paint - lots of sratches on the doors ect - but will stay there again	
Feb 1 2008 	Very Nice Stay	Hi we just found this website so we have several vacations to enter. Went to Europe in April 2006 and went to London, then Amsterdam and then to Paris. Very Nice Hotel with one of the better rooms we have had. Slept well and kept very busy while in London almost to busy. We recently had retired and have taken several vacations the last 3 years. London was nice and we saw as much as we could in the last three days. make sure you get to Heathrow early as we got there two hours before our flight to Amsterdam and it took almost that long to get through security. The Beaufort is a fine hotel with very friendly people working there and we want to thank them.	
Jan 31 2008 	Cute hotel great staff!	We stayed 2 nights in a standard double room with our 6 month old. Upon arrival we were advised we may find the room somewhat small with the cotbed in it. A special rate was offered for an upgrade. After inspecting the room we went ahead and stayed in the standard room. A bit difficult to move around with the cotbed in there due to the lay-out, but otherwise spacious for European standards. The staff was extremely helpful in suggesting restaurants and making reservations. They called us on our mobile to inform us of our reservation. Helping with the baby stroller up/down the stairs, arranging taxis, serving (complimentary) scones and tea in the room, and having breakfast to us a few minutes early!(!) nothing was too much trouble. Loved the complimentary mini-bar in the lobby.Great location! Right around the corner of Harrods in a cute quiet street. We would stay there again.	
Jan 25 2008 	It was just OK	I have to be honest, I just don't get the reviews this hotel is getting. It was just ok, not even good, just ok. First the location is very good--around the corner from Harrods, etc. Internet access was also very good. However I am very disappointed in the websites misleading 'photos'.  Yes I know this is a small charming hotel, in former town homes, however the photo's are SO MISLEADING!!!, taken with wide angle lenses, portraying the rooms and lobby as somewhat expansive. I had a jr. suite, and have to say, for what I paid, and the hype the website and reviews gave, well perhpas I was jaded. The rooms was small, and the rugs bordeline line dirty. The free drinks and snacks the tell you get in the room, a bag of 5 mini short bread cookies, and two mints. The drinks they tell you are available downstairs, nothing more than a mini bar down in the lobby, nothing special or unique.  I have traveled extensively, usually staying in both small and large luxury hotels--what can I say I like the bells and whistles. And that is what I expected at the Beaufort--boy was I disppointed. I won't be returning to the Beaufort. I'm sure they will miss me.	
Jan 24 2008	Excellent as always	As always the Beaufort Hotel was an oasis of tranquility in the centre of London. Lovely staff, elegant rooms and lounge and nothing too much trouble for them. Please don't stay here if you are loud and want a large hotel chain, please do stay if you want personal service, peace and quiet, and expect the same from your fellow guests.	
Nov 30 2007	Excellent hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and could not fault its location, the friendly efficient staff nor the restful decor. We would definitely not hesitate in booking the Beaufort again. Fantastic!	
Nov 30 2007 	Small Charming Hotel	my wife and i just spent 4 nights at the beaufort, this place is great!unbeatable location, lovely rooms, great inroom breakfast service, very quiet/relaxing, young, caring &amp; professional staff, free drinks in the afternoon, clean, charming, good relationship quality/price considering the very expensive city and neighborhoodwe were given room 32 which is supposed to be one of the largest double (standard) rooms: it was small but with a very large bathroom separated from the room by a few stairswe loved it and will be back!	
Nov 29 2007 	Gratitude for the charming Beaufort	There are many lovely, small hotels in London and I have stayed at and enjoyed a number of them. But I must say that the Beaufort now ranks at the top of my list. Wonderfully located (almost literally around the corner from Harrod's), it's a very pretty hotel, more contemporary than some, and yet has a gentle edge and personal style that makes one feel so comfortable. I was received at the reception desk very graciously, and offered a cream tea, which could be served either in my room or in the drawing room or the downstairs lounge. I chose my room because it was so inviting--not huge, but beautifully appointed and quiet, everything in a soft cream color with luxurious bedding and jewel-toned silk pillows and draperies. Bless the hotel Gods --it was surely one of the nicest single rooms they have to offer.The hotel also provides drinks late in the day, accompanied by olives and nuts and chips, just enough to see one through til dinner and they have a good room service menu (my breakfast arrived exactly on time).Everyone was so nice--when I needed help getting online on their communal computer, someone immediately came to my rescue. I was also impressed by how well maintained the Beaufort was--not always the case in London when a building is vintage. I only had a single night's stay (I tried to stay an additional day, but they were, understandably, booked). I hope next time it's longer.	
Nov 20 2007	Seriously recommend "the Beaufort" to all visitors to London	We were extremely delighted with our stay at the &quot;Beaufort&quot; Hotel last year that we thought we should shareour experience with other visitors.Apart from its central and most convenient location to London's major shopping district of Knightsbridge,(with Harrods just around the corner), we found that the hotel provided the upmost in comfort, congenial and pleasurable surroundings and client service to more than match what we wanted from our visit to the nation's capital.We were delighted with our room which was extremely ,tastefully furnished, providing every comfort needed. We loved also the extra 'little touches' provided by the Management - complimentary scones, jam and cream; and the perfect way to relax after a long day spent shopping to have and enjoy ,complimentary drinks from the bar .We found the service provided by the Hotel's Management team, extremely good. They were prepared to go that 'extra yard' to be helpful and ensure that our stay at the hotel and our visit to London was indeed a memorable one.I/We would highly recommend the hotel to any discering visitor to London - and our best recommendation is to say that we will certainly be returning there when we visit London next.Ms Jillian Menon	
Nov 16 2007	A touch of paradise	The Beaufort has all that classic charm you would expect from a boutique hotel in the heart of Knightsbridge. The hospitality is impeccable with the staff being the friendliest and most cheerful I have encountered in a hotel. In the hub of one of the nicest parts of London, the hotel is in a quiet, quintessential London street yet only moments from Harrods, shops, transport, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. The hotel has the comforts of home, from the warm &quot;good morning&quot; when breakfast arrives to the ability to have a relaxing champagne in the evening. The rooms are tastefully decorated and the little extras do count for a lot - water, biscuits, chocolates and of course delicious scones for high tea in the afternoon.This is a great find in the heart of London.	
Nov 12 2007 	Relaxing break	If you like small boutique hotels then this is the one for you. Just around the corner in a quiet tree lined street from the hustle and bustle of Harrods. The room we had stretched from the front to the back of the hotel and so had windows at both ends. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed.Positives: Our room was quiet and comfortable. The free residents bar is a definate plus with a good selection. Soft drinks are available free any time of the day and night free of charge. The staff are polite and friendly. The flat screen TV was good with a variety of international channels. The bed was really comfortable. The morning paper was complementary with a further good selection available in the lounge.Negatives (really nitpicking!): The water in the shower had a weak flow - not close to the power shower effect. I asked the receptionist to recommend a resturant locally and she had to resort to &quot;google&quot; a reply.If you want a centrally located, small boutique hotel in London then this is ok. At the &quot;best available&quot; internet rate it is value for money. I would recommend an upgraded room because the aspect of these is good. The receptionist also recommended this and offered to show us different rooms if we wished to see the difference.	
Sep 27 2007 	The Beaufort - A great night in Knightsbridge	We stayed at the hotel when we attended a wedding in London and had a very enjoyable stay. Very well located for all the well known shops in the area and has the fantastic offering of afternoon tea and a bar all included in the price! Excellent find with another date in the diary!	
Sep 9 2007 	Elegant and sophistacated hotel	This was my second time to stay in the hotel and it surpassed my first experience....it has a great location in a safe and sophistacated area of London with ample of restratants and Harrods just around the corner with Krispy Kreme donuts!The first time myself and my mother stayed there were over for my first and only wedding dress fitting...the staff were very friendly but the room was very stuffy with only one window which led to a small courtyard that had no exit, which made me uncomfortable in case of a fire etc. However, the hotel has so much to offer that the second time we stayed there (to collect my dress) we requested a larger room which had more space and better views etc and when we checked in we were upgraded to the junior suite...Included in the price there was an open bar from three pm onwards...after collecting my dress we decided to head back to the hotel, as we were mentally exhausted, we decided to have a glass of champagne with olives and of course it led to a bottle and a half of champagne....all included in the price!!!top hotel for fellow travels who are looking for a home away from home!	
Aug 31 2007 	Fantastic	What an amazing time we spent in this hotel. The only negative thing to report was the size of the room, (a deluxe).The staff were excellent, they could not have been more helpful. Afternoon tea was worth leaving the shops for!!The help-yourself mini bar in the foyer (free from 3-11pm) was gratefully appreciated!!! It was well stocked with wine, champagne, spirits etc. It even had cocktail mixers!It took about 90 seconds to walk to Harrods, and the tube.I will certainly return- however, breakfast is so expensive there, so advisable to eat out in one of the many nearby restaurants.	
Jul 24 2007	a relaxing pleasure in a great location	This is a beautifully appointed boutique hotel located in the midst of everything. I found everyone so pleasant and responsive. I especially appreciated the prompt response of technical help with wifi and room service. This is a place to enjoy again and again.	
Jul 15 2007 	What a pleasure!	Our family arrived weary from an assortment of Italian lodgings. We were delighted to be in such a charming and comfortable environment. The hotel is immaculate and thoughtfully appointed. It is technologically well-equipped. There are two public areas for gathering and relaxing. The staff was knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Great location. We highly recommend the Beaufort and hope to return.	
Jun 29 2007 	Great Little Boutique Hotel	Situated in a quiet garden cul-de-sac in the heart of Knightsbridge the Beaufort is wonderfully located. The hotel is nicely decorated and not overly done. The room was slightly small for the cost but was clean and well furnished. Staff very efficient, helpful and knowledgeable.	
May 21 2007 	We absolutely loved The Beaufort Hotel in London!	We had a wonderful experience at The Beaufort Hotel in London. The hotel is charming and extremely comfortable...with complimentary cocktails from 3p to 11p every day! The room was just perfect and the location of the Beaufort is within walking distance of all of London's interesting sites. We will definately stay at the Beaufort again.Todd and NancyMichigan	
May 11 2007	Tea at 33	The Porter greeted us as we arrived in Beaufort Gardens. Our Bags were taken care of and we were checked in and in our Suite within 5 minutes. After opening the terrace doors, taking in the sunshine and jumping on the bed in utter delight, we ordered a Cream Tea. All i can say is....wow.The Rooms are all very well furnished, the Guest Lounge is equally impressive and the staff could not do enough for us, from organising babysitting to sorting out our congestion charge, nothing was too much trouble.After coming back from a party late at night, we unfortunately missed the free bar offered by the hotel, however we were allowed to sit and demolish our own Champagne and Krispy Kreme doughnuts until the early hours.It is our hotel of choice when in London.	
Apr 30 2007 	Great stay at the Beaufort	A wonderful boutique hotel. Very close to Harrods and very central with many restaurants and shopping in walking distance. The hotel is very clean and nicely furnished. My room while small, but that is to be expected in Europe, was very comfortable and stylish. The staff was very responsive and helpful. i had arrived very late and the young lady at the front desk went out of her way to call local restaurants to see which were open late so that i would not be inconvenienced. There was a free bar in the evening which was unexpected. While my stay was brief, literally overnight, it was very plesant and i thought it was a good value for the money. will definitely return and will recommend to others.	
Apr 23 2007 	Charming Beaufort Hotel	Lovely and comfortable. A very beautiful hotel!	
Apr 12 2007 	Problems on Second Visit	I have stayed at the Beaufort twice. The first stay was very pleasant although the room was tiny. The most recent stay was not as nice. The elevator was not working and as I have trouble walking so we were put in the basement room 1. It was larger but open to the street and outdoor lights shined all night. There was noise from the reception area above. The location is very convenient to Harrods and the service is fine although there seem to be hardly more than 2 or 3 staff around most of the time. They do a nice afternoon tea and offer free drinks in the evening,	
Mar 16 2007	Ssssoooooo relaxing	This is a beautiful hotel. A lovely place to return after a day out in London. The staff are helpful and friendly and everything done just right. Comfortable whether relaxing in your room or one of the Beaufort's common rooms.....but keep this a secret! ;-)	
Aug 22 2006 	Fit for Madonna	A long review but worth the read! If you want a quick review here's a simple sentence - STAY AT THE BEAUFORT ITS THE PERTECT HOTEL FOR A VISIT TO LONDON!At the last minute on of my friends supprised me with tickets to see the Madonna Birthday concert, on the Confessions tour. I couldn't believe it!!! The only problem was I had to find a hotel that was up 'my standards'! London is such a large city with thousands of hotels - so where do you start? - Knightsbridge is the answer! The Beaufort Hotel is well presented and in an ideal location - next to Harrods - where I managed to fit in some shopping in my 24 hour stay. For those of you who love a good cup of Coffee - Nespresso is just around the corner too. (Gave me a chance to get some more coffee and acessories for my machine) I stocked upon Ristretto to bring me back to life in mornings!!!So why choose the Beaufort among the vast array of Hotels? I have a simple answer to that - Cream Tea!!! The Beaufort offers complimentary cream tea from 3pm. A lovely English touch! There is also a complimentary bar - see the hotel website for details.The staff:Any one who knows me, knows I like things to be simple and easy - stress free. That's because In work in a stress-FULL environment. So I don't need any stress in my social life. The staff were friendly, helpful and a joy to meet. I even had chance to meet the Sales and Marketing Director - by accident really - he was in the lounge reviewing the Beaufort website -- while the cream tea was being served. I gave some feedback on the website. Its very easy to use - so I would recommend booking through there, plus you'll probably get the best price booking direct!Check in - Check OutReally simple and no problemsOverall Rating 5 out of 5!!!I've recommended the Beaufort to all my family and friends simply because the hotel, the staff and the cream tea really added up to something special. As I work within customer services its always nice to hear about the good things as well as the bad. If there are hotel awards - The Beaufort staff deserve one!GP Fradgley	
Jan 21 2006	Pleasant stay	We stayed at the Beaufort last weekend for 2 nights. It is a very pleasant hotel and like another review said, the complimentary afternoon tea and drinks in the evening are a really nice touch if you have the time to take advantage, we didn't unfortunately.We stayed in room 6, it was down a couple of steps from the entrance hall near the ladies toilet.The room was very very small and it had an enormous bed, so that didn't help, I would say it should have been a single room. One step from the side of the bed and you were in the en-suite, which was a good size compared to the bedroom. It was very difficult for my husband and myself to move around at the same time, so getting ready to go out was quite an effort, plus it was unbearably hot as the air con didn't seem to work, I had to take the front off the radiator cover to turn the radiator off.There wasn't a dressing table in the room and the full length mirror was on the inside of the door to a tiny built in wardrobe, and I mean tiny, you would not be able to stay for any length of time as there's hardly any space for your clothes plus, and this one is more for the ladies, I found it really difficult to dry my hair because of the mirror/plug situation.The room above us must have had wooden floors as we were woken both mornings at about 7am with people walking around.The hotel was in a really convenient position and it was spotlessly clean and the staff were really friendly. I would stay there again but only if we guaranteed a different/much bigger room.	
Jan 18 2006	Fantastic Value	In an overpriced London hotel market this one really stands out. Fabulous location; stylish, well thought-out bedrooms; a very sleek and inviting lobby and interesting artwork on the walls. Best of all are the little touches: free afternoon tea and scones brought to your room; free drinks  including chilled champagne  from the help-yourself bar; free movies and internet access. Of course if you dont drink tea or champagne, dont watch movies, dont like art and dont use the internet you may as well stay somewhere else. But if you do some or all of these things, youll immediately shave quite a lot of money off your bill  which is very reasonable in the first place.	
Nov 5 2005	Beaufort......do not stay in the basement	The Beaufort is a small hotel in a very nice location in central London. The place has been given a facelift recently, so it is quite pleasant. The rooms are well appointed and modern. However, the room you get is very important. One word of caution....DO NOT STAY IN THE BASEMENT!! The floors are thin as paper, the ceiling is very low (maybe 2.3M or 7 feet) and there is constant activity in the reception area over your head. Our friend stayed above ground level and said it was pleasant. Also, hotels in London are generally overpriced. You would expect the Ritz in the States for these prices, but this is just a small, relatively simple boutique hotel. One other plus; free wine and champagne all evening.	
Oct 19 2005	Better than ever	I had stayed at this hotel several times although not in the last couple of years. Imagine my surprise to see the major changes since I last stayed here. At first I wondered if I was in the right place! Gone is the cozy, comfy country house and in with the new, sleek modern style. At first I didn't like it, but then grew to love it. Although the lobby area is quite cold and unwelcoming a planned fireplace may make it more welcoming. Our room was large, immaculate and complete with all the amenities. Service remains superb with the complementary afternoon tea, bar and wonderful breakfasts served on Wedgewood China. We were in Room 3 in the basement and right across from the lounge which housed the computer (with complementary internet access) snacks, cofee and comfy chairs. We felt like we were in our own home or at least an elegant suite. One might imagine that it would make the bedroom noisy, but everything was as quiet and elegant as can be. In a very inflated London Hotel market, this little gem offers great value and I can't wait to return.	
Jun 20 2005	One of the nicest hotels in the world	The Beaufort is a gem in the middle of London. Quiet, welcoming, clean, and personal, this hotel is an oasis in the midst of busy London. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Knightsbridge--a stone's throw from Harrod's and lots of tourist attractions. But convenience is only one reason to choose the Beaufort, Warm, efficient service is another. Clean, quiet, comfortable rooms is another. Great karna and peace are two others. For business travelers, tired of another busy, transactionally-based hotel, this is a real find. For leisure travelers, looking for a warm, charning base from which to explore London, this is a great bet.	
Apr 4 2005 	In Transition	Just came back from two nights at the Beaufort, March 29-30. I have stayed at this property a number of times over 10+ years and it is clearly in transition. The floors have all been redone with laminate, which is clean and brightens things up. The common room was being renovated, so one of the guest rooms in the basement is now the place to get your drinks, coffee and there is a computer linked to the internet so you can browse. There is wireless internet that works, most of the time (and they'll get it back up if you call them to let them know it's down). The room I was in this time was quite small - definitely not for two people. The staff remain friendly and the location is still wonderful. All in all, it seems to be a work in progress - not the property that was once written up in Gourmet, but not sure where it's headed. There's enough attraction here to stick with it for a while longer, presuming the price doesn't rise, to see what it turns into.	
Mar 29 2005	Worn out	My wife and I sayed here just before Christmas. The hotel is superbly located in Knightsbridge close to Harrods, but that is where the good news ends. Sure, it looks marvellous on the web site but the hotel needs a serious upgrade. Rooms are TINY. Cleanliness average.	
Mar 21 2005 	Dont get room 1	I stayed here for one night and I am not sure I would stay agin. The reception is looking a bit worn but the welcome was fine. I was shown to a duluxe room in basement...it was a big nicely furnished room although I would have preferred a carpeted floor. There was no working air conditioning so I had to leave window open ensuring I was awake from 5 when milk arrived. The staff started letting the kitchen door slam at 6 and the movies and internet didnt work to fill in the time until my breakfast arrived! Nice handy setting though but not worth the money especially if you had paid full rack rate	
Jan 28 2005 	Small but beautifully formed	As a single woman who travels regularly to London, I felt very secure &amp; comfortable here. My standard double room was small, fine for one but not for two people. It was romantically furnished with draping voiles, a fur throw &amp; silk cushions and very clean. The staff were all helpful &amp; friendly. The location is excellent, in the heart of Knightsbridge, but in a no-through road so you get a good night's sleep away from the traffic. I would recommend this hotel if you are tired of characterless chain hotels.	
Jan 26 2005	Excellent Hotel	We stayed at this hotel the weekend before Christmas and it was busy, the staff charming and the service excellent. The complimentary afternoon tea was most welcome after a day out in the bustle of the Christmas shoppers, and returning in the evening was a pleasure when we could help ourselves to a nightcap. The room was perfect and the bathroom was far larger than normal for a London hotel. I can't wait to go back...............	
Nov 17 2004	in love with london and the beaufort	Just returned from a wonderful trip to visit my daughter who is studying for the year in london and i have to say that the beaufort and the terrific staff were one of the highlights of the trip. we enjoyed the elegant suites, the free internet and business center, great morning coffee and breakfast, well stocked bar and snacks, afternoon tea and especially the warm and friendly staff - each and every one of them were so kind and helpful - always eager to do something nice - we even had the opportunity to meet the owner (delightful!!) and she was most gracious to show us the other suites throughout the hotel. all in all, the beaufort is a special haven to return to after a busy day in london and we look forward to returning again. I would recommend this particular hotel to persons who are looking for a cozy and more personal atmosphere and attention to detail.. and, of course, the location is just perfect!!! -	
Nov 16 2004	A 3 STAR HOTELS AT 5 STAR PRICES	Having read so many positive reviews I was looking forward to my stay, albeit a short one. Having stayed at other Hotels in the immediate area I was aware of what a great location Beaufort Gardens offered. But what a letdown, from the moment the porter and myself tried to fit into a miniscule lift and then had to travel through a rabbit warren of narrow hallways and multiple doors before finally arriving at the room. This was not a room decorated in the manner of those represented on the website and definitely not worthy of a 5 star rating. However, the bathroom was large and light and bright. I pre-ordered a taxi for the following morning to Paddington Station but found a limousine had been ordered instead for a 5 minute journey. I HAVE STAYED AT MANY 5 STAR HOTELS IN LONDON AND THE BEAUFORT CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE CLASSIFIED AND PROMOTED IN THIS CATEGORY.	
Oct 28 2004	Beaufort Hotel	I was staying at Beaufort Hotel from 23rd till 27th of October. The rooms are very nice, the location as well (Knightsbridge). The only problem - unprofessional staff. I reserved the room online by credit card - 50 GBP were paid in advance. Upon arrival mistakenly I give another one for pre-authorisation. Noone has told me that the second card will be blocked as well. As a result - both cards were blocked for the full amount of staying + 100 GBP!!! for security reasons!!! By check out the card was charged for the third time!!! Both previously blocked cards are still blocked and willl be unblocked in one week earliest!!! The name of the guy who was in charge of this &quot;nice&quot; transaction is Benjamin!!! Take care!!!	
Jul 8 2004	Not what I expected...	I usually would not do this but I wanted other travelers to know about my experience at the Beaufort and judge for themselves. I was there for a total of 7 days, mainly for business. The staff were very friendly and helpful for the most part. There was only one lift that was very small. You have to leave your key at the front desk before you leave and get it when you come back. You order your complimentary breakfast through the reception each night and it did come promptly every time. Phone messages are handled through the operator (you don't get a voicemail box) so I had people saying that my line kept ringing and couldn't leave me a message. I did receive some messages though when the call got redirected back to the operator. The complimentary e-mail and movies were the main reasons why I chose the hotel as well as the location. It was great until the system went down for a few days (they couldn't get it fixed right away for some reason). The phone charges were higher than in other London hotels. The complimentary drinks were nice. The front door is locked after a certain time at night so you have to ring the bell for the reception to open it. Finally, they put me in a room where there was some construction work going on above me so I'd hear it on the days I got back early. I probably wouldn't stay there again but others obviously enjoyed their stay there. It's up to you...	
May 17 2004	Enjoyed the Beaufort Immensely! We will return!	Everyone's taste is different and those who have provided less than gracious reviews are certainly entitled to their opinions; however, I found many wonderful things about the Beaufort, most importantly, feeling safe and secure as a business woman traveling overseas. My husband and I have traveled to the UK extensively. We found the Beaufort only about 2 years ago, and whenever travels allow a stop or visit in London, we stay at the Beaufort. I have stayed also as a business woman traveling alone and have always felt very secure. Our rooms have been charming and clean each time. We have had rooms in the front with a balcony (our favorite!) and several times on the back side. Yes, we've had to climb the stairs, but there is a lift if you can't or don't want to climb. The amenities in the room are wondeful. The staff has been always gracious; especially after a long trans-atlantic flight...they always deliver a tray with breakfast up to our room upon arrival without a second thought!The location is a plus; it couldn't be more convenient! The museums, shopping, grocery, dining and even the Tube are close by. Please give it a try; and remember, if it's a Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt that you yearn for, you are probably bmuch etter off staying there. This is a unique, comfy, accommodating and safe property. We will return and we can't wait-requesting, of course a room with a balcony!	
Apr 28 2004	Second Stay	We just got back from our 2nd luxurylink stay at the Beaufort. As we approached the hotel, I was a bit worried -- there was some paint chipping off the front and the carpet, in the entry area, seemed a bit frayed. However, we were immediately greeted warmly and our luggage was taken up to our room, even though it was only 9 AM and the official check-in time is much later.The service was the major area of improvement: breakfast arrived on the dot; wake-up calls came to the second; the room was kept spotless; the fresh flowers were lovely; the bottled water replaced as needed; and one day we found a basket of apples in the room.The internet access was free (which is good as the keyboard is extremely difficult to use ... but we've been charged $15 per hour elsewhere for the same system); movies are also provided at no charge.And when we needed assistance, the assistance was provided .. and no one had his/her hand out for a tip (although we did leave a staff gratuity when we left).The new management has made a BIG, and positive, difference. We would be happy to stay there again.	
Apr 18 2004	The Boastforth Hotel	The Boastforth Hotel The room was ok - for a travelodge double - it was supposed to be a junior suite. Someone had gone mad with the wood grain effect paint. Fruit amounted to 3 apples, one rotten. Flowers were half dead. No internet or movies were available, and we had to find this out ourselves after struggling with instructions in German. No manager was in evidence, but staff were polite though some lacked English. If we had paid full price we would have been furious - there seems to be a very cynical pricing policy meaning you can pay 50% more if you don't find the right site to book on. On the plus side the location is great and the free bar and afternoon tea are good touches which I suspect were initiated by the original owners as now the place has the air of a money-maker run by clockwork at a distance. Can't understand the raves - I put it down to either people wanting to belong to an elite club or that I have travelled too much and stayed in some amazing places. Read all these comments and make your choice carefully	
Mar 27 2004	Wonderful Stay at Charming Boutique Hotel	I stayed at The Beaufort for 5 days in March and truly enjoyed my stay. The location is terrific--walking distance to museums in S. Kensington; tube stations and bus stops close by.I had a bright and spacious junior suite. The room was spotlessly clean and well maintained throughout my stay. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast and tea were delivered promptly to my room. I thought my room as well as the public sitting room nicely decorated. The fresh flowers throughout the property are a particularly wonderful touch.I will definitely stay at The Beaufort on my next visit to London.	
Mar 21 2004	It's a nice place	My daughter and I just spent 5 days at the Beaufort. We booked it on line so we weren't sure what we were getting but I was pleasantly surprized. In comparison to other European hotels I've stayed at the room was pretty good sized. The bathroom was huge and everything was very, very clean. The staff was helpful and courteous and prompt. We had a great breakfast brought to our room promptly every morning. If we needed anything they were right there to help. It was also a great location. Harrod's was right around he corner one way and the Albert and Victoria Museum the other way. Also a tour bus line just in front of Harrod's and a tube stop. You would never know it was so close to everything because it is a very pleasant little side street. I was also very pleased with how quiet the hotel was. You never heard any body coming or going. As to the fire doors, it just made us feel safe. We would definately stay there again and would recommend it to friends!	
Jan 19 2004	Would NOT stay there	This site has both good and bad reviews of the Beaufort but I must say that I agree more with the bad reviews. I heard it's slightly improved in the past year (perhaps they are finally starting to notice all the bad reviews) but it's still a glossily-packaged hotel that is worth much less than its cost. There is certainly a big gap between the marketing material and the real experience, as some reviewers here have already pointed out. So my suggestion to readers is this: there are so many hotels in London of this type and many of them are unanimously recognized by users as offering good value and being charming. So why take a risk with the Beaufort? No matter how many users write defending this hotel, one cannot hide the fact that SO MANY GUESTS have been very dissatisfied with their stay here. The rooms are cheaply decorated, the staff is unprofessional, and it was pain in the neck to keep climbing stairs and going through fire doors just to get to my room. As for the living room, it was small, dark and depressing. I don't know why the hotel even promotes this in their marketing, and especially as something &quot;all of London is talking about.&quot; I had a great laugh over that one. I personally would not stay here again unless they offered a room for free..and only then, just to be able to get some of my money back from my first stay.
