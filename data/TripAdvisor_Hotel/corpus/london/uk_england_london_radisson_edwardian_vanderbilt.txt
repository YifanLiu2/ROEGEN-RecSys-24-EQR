Nov 23 2009 	Never Again !	My husband and I must have been in the same room as the lady from Edinburgh. This was no way a 4 star double room. The bed was about 4ft wide and the room was so small it (the bed) was pushed hard up against the window. Therefore to get out of bed one occupant had to climb over the other. I haven't done that since a caravan holiday in Wales in the seventies !When we arrived it was about 4pm so getting dark and I didn't immediately realise why this room was so dark. As it was stuffy I opened the window and to my amazement realised that there was no 'view' just a huge air conditioning unit inches from my face !! If it had been a bright day there would still have been no natural light in this pit. The tiny cupboard known to some as a wardrobe also housed the trouser press and ironing board. There were no drawers for belongings. As we had come to visit The Royal Albert Hall I did not want to spoil my mood by having an argument about the room. Infact it was so awful we ended up laughing. Later that evening on returning to our room about 11.30 the security key card to give us entry to the corridor would not work. I went to reception and was given another card. That also failed to open the door. Back to reception to get another key. No good. The pleasant, helpful, embarrassed lad on reception arrived with the Manager's master key. No good. By now, after two glasses of wine, I had a fit of the giggles and asked if I should sleep in the lounge. We were taken on an alternative route via lots of corridors and stairs to our room. The staff were all pleasant and hard working. It is the management of this hotel who need to ask themselves if this is really 4 star. It is nothing like any 4 star hotel I've stayed in around the world.	
Nov 20 2009 	never again	Stayed 2 nights last week. Checked in. Asked if non-smoking room required - yes- but it made no difference I got a crappy smoking room at the back looking out over aircon units or some such. The television had a snowy picture -something I haven't seen since the 70s!! I got scalded by the shower as it was really difficult to set the temperature gauge and the water from the fixed head shower sprayed all over the bathroom. The lift was the slowest I have ever been in...walk if you can. Didn't risk breakfast. Won'[t be back. If you want to stay in this area go Millennium.	
Nov 19 2009 	Excellent location and super friendly staff	From start to finish, the service was excellent and the staff were delightful! The hotel is very centrally located with convenient access to buses and a tube a stone's throw away! My suite was beautifully decorated, spacious and had great views of the bustling city below, which I loved, and was very quiet. Very close to Oxford Street and shopping heaven!I can't say enough about the friendly and courteous staff, it was a real pleasure of a trip.	
Nov 19 2009 	Amazing...just stunning	Such a wonderful place to stay - comfortable, calming atmosphere; friendly, helpful and well-presented staff; the rooms are magnificent and the food was just stunning!I would reccommend this hotel to everyone!	
Nov 16 2009 	Wonderfull Place to Stay	I have just returned after spending three nights here with my husband. The purpose off our visit was a concert at The Royal Albert Hall. This was our 3rd visit to this hotel. The hotel is very good, from the cleanlieness to the friendlieness of the staff. It is a superb location for Knightsbridge, also for The Royal Albert Hall. We hope to be coming down to London again next year and will definetly stay here.	
Nov 6 2009 	Gave this place a second chance. It won't get a third.	I stayed here 4 years ago on business and did not have a good experience with the room, but work booked me in here again and I thought it might have improved. Reading other reviews I think your experience will depend on which room you get and where in the hotel it is. This time I was in a room on the 3rd floor but along a long corridor before you get to the lift. It was alleged there was a lift anyway, it made some noises when you pressed the button, but never arrived, despite assurances from reception that it was working perfectly. Had to lug case up three flights of filthy staircase - it cannot have been cleaned in months, the dust was quite deep next to the skirting board. Room was very small but OK for one night. TV a very small old type high up on the wall so you get a cricked neck watching it. Room and bathroom was very cold - no heating in bathroom at all, and I had to turn air con on full to get room up to a temperature somewhere near bearable. Yet the corridor was boiling hot?Breakfast was fine with a cheery person on duty in the dining room. The only thing really going for this hotel is the location. The exterior and the public rooms look wonderful, but it really is just a facade.	
Nov 2 2009 	A hotel with professsional and courteous staff in a great location	A professional welcome on arrival and a call to my room once I had settled in to make sure everything was fine. The breakfast room manager Cecille had a most welcoming style and made everyone at ease. The room was good with all facilities you would expect and on my last day I was able to leave luggage securely back at the hotel after checkout while I enjoyed touristy things without the bagage. The hotel is in a great location for the Natural History Museum and the V&amp;A - a 5-10 minutes walk away. It is also a minute or so from a tube station which means only a short hop on the tube to Covent Garden, Leicester Square and Harrods. What more can you ask for?	
Nov 1 2009 	Good Hotel great service	Stayed at the Vanderbilt 2 days ago, was allocated room 301, overall a good in a very good location, the underground is only 4 minnutes away, the service offered by the staff was great.	
Nov 1 2009 	great place	We have just got back from 3 nights stay at this hotel. We booked through asda as a secret hotel. Was a bargin. Room was on ground floor (24) good size double, clean and quiet over looking the street.Breakfast was good.Staff all nice and friendley. After reading some of the negative reviews on here was a little worried but worried for nothing. Location was fantastic only a couple of mins from tube, shops an resturants... Give The Green Door steakhouse a go, best meal we have had in ages...All in all fantastic stay up in london.	
Oct 30 2009 	We loved it!	We'd booked a 2 twin bed room, as the double would be too small for us. I'd asked reservatins if they could try for an upgrade, and she assured me thye'd try when we arrived. Well, that first nihgt, the front desk person said they couldn't upgrade a 2 twin room. ??? Hmmmok. Well, I tried again the next morning, and got Ahmed, who was marvelous. He put us in a lovely room with a king bed (room 102). It was spacious (compared to other London rooms) and well situated in the back of the hotel and was very quiet. Breakfast each day was wonderful with a full selction of hot and cold items. Spaciuod dining room compared to the Bonnington in Bloomsbury where they pack you in like sardines. We were directly across the street from the Gloucester Station and many shops and restaurants. I can't wait to go back!	
Oct 23 2009 	If I'd paid full price I would have been disappointed.	I got a night at this hotel at the last minute for cheap - the location is brilliant, just a minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube station and the entrance is very grand. The service at reception was OK, but I had trouble using the lift which seemed ancient and my room was teeny-tiny - the bed was only a bit bigger than a single and wedged into the corner of the room, the shower was alright but needed a re-fit. And £16 for breakfast?! I went to a local cafe instead. I wouldn't call this place a 4* - it had a far more 3* feel to it for me.	
Oct 21 2009 	LEFT SICKENED AFTER BREAKFAST WITH THE HEALTH HAZZARDS IN THIS TIME OF PANDEMICS!	I am writing to complain off a disgusting and unacceptable practice being carried out in one of your hotels, the Vanderbilt in Cromwell Road. We stayed there for two nights 25th and 26th of August at breakfast on morning one I was a little suspicious that the seal of the yoghurt had been tampered with but ate same. On morning two the same but it was not until I had taken several spoons of it that I came across pieces of paper torn off from sugar sachets in the middle. Obviously staff are refilling part used yoghurts and attempting to reseal same. Why I wonder if not a cost cutting exercise from management! I can only close by saying that what was otherwise a very enjoyable stay was ruined by the above and has left me feeling some what disgusted. What a terrible experience for our 40th wedding anniversary!One last thing is that the ordinary double rooms are extremely small..     .	
Oct 17 2009 	Don't look for any Vanderbilt here	The hotel purports to be the home of some unnamed Vanderbilt. Don't think any have been here in a long time. Front staff was pleasant enough but luggage took more than 1/2 hour and a phone call to be delivered to room. Room was very dated - it appears there have been several houses put together to make this hotel. Hallway a bit of a rabbit warren. Lift was out of service part of the time. Breakfast is not included and very overpriced. Location is great if you are wanting to spend time at Natural History Museum, V &amp; A or Royal Albert Hall.	
Oct 17 2009 	Would not stay here again	I stayed with colleagues at this hotel for one night and would not stay here again.The staff were friendly enough, the place was clean and breakfast ok. However, the rooms were awful. I was first given a room on the ground floor. To find it, you had to weave through smelly corridors. The room was the size of a small shoe box, the air stuffy and the room and corridor stunk of cheep air freshner. We arrived early, so I went back to the desk and asked if I could change to a room higher up in the hotel. The staff made no fuzz about that and offered me a room on the forth floor if I could wait until 2 pm. The room was still a tiny single room, but at least it did not stink like the previous room. The bed was rock hard, there was only one choice of pillow size - a very thick one that did not feel comfortable. The ventilation system was so noisy I had to turn it off to sleep. The bathroom was ridiculously small and very cold: no floor heating (as a matter of fact I found no heating in there at all apart from a towel rail). It had the smallest shower cabinet I have ever seen. It felt totally claustrophobic.All in all a totally disappointing experience and not one I would like to repeat.	
Oct 13 2009 	Avoid	Good location however terrible rooms. Avoid the first floor rooms (7,8) as its extremely noisy and impossible to sleep. Room 7 doesnt have a window so good luck trying to see the sun in the morning. Overall this is a terrible hotel at an exorbitant price.	
Oct 10 2009 	Great stay	Excellent location. The room was very comfortable and staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet had an average selection. I did not look at the menu so can't judge that.	
Oct 9 2009 	Very good at the right price	I stayed in a ground floor double room on a Saturday night which I had booked as a &quot;secret&quot; hotel. The room and bathroom were well equipped and comfortable but the room is only just big enough for two. It is very near Gloucester Road tube station and is within walking distance of Exhibition Road and South Kensington tube; there are frequent bus services, too.I can't quite rate this hotel as the four star it claims to be but on the plus side it had decent sized good quality towels - not always the case even four star hotels. I thought it good value at the price I paid (around £80) but I would not have been content to pay the rack rate.	
Oct 9 2009 	GREAT LOCATION GREAT BREAKFAST EXCELLANT STAFF	We stayed 3 nights. Hotel is very clean with great amenities. Location is Tremendous!! All staff were curteous, professional and pleasant. Breakfast was awesome. We were able to get online in the room at no charge. Would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel.	
Oct 8 2009 	Great Hotel Short Walking distance from tube 	From the moment that we arrived at the hotel, the staff were friendly and went out of their way to make sure that all our needs were taken care of. The room was a little on the small size (coming from American Hotels) but it was clean and had all the items you would need or want... king size bed, sofa, table etc and tea/coffee in the room.We had room service a couple of times and the food was good quality but their breakfast was one of the best i'd had in a long time...The hotel is down the street from many of London's great museums and just a cross the road is the tube station which will take you anywhere in london.The only downside, was the size of the lift in the hotel, it is so small that more then 3 adults would not fit in to it.. so most of the time we took the stairs.I would stay at this hotel again without a second thought.	
Oct 1 2009 	Excellent in every way  the staff the facilities and the location ....perfect	I booked this stay for my partner as a birthday surprise. This Hotel is in an excellent location literally 2 stops on the tube from Victoria . The hotel was first class, the staff were helpful , the facilities were excellent, the room was of a very large size with a nice view of kensington and the breakfast was very generous. I will be returning to this hotel and would recommend this to all my friends . All in all an excellent hotel .	
Sep 30 2009 	GREAT LOCATION	We had stayed in this hotel once before and it is in a perfect location. The check in staff and breakfast staff were very friendly and attentive. Breakfast was good. However, there was one concern. The bed in the room was NOT a double bed but of three quarter size which resulted in a very poor night's sleep. We were told that the bed WAS a double - obviously for VERY small people. The size of the bed may preclude a further stay.	
Sep 29 2009 	Much Nicer than expected but not perfect!	The Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt feels like a grander hotel trapped by a smaller building. The staff are helpful and friendly and the building itself is rather beautiful inside. The features are lovely, it's not too grand, but it's humbly elegant.The building has a great location, great service, and lovely rooms that are well laid out. If you are looking for a nice, reliable stay at a nice, reliable hotel with rooms that wont wow but will make you feel peaceful and at home, this is a great choice. I got my room at a bargain price and was given a complimentary upgrade since I'm rather tall. Even so my upgraded room was a bit...tight, but it did the job and then some. It was cosy, i had a great sleep despite a stressful week around the stay, and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Free wifi was a great addition and definitely is something that business travellers will appreciate.Problems: There are two very rickity old lifts. Minor issue.The air conditioning in my room smelled a bit like old rotten eggs sometimes. This problem was actually kind of gross, I'm not sure what was going on there.The rooms were a wee bit small, but this IS london.	
Sep 28 2009 	Fabulous	We booked a trip for the first time using Expedia. Firstly the overall experience was wonderful. The hotel had received mixed review on all websites. Please disregard the bad ones!! We stayed 2 nights and then came back for another 4. Hotel is very clean with great amenities. Location is Tremendous!! All staff were curteous, professional and pleasant. Breakfast was awesome. We were able to download our boarding passes in the Business Services section at no charge. Would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel.	
Sep 28 2009 	good location rather expensive	We're just back from 3 days in London in the Radisson on Cromwell Road. Check-in was rapid and fluent. We were given room 29 on the ground floor. You have to use your roomkey to be able to enter the corridors of the hotel. We were in a Deluxe room with breakfast. The room was large (especially compared to other rooms we had in London before). Very large bed, 2 seats, a desk and a small bathroom. The airconditioning made a lot of noise. When we returned from dinner that night and went to bed, we switched off the AC because it was making too much noise. Switching off the AC did not relieve us. In a room nextdoor, there was a similar noise; we could not sleep with this noise. I checked on the corridor and saw that there was not a guestroom next to us, but a room used by staff. The sound from this room was like a generator. We decided to check with the front desk if we could change rooms. At first we were told that the hotel was fully booked, but after a couple of minutes (frontdesk had to speak to management first, I suppose) we were transferred to room 227. This room is on the second floor, but in fact it is on floor 1 and a half. This room was even larger, with a huge bathroom (but still the toilet crammed in between wall and bathtub), large bed, desk and a sofa. The funny thing is that you enter the room, you have the bathroom on your left and then you have to climb another 5 or 6 steps to get to the room. This room suited us fine.As mentioned in other reviews, the breakfast is fine. When you come to breakfast round 9h30, you have to get in line at the buffet. For a hotel as big as this, this should not be the case.Check out was also fast; we could leave our luggage until later. The public rooms are very nice, the guestroom and corridors are OK, although the furniture in the room could do with a freshening-up. Considering what we paid, we expected the hotel to be smarter. The staff is very helpfull though.One final remark : the corridors are like a maze; if you are on floor 1.5 as we were, you could do with a map.	
Sep 21 2009 	Greatly disappointed	Had stayed at Radisson hotels before so was looking forward to staying at the Vanderbilt.Our room was very small.We could hardly get to the wash basin which was placed between the end of the bath and a wall and we are not particularly big people.We used the basin by standing sideways. The bed was so close to the desk and chair that it was impossible to pull the chair out and sit at the desk.There was one further chair which was somewhat wobbly.Service in the bar was very poor; we had to wait 20 mins for a drink.Breakfast was poor. We had to wait to be seated. I ordered a coffee but none was forthcoming so after a long time I helped myself but got rebuked because of this.My sausage was like leather and I simply could not eat it and I am not fussy about my food normally.The eggs too were dry and I didn't even try them.The alternative would have been fruit salad but although it was only 8-30 there were only a few sorry unappetising portions left.Prior to our visit I e-mailed the hotel with a query regarding booking in times.This was not answered.I shall not be returning.	
Sep 15 2009 	This hotel was a big part of our vacation's success.	We stayed at the hotel for 10 nights--our first trip to London and we wanted to see everything. We were upgraded to a king room because of the length of our stay. The staff at check in was very pleasant. Our room was spacious, although only 12&quot; around the huge bed, and bathroom was large. We could have used a small table since we ate in the room frequently, but there was a large built in desk and storage.Location was perfect for what we needed--close to the underground, but quiet, generally, compared to other areas. We even slept with the windows open most nights.Breakfast was very large. I was worried that we would only have breads and juice but we had a hot buffet, cold cereals, breads, fruit, juice, etc. Plus a small menu to order items without charge. If you're traveling on a budget, take a roll, cheese &amp; ham along for lunch.Did not eat at the restaurant at night but used the business center to print out ticket confirmations. Free wi-fi in the room worked without problems.All in all, we would go back again and can recommend the hotel to our friends.	
Sep 13 2009 	Great Location not great experience though!	Have just got back today from a weekend at The Vanderbilt. Location is fantastic and it was one of the main reasons for choosing it. We were entertaining 6 clients, and then we stayed an extra night for leisure as we went to Proms in Hyde Park last night (which was amazing)Booked 5 standard rooms, and we were given a comp upgrade to a kingsize. First room we went into we walked back out. The window looked out onto the roof and generator and that was the only view ... the window was so small there was nothing else to be seen. I would rather have stayed in a regular room with some sort of view than be given that. Anyway, we got moved to a ground floor (we had been advised it would be noisy as it overlooked the Cromwell Road). It was better. Nice size, but very dreary I think for a 4* hotel. Carpet shabby, woodwork scuffed and dirty, tiny bathroom, old leather sofa which could have done with a clean up too. Certainly would not pay for this room. The other people whom we were with said there were rooms were ok but very small. One had to climb over to get into bed though as you could not access it from both sides !!The public rooms are lovely, the bar is nice, but for normal London area you get ripped off unfortunately.Location is brilliant, you can walk easily with Gloucester Road tube station a 2 min walk away. Great for V&amp;A Museum, Natural History Museum too all with quick walking distance.Had a day out in London on Saturday got back to hotel at 4.10pm only to find our room JUST being serviced ! Also one of our clients rooms had no hot water that morning, so not great on that score.Buffet breakfast is average, nothing to get excited about. Staff are friendly and helpful in most departments.This morning housekeeping banged on the door at 9.10am ....... Then returned back at 10.30am .... Not very impressed especially when check out is not until 11.00amHave stayed in 3 other Radisson Edwardian Hotels so I thought it would be the safest bet to return to another, sadly we were very disappointed with our stay. We were offered a comp Sunday roast lunch today, which again was average.If you are looking for top location of this area then book it, if you want good quality bedrooms and top class service then try somewhere else.	
Sep 12 2009 	GOOD HOTEL	Stayed just one night but the service good hand for tube and plenty of places to eat and drink near by. would stay again	
Sep 8 2009 	Great location but cleaning needs a LOT more attention	Stayed here for one night over the bank holiday, got a great rate. Front desk staff were excellent and the location is great. However, I noticed that the stairwells and the room were both a little dated and shabby in areas. Also some of the common areas were dirty e.g. accumulations of dust and cobwebs. Some of the carpets also looked dirty.	
Sep 1 2009 	Very Good Hotel Great Location	Stayed at this hotel over the bank holiday period (room 402). The room was spotlessly clean, with a very comfortable bed, safe, fridge, iron and ironing board. The bathroom was a little small but well thought out and it was lovely to put your tired aching feet on the cold marble floor in the bathroom after a long days sightseeing!!The breakfast was a more than adequate buffet but you could order from a menu if you wanted.Reception excellent couldn't do enough for you - they even took our bags up to the room when we went out to get a feel for the area.I would definately visit this hotel again.	
Sep 1 2009 	Much better than expected.	We have just got back from a couple of nights stay at this hotel and we were more than happy with our choice. Reading some of the previous reviews I was a little apprehensive especially about the the room sizes. Our room was on the 4th floor and at the quieter side of the hotel so we were pleased about that, the room was a reasonable size and we did not feel cramped. It was simply furnished and looked as though it may have recently had a makeover. The bathroom was tiny only room for one at a time but it was modern and clean so it didn't matter about the size of it.The bar and the resturant provided a good service and were nicely furnished. Breakfast was good with a good selection of cereal, fruit, yogurt, croissants and the full English.Tea and coffee was bought to your table the tea was not good very weak and undrinkable in my opinion but the coffee was good. The hotel is in a very nice location with the tube less than a 5 minute walk away. There are a few nice restaurants and cafes nearby. I can thoroughly recommend the Green Door Steak restaurant a great service and lovely food. There are also museums just a few minutes walk from the hotel so all in all is excellent. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as it was reasonably priced for London and has everything you need for a relaxing break.	
Aug 27 2009 	Enjoyed my past stay	I have read a few of the comments by travelers, and I was rather surprised. My wife &amp; I stayed here a couple of years ago, and we enjoyed ourselves. The service was as expected, and the restaurant staff was attentive. True, the rooms are not as large as one would normally find in the states, but they were clean. The hotel location is excellent. We enjoyed it so much, that we are returning for 9 nights in mid Sept. I will give a follow up review upon our return.	
Aug 19 2009 	Positives far outweigh negatives	My family and I recently returned from a week's stay at the hotel. Overall, our stay was very enjoyable. The staff was unfailingly pleasant, courteous and helpful, quick to respond to any request we made. There was some confusion upon arrival, as we were assigned a room that was already occuppied. However, every effort was then made to provide us the non smoking rooms we had requested and my husband and I were upgraded to a much larger and very comfortable. My son was placed on a different floor in a small single, which was very tiny, but as we spent very little time in the room was perfectly adequate. Only 1 lift was working, but after bringing our luggage up the first day we never attempted to use it again. We were on the third floor and just took the stairs. It was no big deal and gave us a chance to work off some calories. The day we left we called the desk for help with the bags and they arrived within minutes to bring them down. We went to breakfast at times ranging from 7:30 to 9:45 and rarely encountered a line. The food was fine, the staff was busy and we did sometimes have to wait to be offered coffee, but as soon as we asked for it it was brought immediately. As others have said, the location is great, right across from the tube station and a totally safe area for walking. Is the hotel perfect? No, but it is a good value and we would definitely stay there again.	
Aug 3 2009 	Not up to our expectations	My wife and I stayed in this hotel for two nights (Friday &amp; Saturday) in July 2009. What I will say is that we will not stay again.We normally stay in the Bloomsbury/Russell square area of London but chose on this ocassion to have a change and decided upon the Vanderbilt Hotel in the Kensington area believing we would be fine as it was a Radisson 4 star hotel.On checking in, the lift was not working properly and we had to wait a full ten to fifteen minutes to take our luggage onto the 4th floor. The girl from the reception could not explain why and simply waited with us?On checking into our room we were shocked as to how small it was. The average sized bed simply filled the tiny room. There were no drawer space and only one chair. The bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom. My wife simply felt unable to stay in the room. We complained and asked to be moved. At first we were told that the hotel was full and no other rooms were available. My wife stated that she would leave as opposed to stay in the room and at that point we were told a room would become available later in the day and we would be allocated that one.We were indeed given a new room and it was better in terms of the space and general comfort although the bathroom was not as good. On arrival at breakfast the next morning, there was a lenghty queue and we had to wait for some 15 - 20 minutes for breakfast.The breakfast room was noisy; the staff chaotic as they cleared/reset tables and the whole ordeal unpleasant. Later that day we again tried to use the lift. We gave up after a while and had to use the stairs. On passing the lift we noticed a sign on the lift stating it was ourt or order. I advised reception that signs should be on ALL floors to advise guests. We altered our breakfast time the next morning to avoid the queues with some success - waiting only 5 minutes on this ocassion.The hotel is in a good location as reported by others. It is next to Gloucester Road tube station and within easy walking distance of the museums and indeed Harrods a little further. However, our experience was not that expected of a 4 star hotel and whilst we enjoyed our stay in London, we were disappointed with this hotel and I would not recommend it.	
Aug 1 2009 	Great location claustrophic rooms non-existent or outright rude service.	I recently stayed at the Vanderbilt and was disappointed in most everything except the location-what a price to pay for a good locale rude or non-existent customer service.Breakfast was included however we only ate there one morning the food is lacking the service chaotic , getting a glass of water a major issue- forget about coffee.What a horrid way to start your day it was better for us to pay for breakfast elsewhere than to go thru that experience again . There is no- service here we had to lug our own bags up and down stairs - The elevator lift is always broken and no one even offers to help with bags. Our room was a glorified closet we asked for non-smoking and were given a smoking room with the worst smell. We had no drawers to put our clothes in no luggage racks - We had asked for an adapter at the front desk were told to come back after check out we returned an hour and a half after and were chastised for coming back too late how rude!! - there were no adapters left. I am warning my travel agent about ever recommending this hotel to anyone else. It is simply not worth the money.	
Aug 1 2009 	NARROW AND DARK	On arrival at this hotel the check in was very professional and we thought that great things were to come, as it had a very plush foyeur and quality furnishings. As soon as we got into the claustraphobic lift things started to go wrong, something was wrong with the card key so we were stuck in the lift for about 10 minutes and it was very tiny and hot making me panicky. Got to the room which was ok but the bathroom was so tiny the sink was literally inches away from the bath so if we were any bigger we would have found it difficult to manoeuvre around, the tv was just a portable one, so no flashy channels to enjoy. Bed was ok but small and room was pretty quiet. Lit up wardrobe was the best thing and the robes. Corridoors were all very dim and dingy and extremely narrow, especially dark on the stairs and carpet was coming off on one back stair making it very dangerous.There was a queue for breakfast the next day - it was quite hectic in the dining room we were show to our table, the waitress was unsmiling and seemed uninterested no offer of toast only coffee, that was filtered and had bits floating around in it, I ordered a pancake and it seemed to take forever to come, and when it did the plate was massive and there was this tiny little pancake all alone, wish i hadnt bothered - still no offer of toast !!!! Was a good location minutes from Gloucester Road tube and handy for Harrods only 10 minutes walk but the hotel itself was very disappointing.	
Aug 1 2009 	wow what a hotel!!	we stayed for 1 night ( went to see calender girls) &amp; to be truthful did not expext mutch!! but when we got their what a surprise we got!!! from the moment we checked in, the gentleman who checked us in, was very pleasent &amp; upgraded us to a KINGSIZE bed( we booked 2 singles). the room was a good size &amp; very comfertable, as was the bed. the only negative was that you had to queue for breakfast as the dining room was very small!!! but all in all very worth the money &amp; a very good stay, very close to the tube &amp; night life, pubs&amp; resterants, all the staff were very good &amp; freindly	
Jul 30 2009 	Terrible - Do not visit this hotel	The room that was assigned to us for four nights (despite our complaints):1. Did not have a window.2. Was located two feet from the main hotel card entrance, where the door was being slammed all night with entries/exits.3. Had an old toilet that took 10-15 minutes to fill up.4. Did not have drawers for clothes.5. Did not have space to walk once luggage had to be placed on the floor.6. Was so crowded that one person (of two) fell down, bloodying and heavily bruising three toes.7. Had a leaky shower, dumping water on the floor.8. Had only a few inches of space between the bed and the wall.9. Had two steps in the middle of the room, which were dangerous (especially in a room with no window).10. Should not have been rented, especially to a human.Nevertheless, when we were forced to move out, the room was assigned to other unsuspecting souls. Incredible attitude!By far, it is the worst hotel in London that we have encountered in 20-plus years.	
Jul 30 2009 	Very good elegant hotel	I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights with my husband and I think that it was very good for the price we paid. The staff was welcoming (there is an Italian lady at the reception) and we were given a very big quiet room. It was a twin room but id was really spacious. I particularly like the elegant area and the hotel is close to shops, restaurants (Italian Ask where I ate good pizza and pasta and there was Italian staff) and the the underground (Gloucester road) is just on the other side of the street. The area was safe late in the evening. My experience was very good, I would definitely go back to the Radisson Vanderbilt next time I go to London!	
Jul 28 2009 	Great location but tiny room	Well positioned in Kensington close to Gloucester Road Tube and within walking distance of Natural History Museum.Staff on reception were friendly but the staff at breakfast wer positively rude.Unfortunately the buffet area is too small if breakfast is busy.Only one lift and even if you use it you may have to walk over to the other side of the room to use.I have stayed twice and unfortunately on both occasions my room was tiny,pssibly because I booked through Lastminute.com.Not sure if I would stay again.	
Jul 21 2009 	Comfortable Period style hotel in great location	We Have stayed in this hotel 3 times at least now. It is in Kensington, just across the road from Gloucester Rd Tube station, which is on Picadilly Line (direct from Heathrow) and District and Circle line. There are plenty of good eateries and bars in easy walking distance and its near Hyde park and Museums etc. Its in a lovely restored terrace building, the lobby and bar are nice, breakfast good (can be a queue if you get the timing wrong) the rooms are comfortable period style but with all mod cons. The staff are friendly and helpful.	
Jul 20 2009 	Fantastic hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights 3rd &amp; 4th July 2009 on a Superbreaks trip to London to celebrate or Wedding Anniversary. Hotel is only moments from Gloucester Rd tube station and in a lovely area. The reception area,bar and restaurant are all on the ground floor and immaculate. Room was on the small side but well equipped. You are only a short walk from the Victoria &amp; Albert museum and the famous Harrods. There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby if you fancy eating out and again the tube is nearby if you want to go into central London. Would definitely stay here again.	
Jul 19 2009 	Excellent location exceptionally welcoming staff and great service	When I arrived at the hotel I expressed an interest in its history and the very welcoming lady in reception took the trouble to show me around and explain the features in the hotel that are still original. As a female travelling alone I do not always like dining in hotel restaurants but I could not have been treated better. I was found a window table and the staff were helpful and friendly without being intrusive. Hotel in good location near the V and A, Science Museum, Harrods etc and just round corner from tube to easily take you into central London. Room was comfortable and the food was good but what really made the hotel special for me was the staff.	
Jul 17 2009 	Friendly  welcoming staff and easliy accessible to all the capitals attractions	Easily accessible from underground - Gloucester Road station is a couple of minutes walk from hotel. There are plenty of eating places/coffee shops in the area as well as a Tesco and a Waitrose. there is also a bank a few doors down from hotel with a cash machine - very handy!Staff were welcoming and friendly and tried to accommodate requests, however, couldn't get a harvey wallbanger cocktail - they didn't know how to make one!Concierge was able to help out with directions of places we wanted to see and took time to give us a map and tell us easiet routes to get there.	
Jul 16 2009 	Great location great service and a great price	I travel to London each week on business and the Radisoon Edwardian Vanderbilt is a great hotel at very reasonable prices. The hotel is located just a half a block from the Gloucester Tube stop, near the museums, parks and many tourist sites. But what makes the hotel so enjoyable is the service that they provide, in particular the hotel Manager, Barbara Figiolini. Since I started staying each week, she has offered to supply my room with what would make my stay even more enjoyable. they staff are very helpful to arrange package deliveries as well as assist in my business needs. The building has a lot of charm and character which one appreciates while visiting London. The bathroom are on the small side, but it is very clean, comfortable and a great value for your money.The restaurant is very good with a nice menu selection, wine and beer, as well as other restaurant right around the corner.	
Jul 12 2009 	Tiny !	I was booked into a single room by my work and I have to say it was the smallest room I have ever seen in my life ! The location is good being a short walk to the under ground and 5 minute walk to the Natural History Museum. The decor was very nice and the room seemed like it had been newly decorated but i nearly caused myself an injury trying to get dressed in the morning. The room had a single bed and a unit with tv on top and safe and kettle inside and a wardrobe to the side. There was only enough space to walk between these and the bed and no more. The room was the length of the bed and then the bathroom. The door to the bathroom could not fully open as it hit off of the toilet. Once you were in teh bathroom there was hardly enough room to turn round and the shower cubical wasn't much better. I had breakfast in my room and when it was brought to me they asked where woudl i like the tray ? well the option was the floor or the bed as there was no table let alone chair or any other surface to put it down. When drying my hair I was forced to stand in my square foot of floor space trying to see past the half open bathroom door to the mirror as there was no other mirror in the room while trying not to fall over my tray ! Look at my pictures to see. My room cost £112 a night ! I am a small person I would hate to think how a tall or broader person would have coped !	
Jul 9 2009 	Great location great value great hotel.	Just completed a three night stay. The location was extremely convenient -- many shops, restaurants, and museums close by. The Gloucester Road Underground station was a half block away.Did not eat in the restaurant but enjoyed good beers and snacks in the lobby bar.Our room was on the east side of the hotel. Room was very clean, comfortable, and quiet.All in all, an excellent value in an excellent location. We hope to return soon!	
Jul 8 2009 	Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt review	Polite and pleasant service awaited us during the check in at the Vanderbilt on Cromwell Road South Kensington for our July weekend break. A good location with the Gloucester Road tube station a 2 minute walk across the road were you have direct access to the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines. Incidentally a 24hr Tesco store is across the road from the station which is handy for any snakes or drinks or toiletries you may have forgotten to pack. A 5 minute walk leaving the hotel to your left, takes you to the Natural History Museum and the V &amp; A museum. 15 minuets further and you can be wondering around the famous Harrods store.The hotel has an elegant old charm worn in sum places but sadly only one lift which is so small that you can just get 2 persons and 2 cases in. The wait for the lift can be exasperating if you are in a rush to check out!!! Our bedroom (307) was a fair size with views over the main road outside but did not have any draws or shelves in the wardrobe to place your clothes in or satellite stations on the outdated TV. The bathroom was on the small size but did have good sized towels. The room had air conditioning and a small table with 2 chairs, a mini bar, room safe and facilities for making tea or coffee. The bed was a good size &amp; fairly comfortable but the pillows were hard and uncomfortable. The room was clean but not spotless. Breakfast was a simple but adequate choice from a help yourself counter with fruit, cereal pastries &amp; juice. You could then choose from a pre cooked full English breakfast with 2 choices of bacon, fried or scrambles eggs, black or white pudding and the usual tomatoes, beans, fried bread, fried potatoes, mushrooms, toast and coffee or tea. The service was attentive all be it a tad slow. I booked a room and theatre package with Radisson which worked out better value than booking a West End show independently along with the hotel. I would use this service again.	
Jul 6 2009	Good value location perfect.	My daughter and I had tickets for the mens' semi finals at Wimbledon and needed a base for the nights before and after. Location was paramount, and so was a deciding factor. The price too, we only paid £88 per night. After reading the reviews we were unsure but most of the problems related to the lifts and breakfast, and we were not having breakfast.Upon check in we were asked for payment up front. I asked to see the room first and that was not a problem We were allocated room 9 on the ground floor. Quite small but a twin as requested with a/c working and a nice bathroom. A very odd shape and no storage apart from wardrobe. Obscured glazing in the window so no outlook. We were only going to use it for sleeping so it suited us for the price we paid. Would have been reluctant to pay more.We ordered ice from room service, it did not arrive, but the bathrobes which were missing did while we went to dinner. There were a few dirty trays in the corridor when we arrived, still there at 11pm.We had breakfast at the Brasserie round the corner, cheap and delicious scrambled eggs. Bought lunch from Paul Bakery equally delicious.When we eventually got back to the hotel about 11.30 the used glasses had been removed but not replaced! We had asked for top sheets as we found the duvets just too hot. These had been left to use if we wished.Checkout was swift and we were able to leave our bags for the rest of the day.Upon leaving we asked the concierge to order us a cab to Paddington. He said it would cost £14.25. I then realised it would be a mini cab. It did arrive in time. Problem was he asked for £18!! Told him the quoted price and he relented. So be warned if you also use this service.To summarise it suited our purpose, was clean and convenient location. Would not have been happy had we paid much more though.	
Jul 5 2009 	Dont believe what you read.. I'm here and its terrible...	Well done website marketing people... You got me! I usually check a hotel out on here before I stay, but having had such good experiences with the other Radisson's in London, I expected this to be the same. It's worn out... and its had very little money spent on it recently from what I can make out. I don't expect to pay for a Deluxe King and get a tired worn old room, with 80's furniture and 80's 16&quot; Portable TV! (with authentic snowy picture!) The staff and management don't really care, and I'm looking forward to Ms Fragglioni's comments to this review, because it seems to me all the good intentions she seems to spout, well, none of the other points in the bad reviews of this hotel seem to have been addressed. When I complained about my room, I was moved to a noisy front facing 'street' room. Serves me right I guess... When I complained to the manager, I was told that he was too busy to see me, and that all the rooms were similar, so that was that.... He called me later to offer me a glass of wine.... Ermm no thank you....I later got a call at 21:12 (as I was starting to nod off, early am start) only to hear a discussion of London Night Life.... I shouted hello several times.. but no one heard me...You have been warned, this place is rubbish. If you do stay at a Rad, choose New Prov Wharf, or the Mayfair.. They are wonderful... This is not...	
Jul 3 2009 	Useful location - comfy hotel	After reading some of the reviews here speaking of small rooms, I feared the worst but we found our standard double room was not a bad size for a central London hotel.The bed was comfy and our room was very quiet.Fixtures and fittings were all there and in good nick and check in and check out was swift.The complimentary wi-fi was a big bonus for our stay.If I had to pick a negative, the corridors are a bit threadworn and dingy and the staff did seem to struggle with the hotels computerised booking system (don't they everywhere!) but these are minor quibbles about what was a very satisfying stay in a hotel just yards from a tube station, a Waitrose and cashpoint machines and within easy walk of all of South Ken's museums and Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park.	
Jul 1 2009 	Excellent place to stay.	This hotel exceeded our expectations. The person at the reception was cordial and helpful. She offered us a king-bed room and our daughters a twin room. Our room had a high ceiling, making it seem bigger. Although facing the street, the noise from the street didn't bother us at night -- it became &quot;white noise&quot;. The breakfast, which was included in our price, was excellent. All the staff could not have been more helpful. Finding our rooms was a bit of a labyrinth, but not at all a problem. The hotel is located just a few minutes walking from the tube, so getting everywhere was easy, even arriving from Heathrow, and that cost 4 British pounds each. Be sure to get an Oyster card to use the tube if you are there for a few days. Also, Tesco, a mini-mart type of store, was near the tube entrance, making it easy to pick up a quick snack or even a very good sandwich and fruit. One thing, though, I would check the time on the TV, which was the only clock in our room -- it was incorrect. But I would happily stay there again.	
Jun 29 2009 	Elegant luxury my foot	If you want to spoil yourselves with an expensive weekend in London DO NOT BOTHER STAYING HERE. From the street and from the lobby it looks great, but i have no idea where they got the room photographs from because the two we saw were awful. The first room, which we were incorrectly booked into , was a standard double (cost £180.00 per night approximately) which was smaller than some shoe boxes i've seen and the bathroom was even more compact. The second room was as booked (Deluxe double costing approximately £250 per night) but was a massive dissapointment, i've had more comfort and better accomodations in hotels costing a quarter of this price( thank you laterooms.com). The furnishings were worn and shabby, the bathroom,again, was tiny and suffered with unpredictable plumbing temperatures.. The air conditioning wheezed something approaching cool air so loudly we turned it off . Whilst you do not tend to go to hotels like this to watch TV, a decent size screen is appreciated whilst you watch rubbish before you go out, we were left squinting across the room at what can only be called a portable TVMy advice, by all means spend your money....just not here.	
Jun 28 2009	Couldn't have picked a better place	My family spent 3 days in London prior to a European cruise. It is a lovely hotel; it was reasonably priced, centrally located &amp; I would definitely return. It had an excellent daily breakfast buffet. The rooms had wonderfully soft towels &amp; all the staff was friendly &amp; helpful. I cannot think of one negative thing.	
Jun 28 2009 	Ideal Hotel for London Visitors	Stay at the Radisson Vanderbilt on Cromwell rd which is a beautiful hotel close to the Gloucester Rd Tube station within walking distance of shops cafes/ etc We stayed here for two nights on a superbreak and were delighted with the room with tea/coffee and all sorts of extras . The Hotel staff were very attentive and helpful printing off maps and directions to Galleries etc from the Hotel . The food was excellent and very reasonable ,we would definately stay here again and thouroughly recommend it,location and accessibility were great.	
Jun 25 2009 	An excellent hotel for both business or pleasure	I have been staying regularly at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt over the last 9 months. The rooms are comfortable, and are decorated to good standard. The hotel is located in a fairly central location, serviced by a nearby Underground and Bus stops. The surrounding area is also well serviced by a wide range of restaurants and coffee shops, but I would recommend trying the hotel's restaurant. The food is of a high standard, and the staff are effiicient and very friendly.	
Jun 23 2009 	Rating "excellent" with reservations - could be dangerous	stayed here three nights,. My single room was quiet, comfortable, excellent decor and plenty of room for one with a pleasant view over the rooftops and adjoining mews houses. The foyer is really enchanting with the fireplace and seating area.The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and the toiletries were absolutely gorgeous. The marble bathroom, was compact but adequate, however, I have serious reservations over the glass shower screen. Getting in and out of the shower proved quite tricky as the fittings enabled limited access (normal access is in and out from the middle of the bath on the flat level but here it was at the sloping end of the bath due to the rigidity of the glass shower screen). On the first night I slipped and, in horror, employed quick-thinking gyrations to avoid crashing into the glass screen head on - very dangerous, I acquired some colourful bruises. Would suggest replacing glass screens with curtains as this would also allow guests access to the shower controls from outside of the bath. Injuries aside, overall a very good stay, friendly staff - with special thanks to the helpful and knowledgeable Alex on reception and charming Crystal and thanks to God I survived without losing an eye or two..	
Jun 18 2009 	Great breakfast!	Stayed here in June 09. Very nice hotel; efficient staff; room nice enough; bed very comfy for a good night's sleep; great location for our trip to Royal Albert Hall - 10 min stroll through lovely area of South Kensington - chosen for this reason. Parking can be a pain but we got lucky round the corner. Didn't have dinner but breakfast was very impressive - everything you could possibly think of was there, from full English to cold meats, danish pastries, fresh fruit, smoked salmon, the choice was endless. Excellent. Overall, would stay again.	
Jun 16 2009 	Not a 4 star hotel as advertised	Hotel looked nice from outside, but is badly let down by girl on reception at check in, a smile wouldnt have come a miss!! As for the rooms , well they are so small our friends room was 7ft X 14ft! My utility room is bigger than that. Our room wasnt much better, we had to shuffle round the bed ther wasnt enough room to move together! Will not be going back.	
Jun 15 2009 	Very nice hotel in South Kensington	My wife and I stayed here for two nights in May of 2009 as part of a British Airways travel special. Since we did not pay for the room, it is hard for me to comment on the &quot;value&quot; of the room, though we were very pleased with our experience. Our previous two hotels on this trip (one in Paris and one in London) were great, but cheap, and it was nice to spend our last two nights at the Radisson. The service was excellent and the front desk employees should be commended for their hospitality. When I arrived, my room was not yet ready, so the front desk offered to store our luggage and then offered us a complimentary beverage at the bar. When we returned an hour later, our room was ready to go. The room was large for a London hotel room, with the bed NOT taking up the whole space. There was plenty of room around the bed and a table and two chairs by the large window. The shower/tub was very long (nice for a tall guy who likes baths), and the bathroom included a warming towel rack. The free WiFi worked perfectly and the breakfast in the morning was amazing. We ate ourselves silly at the buffet breakfast that included everything you could ever consider &quot;English.&quot; Additionally, there are things on the menu (pancakes, omelets), that you can order that are included in the price of the buffet.Again, it's hard for me to rank the &quot;value&quot; of this hotel, but if the price were right, I'd stay in it again when I return to London. It's top-notch.	
Jun 14 2009 	Not up to the Standard Advertised	This hotel is advertised as &quot;One of the Smartest Hotels South Kensington has to offer &quot;... unfortunately on our visit we did not find it so. It is rated at 4 star... but we disagree with this rating. Our room was very small (at front of hotel and therefore very noisy, but perhaps we should have requested room at rear of hotel). The consierge was very helpful and did arrange for a larger room for us, but we have stayed in 3 star accomodation which is decidedly better! The bathroom was tiny and basic. Air conditioning very noisy. The lift was miniscule and took ages to arrive and subsequently we found ourselves using stairs which was fine for us as we are fit, but perhaps not ideal for less able people. Two people plus luggage was all it could take. We ate out so can't comment on the quality of the food. It is certainly well placed for Royal Albert Hall (within walking distance) as is V &amp; A Museum etc., tube station etc. Lovely restuarants and amenieties all within walking distance. On any future visitx to London we will choose other accommodation.	
Jun 12 2009 	A jewel of a hotel ideally situated for the underground and Harrods	I stayed here with 11 business colleagues, most of whom spoke very little English. The hotel receptionists were very patient and extremely helpful, changing rooms previously booked as 2 of the party wanted smoking instead of non-smoking rooms. The rooms were small but adequate, with a mini bar, tv and superb shower, as well as a bath and good quality toiletries. The breakfast was delicious, with plenty of choice for any preference, and the serving staff always ready to top up the tea or coffee. Although the hotel was busy, there was no 'eat and go' pushiness by the staff, always smiling and welcoming. My only gripes are the tiny lift, which did not always accept the electronic card and sometimes refused to work, and the outrageous prices in the hotel bar - £10 for a gin and tonic is really too much even in London!	
Jun 8 2009 	Good Friendly Service	A pleasure to stay in this hotel, with the night Reception staff back on at Reception the next morning with the same friendly welcoming manner despite little sleep.	
Jun 6 2009 	Excellent hote in good location	Booked hotel for a theatre break.Arrived before 2pm check in time but allowed to book in an hour before time by friendly recption staff.After quick visit to our room we were able to start our sightseeing earlier than anticipated which added greatly to our trip.Excellent location near Gloucester Road tube station, just 3 stops to theatre land and Soho restaurants.Bar service in evening a little chaotic due to arrival of so many guests at same time.Excellent breakfast and breakfast service.Very friendly reception staff looked after our luggage for rest of day whilst we explored Central London before heading back home.Will look to book here again the next time we visit Central London.	
Jun 5 2009	Overall a good hotel	Excellent location in the heart of Kensington, a few steps away from Gloucester Rd. tube station, with easy access to both Heathrow airport and St. Pancras Eurostar station. Close to many restaurants and walking distance from Harrod's, Harvey Nichols and upscale shopping on Sloane St.Staff is efficient and helpful, breakfast is freshly cooked every morning (the pancakes are delicious) but could include more options of fresh fruits and breads.The building is a bit of a maze, so it would help to indicate the location of rooms in a printout map or plan upon arrival of guests. Also, there could be bellhops to help guests (especially seniors) with their luggage.Good price for London, considering the high cost of rooms in the city. Nice decor in the lobby, excellent food at the restaurant, with good prices.Rooms were small, but well-appointed, with good air-conditioning/heating. Bathrooms were a tad too small, with toilet so close to the sink it was almost unfit to use.Overall, a really nice stay.	
Jun 3 2009 	Great location 	Very safe area and within walking distance of kensington gardens/palace and knightsbridge shopping area...very easy to access from tube station when arriving from heathrow!! Couldnt ask for a nicer location...staff was so helpful and hotel was beautiful...restaurant was expensive but very delicious!	
Jun 2 2009 	Very nicecentrally located	We had two rooms here in late May with our 21 and 19 yr old sons traveling with us....we all thought the hotel was just great . The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful to us and tried to make the stay very pleasant. Our bathroom (we had room 14 a double bed) had a VERY small bathroom but our sons who had room 9 ( 2 twin beds) had a huge bathroom by comparison...go figure.Internet was free and worked very well!The hotel is in a very good area of south kensington located right off the glouchester tube station (exit left then your first right and your are there in 3 minutes tops) Great pub right outside the station ...good food and beer reasonably priced. There is a KFC and a small restaurant that we didn't try right next to that and at least two late night places to stock up on water and other essentials. Overall a very nice place to stay ....a lttle pricey but hey this is London!	
Jun 1 2009 	Good accomodation south of Hyde Park	My wife and I stayed for two nights as part of a British Airways package. The package included full English breakfast.Although the room was small, akin to hotel rooms in New York, it was attractive. And, even though our room faced a busy street, it was not noisy because we were on the fourth floor (the fifth floor in the U.S.) and because the windows had very thick, dark curtains. The food was delicious and I especially enjoyed that it was buffet style. The only wrinkle was that one our first morning of our 21 day trip my wife had to go without tea and I had to serve my own coffee because we lacked a designated staff member to fill this need. However, the server/waitress the very next day was excellent and the food was just as good.This hotel is located very close to a bank, a tube station (Gloucester Road) and a Waitrose, an excellent grocery/deli with ready made to go meals etc., is next to the station.I was sorry to leave the very comfortable bed as well. The only criticism is that the elevator was small and slow and sometimes difficult to use. But, I'm glad that they had one as most hotels do not!	
May 29 2009 	great experience	A friend and I recently stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt Hotel in Cromwell Street, London. We were very impressed by the standard of the rooms, the helpfullness and pleasantness of all the staff from reception staff to dining room staff. We had a lovely plentiful breakfast in the Hotel with food to cater for all tastes and cultures. The lady that served us at breakfast was very pleasant and our coffee was continually topped up. A pleasant touch only normally found in the U.S.A in my experience. The young man on reception when we booked in could'nt have been helpfu enough and even demonstrated how to use the lift with the key card. The beds were extremely comfortable which facilitated a good nights sleep. The situation of the Hotel was also very good being immediately across the road from Gloucester Streeet Tube Station which is the main line from King's Cross Station. Overall this Hotel was very good and I would certainly recommend it to others and hope to get an opportunity to stay there again.	
May 28 2009 	Fine for one night but a bit shabby in places	Wonderful location, good front of house staff and room was fine, minus the heating having two settings (roasting and off). Overall the hotel was clean and well appointed, if a little tired in places. For my needs (quick overnight for business) it was fine, but the key issue was that the attention to detail was lacking - so kettle and teabags in the room but no cups to drink from, big rush to get you a cup of coffee at breakfast but I had to ask for milk 3 times and eventually after 15 mins I gave up - that type of thing.	
May 27 2009 	No Butter ever	This hotel is fine. Not fantastic, but adaquate for most trips with some small problems. Nice location, and my room was small but clean. I must reread the terms for 4 star though, as there were some things missing which I though were required for the 4 stars. Shampoo for example.The issues I had were as follows:No butter. The breakfast range is good. loads of fresh fruit, good range of hot items, nice bread. Just no sign of any butter despite asking for it at least 3 times every breakfast. The staff are very busy, so it's an awful waste of toast as it goes to the kitchen uneaten. Just put it out on a counter please so we can get it ourselves? Poor hairdryer. I was there for a few days, so noticed the female guests checking in with perfect hair, and checking out looking like they'ed been dragged through a bush. Hairdryer is probably ok for men, or people with very short hair. There isn't enough power or heat in it to be useful for anyone else.No shampoo or conditioner. Hand cream was present though?The phones. My mobile battery died, any my husband needed to contact me. The reception phones in the hotel are just not answered. He called over 10 times. I tried to call them myself to check the number. I stood in reception, phoned from my collegues phone, and heard it ring out. I had the same issue when trying to call to let them know my flight was delayed and I'd be checking in after midnight. They just don't answer the phones and there is no message service or direct dial to the rooms available.	
May 26 2009 	Very pleased	Spent 3 nights here - 2 nights courtesy of a British Airways promotion and an extra night. Have been to London multiple times and have stayed in Bloomsbury and, more recently, at the Bailey a block away from the Vanderbilt. The 3rd night we booked was for a room with a larger (king) bed but, at check in, were offered the same, 4th-floor room for the 1st two nights so we didn't have to move from one room to the next. Very much appreciated. We found the room very comfortable and, although it faced Cromwell Street, didn't mind the traffic noise even with the window open. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet, the great location, and the helpful and accommodating staff. Glad that it was on the BA list of hotels because we now have a hotel to which we will happily return.	
May 17 2009 	Great place to anchor a London visit	Hotel is perfectly located in south Kensington across from Gloucester Road tube station and on several bus routes. Rooms were well appointed, the breakfast was excellant, and the staff attentive and knowledgeable. Would stay here anytime visiting London with high comfort level that stay would be outstanding.	
May 15 2009 	Consistently a Great Value	Just returned from 4 nights stay at the Edwardian Vanderbilt over the Mothers Day weekend. This is my 4th time at this hotel, 1st in 2000, 2nd in 2003, 3rd in 2005. It just gets better and better. Location is prime...steps away from Gloucester Road Tube Station and steps away from #74 bus that takes you to Marble Arch area. Great restaurants just a few blocks away. Fun, local pub close by...the Zetland Arms. Hotel has lovely common areas; a wonderful breakfast buffet (with some of the best coffee ever); very kind staff (although the weekday breakfast folks are a bit more hospitable and efficient than the weekend...could be due to greater crowds on the weekend). Bathroom was spacious and we loved the water pressure! We were in a deluxe room. (My kids have stayed in a standard room and they are small, but adequate.)You need to love stairs, tho. Altho there are 2 lifts, they can become slow/unavailable during peak times. And one of the lifts just stopped working one day. That said, the idiosyncrasies of the staircases are fun and interesting (albeit maze-like). We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and laughed when one set of stairs would take us somewhere completely different.	
May 13 2009 	Exellent hotel	Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt gives good value for money. A very nice room with good space. Friendly staff and an exellent location. We'll defenitely come back.	
May 12 2009 	Don't book a single room!!	On arriving at the Hotel the staff at reception were far from welcoming. I was travelling with two friends and we had all booked single rooms. You have to walk through a maze of dark and narrow corridors to find your room. There are two lifts which you can forget about as housekeeping use them all the time. All the single rooms are tiny. My first room (338) was not clean and the bathroom was not clean and the smell was awful. I went to reception and luckily there was a nicer person on reception and he changed my room straight away. The room was slightly better than the previous...in need of decoration and a good clean. There was no wardrobe just a bar hanging beside the TV with 5 hangers and to my amazement there was no where else to put any other clothes. I used my suitcase which luckily I could store under the bed. I would expect to have a wardrobe in a 4* Hotel.The bathroom was small ...I had to climb over the toilet to get into the shower. There was a safe but no minibar. As for breakfast...you have to ask for absolutely everything. Coffee, toast (which was always cold), butter, jam and the waiting staff seemed very put out every time you asked for something. On the second day there was no muesli left and I asked if they could bring some more.....I was then told that it was all gone!!. There was none the following morning either!. On checking out nobody asked if we had had a pleasent stay or if everything had been ok. The only positive side to the Hotel is it's location. Would I stay there again?....No way.	
May 4 2009 	A pleasant stay in the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt.	We had a pleasant stay in the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt. Nice spacoius rooms, extremely friendly staff en an exellent breakfast.To recommend.Next time I visit London, I'll certainly book a room in this Hotel.	
Apr 29 2009 	Great location and value.	This was my first trip to London. I was there on business for one night, but stayed an extra day to explore the city. The Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt was a great location for my trip, at what appeared to be a very competitive price. With a tube station right around the corner it was extremely easy to get to and from Heathrow Airport, as well as to get anywhere else in London. My room was tiny, but clean and well decorated. The bed was comfortable, and the room was quiet at night, so I had no trouble sleeping. The neighborhood is very pleasant, with many shops and cafes nearby. The hotel staff was pleasant and businesslike. I generally avoid eating at hotel restaurants, so I can't comment on the Vanderbilt's food service, but I was pleased to have plenty of nearby cafes and restaurants to choose from.	
Apr 25 2009 	convenient location	I was pretty happy with the location, so close to the tube station. i do not have concerns when it comes to the size/quality of the room. The only concern is the way breakfast was served in the restaurant. That was actually a nightmare - we had to ask to get every single stupid thing - coffee, tea, milk, spoons (never got them so used forks to stirr our tea), butter - every single thing had to asked for and at some point we did not even bother, wasn't worth the hassle as the waiting stuff were doing sth else and could not be bothered or there weren't enough of them. I am not writing this just to complain but if the manager reads it t this could be changed eg assigning one waiter to a couple of tables instead of having a bunch of headless chickens.	
Apr 22 2009 	Great Hotel in a Great Location	Had a wonderful midweek break at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt hotel, South Kensington. We visited London mainly to go to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, which is only a 10 minute walk away from the hotel. As a bonus, the Natural History Museum, Science Museum and V&amp;A Museum are only 5 minutes walk away. The nearest tube station, Gloucester Road, is only around the corner and runs on the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines so there are great connections to anywhere in London. The food at the hotel was excellent. As a lacto-vegetarian it can be difficult to find meals to suit, but there was no problem at this hotel. The buffet breakfasts kept us going right through the day!! Some people may think that the price is a little high, if they are comparing it to elsewhere in the country, but for the service, comfort, cleanliness and good food in such a prime London location, we personally think that the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt is definitely value for money and will be returning there next year.	
Apr 21 2009 	Overpriced - tiny room tiny bed poor service	Very poor value - the room and bed were very small, there was a constant plumbing noise, and inadequate lifts. Woken on morning one by a false fire alarm and on day two by building noises. Long queue for breakfast which was generally mediocre (and fruit juices not available). There was a fag end and empty yogurt pot on the staircase we used for over 48 hours. A disgrace for a supposedly 4 star hotel.	
Apr 20 2009 	Location is the outstanding service is impersonal at best	Yes, the location is subperb, the rooms are very clean and the food is good. The staff is professional but they do not make you feel welcome at all. I emailed two weeks before to arrange a car pick up at the airport and was unable to because I received two different prices, one from their coporate office and one from the concierge. They were obvioiusly not talking to each other. It was really easy getting to the hotel from the airport though. The check in was all business, not a touch of friendliness or genuine welcome. Our room was ready early so that was good. We asked the concierge for help on four ocassions about sightseeing and such. They were helpful sometimes, but never friendly. You could get the same information from reading a map or brochoure and probably feel more satisfied. One example, we asked for help getting to Stonehenge and got nothing concrete after three different calls to the concierge. It always felt as if we were interrupting them. The best service with a smile came from the maids, always top notch and very efficient. The front desk staff (always at leas five people), were never once friendly. Breakfast was good, but again the service is very impersonal, we had to wait for coffee service since we were told by the server we were not sittin in &quot;her area&quot; and she was not in charge of coffee there. I know we are just one more tourist couple on &quot;holiday&quot; and they see thousands, but to us it was our one chance in a lifetime to enjoy the city and it is a shame not to feel at home in your hotel.	
Apr 16 2009 	Disappointing Hotel	Positive first - breakfast was excellent both the food and service, reception areas lovely and reception staff great. Area is good with some lovely restaurants, try The Green Door for excellent steak!BUT.... the first room we were shown was only a 3/4 bed (room 121), then they moved us to a tiny room with a double bed, only slightly better - when i say tiny i mean only enough rooms for one person to walk around the room at once and the basin hung over the bath. We asked if any other rooms were available and were told none were available - the room and bathroom were so small we actually considered leaving altogether. Eventually asked again and really helpful reception staff got into a larger room however it was still very shabby and in need of a face lift. Bath water was barely warn so had to have showers only. We saw three rooms and not what I would expect from a 4* hotel, especially a Radisson.Cant recommend on the basis that I know of better hotels for less money.	
Apr 15 2009 	My Choice in London!	A bargain; yet comfortable and convenient. The staff is ALWAYS gracious &amp; helpful. As a solo female traveler, I always feel safe at the Vanderbilt. The neighborhood is charming - full of lovely cafes &amp; pubs. As an experienced world traveler, I recommend this hotel without reservation!	
Apr 14 2009 	Good quiet hotel in great location for working in London	Good smallish hotel, great location for central London, on same road as Natural History museum ( 5 / 6 minutes walk) and Victoria and Albert Museum ( 10/12 mins).4 floors, all rooms clean , well decorated and decent size . Bar menu available at decent price as alternative to the restaurant or room service.Lifts x 2 - on the slow side in arriving when called	
Apr 12 2009 	Excellent Stay	This is a great hotel, lovely, Victorian English style and in a very convenient location. Our room faced Cromwell Street, which was great. We had two beds, a desk, a closet, small refrigerator, plenty of electrical outlets, tall crown molded ceilings, safe, color TV, an electric water heater to make coffee and tea and a roomy bathroom with combo bath/shower. We were close to the lift however it was secluded in a small-enclosed area and very quite. The lift is very small and slow.Hotel breakfast was good offering a wide variety of breakfast foods i.e. scrambled eggs, sausages, fruits, croissants, cold cereal etc and beverages i.e. coffee, tea, milk, and juices. Although there is a coffee/tea maker in the room and is offered at breakfast, the front lobby could benefit by offering coffee/tea as well. The Hotel is within a few blocks of restaurants with a wide variety of all ethnic foods. The Gloucester Tube station is a block away and next to a small shopping mall with Drug store, Grocery, Post office, money exchange, and ATM next to the hotel. Natural History and other museums are within 1 block. Harrods is in an upscale shopping area and is about a 10 min walk.The staff was very efficient, attentive and accommodating. The concierge always picked up the phone to automatically verify our side trips/tours. On the day there, my young daughter had left her favorite little stuffed animal in her bed sheets while we went on a day long Harry Potter Tour. While packing that night to go home, she noticed he was missing and became quite upset. I phoned the front desk and explained the situation. My little girl was very upset and began to tear up when a knock came at our door. It was one of the front desk personnel who had her little &quot;Piglet&quot;, wrapped in clear plastic and delivered it to her. So bravo to the cleaning staff and the front office for their quick and caring efforts in a situation that could have turned such a wonderful vacation into an upsetting one for my daughter. We plan to return to London and will definitely stay here again.	
Apr 7 2009 	Hmmm..... Not bad but .........	THis Hotel is ocated in a great part of London. Very close to Gloucester Road Tube station with a superb variety of restaurants and Pubs close by. Within a five minute walk we found Indian, Italian, Thai, Mediteranean, and English plus Burger King and KFC !! So no likelyhood you will starve in this area. We ate at the Light of India ... Portions were good and the food was very nicely prepared indeed. The staff were friendly and positive.I wish the Hotel had been as positive an experience, but sadly it didn't really meet expectations. On arrival we were allocated Room 125. We got up to the room to find that it was barely big enough for one person never mind two. The bed, though a double, was pushed in a corner meaning that should my wife need to get up during the night, she would have had to climb over me. I returned to the Reception and a second room was immediately allocated. This one was better but the bathroom was small, the sink being tiny and almost unuseable. The TV was poor with limited choice and the biggest problem was the noisy air conditioning unit, which rattled and dripped all night, regardless of being turned on or off ...On a brighter note the rooms and the Hotel in general were very clean and very well kept.Other issues I had were that of the size of the lifts, access to the rooms (a very long walk) and queueing for breakfast... the dining room barely big enough to cope with the demand. I am happy to say that the food was well prepared and presented however.So all in all not a bad hotel, but I certainly don't feel anyone should advertise it as a 4*. A top notch 3* hotel it certainly is. It is in an exclusive area of London, but that cannot make up for the standard of the rooms. I had little contact with the staff, they did sort out the room promptly and were polite and curteous. No issues at all there... Would I stay there again ... probably not, but then it wasn't a silly price, maybe I just need to spend more and go 5* ..... Any suggestions ???	
Apr 3 2009 	Great Location	Stayed here for 5 nights end March, location was great only a minute walk to Glouscester Road Underground, Hotel was clean and Staff very friendly but be warned if you want a night cap at the Bar ...very pricey, but then this is a class London Hotel, the Consierge was very helpful and took time to go through all our details to make it a lot easier for our stay.	
Mar 26 2009 	Location excellent shame about the standard	The Vanderbilt is situated in a very good location with excellent public transport services but there is little else, apart from the quality of the food, to recommend it. The welcome was pretty unfavourable. We arrived at 13.50hrs and after queueing in reception for a while were told by a surly woman reception clerk to come back after 1400hrs when our room should be available. We stayed for three nights over a weekend in Room 339 which involved going up in the tiny lift to the 3rd floor, walking along miles of narrow gloomy corridors and through countless doors to the other end of the building, and then down a long flight of stairs - all this with baggage for the weekend and a function. The accommodation was described as 'deluxe' but it certainly wasn't. Yes, it was spacious [bedroom about 220 sq ft, useless internal lobby approx 35 sq ft, and bathroom around 42 sq ft] but that was only because it was in a back part of the building that was incapable of economic sub-division so it was charged at a premium! The king-size bed had an old mattress that had not been turned as indicated on the attached label and was fairly hard and lumpy. The two pillows were not high quality; we found two more wrapped up in the wardrobe but they did not add to our comfort. The bed was only warm enough if we kept the heavy counterpane pulled right up. There was a noisy fan heater at ceiling level that did not warm the room sufficiently - we had to keep it going continuously and because the two windows were sealed up with wadding there was no fresh air. The room was very dingy with dreadful piercing spotlights recessed into the ceiling in all the wrong places [e.g. straight in your eyes when lying on the bed, and not over the suitcase shelf in the darkest corner of the room. The dirty net curtains kept the daylight out but at least masked the bad view. The room decor was satisfactory in condition if dreary in appearance - no evidence of the refurbishments mentioned in other reviews. The furniture was rather bad for a hotel of this rank - inadequate desk/dressing table with wonky drawers and a 1970-vintage hairdryer, one scruffy chair, two more ugly chairs in dull upholstery, a shabby sofa-bed, a coffee table that would be more suitable in a garden, and a home-made wardrobe that was none too clean [but did have plenty of hangers]. There were more drawers so no shortage of space for clothes but having had items go missing in London hotels we thought it best to keep everything in the locked suitcases [there was a safe for valuables]. The wardrobe contained a trouser-press and a decrepit ironing board with ancient iron. It was not obvious whether any of the appliances had been tested recently.The bathroom was a good size and fairly clean but given the space available it was deficient. Only one small shelf [over the basin and under a crooked mirror] . Only a tiny coat hook on the back of the door. No seat or stool. Very poor lighting [having to shave or apply make-up under a narrow cone of light from the recessed ceiling spotlight is not easy because one's face is almost entirely in shadow]. The bath/shower was satisfactory but a long way from the towel rail [which was turned off until I found out how to open a valve]. The liquid soap and shower gel dispensers were refilled each day but it was not obvious that the products named on the wall-mounted bottles [Soames &amp; Gilchrist] were actually used. Other provisions were shower caps and emory boards in packaging that suggested that they had probably been there a long time. The towels were satisfactory but not luxurious. Kleenex and toilet tissue were not replenished adequately [on returning from an outing we took some up from the reception toilets to make sure there was enough]. The extractor fan was quiet and quickly cleared the condensation. There was a tall mirror in the lobby between the bathroom and the main room but lighting levels were poor.At all times the corridors were obstructed by vacuum cleaners, piles of laundry, housekeeping carts, meal trays, and other cluttermaking movement even more difficult. The warren-like layout of the hotel was probably unavoidable given that about ten terraced houses had been joined together [only one of which was the Vanderbilts' I suspect]. This was an interesting [and sociable] historic feature and only a problem when carrying luggage in the narrow hallways, doorways and staircases. The breakfast food was very good [although at £16 each it should be] although the staff and accommodation struggled to cope when hundreds of guests on leisure breaks all came down for breakfast within the same half hour; there were just not enough places and the tea/coffee/toast/table-clearing services were erratic. But the food never ran out and was very tasty [especially the pork sausages and bacon]. The variety offered was perhaps a bit limited at this grade but what it lacked in range it made up for in quality. The woman who seemed to be in charge of breakfast service was going like a dynamo and kept on smiling throughout. No other staff in the hotel were anything like so pleasant - there were always groups of staff hanging around talking to each other and taking phone calls when customers were waiting for attention.The in-room provisions were on the mean side. One day there were no cups or spoons for a drink so I contacted reception [there was no direct phone number for house-keeping] but after 15 minutes with no action I called again and had to repeat myself twice as though my request was inconceivable. They were brought to our room after another ten minutes. We had a bar snack at lunchtime on our final day and that was very good, pleasantly served by the &quot;human dynamo&quot; and a different reception clerk was most obliging about keeping our luggage safe pending departure.Overall, this hotel does not live up to its promise or the Radisson reputation and there is little evidence that the management which responds to these reviews has taken any of the comments on board for future vistors to London.	
Mar 23 2009 	Small cramped and hard to get around	I stayed here in March with friends. Check in staff were lovely but we were a bit bewildered when getting to our rooms. The main lift was out of order and the alternative was definitely the smallest I've ever been in. It took forever to arrive, wouldn't stop at our floor and we ended up having go back and walk to 3rd floor. The room was tiny but clean and had all I needed. Trying to find your room after a night out was certainly an experience. Bar totally lacking in atmosphere. Breakfast was ok - nothing to get excited about. Defintely not recommended for families with children, elderly or those with mobility difficulties.	
Mar 18 2009 	Excellent	Great location near museums,very nice hotel, good service. On may last stay in November, I arrived at 8 a.m. but they let me check in. A non-smoking single was not available, so they gave me a double! On this stay, I left a bag at the desk and it was brought to my room	
Mar 18 2009 	Luxury at an Affordable Price	For some 4 star opulance at the price of a average London tourist class hotel book the advanced booking option at the Vanderbilt. Staff are always smiling ,willing to help and very sociable. Rooms are both very clean and tastefully decorated in keeping with the Vanderbilt families reputation for the best of everything. Great location for the museums , Harrods and some great pubs and restaurants. I've stayed in many 3 to 5 star hotels across London but for me this has to be the best value one. If you want a treat , indulge !	
Mar 18 2009 	Great location	This hotel is perfect located in South Kensington (metro Gloucester). Lot's of small cofee shops &amp; restaurants around the corner and the metro is really close by! All main attractions are easy accesible by metro!!Good value for money !!	
Mar 17 2009 	Perfect.	My husband and myself have just returned from a wonderful weekend in London, It was a birthday suprise and a wonderful one at that. We arrived Saturday 14/03/09, check in wasn't until 2pm but they had a room ready and the concierge physically directed us to our room which was superb in itself. We were quite impressed with our room 144, but it was slightly small but the high ceilings made up for that, the only thing we would change would be the bathroom very small and it looked like work was needed to be done, but not enough to put you off as it was gleaming clean so what more could you ask for. Breakfast was amazing food hot and very tasty, my husband actually said it was the best breakfast he has ever had in a hotel and I agreed which was something for me to do as I'm very picky with food. You couldn't ask for better staff they were so helpful and polite and they didnt find it a chore when giving someone like me directions to Twickenham including what trains to get etc. All in all we cant really fault this hotel, we had a fantastic time and when we do return we will return to this hotel.P.S Harrods is a must!!!!Mr &amp; Mrs Davidson	
Mar 12 2009 	Excellent hotel in convenient location	Excellent hotel with very good service. Location very convenient for travel to most parts of London. Very near museums in South Kensington.	
Feb 19 2009 	Comfortable blend of old and modern	Stayed one night on business trip and attended conference there following morning. Very comfortable room, huge, with large settee, wardrobes, etc, etc. Very comfortable. Room service was good - food excellent and service extremely good. Room was clean, bathroom very spacious and clean. Hotel is a bit 'rabbit warren-like' in places, but posed no problems to me, but I do wonder if someone who had mobility problems may struggle on the upper floors. It was originally several buildings which have been connnected. Very grand in places as befits somewhere with the Vanderbilt name. Reception is good and efficient. Bar is bright, modern and welcoming. Conference facilities were very good - located downstairs in the basement, but were bright, well equipped and modern. I enjoyed my stay and would happily return - for business or pleasure.	
Feb 19 2009 	Great location ask for alternate room if not satisfied	I stayed here for four nights as part of a flight/hotel package. Based on the cost of the flight alone, the room was a steal at about $500 USD for all four nights ($125/night).I was concerned that I might get an inferior room as I was told it would be &quot;run of the house&quot; or a room of their choice with no guarantees of size. I did request at least a double bed as some singles are only a twin. My first room was standard (small) but comfortable. My only complaint was that there was no table or desk to lay open a magazine, book or newspaper and one small uncomfortable stacking chair. The next morning I asked if they had a room with a desk and I was moved to a very spacious room with large bay window, sofa and side chairs, a large desk and larger closet and bath. I was pleased to learn it would be at no additional cost.The lift is indeed tiny and very slow. I often waited upwards of 5 minutes for it to arrive and it seemed to be being used by staff - perhaps they could lock it off to prevent it from stopping along the way to pick up additional passengers. As far as I know there is only one lift and that is a problem during the morning cleaning processes. I could hear it passing my floor again and again before it finally stopped. In all fairness, there are only four floors and there are several wide and open staircases if you are in a hurry.The breakfast was plentiful and hearty. I chose to take a tray to my room and had plenty to make a snack for &quot;the road&quot; to take along during my sightseeing later on. The buffet included fresh fruit, pastries and rolls/bread, cereal, juices and other beverages, cold meats, sausages (2 kinds), eggs - both hard boiled and scrambled, fried bread, bacon, broiled tomatoes, yoghurt, and potatoes. Did I forget anything? Needless to say - very substantial!I found my rooms clean and in good order. The &quot;business center&quot; consisted of two computers and a printer in cubbies with high stools (not very comfortable, so standing was a better option which limited extended use - on purpose???) Only once did I find both computers occupied.Staff was generally helpful, but more than once they saw me struggling with packages and did not assist me up the steps. One concierge was quite aloof and acted as if it was a major inconvenience to post a letter for me, telling me stamps and a postal station was opposite the nearby tube stop.The location is superb with the tube a short walk away. There is also a small shopping area adjacent to the station with a Waitrose grocery market, Boots and newsagent amongst others. There are restaurants and take-aways opposite the station, too.I found the room very quiet with minimal street noise even though I was on the street side.	
Feb 16 2009 	Best London Value For Money Hotel	Stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt Hotel for 3 nights from 7-10 February 2009.The hotel is in a REALLY nice area, and is only 100 meters away from Gloucester Road Tube Station.The room was very nice, although quite small. It had recently been refurbished, with the smell of new carpets still in the room - very nice!!Didn't use the restaurants in the hotel, but staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. I paid GBP 84 (excl taxes) per night for the Saturday and Sunday nights, and GBP 77 for the Monday night, booked directly on hotel's website. VERY good value for London, in a 4* hotel in a very good area.Oh, and FREE wireless internet in the room!!!Will DEFINITELY stay there again.	
Feb 9 2009 	Beautiful hotel in great location	The photos of the hotel on the website don't do this hotel justice. The building form the outside is beautiful and the entrance and bar areas make the hotel just as beautiful on the inside.I was expecting the rooms to be abit worn, but ours was freshly decorated and smelt very clean. I was more then impressed. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathroom more then adequate and this is a great location, over the road from Gloucester Road tube station.I will certainly be going back.	
Feb 9 2009 	Royal Stay	Although I had booked a deluxe king room the bathroom was a liitle shabby and could do with a good facelift. The bedroom itself was clean and comfortable.Overall I found the hotel to be above average with excellent service.	
Feb 4 2009 	Great hotel and location	I arrived at the hotel at 12pm and was able to check into my room early. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating of my requests. The elevator lift is very small, at most could hold 3 people without luggage, but it did get me up and down many times with no problems. My room was on the 4th floor which is the top floor of the hotel. The room was tiny as most hotel rooms are over there, but very clean. The bathroom was also very neat and clean. I had dinner in the restaurant one night and it was fantastic, as well as the continental breakfast each morning was definetly above average and offered more than most hotels in the U.S. would offer. There is also a nice gym located in the basement of the hotel that if you have the time is definetly a great place to check out. The location is about a 10-15 min walk to Harrods, and is located nearly next door to the National History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum both of which are free admission. There is a bus stop right out in front of the hotel which will take you past the sites and into the tourist parts of London. There is also an underground about a block from the hotel, although it was recommended by the hotel that I use the bus as the tube system is not ideal right now due to many lines under construction. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London for a few days or even a week. It was by far the nicest and friendliest hotel I have stayed at over there, and I will be sure and stay there again next time.	
Feb 2 2009	Fantastic Hotel - Great Location	Staying in London for a weekend, we arrived at the hotel at 2pm met by very friendly and helpful staff. Even had our car valet parked. Room was fantastic, very clean and possibily the most comfiest bed we have ever slept in. Breakfast was excellent, lots of choice and the dinning room and bar are very clean furnished to the highest standard. Central location to Knightsbridge, Harrods, museums, Royal Albert Hall, train station and cosy London pub just across the road. We will be coming back to this superb hotel. Top marks from us both, well worth a stay. ;o) ps the rooms were a bit small ie&quot; travel inn&quot; but if you can ask for room 140 thats were we stayed i think we had the best or one of the best rooms	
Jan 24 2009 	Had better wouldn't stay again	Stayed at the Radison Edwardian Vanderbilt for one Friday night in January 2009.At check in they never had our reservation and I had to go to the business centre to print off my confirmation which I thought was charming!!!!I parked my car about 30 yards around the corner to the hotel in a side street, to get it of the main road, and asked for it to be valet parked, I was told I'd have to bring the car to the front of the hotel for that to happen. For the £37 per day valet parking charge the valet couyld have walked the 30 yards instead of me.The lift is the smallest lift in the world.We had a deluxe room! I don't know what the diffrence is between this room and a non deluxe room, the web site said minibar, which it had but was empty. The room was large, had a large sofa and a large bed, it had tea making facilities but the room was missing something, it was very sterile. The bathroom was tiny, good job we din't bring a cat because we couldn't have swung it. The sink was crooked and wasn't fixed to the wall properly. Also, there was no shampoo sachets or shoe shine cloth. But room and bathroom was clean.The bar! £7 for a Jack Daniels, I know they have to make a profit but a 70cl bottle of JD is £17!!! Bar service was OK.The restaurant. We booked a table the night before we arrived via the web for 8 pm, it was a good job we did because the place was empty!!. We were shown to our table, handed the menus and asked what we wanted!!!! I asked for the wine menu and a small bowl of olives. They asked if we wanted water we said no (remember this bit). I ordered the wine, then we ordered the meal. The wine arrived (screw cap.....I hate that.....when you're paying over the top for a bottle of Aussie plonk you expect at least a rubber cork) even though I ordered the wine they showed the bottle to the wife and she tasted it! Then they gave us water! The olives didn't arrive I had to ask for them again. Apart from that and a screwed up bit of tissue sitting on the window sill (which must have been left over from lunch or breakfast) the food and service was actaully OK.Breakfast, no problems food and service was OK.Check out. I booked the room over the web, the rate included breakfast but I was charged for breakfast again, they removed with no problem.Car Valet. When we arrived and I'd moved the car to the front of the hotel we were told to inform the hotel 30 minutes before we wanted to leave so they could get the car. We had breakfast and told the hotel that we would be checking out in 30 minutes time and could the car be brought round. We checked out went out the front and a car was there but not our car! The car they brought round was silver, the same colour as ours, it was an 05 the same reg as ours but it was a VW Golf 2.0TDi, ours was a peugeot 307. We had to wait another 30 minutes for them to deliver the correct vehicle.Would I stay there again?......No. There must be better four stars in the area	
Jan 13 2009 	Great Hotel. Would stay again .	My wife and I stayed here last week (jan10th) as part of a theatre package and must say I was very impressed! On arrival we were made to feel very welcome at the reception and had our room upgraded as the initial one was not ready ( we were 2 hours early). Our room was very nice with a massive bed (my wife was impressed!) and nice and clean. We soon found the bar and relaxed for an hour while finding our bearings with a map provided from the very helpfull staff. We went out to see a show later and after decided to head back to warmth of the hotel where things went slightly pear shaped . The bar staff (2 of) could not seem to cope with the amount of people who had the same idea as us and I felt sorry for the one girl as her fellow worker had to ask her how to do a large Vodka and Coke. Minor moan . Next morning after a very nice night we enjoyed a lovely breakfast and checked out with a smile. Stay again ? You bet x PS if your going with your missus stay away from Harrods! You can see the glow of its lights from the Hotel and there like moths to a light bulb! x Enjoy.	
Jan 13 2009	THE absolute Londonish stay	The most comfortable and convenient hotel for a family with young children 11 and 17 to have a great time in LONDON and NEVER forget the experience.Excellent staff especially the lady incharge for the breakfast.So sweet and kind (little chinese lady) .GRANDbreakfast Idont think that it is found in other 4star hotels.And of course LOCATION .A 2min walk to Glouster Road Station from where you can go every where!!!!Or bus No 74 runs in front of the hotel and take s you down town very fast. THANK YOU VANDERBILT FOR GIVING MY FAMILY A N UNFORGETABLE EXPERIENCE.Next time we come we would just like rooms on a higher floor and probably looking to CROMWEL ROAD. That will be PERFECT!!!!	
Jan 8 2009 	So-so...	Um, Ive stayed in about a dozen London hotels now and this one excels in location andwell, thats about it. Not that its a BAD hotel. Its not. Its justmediocre. My bathroom was smallish  even by London standards. The staff (aside from the great staff at the bar) were so-so in the customer service department. The décor was dated, the elevator was semi-workingbasically, it seemed like maybe at one time this place was grand (maybe or maybe not) but, regardless, its heyday had come and gone. And, it didnt seem like the staff cared enough anymore to make it better. When I checked it and was shown to the elevator, I was told that, when I pressed the UP button, I should press the DOWN or the elevator would never come. Like this was something I should have known. No mention was given about it being fixed. I think it was just one of those things that would be tolerated until the down button stopped working as well. I know this is petty, but thats how the entire hotel feltbroken.	
Dec 29 2008 	Lovely	My husband &amp; I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and really enjoyed it.The hotel's location is very conveniantly close to the tube station.The room was everything we expected it to be. Lovely soft bed &amp; duvet and very clean bathroom.Hotel staff also very friendly and helpful.We would definately stay here again!	
Dec 17 2008 	friendly and clean	My partner and I were surprised and happy with our 2 night stay at this hotel. The hotel was very elegant and good value for money. The staff were extremely polite and always willing to help. The room was comfortable and clean. We found the location a real bonus, with the tube station a 5 minute walk away, the bus stop a 2 minute walk away and the major museums within a 10 minute walk. The main attractions of central London only a 5 minute bus ride away.	
Nov 30 2008	Superb staff poor hotel	The staff were excellent, especially Ahmed, the Deputy Manager. The hotel itself is poor. The public rooms flatter, only to deceive, because the bedrooms are small and tatty, compared to, for example, the Holiday Inn just along the road.	
Nov 30 2008 	Unsafe lifts	Considering postivies, the room my fiancee and I stayed in was warm and clean, and the hotel's interior attractive. Considering negatives, I was trapped within one of the lifts for about ten minutes, the alarm bell yielding no response. Shouting up the lift shaft (I think) alerted workmen to my presence and I was freed. Half an hour later my fiancee asked at reception if the other lift was safe to use and, having been told that it was, entered it, only to have the lift plunge mid-journey from the second floor to the basement. The hotel's manager apologised, after we had asked to speak with him, but his apology was markedly insincere. The reception staff were also somewhat unfriendly. A couple of minor toiletries went missing from our room, only to reappear after room service's next visit.	
Nov 19 2008 	High expectations low cielings!	I stayed at this hotel on my second trip to London. It was on business and I was told it was where I was staying. When I found out I looked it up online and took the &quot;virtual tour&quot;, to be honest I was pretty excited and expected to have a great experience as I did at the Millennium Gloucester, which is located right around the corner. I knew the location was going to be great but expected similar accommodations to the Millennium. When I got there I struggled to get up and down the hallways with my luggage. I am pretty Tall and had to Duck more often than in a submarine. When I go the room it was smaller than a single dorm room and it was for 2 people! the TV was tiny and way outdated, the bathroom was tiny and hard to move around in. The Bar is nice and the staff were accommodating for my group of colleagues. I would not recommend this hotel, other hotels are similarly priced and much more modern. I get the old english charm thing but this was taking it too far.	
Nov 19 2008 	Don't take your cat!	Because in a single room there would not be enough room to swing it! I stayed in room 148. I could touch the walls on both sides, and could not close the bathroom door because the bed frame blocked it. You could only turn on the shower standing in the bath so you froze for the first few seconds. Which was good in a way because no matter what I did with the thermostat, the room was baking hot. And the sink effectively blocked your access to the toilet!Oh and the key never worked twice in a row, so I walked for miles down the corridors!	
Nov 17 2008 	Clean warm hotel in a very convenient location	I stayed in this hotel in early November and I have to say, it is an excellent hotelThe rooms are clean and warm. The location is very near a tube station and handy for the lines to all the major attractionsI would recommend this hotel to anybody - I was initially placed in a single room before the staff corrected this and although it was small it looked nice. The twin/double room they moved me to was spacious and although it overlooked a main road very quiet	
Nov 11 2008 	Clean and comfortable	I stayed here for 5 days in September and liked the hotel. I had a single room which was small but clean and alot better then other hotels I have recently stayed in! The staff were friendly but I was repeatedly locked out of my room which after climbing all the stairs and winding through the corridors gets very annoying!Unlike a lot of hotels that advertise wifi, it was free in this hotel and had good coverage. I had a room at the side of the hotel, which wasn't too noisy although my window was fairly small and had scaffolding infront of it. Besides that though, the room had a bath, the bed was comfortable and the room was well maintained so I would definitely stay at this hotel againGood points:Friendly staff, free unlimited wifi, clean, quiet, air con, nice bathroom, comfy bed, plugs next to mirrors, close to Gloucester Road Underground station, tesco and waitrose. Bad points:Very narrow and windy corridors, I was repeatedly locked out of my room due to problems with my key card	
Oct 25 2008 	Elegant facade but disappointing within	I stayed one night at the Vanderbilt as part of a conference package. The location is good; very close to the tube and easy walking to Hyde Park, the museums and the Albert Hall.The restaurants and bars were fine, and food was good both in terms of choice and quality. Reception was adequate, no more than that. The conference rooms were surprisingly light given they were in the basement - and the swivel chairs were great. Both bedroom and bathroom felt rather small; there didn't seem to be anywhere to put anything: remarkable that was noticeable, given that I was staying on my own for one night! The overall feel is that of a grand and rather elegant residence - which is exactly what the hotel once was. I never actually located the lift, but colleagues told me it wasn't worth the endless wait. Instead I perfected the composed ascent and elegant descent of innumerable staircases. All I lacked was an elegant companion - and somewhere to put my overnight things!	
Oct 24 2008 	Tired 	I stayed here for 2 nights in September whilst on business in London. Having arrived from stays in European hotels which were newer, fresher and certainly cheaper, I was disappointed with my characterless room.My room was dark with an almost foreboding feel about it. The carpet looked stained and dirty, as did the walls and curtains. Despite the ensuite bathroom seeming to be mostly modern, the rest of the room felt tired and old. The bath tap also leaked (ran constantly) for the whole of my stay.On the plus side, the location is very close to the Tube and Museums etc. The breakfast was also varied and plentiful.	
Oct 20 2008 	Comfortable Hotel in a well serviced area	Despite some bad comments below, I think the Vanderbilt is a nice hotel. I booked a room on the Ryanair.com web-site and they gave me a good room on the 3rd floor with a view on the road for GBP 60 per night. Sound insolation is ok. Room furniture and decor is lovely, the curtains were a bit dusty but that didn't bother me. The bathroom was small, but not too small. Reception staff is friendly and helpful and also service is good. Location of the hotel is next to Gloucester Road tube station with a 24h Tesco supermarket.	
Oct 19 2008 	Location is great but hotel disappointing	Small room, a ratting air con vent disturbing my sleep(even though the air con was off) and toiletries bolted to the wall (never a sign of a good hotel!). On the plus side, location is great for the tube. I stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum 2 weeks ago and preferred it. And it was cheaper. If this is the area in London that you want to stay in, stay there instead.	
Oct 6 2008 	Having stayed at both - I'd go back to the Holiday Inn.	I booked the Radisson with Londontown.com for £79/night - the cheapest decent place I could find in the area for one night after 2 days in the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for £54.50 (£109 with there 2 nights for the price of 1 offer).3 days prior to my stay I used the online check-in service to process my payment and select my room preferences. The site says that having done this I should arrive to find myself already checked-in with my room keys &quot;ready and waiting&quot;. And so, I was disappointed to find upon my arrival that I was still required to check-in as normal and the online service was not in any way useful or time-saving. Not least because my room preference also appeared to have been ignored.I had requested the highest floor available but was first given a street-level room (room 10). Not only this but the room had an air conditioning unit directly outside the window which was very noisy (and incidentally appeared to be in poor repair with some ducting not connected properly) and would have looked out onto a brick wall only a few feet away had the glass not been frosted to disguise the eyesore. In addition, the minibar had clearly been switched off, unused and empty for some time.Not surprisingly, I requested another room on a higher floor. I was given room 408 on level 4. I struggled to find my way to the room as I entered the lift with a maid who informed me that the lift wouldn't stop at level 4 and I would have to walk from level 3 (even though the lift shaft does go to level 4 and there is a '4' button and nothing in the lift to advise of the fault). However, when the maid left the lift I was told by an announcement that the lift was out of service and was taken to the basement level. Thankfully it did make it as far as level 3 second time around but there were clearly issues with the lift. I noticed some other lifts in the hotel were also marked 'out of service'.Although this room was much better, with a pleasant outlook, the window was in poor repair and did not seal against the frame. This allowed a draft and a great deal of noise in from the street below. I brought this to the attention of the check-in staff and moved once again to a room located on the side of the hotel (143). Thankfully the room I ended up in was okay and I enjoyed my stay but I was left with a bitter taste after having had such a hard time checking-in to a decent room.I also felt that the hotel was let down in other areas such as tired decor in the halls, stairs and lifts and less than welcoming check-in staff. The problems were highlighted as I had spent the previous two nights in the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum (literally over the road) which I could not fault.	
Sep 28 2008 	Just about ok....	I was apparently upgraded on check-in and got a room just about large enough, though the bathroom was not. It was as small as it possibly could be, had nowhere to put toiletries, and access to the over-bath shower was tricky. The room was nicely decorated, and my room service breakfast was delivered on time, and with much courtesy.	
Sep 12 2008 	Excellent location	The location is superb, within 2 minutes' walk of Gloucester Road Underground station, good both for business trips and tourists.I spent one night there on business and was quite satisfied. Reception staff were patient and helpful and the front office layout is particularly pleasing.The double room was smallish, fine for myself on business, but might have been cramped for two people staying. There was a slight smell of damp on entry, and I would echo the other criticisms of the layout of the bathrooms and position of the toilets (I have to conclude that the &quot;architect&quot; never tried sitting down on the job).The bar area is pleasant and well run, if on the expensive side (but that applies to most London hotels). I cannot comment on the breakfast service, as I ate outside (there is a patisserie within 2 minutes' walk).	
Aug 27 2008 	Great location expensive bar	We booked this stay with friends via Superbreak.com as part of a theatre, hotel and travel package and got a great deal on a 3 night stay.For me the location was the best thing, literally 2 minutes from the tube. There are also lots of places nearby to chose to eat (Cous Cous Darna is well recommended)Our party had rooms 10 &amp; 11 on the ground floor at the back of the hotel which was through a side door and meant we didn't have other guests going past our door at all hours. Our room (10) had no view but as we were hardly in our room this didn't matter. Unfortunately there was a generator/air con unit outside the window, however once our earplugs were in it was fine.The bathroom was a decent enough size, perfect for a long weekend, with plenty of hot water and had everything we needed, although an additional shelf to store toiletries would have been nice. The room itself was a bit of an odd shape and didn't have the advertised iron and ironing board so I had to borrow my friend's from next door. Personally I didn't find the bed to be the most comfortable and the pillows were far too soft for my liking but that could be down to personal preference. It was well appointed and the in-room safe is handy.The breakfast room was quite large and there was always plenty to chose from, however it did get quite busy and one morning we had to wait ages for our tea/coffee/toast to be brought to the table.We didn't eat in the hotel on an evening but we did have drinks there and be warned they are expensive (£8.50 for a G&amp;T), however there is a pub nearby that has a nice atmosphere and cheaper prices.I would stay here again as it's easy to get to from Kings Cross, the breakfast really sets you up for the day, the staff are nice and the location for sightseeing is great.	
Aug 25 2008 	Tired	I have stayed at this hotel a number of times on business. I stayed last week and was allocated room 139. The rooms are now looking really tired and not up to 4 star standard. As I looked around I would rate 2-3 stars at most. Very small room, even smaller wardrobe space and very small and old TV. What was even more unacceptable was the bathroom. The lavatory was in a corner position right against a wall. It was actually impossible to use as the washbasin was directly in front of it with its pedestal just 6 inches from the lavatory pan and the washbasin actually impeding any possible way of using the wc. To make matters worse, the whole room was so small that the only place for the towel rail was directly over the lavatory. Not ideal. I raised this with reception and was eventually offered another room on the 4th floor. The receptionist offered to show me the room and led the way to the lift. A piece of tape over the 4th floor button stating 'do not use' meant that we had to get out on the 3rd floor and walk up a floor. Similarly we were unable to access the lift from the 4th floor which was not really an issue as the offered room was not really worth the effort of moving. I used the lounge gents toilets for the duration of my stay.	
Aug 21 2008 	Tiny room	Room for the single room was tiny....paid 115 pounds a night for that, plus extra of 10 pounds an hour for late check out.The room was okay....comfy bed, but everything else was small.The only elevator in the hotel was not functioning the whole time I was there, so carrying my huge luggage up and down the narrow colonial stairs was quite a challenge.Location was great though, 5 minutes walk to Gloucester road underground station. There's Tesco Express, Waitrose and Boots nearby, so getting daily needs is not a problem.	
Aug 21 2008 	Wonderful location	We were in London for a couple days awaiting the departure of a cruise to Norway, Iceland, and Ireland. We found this hotel very convenient to most things. It was well appointed. The rooms were a nice size. Breakfast were very good, and a nice way to start the day. The only problem we had was, the lift nearest to our room didn't work on the day arrived, and it never did get fixed. On the last day the other lift didn't work either. Which made baggage handling a little difficult. There are lots of doors to walk through to get to your room - which I guess is part of it's charm. The staff was very pleasant. The internet was free and very easy to use. We hired a private driver to pick us up at Gatwick and transport us to the hotel. This was great, after being up all night on an airplane, it felt good just to be taken care of.When we left we took a cab back to the bus station to meet up with Princess Cruise line representative.While in London we did a lot of walking, which we like to do. Harrod's is very close, there are several museums within walking distance, and Kensington park is a very easy walk.The crowds were very large everything was packed - it rained really hard - so that make seeing things difficult. We took the double decker bus ride around London - however, with the rain and the crowds we just sort of rode around. The bus stop, however, is just around the corner from the hotel.Lots of nice places to eat around the area also. If we were to go back to London we would probably stay there again. However, since we are not big city people that probably will not happen.However, Norway and Iceland were well worth the trip. Travel safe!	
Aug 15 2008	room without a view	From the start of entering this hotel there was disaster. We travelled in a party of 3 families totalling 9 people and requested a room for 4 a room for 3 and a double this is where we encountered the first problem. We could only be offered 3 triple rooms so basically we would have had to share with the other family. While this was resolved we where told to take a seat in the lobby bar area so we decided to have a drink or so we thought - the bar staff could not work the till and there was no beer in the pumps so we paid £4.50 for a bottle of beer which included the 50p they charge each time for service. We waited 45mins for the transaction from start to finish.In the mean time reception still had not sorted out problem so we though enough time waisted we will go out.On our return all was sorted we all had the deluxe rooms as we had paid for. We went to our room (the quad) which was a king sized bed and 2 sofa beds (we had been told it would be 2 king sized beds) and where taken a back by the darkness of the room. I opened the curtain to the view of some type of rusty machinery covering which probably housed the air conditioning with no view at all other than that (see attached pictures).The next problem was the bathroom it was so small that when you where sat on the toilet the sink was in the way so you has to manouvre yourself out of the way.The toilet was unclean and smelt of sewage and there where various fitments missing off the walls. I attempted to complain but the staff where so damn unhelpfull i had to give up.The other problem was the breakfast the set out is so unorganiased drinks right next to the buffet area so when people are queueing for the food you can get a drink. We where also served by tutting waitresses who did not offer tea and coffee and had to be asked and it then arrived about 10mins later.An average breakfast but not the cheapest.All i can say is the service from certain staff is appalling and unhelpful. Any problems are dealt with unprofessionally and dont get sorted.Our party was large and included children so it was too hard to be located by the company it was booked through , had i been there with a smaller group i would have moved without question. I appreciate it was a 4 star and not a 5 star but what we got was definately no higher than a 3.	
Aug 10 2008 	Victorian Style with Newer Amenities	Our room was elegant, comfortable and quiet. These rooms are renovated townhomes that preserve the feeling of the old style while incorporating modern amenities. The breakfast was beyond comparison, the hotel staff was professional and helpful. The hotel is centrally located in an upscale neighborhood in south Kensington. It is near Gloucester tube station, good pubs, museums, upscale shopping (including Harrods), and Kensington Palace and gardens.	
Jul 19 2008 	All Round Above Average	I spent two weeks here for business and pleasure. The hotel is a bit of a rabbit-warren of corridors but the rooms are large (by London standards). The bathroom was excellent, the staff helpful and the breakfasts large. It is close to the underground so getting around was easy. I would happily stay here again.	
Jul 12 2008 	Good bed - but not the greatest of rooms	I recently had a one night stay at this hotel for business - location is great, right opposite Gloucester Road tube station and very accessible. Lobby area, bar and restaurant are very modern and really nice to chill out in. The room however was something else: I had been upgraded from a single to a double, and thank God I was as it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in. If you pulled out the chair at the desk it touched the bed. It was certainly compact!Having said that, the bed was comfortable and the room had everything you'd really need: it was just so small you wouldn't want to spend any time there. I had some issues with the room: heated towel-rail didn't work, minibar on but not chilled, hairs left in plug in the sink, &quot;free&quot; Wifi was really slow and often wouldn't connect.Overall: ok if you're just going to sleep there, but not if you are intending to spend any longer at the hotel than a day. I had a &quot;traditional&quot; room style (i.e. in need of updating) but perhaps other modern rooms are better. I will add that I received an email survey on my stay and the hotel did respond to my issues well straight away, which was encouraging.	
Jul 7 2008 	Great Location ... Good Hotel	Stayed twice in this Hotel in 2007 and both times it was good. Standard of rooms does vary due to the nature of the hotel especiially the single room which one of my family had which was very cute as it had a small corridor from the room door (with its own doorbell) before going up some steps to the actual room - although cute and cosy it was very small and no space to move in the bathroom. But you dont spend much time in the room so all you need is there. Both times the rooms were at the back of the hotel so therefore not as noisy. Narrow corridors make it hard to get luggage through but it was originally a townhouse of the Vanderbilt family and not designed for the traveller with suitcases! Breakfast were good and the lobby was clean and bright. In december it was decorated for Christmas with a lovely large tree beside the fireplace in the entrance area. The location is great - only about 1min away from Gloucester Road tube station (served by the tubeline from Heathrow), also great for Kensington, Harrods and musuems. Also used this hotel as a base to go to Wimbledon. The staff on reception are really helpful and especially on out last day when we needed to stay in the room past the checkout time because my mother had just got out of hospital they only charged a minimal fee and did everything they coudl to help us. In a really nice fashionable part of London just away from the main hustle of the centre. I'll stay here again when im in London	
Jul 6 2008 	Exceptional service friendly staff handy location	I stayed here for a few nights in early July 2008. I initially booked into the Frasers Queens Gate Kensington but found the service so appalling I left the hotel in order to check into this hotel which was across the road [see my review of the Frasers Queens Gate Kensington].From the start, I was extremely impressed with the service and professionalism of the staff at the Radisson Vanderbilt. In fact I would go so far as to say that I was happy as Larry in this hotel. I asked for a quiet room at the back of the hotel and got a lovely split level room where you go down a few stairs to get to the bathroom. That made it feel more like an apartment than a hotel room so it was fantastic. The double room was extremely large. Note that as I wanted a room at the back of the hotel and the hotel was nearly full, I chose to take a smoking room in order to get a room at the back of the hotel but only after I checked out how bad the smell of smoke was as I am an emphatic non smoker. There was hardly any smoke in the room [and I am very fussy] so I took it. Also my room had a [clean!] window that I could open which I also liked as I like fresh air. It is very rare to get this in modern hotels as normally the windows won't open. If you are sensitive to street noise I would ask for a room at the back of the hotel as Cromwell Road is a busy street.My double room was very large and equipped with everything that you need. The hotel has free wireless internet - another bonus in an era where many hotels are fleecing guests with exhorbitant internet charges. Also the hotel is 2 minutes walk to Gloucester Road station and a Waitrose supermarket and a Tesco's convenience store. There are numerous walkable dining options in close proximity to the hotel. The staff here are offering an exceptional level of customer service and if anything goes wrong they are quick to rectify it. The phone in my room needed changing and it was done immediately. Likewise I wasn't happy with the temperature of the mini bar in my room - a bit warm for my liking - since it couldn't be fixed they gave me a replacement fridge immediately. In fact I could not believe the speed with which maintenance was sent to the room. Also the staff follow up to make sure things are done. The hotel is charming with numerous winding corridors that you go through to get to your room - I found this charming. Also the hotel has one smoking floor. This is a good choice for London particularly if you can get a good rate. It is an extremely well maintained property with a huge emphasis on customer service. I found the service better here than I have experienced in many 5 star hotels. As a result of my good experience at this hotel I would consider staying at another Radisson Hotel during future overseas trips.	
Jul 2 2008 	A standard good hotel	I stayed at this hotel 4 nights at the beginning of June 2008, when I attended a conference that took place at the hotel itself. The room was ok, clean, spacious. I was at a twin double room (even if I was just one person) with a view to the main street (a little bit noisy). The breakfast was ok; I had lunch there and the food was good.The staff was kind and helpful. the problem was with the lift. In order to go to the floors there is this old and slow lift and often I had to wait for a very very long time to take it. The location of the hotel is very good, just 2 minutes from the Gloucester Road underground station, 5 minutes from the Natural History Museum and the V&amp;A Museum.	
Jun 24 2008 	Not quite Radisson standard	Having booked for one night over three months in advance of our trip we were surprised on arrival to be told that our room was not ready. We had been advised that check in could be anytime after 2pm, so we didnt expect to have problems arriving at 7pm. The receptionist, tut tutted and made some rather irritated noises whilst sifting through the computer screen to try and find us an alternative room. After a few minutes with absolutely no comments, apologies or any eye contact with us she eventually conferred with a colleague and shrugging said &quot; a room for you, I will take you&quot;. She was not impolite just apathetic. We were shown through a set of doors but not into the room which was through another door and up a sort of half spiral stairway at the back of the hotel. It smelt musty and unused on these stairs and this smell followed us into the room. Room 129 had lovely contemporary decor and was a good size for a London Hotel. No view apart from other windows and possibly a generator which hummed all night. If we had had no sense of smell it would have been fine. The bathroom also smelt damp and musty, with an unnatractive layer of peachy brown mould around the bath and shower. On request from us the housekeeper did arrive and spray room freshener around but it made no difference and no other rooms were available as we were told the place was full. We slept with the window open and the air con on just to air the room. Breakfast was excellent with extremely attentive service which in some way redeemed the smelly room scenario. What a shame, we have stayed in other radisson hotels, all of them wonderful ,but this just didn't meet the grade expected. It was in a great location for the museums, Hyde park and The Royal Albert Hall but we will not stay there again.	
Jun 19 2008 	I was not 'Wowed'  We only stayed here 1 night	I am sure that if I had booked a week here we would have got a better room, we were on floor 1 and 1/2 which was hard to manuver the luggage there up and down the narrow stairs, but the room was quiet and the bed was king. Tiny little tv, which they did display our name on.We arrived exactly halfway thru our 2 week vacation, and to our surprise we found a laundrymat just a short walk down the street. We had asked the front desk about this and got the deer in the headlight looks and I couldn't believe that they did not know about this.After traveling from Paris most of the day, we used this location to wash up our clothes, browse around Sainsburys,check out the internet cafe, buy a new suitcase at a local shop, had a great dinner at Garfunkels, and rest up for the next hotel that we stayed in for 8 days in Central London, which later we could not find a laundrymat anywhere close by.The don't provide shampoo and much bathroom amenities so be prepared and bring your own. Those awful smelling pump bottles in the shower, and the standard marble bathrooms which you have to be very careful getting in and out of the shower.When we were leaving we asked for a taxi, and they said that the taxis were all busy and they had a private car service that they used instead at a agreed upon price. What a jewel of a guy he was. We got caught in traffic going to Picadilly and would have surely had to pay a mint if we were in a regular taxi. We later booked him for a ride to the airport at the end of the trip for a very fair price, and really made a nice friend. We saved his card for the next trip. The location of this hotel next to Kensington is very nice.I would stay here again for the convience of the laundry but would move on to a nice hotel later.	
Jun 14 2008 	A mixed bag	I stay at this hotel when I go to London on business because it is in such a convenient location. Each time I stay it is different, I've had quite a mixture of rooms from lovely spacious twins on the front of the building to pokey boxrooms on the back. The last room I had in May 08 was a very nice double with bags of space. The staff are ok, there are sometimes problems at check in / out with missing details but I always have a print out of my booking and it's always sorted out. One problem I always have is getting conected to the internet, so far I haven't been able to connect using their data ports or the phone socket at the desk, I sometimes get through by unplugging the bedside phone and using that socket. I've asked the staff each time but am always told that the person who could help has gone home. On the other hand when I left a shirt behind in May they sent it back to my by recorded delivery. Overall the location is great and the hotel is very nice, it keeps me going back each time!	
Jun 2 2008 	Great location great hotel	I booked this hotel through a &quot;discount&quot;-website for a good price. Was promised a 3-4 star hotel in Kensington and that was exactly what I got. Other reviews here have complained about the size of the room, dirty rooms with no windows etc. I got none of that.Our room was located a bit far from the reception and it took us about 2 minutes of walking and elevating to get to it. The beds were a bit spartan (rather thin matress on a wood box) and there was no lamp on the nightstand.These were the only negatives !The breakfast was excellent, staff very helpful the entire stay providing us with information about busses/tubes, maps of London etc. The room was average sized with clean carpet and bathroom and two large windows facing a quiet alleyway. We slept with the window open and never got disturbed by traffic or other. The decor of the hotel is also beautiful.I am a happy customer and will definetly return. The location is superb with busses and tubes close by that go directly to both Kensington High Street and Oxford.	
May 12 2008 	I will return	I just got back from my European Vacation, of which the first leg was a 3-night stop in London. The hotel was fantastic. Great location as it was super close to the Glouchester Rd Tube and the South Kensignton Station. Which from there, you can go anywhere in London. Excellent restaurants within walking distance. Upon arrival, the concierge seemed a bit aloof, but ended up being extremely helpful and patient when it came time to book tours. The complimentary breakfast was ok. nothing spectacular but it filled my friend and I up until dinner so that was a plus. The restaurant/bar staff ijn the morning and at night worked really hard to ensure we had a great time at the hotel. Smiley during breakfast knew to get me my maple syrup with the french toasts. That made my day. I loved the decor of the hotel and it was in an upscale and quiet part of London. I went out every night and didn't get back until 530 in the morning and felt extremely safe walking around the neighborhood. The only thing that I found odd was the small size of the elevator and the bathroom sinks. but that can't be changed so I won't harp on it. I thought the room sizes were quite adequate for 2 big girls and we didn't have a problem manuevering around it.	
May 9 2008 	good location perfect for a sight seeing trip	we arrived at the hotel early, around 12pm and they gave us a room immediately. a fab start after a long journey. the hotel was spacious actually - we had a king size bed and a 3 seater sofa and a lot of space really. I was quite shocked - in a good way. It is literally a 2 minute walk from the gloucester road underground station with quite a lot of local amenities such as a waitrose and tesco right nearby in case you want to buy some water and a sandwich, restaurants too. The breakfast at the hotel was also excellent - my boyfriend was very pleased that they had 'real cumberland sausages' not the shoddy cheap breakfast you can expect elsewhere - although the service was a little slow for tea and toast. When we spoke to the receptionists they were polite and attentive and ready to give us tourist information when we asked. all in all i'd say a very good experience.	
Apr 21 2008 	Saved From 2star Hotel	I had booked a crummy hotel through AAA and my travel buddy was so upset she rescued us from the dump I booked. This hotel was great. Since the paint ended up being wet in our room, we were given a tour and allowed to pick our room. We got a room with two twin beds with a view. The tub was very long and great, although I think it leaked to the floor below when I was taking a bath. My friend request down duvets, which we got. The TV was small but all England seems to be like this. I guess people aren't in a rush to watch BBC. We met a couple of nice men at the bar and headed out to tiger-tiger. We were close to the underground and in an okay location for the bus. There was a grocery store around the corner as well. Overall a great hotel.	
Apr 4 2008 	Great Hotel and lovely staff.	We really enjoyed our over night stay, buffet breakfast was cooked fresh and was lovely. Room was nice and spacious (mind you we did have a Deluxe room). Staff was extremely helpful and friendly allowed us to check in early as room was ready. Right across the road from Gloucester Road tube station, restaurants, not far from shops and a lovely walk to Knightsbridge. Overall a great stay. Would use again.	
Mar 30 2008 	Worst room ever	The only real good thing this hotel has going for it is the location. The room was was one of the most depressing places i ever stayed in my life. It actually had no window! only a small frosted glass panell approx. 2ft x 3ft that seemed to have florescent lighting behind it. But the worst was trying to get asleep as the room seemed to be situated next to the laundry or boiler room. The room rumbled and vibrated all night long it was like trying to sleep in truck with the engine switched on!!! In the morning i alerted the concierge to this nightmare.He offered another room which i dually accepted although the decent thing would have been to reimburse me for night. Raddison should not be allowed to use that room as a bedroom as it seems to be a converted boiler room. The staff were professional but not exactly friendly. It was my first stay in a Raddison hotel and certainly my last.	
Mar 28 2008 	Never again	This hotel was definitely not what I had expected. The check in took half an hour and the staff were quite rude, I called the concierge and was told I would be rung back with an answer to my question and never was so I had to go downstairs and they had completely ignored me! The rooms are tiny and the view from my room was basically into another room. It was a maze to find my room and there was quite a bit of work going on in the hotel. The cleaners come around at about 8 and expect to be allowed into the rooms to clean and wake you up my knocking loudly on the door. The keycards and lift are useless half the time they do not work. The only time that I found the staff useful was when I was handing over my money. The location was quite empty in the evenings apart from a few dodgy men and I felt quite unsafe taking money out of the ATM.The other problem was that contrary to what had been said about it being close to Harrods, it is actually 2 tube stops away from the Knightsbridge stop. The only positive thing is that if you dont eat at the hotel there are quite nice cafes opposite the tube station.	
Mar 20 2008 	Great location	We stayed here in September 2007 it is close to the tube, the Breakfast is excellent, the rooms are small but clean we sayed in a room at the back of the hotel which was very quite, staff were helpful and friendly I would stay there again	
Mar 20 2008 	Saving grace are the staff	This is the third time I've stayed in the Vanderbilt - the first time was good; the second mixed (yucky brown crusty stuff on bath towels!) and this time -also mixed.I arrived and found they had no record of my booking. Fortunately I had the paperwork with me and they found me a room - all this took a long time as their room booking system was down, so they couldn't issue keys, find which rooms were unallocated etc. The receptionist was good, very polite, helpful and apologetic. I went to my room which was possibly the smallest I have ever seen - it almost induced claustrophobia. I asked for a different room, another polite and helpful member of staff came to get me to take me to a new room and we embarked on a mystery tour of the hotel. The first room was already taken; the second found to be unavailable after all, etc etc. Eventually I ended up in a nice twin room, which was very comfortable - only two minor faults. The bathroom stank of cigarette smoke - so much so it was almost unusable (non-smoking room) and the sink tap had been plumbed in the wrong way meaning hot and cold were reversed - a minor thing admittedly. The breakfast was nice, staff throughout were helpful and pleasant - they are the hotel's best feature (except for the location). Overall, it's not a bad hotel, if you get the right room.	
Mar 5 2008 	Just what I was looking for!	I just completed a five night stay at The Vanderbilt and cannot understand why this hotel is not ranked higher among TripAdvisor hotels. I had a wonderful stay! I booked a single room through the hotel website at a very reasonable rate. Although the website stated the room would have one twin bed, my room actually had one double bed, although it was still considered a single room due to its small size.The positives: Staff is very pleasant and willing to help. There are a few steps from street level to the lobby and I was helped with my luggage both coming and going. The room, while small, was well laid out and I had plenty of storage space for my belongings. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, as well as two computers in the lobby for use by guests at no charge. The hotel is very clean and always smelled fresh. Housekeeping was quick to make up my room everyday. The heated towel rack in the bathroom is a nice touch and the towels were oversized and very cozy! The hotel also provides washcloths, which are sometimes tough to find in European hotels. I had no issues with water pressure as some of the other reviewers mention and my room was on the 3rd floor. Gloucester Road tube station is a 2 minute walk from the hotel and there are plenty of cafes, grocery stores and restaurants right outside the door. The hotel sits on a bus line directly to Knightsbridge and the South Kensington museums.The negatives: My only complaint is in regards to the bed. I have definitely slept in worse, however the mattress was fairly hard and I could feel the springs when moving around. That being said, I did not mention this to the hotel staff and perhaps I should have, as they probably had a foam pad or something to make it more comfortable. Things to keep in mind: Yes, this hotel has small rooms, just like the rest of London. Yes, this hotel is several converted Victorian townhomes, so there will be quirks to it. For example, the floors are squeaky and there are narrow corridors and sometimes it can seem like a maze getting to your room, but I find all that a bit charming considering how old the buildings are. There are two small lifts that serve the entire hotel. Yes, they are pretty tiny, but again that's to be expected in a historic property. I was able to fit in the lift with two suitcases with no problem and never had to wait more than 2 minutes for a lift. The hotel sits on busy Cromwell Road. My room faced Cromwell and while I was able to hear traffic, it was not as bad as one would expect. If you think it may bother you, however, ask for a room on the back of the hotel.Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again on a future trip.	
Feb 11 2008 	Good location Poor water pressure	I got 2 nights free when booking with BA so I'm reviewing without any considerations on price/worthiness. The location was great, a 2 min walk to the Underground. And I felt safe walking in the neighborhood at night.Front desk and bellmen were courteous.Breakfast was hot and nice, quite a bit to choose from. At the breakfast room, it seemed that most were business travellers. I don't recall seeing any kids. I didn't find the bathroom small at all. Maybe there were different sizes within the hotel. In fact, the room and bathroom were like the average you see in the U.S, which were quite huge in European standards.Elevators were tiny: 2 people and 2 luggages, that's it!The one complaint that I have is the bathroom. The bathtub has a flawed design. There's a 2 inch gap between the tub and the glass above it, so the bathroom is flooded every time I've taken a shower. The water pressure at the sink is pathetic; it's more like dripping. Toilet flush doesn't sound too powerful; but I've read that it might London. My stay was from two years ago so things might have changed.	
Jan 26 2008 	Small room close to Earls Court Exhibition Center	Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt was an ok experience. The service was neutral, breakfast good (in the UK) but the rooms were really-really small but pretty quit. But make sure you do not stay at the ground floor (0) because the kitchen is on the same floor and it can be a bit noisy during the early mornings when chefs prepare the breakfast. Anyhow if you just need a place to sleep close to Earls Court Exhibition center, you might consider this hotel. It is also walking distance from good shopping sites and museums and very close to the Glochester road tube (metro) station. The hotel was clean and nice -- nicer than smaller hotels next to Earls Court exhibition center (Hogart Rd). If you travel to London as a tourist there are plenty of better bargains.	
Jan 22 2008 	Don't go there	This hotel has a nice web site and a good location, and that is it. They call themselves a &quot;luxury 4-star hotel&quot;, but it is rather a mediocre 3-star hotel. First, we had to walk through a mace of corridors before finding your room. Then, the room itself was extremely small. The bathroom is so small there is only room for one person unless the other is in the bathtub. There is only one lift for the whole hotel and that only fits three people. They even had signs recommending everyone to use the stairs... They were renovating the hotel while we were there but I am never coming back.	
Jan 18 2008	Another Radisson Disappointment	I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed at this hotel - another Radisson let down in London. When I checked in they told me they had no n-smoking rooms available but they had upgraded me to a king-size smoking room. There was no apology and I felt as though they were expecting me to be grateful for this.....thanks....but no....Despite the stale cigarette smoke and the awful smell of room freshener the room wasn't too bad...except....* It contained a 14inch portable tv with a bad picture - this was placed at the other end of the room to the bed next to the sofa,.....so the only place you could watch it was from the bed and you needed a pair of binoculars.....they even had the cheek to market pay movies at £9.95....bad move guys...* There was a nasty smell coming out of the plughole on the sink* The bathroom was tiny* They have bottles of shower gel fixed to the wall - the positioning meant that u kept banging your shoulder against it when taking a shower*There was a lot of road-noise.....This is a classic case of a four star hotel charging four star prices but actually having three star services and facilities.There are better hotels in Kensington charging four star prices but giving four star service.Radisson are good at airport hotels that are new build but they are useless at city hotels that are older	
Dec 13 2007 	Shabby tired worn. Definitely not a 4 star	We were disappointed with the hotel as a whole, as were were expecting far more from a Radisson. The lift was so small- you could fit in a max. of 3 people. Don't know how you're supposed to get in with luggage..? The room (a twin) was very small. All surfaces in the room were worn- carpet, closest, desk. The bathroom was so small that the only way my husband and I could both fit at the same time was if one person was in the shower! The shower was poor. The positives were: good location, no traffic noise, beds and pillows were comfortable. We won't be returning.	
Nov 29 2007 	Good location for London shopping	We stayed at this Hotel for one night, a Saturday while attending a charity event in London. We booked it through Expedia who offered 20% discount on the hotel. The hotel is ideally situated. It's close to the tube and walking distance from Harrods and the Knightsbridge shops. The Natural History, Science and Victoria &amp; Albert Museums are all close by. Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are ideal for a Sunday morning stroll. I don't think you can get closer to the centre of London for this money.I have no complaints about the hotel it's slightly &quot;shabby&quot; but I think it is about to have a makeover, there was scaffolding on the front of the building.The bar snacks were very good, the staff are pleasant, proffessional and helpful. We returned from our event at 1am on the Sunday morning to find the bar still open and quite full. This hotel is ideal for a shopping weekend in London.	
Nov 15 2007 	good choice	Overall , nice location and convinient located near Gloucester station .Staff attitude ok ; congratulations for the ladies from the breakfast restaurant .Try to avoid rooms at upper levels ; it seems that they're having problems with the water pressure .	
Oct 19 2007 	It was fine - would stay again.	My office booked me in here for a short notice business trip, and by the time I read some of the poor reviews I was en-route and unable to change so arrived full of trepidation but it wasnt warranted - it was fine. Firstly, on checking-in the reception staff were polite and efficient. The reception areas were spotless and very comfortable. I was given a twin room on the 2nd floor at the front of the hotel. My heart sank when I saw they had given me a smoking room but although there was a vague smell, it wasnt cigarette smoke - and nothing that 5 minutes with the window open didnt sort out. The room could do with general updating but it was still comfortable - the twin beds were located in a alcove room separate from the main room area containing desk, chairs and coffee table. The desk was big enough to work from with a laptop and paperwork. There was also a mini-bar, free safe and hairdryer (although only the basic hotel type, ladies - if you have an high maintainance hairstyle you may still wish to bring your own). The closet also contained a trouser press and, impressively these days, a iron and ironing board. Oh and equally impressive - the tea/coffee tray has home-sized mugs! The bathroom was spacious and clean, with bath and overhead shower - no probs with water pressure.As mentioned, the room was on the front of the hotel facing the busy Cromwell Road, so yes it was noisy but bearable, and the traffic subsides as the evening goes on. I'm a light sleeper and didnt find street noise an issue in the night. The room had heavy black-out curtains which probably helped.The staff in the breakfast room were exceptionally friendly and efficient, making extra effort to seat me somewhere comfortably as a female lone traveller. The breakfast was good, with a hot English breakfast buffet and cold continental selection. So something to suit all tastes.The lift could be an issue - it worked only once during my stay. Not a problem for me, but could be for those less mobile or with lots of luggage - although reception did offer help with my bags. Fortunately, my room was quite close to the stairs but I could see the corridors went up, down and round lots of corners - again could be a problem for those less mobile.The location is very convenient - 2/3 mins walk from Gloucester Road tube on the Circle and District lines and an array of shops, coffee bars ect in the immediate area. I was there for business travel and while I wouldnt put in it the 4-star bracket it would have been acceptable for leisure travel and I would consider staying again in future.	
Oct 19 2007 	Pleasantly Surprised	My wife and I decided to stay at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt Hotel during our recent holiday in Britain owing to its central location, closeness to the tube and its relatively cheap price, for a four star hotel. After reading some of the Trip Advisor reviews I must say we were somewhat concerned about the standard of our chosen hotel, however to our surprise, we found our stay, a wonderful experience.Upon our arrival (we were able to take the tube directly from Heathrow which was a real bonus for first time visitors) we found that the foyer was certainly impressive and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We found our standard double room clean and tidy and the air conditioning was a real blessing. We loved the quality of the furnishings, carpets and drapes and the bathroom was also spacious and comfortable.The bed was very comfortable (Im 6 4 and need a large comfortable bed) and the couch, chairs and table were perfect for laying out our brochures and maps as we planned our days activities. The room was quite spacious and roomy and very quiet in this busy part of London. We used the fridge to hold our own drinks and at no time was there even a suggestion that we may have been charged for using it or disturbing the hotels drinks as other reviewers have reported..Breakfast was a wonderful experience with so much variety, we could have had a different meal each day of the week. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was always fresh and tasty.Overall our experience at the Radisson was wonderful and really enhanced our London visit. We cant wait to go back.	
Oct 14 2007 	Great Hotel	We really enjoyed the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt. The hotel has been almost 100% modernized and it was our nicest hotel room on our entire two-week European vacation--definitely the most comfortable bed (King)! We had a large desk, closet, king-sized bed, table with chairs, and a nice, modern bathroom with a towel-warming rack that actually worked! Like most of our hotel rooms, the hotel is on a busy street and I wore earplugs to sleep, but my husband slept fine without them.The breakfast that was included was good (no cappuccino or latte available, which was disappointing, but there is a Starbucks right across the street!). The hotel is slightly far from central London, but there is an Underground stop catty-corner from the hotel, and there are other sights within walking distance--Victoria and Albert Museum and Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens. Great pubs nearby, too! The &quot;Big Bus Company&quot; tour also leaves across the street from the hotel, and we enjoyed that, too.	
Oct 2 2007 	A disappointment	Having been fans of the Radisson group abroad, we decided on this hotel for a minibreak in our own country. I have to say we were somewhat underwhelmed. The hotel is an endless spiral of corridors, and our room was very cramped (it was difficult to get in/out of bed as it was pushed right up against the window)and not exactly spotless. The bathroom was very average indeed - and, frankly, for the price (even allowing for London's ridiculous hotel rates) things should have been much better.The bar snacks were expensive, but at least they were big portions and of excellent quality.We left feeling that it was all a bit impersonal, like we'd simply rented a bed. Radissons are usually much better than this.	
Sep 19 2007 	Not Radisson Standard	This Hotel is not 4 star standard.The rooms are tiny,especially the bathroom &amp; in need of huge modernisation.The hotel itself is old &amp; very hard to find your way around it.The biggest problem is the staff and, in particular, the Reception staff, who varied from rude to unhelpful. The location was good as it was just around the corner from Gloucester Road Tube Station. However, all in all I would not recommend this hotel.	
Sep 15 2007 	Nice location - but be careful	After arriving in London, we were provided with a room which involved two flights of stairs (one down and one up) after taking the lift. We asked for a different room, and were provided with a tiny room with no closet space and no drawers (not helpful when you are staying for 8 days). Finally after requesting a different room, we were given a room that we stayed in for the remainder of the trip. Once in our final room, the bed was comfortable and the room was fine. The bathroom was extremely narrow, but everything worked.The hotel only has one very small lift - big enough to hold two people and two bags. We ended up on the first floor, and were glad we were not on a higher floor waiting for the lift on a regular basis.The hotel is in a great location and very accessible to the tube. However, we did not find the hotel staff overly helpful with directions and making reservations and would not return to this hotel.	
Aug 20 2007 	This is good	hi, dear everybody,since I have had great help with locations and hotels through tripadvisor, I also wanted to give you something in return.Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt is a very nice, clean and cosy hotel. Not great, but very good. Rooms are spacious enough (you can not expect anything more in London!) and even if the toilet is very small (our room: 1meterx2meters), it was quite ok! TIP: If you like it quiet, take a room facing back, on the mews (a small and quiet street). If you want more space and light and you can take some traffic-noise - then take a room facing the big street. But anyway, this is really a nice hotel. Close to great museums, and by the London bus you can get to oxford str in a couple of minutes (my sister prefers the tube, but I like the bus). Also, take into account that Harrods food is open till 9.00 pm, and they start reducing some items (like salads) after 8.pm. Worth a visit. Opposite the main Harrods is Harrods 102, concentrated on take-away-food, and that is open till 10pm. Great salads etc. The area around Harrods is pretty &quot;Islamist&quot;, but for example a small walk from the hotel is the Queens Gate, a beautifull local place to hang around and shop. The Radisson Edwardian is a nice place to stay, maybe even worth more than the promotional price was. But the breakfast - one morning the bread was finished, so was the cheese and sausages... but when you ask kindly, you will always get some!I recommend this place. Go there, and you do not pay too much for a London hotel, and you find a nice hotel to stay in.	
Aug 2 2007 	reasonably priced hotel for visit ot London	Stayed here for almost a week with family as part of tour of England; found the lobby space well kempt and well appointed, but the room itself was less satisfying. It had an odd odor to it and was quite noisy because of a nearby generator. The closet was fairly small; there was not much drawer space for storing clothing. The room was quite dark. Staff supplied another lamp, but it only marginally improved the darkness - reading was impossible. The bed, however was comfortable. The bathroom, though very small and awkwardly arranged (no room to stand beside the tub, for instance) was clean. Food at breakfast was fine and there was a substantial variety; service at breakfast was excellent but at other times while visiting the restaurant / bar one could sit for extremely long periods and not be able to attract the attention of the staff. Service by the reception personnel was spotty - some helpful, others less. The location is fine; one can walk to the Victoria / Albert Museum, the Museum of Natural History, and Harrods; plus there are a variety of inexpensive cafe's nearby.	
Aug 1 2007 	My Home From Home	I stay at this hotel on a regular basis and cannot fault it at all. The staff are the friendliest I've ever come across and you always see the same friendly faces. Nothing is too much trouble for them. The hotel is kept in immaculate condition and the rooms are always cleaned to the highest standard. The rooms are well decorated, have a phone, mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities, shower and bath, Sky TV etc etc. When I've stayed there and ordered room service the food has always been nice and arrived very quickly. The rooms to tend to be a little small because this is an lovely old building. The area the hotel is in is great (nice restaurants, close to the tube, supermarkets nearby and the Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert are a 2 minutes walk, as is Sloane Square). I really enjoy staying here and I really do feel like this is my home from home, I feel that welcome. After reading some of the comments on here you may want to take into account that I am a single female business traveller, I wouldn't really recommend this hotel as a holiday or family hotel, it is definitely geared more towards the business traveller - for which it is perfect.	
Jul 18 2007 	Horrible disappointment	We just returned from a week in London, and this is where our travel agent regrettably stuck us. (We are a family of six, grandparents, parents, and 2 children). The rooms were not cleaned, the carpet smelled horrible, the rooms were extremely small (the closet held one persons clothes, and there were no luggage racks for the other suitcases) and the bathrooms even smaller. There was nowhere near enough lighting in the rooms (probably so you wouldn't notice the filthy carpet) and the window was cracked and the mini blinds were crinkled and damaged (that area would not close so everyone in the apartments in back of us could see in). We had a triple room and were told that it was the biggest room they had (unimaginable!). We couldn't move rooms because they were &quot;totally booked&quot;. The halls were dark and narrow (a real problem for my visually impaired mother) and there was only one lift and it could accomodate a max. of 3 adults comfortably. When we arrived there was a plate of food outside the door that had become dehydrated from sitting there for so long with flies buzzing around it. They never took away our dirty drinking glasses the whole stay, but one day I put them outside the door (where they stayed for over 24 hours) and when they finally replaced those glasses with &quot;clean&quot; ones, the &quot;clean&quot; ones had lip prints around the top of them! The icing on the cake, however, was when I got home I discovered a $1200 charge on my moneytravel card for preauthorization from this hotel which they were supposed to release upon checkout but never did. What was worse was that they couldn't figure out what they were doing upon check in and swiped my card twice so I was double charged. I then had to get on the phone with the card company to get this straighted out. So you see the headaches didn't end in London. I must say, the only good thing I experienced at this hotel was the front desk that helped us with tours, taxis, etc. they were wonderful. I would never stay here again.	
Jul 11 2007 	Above average except for the size of the rooms and corridors	This is a good hotel in an excellent location, with friendly efficient staff. It has all the right amenties but I am afraid that the size of the room and the narrow corridors is below what is expected of a 4 star hotel. I got a good deal on the internet but if I paid the normal price I would be disappointed.	
Jul 7 2007 	claustrophobic!!	Booked through agent for location and pics on website. Didn't even come close to pictures on web. Twin room was so small we had no room to place our suitcases and belongings. Wardrobe barely held enough room for one. Bathroom was a narrow aisle with no room to enter tub from side. Asked for bigger room and was moved from 318 to 314 maybe 1foot bigger. very frustrating to pay $170 a nite and not have enough room to turn around. Staff did not speak much english but staff in dining room was very nice and did not charge me for soup my Granddaughter did not like. George at reception was very helpful getting us a taxi to airport and to play. Other reception told us St. Pauls was no charge. Not so. Dirt on wall from register. We kept window open. Was told that all rooms on 3rd are tiny. My complaint about smallness was disregarded and I would have paid more for bigger room! Were staying at the Thistle Marble Arch and would have gone back there if rooms available. What a disappointment! There are other hotels in that area and we will try those next time.	
Jun 27 2007 	Dissapointment	The hotel was a huge dissapointment for me: the rooms were incredibly small (smaller than in Paris, if someone can imagine!), and I had the impression of staying in a shoe box . The bathroom was even smaller than the room, I believe that a man could hardly get into the shower cabin. The bed was comfortable, however. There are some good points: the staff is very friendly and helpful, when I asked them to change my room after the first night because of the noise during the night they were very nice. The second room I got wasn't better but the hotel was fully booked so there was only one room available. The location is fantastic, close to Kensington Gardens and Kensington High Street (shopping area), close to V&amp;A Museum, Natural History Museum, and also to Harrod's. The entire Kensington area is wonderful, but I suppose there are better hotels there. Try Royal Garden hotel, it's a bit more expensive but the rooms are huge and you can get a room with a view to the park.	
Jun 26 2007 	Great disappointment	Arrived at 3pm after travelling for 30 hours to find room was not ready. Had to beg for room and finally given one in bowels of hotel next to cleaners rooms.Would not stay again!	
Jun 4 2007 	Rabbit warren	Good location, close to the tube, main road (buses &amp; taxis) and the London museum quarter. We arrived with a one year old wanting to be fed and having booked 3 rooms but none were ready. Staff were friendly but not too interested in speeding up the process. Requested infant cot, got a cot bed. Room was a good size but hotel is a rabbit warren of narrow corridors with numerous fire doors and only one working lift - not the place to negotiate passage with a stroller. Room service was poor, had to ask 3 times in one day to have the room cleaned.	
May 28 2007 	Convenient Location for the Royal Albert Hall	The Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt is in an excellent location, just a few minutes walk from the Natural History / Science / V&amp;A Museum and around 15 minutes walk to the Royal Albert Hall (The reason for our stay). Check in was quite long but the staff were very welcoming and explained about room access to the hotel and location of the breakfast in the mornings. Finding our room was not much fun ,as it a rabbit warren within the hotel and there are corridors and doors everywhere. The room itself was good and very clean, and we were glad to be at the back of the hotel away from the very busy Cromwell Road. The view from our room over looked the hotels air conditioning units.. Which wasnt a problem as we had double glazed windows and when sleeping it sounded just like the windy night? The bathroom was good, although we didnt make full use of it as we were only staying for one night. The Hotel's bar was okay, but the prices were quite shocking for a four star hotel......It cost £17 for a pint of lager and a brandy and lemonade......WOW.... Although I know hotels are expensive this surely was over the top, and the evening bar staff were rude and very unhelpful as we had asked about food being available at about 11pm after coming back from the concert and the reply was Only Cold &quot; and no more of explanation than that. The breakfast was okay although it seems that everyone in the hotel goes down for breakfast at around 9am, so it was very busy and I would recommend that you either ate early or later Check out was good and much faster than check in. I booked the hotel online for £99 a felt it was overpriced but hotels in the area of south Kensington are expensive so it wasnt that bad really. It seems that the hotel have put all their money into the reception area and the hotel itself is starting to look run down and needs a facelift. But I would recommend staying at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt if you are going to a concert at the Albert Hall and getting home that same evening proves to be problematic. Staying at the Radisson took all the pressure off our shoulders with getting the last train home etc. We then travelled home the next morning which was so much easier.	
May 11 2007 	No problems here!	Having read some of the reports on this hotel, I booked in with some intrepidation. I need not have feared. The lobby is elegent and welcoming and all the members of staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful especially on reception. My double room was small and the bathroom was miniscule but perfectly OK for a one night stay. I was on the ground floor but the room was well insulated from the traffic.I didnt eat in the restuarant during the evening but breakfast next day was fine. The other guests were predominently American tourists of a certain age. A most pleasant stay and not bad value given the exclusive location.	
May 4 2007	clean and comfortable nothing special	nice reception. over priced restaurant - plenty of local restaurants. clean throughout. took a while to get to room as at far end of terrace! Room was very small - bathrooom awkwardly small but clean and comfortable, nothing special - all staff friendly.	
Mar 15 2007	Disappointing for the price	The rooms here are shabby, in need of a serious spiff-up. The management has invested all their funds into the lobby area, so it looks good when you arrive but the rest doesn't measure up. The first room they assigned me to had been flooded -- soggy crater in the rug and a mildewed smell. The next room they sent me to was disappointing in that it had not a single drawer to unpack into -- there were hangers but not even a shelf in the wardrobe. You'd really need a drawer or two because the room was so small you could not have lived out of a suitcase, without tripping over it. When I asked if any room had a bureau, It took two more tries for them to find me one. I was glad I had pressed; don't see how I would have managed my 4-night business trip otherwise. The small disappointments in the final room: shower drain was plugged up, toilet tank ran incessantly, stained walls -- were not dire, but I felt the price paid warranted better quality. On the plus side, I found all the staff pleasant and helpful, and as others have noted, it's a very convenient location, kitty-corner to Gloucester Rd tube stop.One last caution: when you check in and they offer you the morning paper, be forewarned they will add a hefty charge to your bill for this! They never said that up front, and the way they offered, I inferred that the newspaper would be complimentary.	
Feb 23 2007	Good but some irritations	I've stayed here on several occasions on business. At a rate of £99 inc. full breakfast it's good value but I would be reluctant to pay much more. The rooms are a little on the small side but comfortable and well presented. Good level of cleanliness and security. Breakfast offeres good choice and quality. I've never taken my evening meal in the hotel, the menu looks ok ,but rather expensive. The public areas of the hotel are pleasant and well maintained.Good location, close to the tube, shops and museums. Now for the niggles! When I've stayed it's always taken a long time to check-in; the hotel could do with an express check-in for people who don't want to leave a coach-load of luggage in the luggage room. There is often a queue for breakfast even though there are plenty of empty tables. The single lift is inadequate; you'll probably get used to trecking along corridors and up and down stairs.	
Feb 20 2007	Depressinhg room	I have stayed in most of the major otels around South Kensington and Gloucester Road but this was the most depressing room ever. It was claimed to be an executive room but it was dull with wallpaper peeling off the walls. the bathroom was the smallest I have ever been in and you could only fil the bath by standing in it. Ordered a non-smoking room but was given a smoking room which smelled. In facct much of the hotel seems to smell of cigarette smoke. Didn't try hreakfast - couldn't wait to escape!	
Feb 11 2007 	Would stay again...but....	I was pleasantly surprised by my stay there. I had read a few reviews and didn't know what to expect. When I checked in everyone was very helpful. My computer had crashed the night before and everyone there did their best to help me get it sorted. When the handed me my room key we realized that i had been given a non - smoking room (i wanted smoking) and they were quick to make the change. Once I got the to room (which was an adventure (up the lift then down the stairs...) I was taken by complete surprise. the room was beautiful. much larger than i could have imagined. the bathroom was a postage stamp...and that was it's own little adventure. The bed was king size (but really 2 twins put together with a feather bed on top) so not terrible but not totally comfortable. The down side to the room was that it stayed cold (jan. in london is COLD) and the one day i was able to shower the water was warm at best. the other days there was NO hot water at all...and the water was so cold there was really nothing to be done. not even a quick in and out. so two days with just taking a wash cloth and cleaning was a little rough. when i checked out and mentioned it to the hotel clerk they had been a ware of the problem and just apologized (it seemed a little shortsighted on their part - since i told them and they already knew) they could have made some concession (but i don't know what). i didn't have my computer so i used the ones that were available to guests. they worked fine (although seating was not comfortable - i am guessing so people didn't just hog them). i did need something faxed there and had a lot of trouble (they said they never got it although it was faxed six or seven times to 2 seperate numbers) that was a bit a bummer. The breakfast was great every morning and the bar was very relaxing to sit and smoke in. Would I stay there again. yes. maybe during the summer so i don't deal with the heat and the hot water. the hotel itself is very beautiful. this is not a hotel that you would stay with the family in. this is for business traveler and adults with out children. When you get in a cab tell them to take you to the Vanderbilt. there are a few radisson edwardians. it gets a lttle confusing. for the money....well worth it....	
Feb 2 2007 	Great Location	Pleasant hotel in a fantastic area. My room was very spacious, happy with the amenities.I found the corridors and stairwells an interesting quirk.Breakfast was great.Very close to Gloucester Tube - handy and convenient with a post office and boots very close-by.I stayed for 3 weeks but didn't spend a heap of time at this hotel. I would definitely return.	
Jan 28 2007	Great location excellent service	I personally did not find the rooms to be too small! In fact, our room was impeccable, with crisp white sheets, a firm yet comfortable mattress, a clean washroom, and beautiful decour. The service was attentive and respectful; everyone, from the concierge to the housekeeping staff to the doorman appeared attentive to our needs. (I particularly appreciated the help given by the doorman in helping me carry my heavy suitcase into my room - given that he was perhaps in his early 60's, this was not an easy task!) The breakfast was splendid for it was a full English breakfast with loads of fried sausages, bacon, and ham - it was good for us to start our day with a hearty meal because of all the walking we did during our trip. Overall, I would book this hotel in a heartbeat.	
Jan 21 2007	Too much squeak to sleep	I booked this room via last minute.com 'secret hotels'. Despite a fairly good rate for a 'deluxe double' with kingsize bed, we did not get a good experience. I must pass on the pitfalls to everyone else. Prior to booking I checked out the cost of overnight parking, which is £35.00 and you are made to sign for this as you arrive. However I had been told previously that valet parking could be arranged with the concierge and this was free. It' s only the valet part of the parking that's free, not the parking itself, which was not the impression they gave.We were in a hurry to get to the Cirque du Soleil at the Albert Hall , which is superb!!! Having dashed in the room and out again, on the face of things it was very large, and well-decorated.Returning in the early evening, we had a chance to look objectively.Don't even think of opening the minibar door. There is a sign on it that says you will be charged for anything you consume or MOVE. At those prices they obviously know that people may be tempted to bring their own and you won't be using their fridge, which did not seem to be working anyway. There are further security measures within the hotel. You cannot go through a door or use the lift without your key card at all times, do not forget it or you will have to return to the foyer to collect your partner. This was not explained, which could save time and temper. Whilst all these measures may be perfectly laudable, the overall effect is that either 'big brother is watching you', or the area is prone to burglars, which is hardly relaxing. The bathroom on the other hand was miniscule, with the inwardly-opening door almost hitting the bath. This is not a four star bathroom, and despite the well appointed public rooms, this does not feel like a four star hotel. I found the cleaning had been inadequate, especially to the toilet. The sink was chipped and very small, the fittings were cheap. The towels did not look clean or smell clean. Prior to the fan coming on with the light switch, there was a distinct smell of 'cooking' in the bathroom, and I can only assume that the location on the first floor may have had something to do with it. During the night, this first floor location, on the front of the hotel, was very noisy, despite double glazing. However, we may have been able to sleep, if the bed had let us. All night long the slightest movement had the 'bed springs' twanging loudly. Even breathing out too much set them off. The next morning, after closer inspection, I found that the mattress was resting on one of those old -fashioned iron frames - I would be hard-pressed to guess which century this bed had been bought in. ( I had asked for a larger bed, as I suffer from back problems, and did not want to disturb my husband when turning over!) We both admitted to thinking about moving to the sofa the next morning. We could not stay for breakfast, and anyway, I am a firm believer in not eating in a hotel which cannot keep its toilets clean, always a bad sign for standards of hygiene.I will say that the concierge staff could not do enough to assist and were extremely hepful and polite. The secret to this hotel is not to be landed with either a tiny room or a large one in the wrong location. No wonder they are letting them through the 'secret hotels' method.One last thing, do approach this hotel by car on the same side of the Cromwell Road, as there are NO RIGHT TURNS and a long central reservation to contend with going west out of London, but I do not think I wish to repeat the experience.	
Jan 20 2007	Great location!	The hotel is 1 block from the Gluecere exit. (I'm not sure of the proper spelling) WE LOVED IT! The price is a little high but the location, near by restaurants, 4 min walk to Hyde park, and great service made it worth the penny. The service was excellent. The rooms are small, but the decor is nice. They have FREE internet for their guest. It came in handy serveral times.My only complaint about this hotel is the long, maze like hall ways. They converted 10 houses into a hotel. There is a series of doors you have to go through to reach you room. If you can, try to get a room near the main elevator. You'll be enjoy your stay if you do.	
Jan 18 2007 	Good location but really not worth the money charged	I stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt for 3 days during a business trip. The hotel is located very conveniently as described already in earlier reviews. The room I was shown initially was what I would call a bed closet and I am used to smallish spaces coming from Amsterdam. The room had a small window to the backside looking out on a shabby backyard. I called the reception desk and told them that I rather pay a bit more to get a better room. I was shown a second room that was larger but smelled terrible like stale cigarettes even though it was supposed to be a non smoking room. Being an ex smoker I just couldnt take it and asked them if there is anything else available. While the third room was still not quite what I would expect for almost 200 pounds a night, I just took it because I was tired and fed up. There was a moment of hesitation where the Holiday Inn which is just a few meters down the street started feel somehow an interesting option though.The reception area of this hotel is nice and the lounge as well. The hotel itself and the rooms I have seen are dated and often looked shabby. The conference rooms in the basement have almost no daylight and are overheated. I really dont think I would book this hotel again. For this kind of money you can really find much nicer places to stay.I took some pictures, but tried to make them look as charming as possible. I actually closed the curtains so that you can not really see how run down it looks in reality.	
Jan 8 2007 	Highly Recommend	My husband and I stayed in this hotel in December, and it was a great experience. I had read some negative reviews on this website, so I was a little unsure of what to expect, but I'm happy to say that we had no problems. Our room was spacious and very clean. The room included a teapot and tea supplies, and the cleaning staff was careful to replace anything we had used. The other staff members was extremely polite and helpful, and the hostess in the restaurant made a point of remembering our name and room number when we went for breakfast. The hotel itself is in a pretty good location; it's central to some great sightseeing and just around the corner from an underground station. Also, there are excellent restaurants in the area, so you don't have to go far to eat out. My only complaint is that the bed was very uncomfortable, and my husband had some trouble sleeping. But our booking came with breakfast every day, and I'd strongly advise making the reservation that way if possible. The breakfast costs about $30 per person (per day), so it can get very expensive in a hurry.	
Jan 8 2007 	Comfortable stay in a good location	Front desk staff very helpful. Particularly appreciated them getting a room ready for us even though it was before midday. Very comfortable twin room. We were at the back of the hotel overlooking the Air Con unit - so don't ask for room 224 if you are there in high summer. 1 minute walk from Gloucester Road tube, excellent connections and safe to walk back to hotel late at night. Couple of OK eating places opposite tube.	
Dec 29 2006 	Very nice stay over the Chistmas holiday.	We stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt from Dec 24 - Dec 28, 2006. I was a little hesitant when I made the reservations, because some of the Trip Advisor Reviews were mixed. But, I chose it because its reviews seemed to be mostly positive with only a few negative, compared to other comparable hotel properties in London.But, the hotel met or exceeded my expectations. We had a very nice stay. The room was smallish by American standards, but adequate - small but not overly cramped. It was was classy and comfortable. Best of all was the hotel staff and management. There were several occasions where I had to ask for their assistance, and to a person they were friendly and helpful, and worked hard to help me solve my problems (non - hotel related). They seemed truly interested in making sure my stay at the hotel and my visit to London was positive as possible.The package I booked included the full English breakfast in the attached hotel restaurant, which we all (my wife, daughter, and myself) thought was very good. We had dinner at the restaurant on Christmas day, and it was good - not great - but pricey. There are several local eateries and bars within a block or so of the hotel which weren't as fancy, but definitely easier on the wallet.The Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt is in an excellent location. It is within easy walking distance to several of the major museums, and but a short Tube ride to the other main shopping, dining, tourist sites, and theater areas of London. The hotel is just around the corner from the Gloucester Tube stop. The Tube goes directly from Heathrow Airport to the Gloucester stop (about a 40 minute Tube ride) without having to change trains, so the hotel is very easy to get to if flying into/out of Heathrow.	
Dec 27 2006 	Tiny rooms near tube	It's great to be near the Gloucester Road tube. And there are some decent restaurants within 10 minutes' walk. But the rooms really are tiny and the hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren - about a gazillion fire doors to negotiate with luggage to get to my room.	
Dec 12 2006 	Ok but tiny rooms	My wife and I stayed at the Vanderbilt over the summer. The hotel was just ok ... it was in a decent location and had a nice lobby but the rooms were tiny. There was barely enough space for the two of us and our luggage. I had previously stayed at the Plaza, and found this to be much better though. If I were going back to London, I think I would try another hotel.	
Dec 8 2006 	Needs a lick of paint!	We stayed here in June for a few nights when we were in London to see a concert at the Albert Hall, which is nearby. The first room we stayed in was seriously disappointing - rather small and the bathroom had a dodgy shower screen that let water spray over the whole room. It was also a bit mouldy and the whole place is really a bit shabby and could do with updating generally. The staff moved us very quickly and efficiently to another room - much bigger (huge bed) although still a bit on the worn side and had an extractor fan thing in the room that was rather noisy. We decided to put up with it although it was annoying! We didn't eat breakfast there (too expensive and there's a lovely French patisserie just over the road!) or try the restaurant so I can't comment on the food. The staff were very helpful, but I wouldn't recommend this place - I think it's overpriced and will probably stick with the cheap and cheerful Travel Inn (near the London Eye) next time I go to London!	
Dec 2 2006 	Good Comfortable Hotel	We stayed for two nights at this hotel in October. Good location as only a couple of minutes walk to the tube station. Staff were very helpful, especially in recommending and booking restaurants for us. Room was comfortable and everything you could expect for the price and slightly more. The only down side was we had a room on ground level at the front so it was a bit noisy. We initially were given a smoking room which we did not request. When we asked to change the receptionist was not keen but eventually managed to move us. Breakfast is a buffet. Not the best and not good value for money if breakfast is not included in your package.Valet parking was good but quite expensive.I would definately stay in this hotel again.	
Dec 2 2006	radisson vanderbilt not worth the money	save your money-go elsewhere..rooms way below par for the price.Staff are very good having said that.Just not value for money..I expected alot more...	
Dec 1 2006	OK if you get a good rate	This hotel is a conversion from a row of white terraced houses. It wasn't built as a hotel and therefore is a compromise - small lobby and left (elevator), narrow corridors and slight general dankness to the place. However, this is fairly common in London.I probably had one of the better rooms in the hotel (205), an executive room with a huge king bed, smallish bathroom, but with a private hallway between the two. It was also in it's own little corridor on the stariwell and therefore very quiet.I think it may have been a smoking room as it had a rather unpleasant smell.The breakfast in the room was a bit late, but good quality.Overall it was OK, nothing great.	
Nov 7 2006 	Not a 4 star rooms are a disappointment	The rooms were tiny and the hotel smelt of wet carpet and mould. Had to complain at reception 3 times and even ask for duty manager to finally receive the room which I had reserved. Prior to this I was informed that the hotel was fully booked and the type of room I had reserved was not available anymore. At check-out, nobody asked me if I had enjoyed my stay at the hotel or if I had had a nice time. Filled out a complaint sheet at the hotel and mailed it directly to the Radisson, but did not get any reaction on that either. My conclusion, if you have a choice and can spend your money elsewhere, please do... there are many nicer hotels within 500 meters radius, which might not have the quality-sounding name, but which definitely are better value for money.	
Nov 2 2006 	Great staff below par rooms	I had heard wonderful reviews of Radissons so was expecting a lot when I stayed at the Vanderbilt. However, altough the staff are very helpful and friendly and the lobby and bar are excellent - the room was poor. It was so small and oddly shaped you had push the table chair right in to squeeze past to the bathroom. Indeed, the single bed only fitted in the room up against a wall.I was only provided with one sachet of coffee, a couple of tea bags and two litte pots of milk, only one pillow and the bath/shower gel attached to the wall of the bathroom was only accessable if having a shower (which was very poor and leaked).Add to that the television reception was dreadful and the iron was missing. Although I was quickly provided with another pillow, more milk (and half a dozen teabags but no coffee!) and an iron (which was attached to a second iron board so I really was in a broom cupboard!) - I really to feel for the price of the room these 'extra's' should be the norm: it was actually no more welcoming or comfortable than a much cheaper travel lodge.	
Oct 27 2006 	Not the best	We had previously stayed at the Radisson Grafton whilst in London, which was excellent, but that was full. So decided on the Vanderbilt. We stayed for 2 nights. The room we were given was awful - ground floor with a window at the top of a high ceiling. It was like sleeping in a broom cupboard! There was no natural light coming into the room, so you didn't know when it was morning! We asked for another room, but it was booked up. The hotel is in a good location. Obviously do not drive into London - very expensive parking by the hotel - £45/day. Overall a very average hotel.	
Oct 13 2006 	It was great!	My 15-year old niece and myself booked into the Radisson for a one-night stay as we were going to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. We were both thoroughly impressed with the hotel and the friendliness of the staff who seemed to be willing to do anything to assist you. The room was well appointed and comfortable - nice to see a full size bath - and the breakfast was fabulous. A great stay, and we'd love to come back.	
Oct 9 2006 	Wonderful Hotel Staff 	My husband and I just arrived home from a visit to the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt Hotel, London, UK. I was a little concerned due to some negative reviews. We found the hotel, the staff, the food, the room, the bathroom, and especially the location just wonderful.We booked through Liberty Travel and Clarice Jessup, our agent, requested early check-in and a room upgrade. We arrived at 12:30 and were immediately checked in. We paid for a standard twin/double. We received a business king with plenty of room especially considering the size of rooms in London. We stayed in Room 219 which is between floors and rather private. We never heard anything from outside the room once we entered. The tea making facilities were nice and the electrical outlets plentiful. The clothes closet fit all our things with some room to spare. The safe large enough for all we wished to put into it. Between the drawers of the desk and two night stands we had more than enough room for our folded clothing and other personal belongings. In the closet there was also a sewing kit. Our suitcases fit nicely between the door and the mini bar; quite out of our way. The bathroom was small but spotless and fitted with marble. The tub was a very nice length and depth. I did not mind the lack of counter space since I chose to apply my makeup and do my hair at the desk and store my cosmetics and appliances there also. The hotel supplied liquid hand soap and a bath gel/shampoo combination product each from mounted pump bottles. We used the hand soap but always bring our own bath products. There were also cotton balls, q-tips, shower caps and luxurious thick towels on an electrical towel warmer and robes provided. The only negative thing was that the bed was rather hard. We solved this by taking the duvet that was on top of the sheet and placing it under us to make the bed softer. This worked rather well and since we were exhausted by the time we retired each night it was not much of a problem.The television is set up so that you can give yourself a wakeup call and also view your bill. We noticed a charge for use of the mini bar which we had not even opened. My husband spoke with the desk staff and the charges were removed after a second call. The hotels computer system was down during the first call. All was handled amicably. It was explained to us that there is a sensor that lets the hotel know when the mini bar is opened. It can give a false reading if you jiggle it, so we moved our tea making to the top of the desk and had no more charges.Our booking included a full English breakfast buffet. There was an abundance of freshly made delicious items from which to choose. Two kinds of eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, tomatoes, mushrooms, fried potatoes, condiments, fresh and canned fruit, clotted cream, jam, several kinds of rolls and croissants, also several cereals and raisins. The staff served us tea, coffee, toast, and there was also juices and water at the buffet. One day there was also pancakes and porridge available. We had such a full breakfast we never needed to eat more than a small snack until dinner time. The wait staff was excellent and friendly. The Vanderbilt also provides two desktop computers and a printer for their guests who do not have laptops. I was able to book theater tickets, check the weather, email home, and print Transport for London tube and train maps and directions. I found the computers available after breakfast (10:00) and late at night (23:30  00:30). The concierge was helpful and assisted us with on theater booking and a call to the airport. I had arranged most all of our itinerary, activities and tube travel information from home so we did not require much assistance. The location, a stones throw from, Gloucester Road Station was just wonderfully handy. We requested a late check out the night before we were to leave. Our flight had us arriving at the airport at about 13:30 check out was 11:00. The hotel staff graciously said we could stay until 12:30 which gave us the hour to arrive at Heathrow. They also held our bags for us while we ran a short errand.All and all we had a wonderful time at this hotel and will definitely return.	
Oct 5 2006 	Great staff but rooms are fair	We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.Overall the room is clean and small like most of the European hotel rooms. We thought the bed ought to be changed. It was very small, probably a full-size. The bed was hard and I could feel the springs. The bathroom toilet needs some more flush power. My husband and I almost broke off the handle trying to flush it. It also fills up very slowly, we had to wait at least 5 min to use the toilet.We also had problem with the air condition. The AC unit was above the vanity and it dumped a large amount of condesation on the desk which ruined my watch and soaked my PDA. The hotel did fix the problem rather quickly.The breakfast buffet that came with our reservation was very good. Great waiters and very attentive to our needs. The staff / concierge were also very good.Excellent location - short walks to the Tube stop, couple grocery stores nearby.It was a ok experience mostly for the location. However, we would try other hotels to see if the rooms are better.	
Aug 31 2006 	Great staff who made our stay extra special!	We stayed here as a treat for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. I'd emailed ahead and asked if it was possible to have a nice room as it was his birthday - they upgraded us to the their best suite at no extra cost aswell as leaving us a card and a bottle of wine. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the whole experience was fab!	
Aug 27 2006	I love it!!	It was incredible, when I arrived at the hotel I got greeted and my luggage was taken up to the reception. The check -person and all the staff have been so great and helpful. Even the roomservice which delivered my food so quick was very effecient.I deffinetly will come back!!	
Aug 25 2006 	Best Value in London	The Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt Hotel is blocks away from the Victoria and Albert and Natural History Museums and a short walk to Harrods. The Glouster Road Tube stop is a block away, as is a grocery store, shopping mall, ATM and restaurants. Service at the hotel was excellent  one of the best stays I have had in London. Denver Mullican, New Orleans USA. Denver_mullican@prodigy.net	
Aug 10 2006 	Could't fault it.	Just spent 2 nights in this hotel and couldn't fault it. The staff were very helpful and welcoming and we received a call in the room to make sure everything was satisfactory. The room was fine, we were abit worried about being on the first floor because of traffic noise but it really wasn't a problem. No banging doors in the corridor or flushing of neighbours loos, it was very quiet. The breakfast was excellent, very tasty. Best of all is the location, 2 minutes walk to the tube or museums, little further to Harrods but a very pleasant route. Would definitely return.	
Aug 8 2006 	Fantastic Hotel	Fantastic location, staff very friendly. Great room, comfortable size for 2 adults and 2 children. Breakfast fantastic, great start to the day. If you don't mind a walk you can easily walk to Harrods.	
Aug 3 2006 	Embarassingly poor example of a 4-star hotel	I booked a night's stay at the Vanderbilt to fit in with a theatre evening out. The location is fine, and the pictures on the internet which I saw also looked promising. Upon arrival we were told that we were being upgraded from a standard double to a king deluxe room, and the receptionist was very polite. This is where our optimism at the standard of this hotel ended. We were shown up to our room (112) up what seemed like a faded-carpet, dusty annexe, stairwell. Unfortunately this gave a good indication of what the room was going to be like. The room was aged - it could not have been renovated in a good 10 years, I wouldn't think. The curtains - although lined and padded - were not wide enough to cover the whole of the window. There were stains on the walls, and it was impossible to tel whether the wallpaper was supposed to be cream with red stripes, or whether it had once been white, and was now generally grubby. I am only just over 6ft, but I was too tall to fit into the shower. In fact, anyone standing over 5 and a half feet would have also had to crouch under the shower attachment - permanently fitted at a very low height. The window of the bathroom didn't seem to fit properly, as neither did the door to the room, and the toilet was cracked. I will never return to this hotel. Including a couple of drinks at the bar, our overnight stay cost just over £100. For that I would have expected a lot more than we got from what is, after all, supposed to be a reputable worldwide hotel chain.	
Aug 1 2006 	terrible	stayed at this hotel in july was a complete disaster rooms were tiny just enough space for the small double bed leak marks on the ceiling wallpaper falling off the walls tried to check in staff were so rude! didnt want to help please dont stay here! definitely not a 4star not a typical radisson hotel i recommend the radisson hampshire hotel on leicester square-it is lovely!	
Jul 23 2006 	Nice hotel	Location was good, and price reasonable for London. Victoria and Albert museum within walking distance, as were shopping and restaurants.Room was clean, a little on the small side. Only complaint was the bathroom... while clean, it was small. The toilet was so close to the sink that you had to maneuver around one to get to the other.There was a mix-up on our reservations when we checked in, but the staff promptly and efficiently corrected it.I would stay here again. 3 stars for the hotel itself, with a 4th star for the location and price.	
Jul 8 2006 	Consistently great hotel	In my opinion, this is the best hotel in central London for this price bracket. I often travel to London on business and have stayed in some pretty dodgy hotels who still charge £70 or £80 a night. The location of this hotel is excellent - a lively, safe, upmarket area only two mins walk from Glos Rd tube stop. One of my favourite pass times in this hotel is watching the Porsches and Ferraris drive past my bedroom window in abundance.I've stayed in this hotel probably about 50 times and have never had a bad experience. The staff are extremely courteous and polite and service is always quick. On the rare occassion when I've had a minor problem with the room (e.g. tv remote not working), the problem was speedily rectified.For those who have given this hotel a bad review, they can't have stayed in many other London hotels. Radisson hotels seem to be in a different class to some of their competitors, especially the Vanderbilt and the Mayfair.	
Jun 8 2006	Much better than expected	My wife and I spent two nights at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt from 6/4-6/6/2006. Our stay was part of a British Airways promotion where they provided (2) free nights at a London hotel if you met certain conditions when purchasing air tickets. Given the low value of the US dollar against the pound, we decided to take a chance with the Vanderbilt even though some of the reviews here were mixed. However, upon on arrival, we were very pleased.The absolute biggest positive of this hotel is its location. It's directly across the street from the Gloucester Road metro station, which has access to the District, Circle, and Piccadilly lines. Between these 3 lines, all major London attractions are served: theater district, Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey... You name it and one of these subway lines can probably get you close. Secondly, the hotel is in a VERY nice residential area and has things associated with residential area. A 'Boots' pharmacy, Tesco supermarket, and Burger King are all across the street from the hotel.Our room (what the hotel considered to be a deluxe/upgraded king room) was a mixed bag. The room and bathroom were gigantic by European standards. The bed and related linens were in great condition and clearly upgraded at some point recently. The carpet - although probably older - was still in a good shape. On the other hand, the chest of drawers and nightstands were clearly showing their age and need to be replaced. Furthermore, the sink in the bathroom drove me absolutely crazy because it had seperate spigots for cold and hot water. This was fine in the 1950s or in Russia but in a 4 star hotel in London, I expect one faucet that dispenses both types of water in my sink. Also for a luxury hotel, it annoys me a little that shampoo, body gel, and hand soap are community products and that no bar soap is provided in the room.Service was good. Turndown service was provided on our first night. Room was made up promptly between our first and second nights. As the hotel wasn't too busy, they upgraded our room when we checked in. I thought this was a very nice touch considering that we were &quot;package&quot; customers and not cash paying. After our first night, we checked out the hotel's breakfast which was also included in our package. It was a nice mix of things typically associated with both British and American breakfasts (fruit, yogurt, various pastries and cereals). Probably worth 5-6 pounds if you are paying.Overall, my wife and I wer very satisfied with our stay at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt. For the right price (69-79 pounds), we would definitely stay here again on future trips to London. As long as you don't expect the Ritz, most folks should be pretty satisfied with this hotel.	
Jun 6 2006	Short Stay great experience	Friendly and helpful reception workers, they even helped my get airline points for my stay.Clean room with some personalized service. Complimentary newspaper and internet service were great. The hotel was in a nice neighborhood, close to a lot of embassies and posh areas of London. Very close to the tube that takes you to some of the major sites in London and is convenient for taking a taxi to Heathrow. Also if you choose the Piccadilly line also runs at the nearest tube station so there is a direct tube ride to Heathrow. The hotel common areas were nice and clean, although it was a maze to get to my room. The room as small but again efficient-who stays in their hotel when they come to London anyway-it served its purpose-clean place to sleep and get clean to hit the sites of London. Would definitely stay there again and at other Radisson Edwardian hotels-so far have stayed at Vanderbilt, Grafton and Kenilworth and found them all to be consistently friendly, clean and a good value (my rate was about $99/night) 3 things I value when I'm paying for a hotel.	
Jun 6 2006	Very impressed - will be using this hotel again	We spent just one night in this hotel - May 31st. We were in London for a concert in the Royal Albert Hall. Firstly - this hotel is very easy to reach using public transport. We flew into Heathrow, got the Heathrow Express to Paddington and then the tube to Gloucester Road. The Hotel is literally across the road from the tube station - a 2 minute walk. The check in staff were very friendly and efficient. They gave us directions to the Royal Albert Hall. I spent quite a lot of time working in London so I'm used the the hotels and the size of the rooms. I was really surprised by our room - a standard double. It was a really good size, desk, seating area with table and chairs, good wardrobe and big bathroom. Yes, the bed was a bit on the small side but it was not a problem. The room was spotless, towels were all clean, mini bar, heated towel rail, speakers in the bathroom, air con, trouser press. We went out for lunch and when we got back we had a voicemail from the manager welcoming us. We did not have breakfast in the Hotel as £15 each for an English breakfast is just extortionate but the norm for London. We did have a drink in the bar the night before and it was a lovely room to sit in for a coulple of hours. There are loads of cafes and restaurants around anyway so you don't have to walk too far for a good (cheap) feed. If you are heading in the direction of Harrods anyway then I'd recommend the Patisserie Valerie on Brompton Road (215) [-] where two people will eat well for £18.00. We got home a day later and had an email waiting for us from this hotel thanking us from staying and inviting feedback. We paid £80 sterling for the night which is good value for London and this location. It's close to Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall, Diana Memorial Fountain, Harrods, Knightsbridge, Victoria and Albert Museum - all within 10 to 15 mins pleasant walking distance.	
May 22 2006	Great Place Bad Beds	Fairly nice hotel in a great location and having read older complaint posts about it things have definitely been improved regarding staff; however, it's hard to give a hotel a good review when the hotel is too cheap to buy decent beds for their guests. I was in two different rooms on two different stays and both times I had to sleep on something that was on the verge of being a torture device.	
Apr 30 2006 	In a great neighborhood	I stayed at this hotel for one night on March 9, 2006 because of a British Airway's free stay promotion. It was conveniently located about 1 blk away from Gloucester Station. The neighborhood is pretty wealthy and very nice. I felt safe walking around by myself. Since I traveled alone, I got a single room. The room was tiny but had enough &quot;amenities&quot; for a fairly comfortable stay. My room contained a mini-fridge, small t.v., decent bathroom (with towel warmers), small closet w/ safe, a small desk where I was able to work on my laptop, and some other items. The bed was pretty comfortable - not too soft but not too hard.I can't remember if I was able to connect to the wi-fi network from my room, but there are two computers (w/ free internet) by the telephone area downstairs in the lobby. The front desk people were very nice. The only thing I didn't like is that you have to go up about 5-8 somewhat steep steps from the street into the lobby, so that if you are lugging heavy suitcase(s) it is quite a pain. No one asked to help me and there was a person behind a counter inside facing the door watching...I'm pretty short (5'2&quot;) and was carrying three pretty heavy cases.The english breakfast is wonderful! I ate so much that I wasn't really hungry around lunchtime, so I was able to save some money for a nice dinner. It is essentially an all-you-can-eat buffet with many different choices. The sausages, bacon (it's so much better than american bacon), potatoes, mushroom, and eggs were some of my favorites. They also had a cereal, fruit and cheese section if you preferred a lighter fare. The coffee was very good, and there were some fresh squeezed o.j. if you wanted that. The waitstaff brought out warm and delicious toast.Harrod's and several museums are within a comfortable walking distance (a pleasurable 10-15 min. stroll). There are many banks, pubs, and restaurants (fast and sit-down) by Gloucester Station. In the evening, I hopped on the train to Covent Garden to watch a theatre show. It was a quick commute and since there were lots of people on the streets and train, I felt pretty safe.Overall, I had a nice experience at this hotel. It is conveniently located to many attractions and is in a very nice area. However, I don't think it would've been worth paying the normal room rate for the room I had. It's a nice hotel, but not a grand one. So, next time if I want to stay in that area, I would look for something more reasonably priced. Otherwise if they have a special, cheaper rate then I might stay again.	
Apr 16 2006	Great Value for Money	I stayed at this hotel one night during a business trip in April 2006. I was travelling alone and I was looking for something good but at a good price.Through the radisson sas website I got a rate of 79£ per night (which is an absolute bargain in london) and was pleased by this hotel. The lobby/bar area is very posh. The room wasn't bad either but was certainly not a super posh luxury (and I didn't expect one seen the money).The bathroom was in marble and very clean. Wireless LAN is free on every room and this was very important to me. Overall a very good hotel where you can get good value for money with this budget.If you are off something more posh I would recommend the Four Seasons Canary Wharf (which has also some good rates on week ends).	
Apr 12 2006	Superb Location	This hotel is excellently situated,just a stroll from Kensington Palace or The V&amp;A museum. Staff were most friendly and helpful, especially at breakfast.Very clean room with pleasant decor. We wouldn't hesitate to book The Vanderbilt again	
Apr 12 2006	Tired rooms smokey public areas friendly staff who are too busy	Everywhere in the hotel smelt of cigarette smoke. it was so bad that we were woken up at 3am one morning because of the stench wafting into our room from the corridor. The only exception was the restaurant.The restaurant staff were friendly &amp; helpful, but the reception staff were always too busy ( though they were always poite ).Our room was looking tired - grubby net curtains, stains in the toilet, marks around the edge of the sink &amp; bath, drafty window. Other soft furnishings looked to be new, but were let down by the state of the rest of the room.	
Mar 16 2006 	Stayed there March 6-10/06	Average hotel. Room was so small we were stepping over our bags to get around. It was very clean but the maids were the only friendly people we encountered. Had trouble connecting to the wireless internet and had to wait 1 day to get help, after our travel agent contacted hotel. Needed internet for business so it was a bit urgent for us. Doubt we would stay there again.	
Mar 5 2006 	Mixed feelings about this historical hotel	I stayed at the Vanderbilt for 2 nights for a function in the hotel. The location is excellent, being right beside Gloucester Road tube station and with bus links. It's also within walking distance to Hyde Park and some of the museums.When I arrived I asked for a non-smoking room, being told none were available. This would have been fine except for a colleague who arrived 2 hours later being allocated one. In any case the room did not smell of smoke at all.The hotel, being an older building, has several levels, including mezzanines and it should be noted that the lift does not serve these. My room was located on a mezzanine level (up in the lift, down some stairs and then up some stairs within the room, leading away from the bathroom).The room was clean and very spacious and was nicely furnished, however the bathroom (which was clean) was very, very small, with no surface on which to place a wash bag. Several of my colleagues also remarked on how small their bathrooms were.We had dinner in the hotel which did not impress. This was in part due to fish being in the vegetarian caesar salad (they had previously not specified this when asked). The rest of the meal was average with mediocre service. (Please note I write this in comparison to other hotels and restaurants I have been to)One big complaint about this hotel is that every drink at the bar is accompanied by a very generous 12.5% service charge, whether or not a waiter serves it to you. This is compounded by the fact that we had to request twice to have our table cleaned before it was, despite the bar being quiet. Ensure you specify if you don't want to pay this charge, as the staff will not tell you that you are paying it (study your receipt).All in all I would not recommend this hotel, and certainly wouldn't choose it again for business. If you get a good deal then it isn't a bad choice, however for a 4 star Radisson Edwardian, I would have expected better.	
Mar 4 2006	Wonderful Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights and when I return to London I will stay there again. The personal service was extraordinary and the friendliness of the staff sets this hotel apart from the others. The rooms were large (for London) and immaculate. The maids did an excellent, daily cleaning of the rooms. Afternoon tea in the lounge was so good that we made a point of being there at tea time.I would add one word of caution for travelers staying here. If you have a bad back or any orthopedic difficulties beware of the VERY hard beds. There are no box springs on any of the beds at this hotel, a rather thin mattress sits on a built-in wooden platform/headboard. As I said the rooms are attractive but I feel I should mention this odd fact. My 18 year old son did not have a problem at all but I was very sore upon rising every morning.I should add that their wonderful, full, English breakfast did a great deal to contend with that morning stiffness. It was an enticement to hurry down to the dining room.All in all lovely rooms and wonderful food at a reasonable price.	
Feb 8 2006	Great value!	Mr Nipley writes: I made a late booking for this hotel and only paid about £70 for the night (not including breakfast). It's a great location, just opposite Gloucester Road Tube Station, and I was really impressed by just about everything. It was welcoming, smart, comfortable and definitely 4*. The room was a good size. The television was rather small and I really don't see why CD players can't be standard in this and similar hotels. Bathroom was fine, although with rudimetary toiletries. The lift is really small and unbelievably slow, but that wasn't really a problem. I would happily stay again and would definitely recommend it.	
Feb 6 2006	Fabulous location!	I got a great weekend rate at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt to cap off a business trip I'd taken the previous week. the location just can't be beat. It's kitty corner to the Glocster Road tube stop, which is served by three different lines. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the few surrounding blocks, and it's just a short walk to Kensignton High Street. The room was clean, quiet and ready for me at 10 am. The staff were always helpful and the lounge area was quite warm and friendly. The bad points were that the &quot;business center&quot; consisted of two internet terminals a la payphones, the shower was quite short (and I'm not terribly tall), and the room was heavily scented with deodorizer or air freshener. However, overall it was the perfect launch/crash pad for my short trip!	
Feb 1 2006	Wonderful eight night stay	Our first trip to London and we picked the Vanderbilt from the internet. Great service, wonderful room, very clean, king size bed, extra large towels, coffee and tea service with daily refills, free internet service, and cable tv. We did not have breakfast included with room- There are a lot of very nice restuarants across the street and within walking distance. There is a tube station and bus stop just across the street. Great location for several museums, Harrod's, palaces, and shopping centers. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. We have stayed at many fine hotels in the United States and around the world, and this hotel is a great place to visit.	
Jan 7 2006	Free wireless internet access 	We booked a twin room for 1 night in this hotel. As we were flying very early in the morning, we arrived at the hotel at 9H30 and a room was already available. We were given a triple room with apparently a free upgrade since the room was quite spacious with a seating area. Only the bathroom was really tiny, but this is the only negative aspect. Free wireless Internet access is available on all floors with great speed. Breakfast is really good, real orange juice (you can taste that it's made with fresh oranges!) and enough choice to satisfy everyone. To get to the hotel, just step out at Gloucester Road, the tube station is at the corner of the street. Good location to visit Science Museum, V&amp;A museum, Natural history museum, Royal Albert Hall,etc. Bus 74 going to Oxford Street stops in the same street. We paid 105 GBP for 2 persons, 1 night, tax and breakfast included - good deal!	
Nov 16 2005	Nothing Fancy but nice	Our room was small but nice and clean. The Staff was very attentive and helpful. great location for easy access to the city and near some lovely cafes. Around the corner from the Tube station so it's very easy to get around.	
Oct 23 2005	Pretty bad...	I stayed in the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt for one night with a friend of mine. I expected a 4-star hotel and I was definitively wrong... This hotel deserves no more than 2 stars !Why ?The guest room was tiny, dark with a bad view. The twin beds were not well cleaned and especially not comfortable ( I wondered if I was in a Radisson or in a youth hostel !). All the furniture in the room seems to be old. Bathroom was ok but not great.In addition, the room was badly sound proof (hard to sleep in the morning...), elevator doesn't work at all and the corridors seems to be a labyrinth (our room was incredibly hard to find, after 4 doors and 3 stairs we found it!)About the location, others users said everything. For us, it was not great but it really depends of what you're looking for in London.Service was ok.	
Oct 17 2005	Not Bad/Not Great	Stayed here from October 4 - 12I booked the hotel on the overall strength of the reviews on this site, but I ended up being disappointed. The room was ludicrously small, and I know that's what you get in London but this was extreme. The bathroom really needed some work done to it, but it was clean. The staff was friendly, but the housekeeping service kept screwing up. One day they forgot to leave us towels, on 2 days they forgot to give us new tea and milk packets. The beds were like ironing boards. The bedspread on them was like a carpet, and kind of dingy. The windows are in poor repair, and as a result the room is pretty noisy from the street. Beautiful lobby. I did not eat at the restaurant because it was too expensive. There are many cafes just around the corner - don't waste your money there! Great location, just around the corner from Gloucester Tube Station. Overall disappointed for the price; but I know it could have been worse.	
Oct 9 2005	Loved it	We stayed here a total of 5 nights in September in-between traveling to another country. (They even kept a few of our bag for free while we were gone!) It is a very nice hotel, with super convenient access to the tube, Starbucks, and Hyde Park. Our first few nights we stayed in a room with two twins and a fold-out bed. None of the beds were comfortable but the size was huge by European standards. Later we stayed in an executive double room with a queen size bed and the bed was such an improvement -- really comfortable and really nice room. I thought it was comparable to American size hotel rooms although the hallway was small. They also have free internet access, which was nice. I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends.	
Oct 4 2005	Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt -- Great Location Service Terrible	The Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt is in a GREAT location. It is very close to the Gloucester Rd. Tube station, as well as restaurants, a Tesco, and a Paul bakery-- which was excellent for breakfast. The rooms were clean, well appointed, and of acceptable size for Europe. The beds were firm and comfortable. However, if you are accustomed to receiving diligent service, or any attentiveness at all, the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt may turn out to be a disappointment!The front desk staff was badly trained and made various errors with our hotel bill. It took over half an hour just to correct the error and check out. Each time we needed the services of the concierge, the concierge was either nowhere to be found, or we had to wait for long periods of time. Also, the concierge made us reservations on our final night at a Knightsbridge restaurant, and then gave us the incorrect address for the restaurant. This caused a wild goose chase of enormous purportions...a complete waste of time.On the plus side, we did get a good deal for this property, but then again, I'm sure there are other properties in London where good service can be had at a decent price.	
Sep 21 2005	Excellent location	I recently stayed for 3 nights - 14/17 Sept 2005 - for 2nd time in 3 months. Ensure you request a quiet room as front facing rooms are a nightmare. Room size varies but make always very clean.Deals can vary - June rate was excellent &amp; included full breakfast, Sept rate was same but for room only. Breakfast - £13.50 - expensive but several good cafes within 2 min walk. Overall location,( 10min walk to Harrods, 5 min to Museums &amp; 1 min to Gloucester Rd tube station) &amp;friendly staff do favours for this hotel.	
Sep 20 2005	Terrible!	We had reservations with friends at the Radisson Vanderbilt hotel in August 2005. The Radisson Vanderbilt Hotel is a beautifully converted row of old London houses located outside the main tourist area. The lobby is small but grand. There is a rich feel as it is very elegantly decorated. Unfortunately we were NOT greeted with welcoming, warm-hearted professional staff. Just as our friends were about to receive their room key, the staff realized we were together so they ushered us into a seating area to tell us there were no rooms available. They proceeded to lie about construction and remodeling going on, so they had to transfer us to another hotel. Even though our friends made their reservations months ago, and we just made our reservations the day before, they said they did not have rooms available. As they quickly escorted us out to cabs, I asked to speak to the manager. The two desks clerks just looked at me blankly, and mumbled there wasnt a manager. The original desk clerk came back in and I explained to him that I knew they lied and there wasnt any remodeling or construction going on, And because of a sign posted in the lobby, my best guess was they gave our rooms away to a Tour Group. The clerk did not deny lying, but assured me the other hotel staff would accommodate us for our inconvenience. Honestly, it felt like we were being discriminated against because we didnt look like upper-class royalty. Though they said they were upgrading our hotel, they did not. We were taken to the Radisson Berkshire, and dropped off in some alley with graffiti on the walls. This was NO upgrade. After much discussion with this staff, we were moved again. As you can imagine, this hotel group proved to be dishonest and unwilling to accommodate us for our trouble. We will never stay at another Radisson.	
Jul 27 2005	Guests in a noble 19th-century-house	My husband I stayed in the hotel for three nights.The hotel helped us have a wholesome tour in London.First of all, the staff were very helpful and friendlyso that we felt it like home in London.[I would like to give my special thanks to Satu, one of the staff,who made me feel so comfortable.] Secondly, the location was great; Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, and Harrods are all within walking distance. The underground station is located just across the road. Furthermore, there are many restaurants nearby. It meant saving our time and money to go to famous places within short frame of time.Lastly, I liked the interior of the hotel. The ceiling of the Lobby, the antique oil paintings, and the marble fire places created the atmosphere of a mansion of the 19th century. The guest room was clean and well decorated in English style. Our room was on the third floor. So, it was quiet and we could have fresh air through the window.It was a great experience.	
Jun 28 2005	Liked the location	Hotel is well located in a residential/commercial neighborhood. One block from Gloucester Tube station, adjoining supermarket, and nice cafes. We ate breakfast at wonderful little cafe down the street from tube, and had a nice dinner at Italian restaurant 4 blocks from hotel. Hotel is about a mile up the road from Harrods and is in a safe neighborhood convenient to the tube. Just a few stops from Notting Hill, Picadilly Circus, and Kensington. Hotel is 2 blocks from Museum of Natural History. Our triple room was very small, and I frankly expected more. Staff was friendly. I would ask for a room overlooking Cromwell Road, and not get caught in a back room. In short, location is nice and 10 minutes from center of old London. You can walk to Knightsbridge, Kensington Gardens, etc. Converted mansion is pretty, and is on a busy street. Just do not expect large or luxurious rooms, as they are very plain.	
Jun 20 2005	Satisfactory Action on Problems	When we checked into the hotel we were shown to room 7 on the ground floor. It had no windows and as soon as I walked in I said the room would not do. Hotel personnel could not have been more accomodating. This was the only non-smoking room then available but as soon as another with a window was cleaned the hotel staff would move our bags into it. We wound up in a good room without any hassle. We noted that there was no facial tissue in the bathroom and in about 45 seconds a maid came with a box of tissues. On our last day a tour group, due to a misunderstanding by the group-not the hotel, moved into the breakfast room as soon as it opened. They had to be sorted out, checked off, and so forth by the dining room head who did it all with patience and good humor. I was only observing but it impressed me. The breakfasts are worth storming the breakfast room for. They have everything from eggs to kippers, cereals to croissants, bangers to brie. The best breakfasts I have had in London. The hotel is overall a good value, but this is London and nothing is inexpensive.	
Jun 16 2005	Royal service	My 71 year old mother and I just returned from 4 nights at the RadissonEdwardian Vanderbilt. It was royal service. I have traveled the world and never seen a staff so willing to please. The concierge/doorman whisked us up and out of taxis. Shirin called us a chauffer in a red Jaguar, dressed fit to kill, to take and pick us up from the theatre. Mom felt secure. I felt like royalty. We came in haggard one afternoon, they took our shopping bags and gave us complimentary drinks in the salon. Room service was right on.They would call to see if all was to our liking. We ate in the restaurant one night and although the menu was quite unAmerican and a bit strange to us, it was good and the chef came out to see if he pleased us. The location is grand, in South Kensington, right at the natural history museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The rooms were small as they are in all of lONDON, but it was very cozy. It had a hairdryer, air conditioning, tub and shower, mini fridge with honor bar, coffee and tea service in room, 24-hour room service. They also have a tiny lift. Access to all floors is by room key card, so my mom felt safe all the time. All in all great. So great, I hate to add this part, but I will, since it did occur and nothing is totally perfect-on the last morning we had a 5:30 AM wake up call to depart to airport. I actually awoke at 4:30. We had packed our bags and had clothes laid out to leave. I saw a tiny mouse run across the side of the room. I am terrified of them and have never seen one in a hotel room anywhere in my life. Icalled the desk and told them of my fear and that I had to leave the room immediately. They came and got us and our luggage, apologized profusely,sat us in the lobby and brought us a breakfast which they would not let us pay for. They then called the shuttle company who was to retrieve us and they had them come a half hour early for us. All the time they kept apologizing. Despite this upset, I still would stay there again. Each and every staff member from housekeeping to front desk, acted as though making us happy was their true aim for that day. And despite all that, it was done with tact, discretion, and a BRITISH type of quiet gentility, than did not make you feel as though you were being patronized nor even that they wanted to earn a tip. The staff was small enough that they called us by our names and discussed daily activities- but there was no pushiness to sign up for their tours or us their services, at all. In fact, more than once, tips were rejected and complimentary actions and services were given. It was amazing and quite enjoyable. We highly recommend the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt.	
Jun 1 2005	Very pleasant	We have today come back from a 3 night stay in this hotel.The hotel is very nice indeed ,albeit quite small - I think that there are about 150 rooms in all. When we first arrived we were given a room on the ground floor. The room was nice but the bed was absolutely tiny and looked like something from a dolls house. The room was also in the corner on the building and was quite dark.My husband is 6 foot 2 and so there was no way we could stay in the room with such a small bed as his feet were dangling over the edge!!We were quickly moved to a room on the 4th floor - this had a queen bed and was much larger.We were not charged any extra cost for this room. It was decorated to a high standard and had good quality furniture and fabrics. However the bathroom was very small but very clean. Our only complaint was the storage as the wardbrobe space was tiny.Hotel breakfast was very nice and had a good selection of cereals, fruits, cooked breakfast.Evening meal was a bit more restricted as they had the same set menu during our 3 day stay and so only dined on one evening. The restaurant is quite pricey for what you get but the food is nice and the service is excellent.The hotel is situated in a good location and Gloucester road tube is situated across the road. There is also a Boots, Waitrose, Ask.Earls Court is about a 15 minute walk and there are plenty of nice restaurants/bars there.All in all, a good hotel, good service, good clean rooms with attention to detail. We would go back if we were in the area.	
May 7 2005	Great family room!	Stayed in a family room - #339 with 2 double beds. Room was huge, at back so really quiet and breakfast was good too! Paid about 110 pounds so was good value. Radisson messed up my reservation and hotel staff was excellent in fixing the problem (which is great when you have been flying all night with a 7 year old!)Richard, New York	
Apr 21 2005	Radisson - Average Hotel Great Location	I stayed at the Radisson Hotel in March for 7 nights. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was very small and the food was average. I was also disappointed with the television selection - very limited.The location was great! Close to the Victoria Train station.	
Apr 10 2005	Small Cramped and Noisy	We stayed in this hotel over the November half term week and were very disappointed in it. We booked it as a last minute deal through the Internet so I don't know if the room we got was indicative of all the rooms in the hotel or if they reserve especially small, pokey rooms for people who take up the last minute offers. Anyway, our room was at the back of the hotel and I assume looked onto a back alley. I say 'assume' because they had frosted glass in the window to stop you looking out. The room itself was just about bigger than the bed and storage space was a joke, one very small cupboard built into a corner so you could hardly reach it. The bathroom was also very very small. On the bright side, the room was clean and the hotel's public areas were lovely. My biggest complaint though was the noise! The hotel seems to have wooden floors throughout and all night long I was woken up by stilletto heals clip clopping along the wooden floors. The noise seemed to reverberate along the whole corridor. The hotel is very well located directly opposite a tube station and it suited us for our time in london as all we needed was somewhere to sleep but I would definitely not return to this hotel.	
Mar 14 2005	Beautiful hotel well worth the money!	Had an absolutely awesome experience at this hotel in March 2001. The hotel staff is fabulous, it's right next to the tube, and it's first class accomodations. I will be staying here again!	
Mar 4 2005	A bit too cramped	I can provide several positive notes about my experience at this hotel. The staff members were very professional and permitted me to check in early even though I had not requested this in advance. The bar staff was genuinely friendly and even comped me on a drink during my final night's stay. The proximity to the Glouchester Road tube stop was also a plus. My greatest single complaint about this hotel was the room size. Granted, most London hotels are small compared to many other cities, but this room was especially tiny. I'm not sure if the fact that it was a twin room rather than a double made a difference or not. To make matters worse, the bathroom - which in London usually matches or exceeds American standards - was equally miniscule. I expect small rooms when I travel to Europe but this one was small to the point of distraction. You have to feel that you are getting decent value for the room and this hotel just did not cut it. I can only call it an average experience at best.	
Jan 26 2005	Won't be using this one again	Booked the hotel via online hotel search company and paid for and selected a non-smoking, deluxe double room in advance. On arrival we were shown to a small twin bedded room which had an ashtray and was obviously a smoking room. The carpet from the bedroom to the bathroom was shabby, torn and dangerous. The bathroom itself was very small and dangerous. I am quite petite and to sit on the toilet I had to squeeze between the sink and the toilet, my knees were under the sink (I could wash my hands whilst sitting down) and I had to sit upright to prevent hitting my head on the glass shelf above the sink. My partner would have to use the toilet to the side as it is impossible for a man to stand in front of it and the bathroom was too small to have 2 people in it at the same time. We complained and had to threaten to leave before they suddenly found us a better room.Nevertheless, the service was poor, we had to constantly request that the coffee/tea making be refreshed, to have toilet rolls and they took all our towels save one small one away.I have since written to the Raddisson Group and complained about the health and safety aspects but they have failed to respond. I feel that as we got a special rate through the hotel search system that we were treated as poor customers.	
Dec 5 2004 	Don't Do it - Try K+K Hotel George	My wife and I visited London in mid-November for about 10 days and spent half in K+K Hotel George and half in Radisson Vanderbuilt Edwardian. The K+K was 10x better. I am sure there are worse hotels in London than this Radisson, but I would not want to stay in them and would not want to stay in this one again, either.The room was dark and NOT fully up-to-date, and was about the size of a small closet. The closet itself was pitiful. There is hardly any place to put your luggage in the room. The small bathroom had a TINY sink and you had to wait about 5 minutes for the water to get warm. The shower had a funny plexiglas contraption instead of a shower curtain that made it difficult to reach the faucets without being in the tub (with the cold water). The room had a TV with a screen that indicated if I had a phone message. I found that on one occasion, I had to call the hotel operator to have them remove the message. Otherwise, the TV kept coming back on by itself at high volumes to tell me about the message I had already deleted. The room also had two phones, one of which was annoying. I had to call someone at another hotel and leave them a message. When I pressed &quot;0&quot; to leave a message, this phone connected me to the hotel operator in my own hjotel while putting the original call on hold. Frustrating. The hotel operator also gave me the wrong number for the hotel I was trying to call (but I got the call removed at check-out).My non-smoking room smelled of smoke on at least one occasion. I assume that was because someone else in a non-smoking room was smoking, which I suppose is not fully the hotel's fault (maybe). They got my room rate wrong. When I complained about it the night before check-out, they said they could not fix it. I asked the person helping me to put what she just told me in writing and to sign and date it. She then went in the backroom for about 5 minutres, returing to tell me it had been fixed. The next morning at check-out I found one night at the correct rate and three at the higher/wrong rate. They did correct it with my printed itinerary. Someone traveling with us at the same time was not so lucky. He could not produce the written itinerary, so was charged 40 pounds more than me per night. They also misplaced his shirt for laundering. When he called them, they said it would be right up in a few minutes. When they did not show up, he went down to the front desk and found that his shirt had never been laundered at all.The location is convenient to the Undergound for the Picadilly line to Heathrow and to the theatre district near Leicester square, and for the District and Circle lines to Parliament, etc. There are many places to eat nearby. Or just get on the Underground for dinner elsewhere. We bought 7-day passes for the Underground which were 20-25 pounds each for Zones 1 &amp;2, but well worth it to get around. A day pass costs about 4.3 or 5.3 pounds depending on whether you want to use it during the morning rush hour. Otherwise, it is 2 pounds for a one-way trip. To get from the airport to the Hotel, we used the Hotelink van (15 pounds each). A taxi to the airport costs about 40 pounds plus tip.There are a number of foreign exchange locations in the area, but I found that the best rates were obained by just using my ATM card to make a cash withdrawl.	
Nov 2 2004 	Not bad. Convenient location good staff	My room was tiny, along the lines of a ship's cabin. A navy ship. The bed was a bit lumpy. The room itself was fairly opulent, with an enormous french door/window that opened up onto the porch above the entrance. Fancy bathroom with loads of marble, but WHY OH WHY can't the British build sinks that have a single sink tap, instead of one that is boiling hot and another freezing cold? The staff was friendly and professional. One (and only one) internet connected terminal was available in the lobby (even though there is easily space for four). Queues got long as guests waited for it, as broadband is not available in the rooms. The hotel's surcharge for international calls might be the highest I've ever seen -- check first (a quick call to the states to check my voicemail cost me over $12). In that the hotel is built out of a block of townhouses, the hallways are narrow and windy, with awkwardly placed fire doors (that are narrower than a large suitcase) placed throughout. Getting luggage to and from the room can be a chore. The lifts hold one person at a time, and creep along.I would go back, but in that there are so many hotels in London, especially this area, that I'd probably try something else first. While quirky and not without charm, the hotel is quite expensive for what you get.	
Oct 26 2004	Expensive mediocre and disappointing. Not recommended.	This hotel is advertised as a high class, quality hotel and from the outside and foyer certainly appears to meet expectations. We got a cheaper deal via the internet and thought we had got a bargain for a luxury room. As the price was good we went for an upgraded &quot;king size&quot; room. I can't tell you how disappointed we were. The room was small and not particularly clean. The standard of fittings, particularly in the bathroom, were shabby, dirty and desperately in need of refurbishment. This was definitely not what we expected. When we went for breakfast we were shocked to find that our £80 a night didn't even include breakfast. They wanted another £27 for that! Needless to say we wouldn't consider ever returning to this hotel. Expensive, shabby and poor value for money. We felt ripped off. Stay away, there are better deals to be had.	
Oct 21 2004	Beautiful hotel in prime location	We stayed in the Vanderbilt in October 2004 after getting a great last-minute deal.Our room was a deluxe double and was beautiful with plush furnishings and an extra seating area with leather couches.The location can't be faulted as it's just around the corner from Gloucester Road tube station and on the same street as the V and A, science and natural history museums.Our stay here was very comfortable and my only minor reservation would be that the sound proofing in the rooms could be better as I was conscious of doors banging somewhere during the night. However, that is a minor quibble and I would recommend staying here.	
Sep 28 2004	wonderful hotel	my cousin and i stayed at this hotel for a week in late august. initially dismayed by the small size of the double room, we were most pleased when we were given 2 individual rooms. these rooms were also very tiny BUT comfie, clean and well air-conditioned. the staff was warm and very accommodating. loved the area also. cannot say enough good. one caveat - the rooms are small so if you are looking for large rooms, this is not the hotel for you.	
Sep 21 2004	Pretty Good	Difficult to fault this hotel. Its location is very handy for the various attractions of Kensington, from Harrods to the local Lamborghini dealer, the Natural History Museum, the V+A, etc.; and Gloucester Road Tube station is just round the corner. The standard of service we experienced during our 1-night stay (20 Sept 04) was good (attentive staff at breakfast, which is unusual) and the room we were allocated was immense - you could have played a game of football in it, had you wanted to. It was also well equipped with air conditioning, ironing equipment, a safe, and the various other bits and pieces one takes for granted. The only (extremely minor) criticism was that the room lighting was a bit dull - although, given the size of the room they'd have needed floodlights to do it justice!All in all, a very pleasant stay. I'd recommend it.	
Aug 14 2004	A lovely hotel in a great location	I stayed here for 3 nights in August 1999, while on business in London. I had a single room which was surprisingly large (by London standards), as was the bathroom. The room was simply but elegantly furnished, with trouser press provided. I can't remember if there is AC or not. The dining room was under renovation, so no breakfast was provided. The staff were helpful in the reserved British way. The location was great, in a quiet, residential part of Kensington just down the road from the Victoria and Albert Hotel and the Museum of Natural History. A tube stop is a minute away by foot. There is a decent pub nearby that serves excellent fish and chips.	
Aug 2 2004	Nice hotel	Stayed here for a night, nice quiet London location. Tube Station 2 minutes walk - perfect.Bed was a bit small (suposed to be a king), nice oldyworldy rooms.Bathroom small, but new and very clean.Easy to get lost trying to find your room though.Had to get my own bags twice because the conceirge could not find them (too many other bags).Nice bar, expensive restaurant - go out its London, explore and have fun. A good base hotel.Get the special rates from their website!!!	
Jul 11 2004	Poor standard of accomodation.	This hotel is a disgrace. I have never had such a small room. The furnishings and decor were tired and the bathroom so small you could hardly turn around. The lobby and bar look very grand, don't be fooled into thinking the rest of the hotel is. Staff OK but not particularly helpful. Excellent location next to Gloucester Road tube station. Definetely not worth the money, avoid if you can.	
Jul 10 2004	WORST HOTEL I EVER STAYED IN! STAY AWAY!	This place is a dump. Stay away regardless of how cheap it gets. The place sells itseld as 4 stars, I wouldn't give it two stars. Tiny rooms (or should they be called cupboards?) with no real windows, dilapidated rooms and hallways, ameaturish, yet strident service. The manager of the hotel would actually shout at you (not just me, but other guests as well). But the worst part is that the place is terribly overbooked, and so you never get the room you requested and you are often either downgraded to a basement room, a shoebox sized single room, or sent to another hotel across the city. All the employees are Radisson trainees and have no clue as to what they are doing. The equipment (minibars, tvs) in the rooms do not work. Do yourselves a favor, save the aggrevation and stay away. Do not be lured by the low price, it is not worth it -- it will ruin your vacation.	
Jun 1 2004	Nice Hotel	Overall we were really pleased with the hotel accommodations. We asked for a double room on a higher floor, and got a spacious (for London!) room with enough area for our two weeks worth of luggage. The hotel location is great--right across the street from the Gloucester Rd tube stop. Our rate included a full breakfast, which was very good and a lot of food. The staff is very nice and friendly; however, we didn't find them to be very helpful for directions, or knowledgeable about London. Overall the Radisson was very nice and we would stay there again. 	
May 31 2004	You can do better	The location is great and the staff is wonderful, but the rooms are TINY! The walls are paper thin, and there is barely room for a double bed. This is small even by London standards. Try the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for about the same price	
Apr 2 2004	Ok if you get a good deal	I visited the Radisson Edwardian for 1 night in March 2004. The exterior of the hotel is very impressive &amp; the location is unbeatable. The lobby too, while small, is very pretty. However, having stayed in many similar hotels in London previously I can say that this wasn't the best - &amp; can echo other reviews about room service trays left in the corridoor &amp; unworkable lifts. Our room too had a mouldy smell which was only relieved by opening the window. Also the speakers in the bathroom didn't work (not essential, admittedly, but we had booked the hotel for a touch of luxury) and the TV wasn't exactly user-friendly. That said, the staff couldn't have been more helpful and we were even upgraded to a better room when they found out our trip was to celebrate my mother's birthday. They offered to make a reservation for us for dinner in the evening, and even called to remind us to put our clocks forward one hour (we stayed the weekend that the clocks in the UK change from GMT to BST). This hotel doesn't match up to the Copthorne Tara, for example, but we did benefit from a special internet rate which made the trip value for money. Don't bother with the breakfast though - not really worth Â£13.95!	
Mar 26 2004	You won't get what you pay for here	I have stayed in many four- and five-star hotels and can honestly say that the level of service and amenities are closer to that of a two star. Our room was very small, although the room next to ours was even smaller (think prison cell), and even though we were staying there for over a week on our honeymoon, the staff was unwilling to move us from our room with twin beds to one with a king until our final night (at the cost of 50 additional pounds). The mattresses on the beds were little more than box springs with a thin layer of padding, so an angry spring is waiting to spear your tender bits every time you try to get comfortable. Our room was cleaned very haphazardly and covered with a film of dust until I drew a design in it with my finger. Some of the hallways and corridors smelled of mold and often room service dirty dishes were left in the halls for days. Also, there was a miscellaneous sulfur smell that would permeate the bathroom several times a day, forcing us to open the windows each time or be left smelling rotten eggs for an hour.The concierge was rarely available or even present and most of the hotel staff were not familiar with the area. When we'd ask for dining suggestions, we were met with blank stares. The majority of the hotel staff did not seem to speak fluent English. In fact, I only saw one native English person working there during the entire 8 day stay. One afternoon, a staff member walked into our room while we were napping, shouting &quot;Mini bar&quot; as she opened the door without knocking. Thankfully we were dressed! Also, the lifts would inexplicably take us to the basement about half the time we used them.On a positive side, we had very little sound from the street on our 3rd floor streetside room, and the hotel is located very conveniently near the Glouchester tube and many restaurants, grocery stores, a Starbucks, and the like. There's also a great Indian restaurant and an internet cafe a few blocks up. Also, the Natural History museum and the V&amp;A are about six blocks away, not to mention Harrods and some lovely Knightsbridge shopping ten minutes walk further. The neighborhood seemed to be relatively safe. You really couldn't ask for a better location.	
Feb 9 2004	Finallygot it right	I stayed a week. On arrival I discovered just how small some rooms can be at this hotel, I could not walk around my bed. I then moved to a dungeon room on the ground floor where after two days of no mobile reception and constantly climbing over laundry and vaccum cleaners to get in my room, I changed again! Finally a 3 floor room which was much better.	
Feb 5 2004	Nice and clean and great breakfast!!!	We stayed here during a summer visit and found it very pleasant. The best thing was the breakfast that came with our stay. There was never a need for lunch after this feeding. It was excellent and varied fare. The room was clean and nicely set up. I would stay here again.	
Jan 29 2004 	Excellent Hotel	Having stayed in a number of London hotels over the last few years I would highly recommend the Vanderbilt Hotel to both business and leisure travelers. Great location, good staff, a sensational buffet breakfast and ample local amenities readily available (e.g. supermarkets, laundromats, reasonable priced restaurants, tube station, etc).The building is rather grand and the foyer, lounge, bar and dining areas combine stylish elegance with all the modern facilities you could ask for such as free Internet access to a PC in the lounge. I stayed on a ground floor room that was large for a London hotel. Very tidy room with a nice bathroom. Was a little noisy at times, but not too badThe breakfast provided as part of the room charge was simply sensational. Wonderful selection of hot and cold foods (e.g. real fruit salads, cereals, juices, sausages, bacon, eggs, toast, etc) and very attentive staff. The breakfast itself is worth about &amp;#8356;12-15. We ate out in the evenings and there is a wide selection of reasonably priced restaurants (Thai, Indian, Italian, etc) within 100-300 metres of the Vanderbuilt.Gloucester Road tube station is only 50 metres away and services the District and Circle lines. It is a great location for the business traveler needing to use the tube to get around London. Kensington itself is a very nice part of London, with nowhere near as many tourists as Bayswater, Notting Hill and Paddington. If you can afford a 4-star hotel in London then do yourself a favour and stay at the Vanderbilt.	
Jan 25 2004	Great service great location very pleased	I stayed for 2 weekends Jan 2004. Great service, checked in early (10am), checked out late (12pm). Rooms were small but very clean and were nicely decorated. Hotel street front, very quaint, kept with the style of the neighborhood. Nice breakfast. The Staff was very willing to please you.  The first weekend I traveled about the city and was pleased to discover that Kensington was my favorite area to stay. Within walking distance of several attractions, it is a very relaxing, safe location. Traveled to another location in England for the week. Then returned to London for the second weekend. I was happy to return to The Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt, it felt like home away from home.  The tube station is right around the corner. Coffee shops and small grocery stores there too. Nice Indian restaurant as well.	
Jan 7 2004	Loved This Cozy Hotel During Our First Trip to London!	This was our first trip to London. After much research (including this site!), we booked at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt through www.londontown.com (another great site). Our rate was 105 GBP per night, inclusive of all taxes and a full breakfast. The hotel is in a very quaint area across the street from the Gloucester Road Tube station on the Picadilly Line.We had a corner room on the top floor, secluded from all the other rooms, so we had a lot of peace and quiet. It was larger than we had anticipated, with a number of amenities, including a hair dryer, mini bar, safe, trouser press, and large bathtub/shower. The room could have used a bit more light and a softer bed, but we were happy and comfortable during our six-night stay.The staff was very friendly and very helpful and housekeeping brought anything we needed quickly. Our full breakfast was served in the hotel's upscale restaurant and was buffet-style...eggs, sausage, potatoes, cereal, fruit, meats and cheeses, pastries, toast, etc. Eating a large breakfast helped us save money, as we were too full for lunch! I also suggest stopping by Hart's, a cute local grocery store, and La Patisserie, a nearby cafe, for late-night snacks and beverages.We highly recommend this hotel...it was affordable, had great service and a great breakfast, and was in a terrific location. We will definitely stay at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt again.	
Dec 6 2003	Very happy with this hotel.	Booked through Expedia. Rate was very reasonable. Traveled with my husband and daughter. Room was wonderful: high ceilings, robes, large windows facing the busy street but virtually no street noise. Bathroom was tiny but we dealt with it. Breakfast was huge and included for three of us but had to talk staff into this for my daughter's breakfast. I had brought my Expedia confirmation which seemed to clarify this problem. Tube is across the street. Great little market and a Starbucks of all things also across the street. Able to use hotel's Internet computer and was told I'd be charged for it after a certain amount of time but never was ( I was always quick) but there was always a line. Close to great restaurants ie: Polish, Indian etc. Would stay here again.	
Dec 6 2003	Horrible Beds!	If you have any kind of back or neck problems, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL! By the admission of their own staff, every bed in the hotel is bad. We tried two rooms and both were the same: sagging in the middle, every spring ready to come out into your back. We were booked for 2 nights but could not fathom trying to sleep on the mattress a second night so we left. Service was slow and the rooms are small. Definitely overpriced. The Paragon Hotel was a better stay!	
Nov 7 2003	Nice Hotel Small Room	I prefer the City Inn Westminster although neither room is that large. The City INN is newer and I payed about the same price. The Raddison does sometimes offer deals	
Nov 7 2003	Best Service ever received at Radisson	I stayed at the Vanderbilt for 1 night, and I was VERY impressed with the staff and the level of service I received. I had a ground room deluxe room which was spacious and comfortable. The check-in clerk was extremely helpful and courteous, as was the concierge. I have stayed in other Edwardian hotels in London, and this one takes the cake for service and quality. Well Done!	
Nov 6 2003	Not Impressed !	We made this booking for three nights using Expedia.Com, First Mistake ! On our arrival receptionist was over eager to tell us that breakfast was not included, but we could have breakfast if we were willing to hand over a staggering £13.50 per person(EUR19.30) for it (needless to say we skipped it and had breakfast in a beautiful cafe in Kensington for a fraction of the cost).I found customer service to be extremely poor. Especially in the bar. The room was satisfactory, furniture a bit dated.We requested and were granted a complimentary upgrade (so its worth a try).On the plus side the hotel is in a good loaction, with good transpot links.I won't be staying here again. I feel I did not get value for money I paid.	
Nov 6 2003	Don't stay here!	I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights starting Oct.29th. The previous reviews looked good and the pictures seemed alright, so I made my reservations. Unfortunately, when I got there, the room was tiny, I had access to only 4 tv channels, and the bathroom had no plugs or shelves to store things. Even worse, the blanket was something I would take camping - I had to ask for 2 additional blankets in order to keep me warm at night. The hallways smelled of heavy disenfectant, and the customer service was terrible. I would never stay there again. Even if you get a good deal, it's not worth it.	
Oct 18 2003	The Radisson Vanderbilt a pleasant surprise	As a 50th wedding anniversary gift from our children, we arrived at the Radisson Vanderbilt for a week's stay in April, 2001. What a great surprise! The hotel exudes low-key elegance near the heart of London. Our room was large, attractively decorated and extremely comfortable. The hotel management was attentive to our needs and we were greatly impressed with the cleanliness and orderliness of the room, lobby area, corridors and restaurant. The hotel was convenient to tour services. We were picked up early each morning after a great breakfast buffet, and taken to the wonderful sights of London and the surrounding country side. Our kids made a great choice, and we lucked out! Try it, you'll love it.	
Oct 7 2003	Great!	We stayed at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt for 9 nights. I lived in England for 6 months in 1995 and deliberately chose this area because it is quiet and accessible. Glouester Rd. tube station is across the street and houses the not only the Picadilly line, but the Circle and the District line as well. The rooms were a little small, but this is an urban, European hotel...are you really hear to enjoy the hotel??? It was quaint, the location is great, breakfast buffet was good, and the bar wasn't bad either. Great value.	
Sep 8 2003	Great Hotel	We stayed 6 nights at the Vanderbilt and found it very pleasant if you do your homework in advance. 1. Ask for a room with a king size bed in advance, (e-mail them) it will be larger. 2. See if you can get a room on the side of the hotel. It's much quieter. We had no noise at all and our non-smoking room had no scent of smoke (a pleasure)! The location is great with the tube station at the corner and a grocery store, bank, etc. The neigborhood is very safe, and we had no problem walking at night.2 minor complaints. The bath tub/shower is very difficult to get into if you're short. YOu must be very careful. 3. The registration desk is small with a small staff. You might find yourself waiting quite a while to be assisted.	
Aug 23 2003	Air Conditioned!	We had Go London accomodations at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt and were very pleased with the room and service received. Especially nice was the air conditioning during the recent heat wave.
