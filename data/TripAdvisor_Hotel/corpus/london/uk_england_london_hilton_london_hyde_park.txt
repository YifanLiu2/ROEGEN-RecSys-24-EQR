Nov 24 2009 	Great location 	2nd visit this year. Very handy for Queensway(around the corner) or Bayswater tube stations, plenty of places to eat and shop. Over the road from Hyde Park very near to Kensington Palace. Never had problem checking in early after transatlantic flights staff always helpful.Breakfast faultless.	
Nov 23 2009 	Very hospitable!	The location is terrific, the accommodations very comfortable and the staff top-notch. Enjoy your stay!	
Nov 17 2009 	Loved it!	We stayed here for 1 night and I was a little dubious after reading some of the reviews on here but I didn't need to worry. I booked this hotel for it's location (20 mins walk through Hyde Park to the Albert Hall or around 30 minutes to Harrods).When I booked online, I had the option to add a request (although requests are not guaranteed). I asked for a room overlooking Hyde Park if possible.When we got to the hotel we were told our room wasn't ready (despite being there 45 minutes after the time the rooms are supposed to be ready).The lady at the desk offered us a complimentary drink in the hotel bar while our room was prepared. We took her up on her offer and sat and chilled out in the bar for around 15 minutes before someone came in to say our room was ready.We were on the 2nd floor which we were told has been recently refurbished and indeed when we got to our room it overlooked Hyde Park.I'd just booked a basic room but it was really nice. Contemporary in design, and spacious enough for 2. Also it was not noisy as some have said on here. We live in the country and were expecting to hear loud traffic all night but we were pleasantly surprised.We had a lovely stay. The room was clean, the staff were very helpful, the breakfast was really tasty and we will definitely go back!	
Nov 17 2009 	Very pleased	Recently stayed at this Hilton hotel for a week. Great location with beautiful views over Kensington Gardens. Excellent service from the attentive and polite staff (concierge, housekeeping, reception and restaurant). Room was clean, comfortable and quite spacious. I have truly enjoyed my stay at this London hotel and would not hesitate to return.	
Nov 9 2009 	Good location and reasonable price.	I booked the London Hilton Hyde Park mainly for it's location, knowing the standards of accomodation would be somewhat acceptable (rare to find in London!) and at a reasonable price.Well, the room was cozy, even though I got two twin beds even though I had asked and booked for a king bed. Nonetheless, breakfast was probably good though overpriced. So went for a coffee outside the hotel instead. When travelling by tube one can get pretty easy access from the hotel, as the location is quite good! That was really the most enjoyable part.Generally, I may stay at this hotel again, but I would definately look for other places as well. Nothing worse than staying at a London hotel.	
Oct 25 2009 	Decent hotel good location	Stayed for one night on a B&amp;B basis. Check in and departure was straightforward. Room was of a decent size, clean and adequately equipped and furnished. Breakfast was standard with the usual array eatables.The location was very good next door to the Queensway metro station. I had a room fronting Hyde Park. The view was nice however it was prone to some traffic noise. If i was returning to London I would consider staying at this hotel.	
Oct 16 2009 	Not a Hilton !!	Very dissapointing stay at this wanabee Hilton whilst on business for three days.Restaurant is pokey - no natural lighting and echoey - which is a problem when the chef is having an ongoing row with the solitary waiter throughout the meal!! Only 3 other diners but 25 mins to place order. Food bland and unimaginative. just three big lumps of Motzarella, three tired rings of tomato and the obligatory &quot;rocket&quot;, Not even a dressing on the salad and non available when requested !The steak was ok - but served with oven chips. AND NO MUSTARD AVAILABLE can you believe that - whats wrong with the Spa shop 50 yards away .Complained to surley supervisor.Woken at 10.30 ish by front of house who wanted to discuss complaintWoken at 5 ish by plumbing noises emmanating from bathroomNo Hot water available in morning - receptionist later claimed boiler problem had been sorted BUT WHY WASANT IT CHECKED IN THE FIRST PLACE!Told at check out that i would receive a discount and they would contact me Still waitingOh i nearly forgot - water is £3.50 a bottle and cheapest internet access £15 - rip off.	
Oct 13 2009 	took in a show	We have stayed here before so were happy to stay again.This is a really nice hotel which is very central to other attractions.We love the location as it brings back many happy memories for both of us. The hotel is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. The breakfast will set you up for the day, believe me. The area is so diverse that its like trying to tune your radio into radio luxenburgh. ( those of us of this vintage will remember the various languages encountered ) We will return.	
Oct 8 2009 	Your classic average hotel	I don't know how anyone could rate this as either excellent or terrible. This is your classic &quot;average&quot; hotel. It's key positive is its location. Across the street from an entrance to Hyde park and near two subway stations. The hotel is clean and the rooms are of reasonable size. Some of the downsides include that it appears &quot;long in the tooth&quot;, the rooms can be noisy (especially if you overlook the park and the busy Bayswater Ave), there are very few spare electrical outlets in the rooms for one's electronics, the service is only average (not highly knowledgeable), the restaurant/lobby area are rather drab and uninviting, and the Queensway Ave. area around the corner is very tacky with lots of tourist shops and fast food joints..It is perfectly fine given its location and convenience. However, I wouldn't consider it for a personal vacation stay. Instead I'd opt to go to Notting Hill, just a mile away, to some of the more charming hotels with more proximity to better restaurants and shopping.	
Sep 26 2009 	Basic hotel	We stayed for 1 night this week, the room was fine, with a large TV, and tea/coffee facilities. We booked dinner, and was disappointed with it. I ordered Salmon and haddock fish cake with chilli dip, and a Rib Eye steak, and then to fish a chocolate fondant sweet. First of all the fish cake came (1) with No fish in at all, then the steak came and it definitely WAS NOT rib eye, more like a hamburger, I had to cut so much fat off. The chocolate fondant came and it was infact a chocolate pudding (like you get in Marks and Spencer, and much better than this) with a drizzle of milk chocolate around the plate. I did not complain because I had pre booked and pre paid for it, which I will not do again. I hate complaining, as sometimes it gets you nowhere, so I find it is better to just warn other people. We have stayed at Hilton hotels a lot and usually find the famous Hilton breakfast is all you need to set you up for the day, but not here!!! For a start the toaster was a 2 slice one!!! not the usual one where it goes in and other people can put more after yours. So you had to wait until the person in front of you had to do there's. Then it actually came out burned. The eggs looked as if they had been lying for ages, I myself like a runny yoke, but these were like rubber. We paid £165.00 for 1 night for this, and feel ripped off.We will NOT be staying here again.	
Aug 23 2009 	Great Location for this Hotel	Recently stayed three nights here while in London. It was in a great location: close to three tube stops, many restaurants, pubs and shopping in the Queensway area. Our room looked directly at Hyde Park: a beautiful view each morning. The buffet breakfast they served here was one of the best we've encountered on our UK travels. The staff was very attentive and so eager to please. We were given early check-in and maid service was prompt and efficient each day. The elevator is a bit small, so there is sometimes a bit of a wait to use it. We found the stairs to be faster especially in the morning hours. Rooms are quite spacious for European standards. They include desks with internet options, workspace and chair and additional sitting chair for relaxing. Hotel was very clean, complimentary newspapers each morning and friendly staff. The lobby is a bit small, but they have made efficient use of what space they do have with chairs and comfortable sitting areas. We enjoyed this area of London very much and will definetly use this hotel again.	
Aug 22 2009 	Not bad but disappointing for a Hilton property	I decided to try out two different Hilton properties on successive weekends in London this year. When compared to the Hilton Tower Bridge Hotel, the Hilton Hyde Park pales in comparison. The breakfast was merely adequate, there were no ice machines which meant calling room service a few times each day, and internet access was on the expensive side. Most listings I see show the Hilton Hyde Park as a 4-star property. I would give it three at best. There was nothing really wrong with the hotel, but nothing to recommend it either. For around the same money, I would advise staying at the Hilton Tower Bridge or the City Inn Westminster.	
Aug 21 2009 	Excellent Hotel...	Great hotel, great stay.... we were there for three nights in mid-Aug 2009.ROOMS:Well renovated and modern. Average size (based on London standards). Very clean and well kept. Internet available at 15 GBP per day. Nice view of Kensington Gardens. Overall very comfortable and clean.LOCATION:Brilliant... right across from Kensington Gardens (10 min walk to High Street Kensington, (through the park), 10 min walk to Notting Hill Gate, 10 min bus ride to Oxford/Bond Street). Right beside the Queensway tube station and 5 min walk to Bayswater tube station. Wonderful location to be in.BREAKFAST:Very large selection.... similar to a buffet breakfast at a hotel in America. The most pleasant surprise was the service at breakfast. The staff were exceptionally polite and diligent. It was truly comparable to service at a 5-star restaurant. Very happy with both the food and service.OVERALL:Would highly recommend and would stay here again.	
Aug 15 2009 	Disappointment*Worst Hilton Hotel ever*	The worst Hilton Hotel ever! stayed at this hotel for the first time and also my last. 3 nites at this hotel at the 6th floor room with a twin size bed. My first night turn out to be the worst night of my trip, air condition broke down in my room, called for help and waited for 30mins of no follow up from the staff until i called the 2nd time, 20mins later a staff showed up with a small fan, telling me they can't fixed the air condition and have no room to exchange. A fan in the middle of the summer night of my business trip.......They did fixed the air condition the 2nd day of my stay but it can only be 19c, no way to adjust thus my second night is freezing cold and the elevator broke down. Need to use the service elevator instead. But it can only take you to 5th floor, I was staying at 6th floor so I need to take the stairway. What an experience ! Sent a message to Hilton customer service after my trip, it took them more than 2 weeks and couple of follow ups before the hotel respond to my message. the result was the Hotel willing to comp me a free night for my next stay! A free night for my business trip dont do me any good, most importantly I dont think I can handle the torture anymore. One more reminder, if your room rate not include Breakfast then I suggest you go somewhere else instead of taking the breakfast at the hotel for GBP18. Good Luck!	
Aug 14 2009 	Good hotel for a weekend break.	We had a twin room on the 6th floor overlooking Hyde Park so pretty happy with that especially since I was using Hilton points to pay for the room. The room was clean as was the ensuite and beds were comfortable. Noise from the road or elsewhere in the hotel was not a problem. Location is good especially with Hyde Park across the road and Queensway and Bayswater tube stations are virtually under the hotel. We didn't have breakfast or use the bar area but there are a couple of nice cafes right next to the entrance and plenty of other eateries on Queensway just round the corner. Staff were friendly and helpful.	
Aug 10 2009 	BAD	We were hoping to enjoy Hilton Hotel hospitality but instead of that we had the very worst treatment that is possible!Me and my wife had a very unpleasant surprise in London. We planned a romantic weekend in London and booked and prepaid(from 22/07/2009) the hotel Hilton Hyde Park London. Some of the reasons that we booked that hotel were that it is located in an old beautiful building near a great park(Hyde Park). Unfortunately for some reason we were moved to a different hotel, that is not in the center, is a modern 3 star hotel and in a very small room. I have to mention once more... we had pre paid the room 20 days before! but for some reason there were no available!!! and despite that (which is thier mistake) we were downgraded to a diferent hotel !!! I will really consider in the future on staying in a Hilton Hotel !! Till now I have writen 3 letters to them and have received no answer! that is all ! thank you	
Aug 10 2009 	Not great but not as bad as some reviews might suggest	Booked this for overnight in London on business. Unusually did not check first with TA and was expecting worst having read reviews after booking. However reception area was small (can see some might call pokey) and lift was broken; not bode well. Avoid restaurant for dinner - bread rolls not fresh - but breakfast is good. Smallish room but not unusual for London and certainly comfortable. Not the best Hilton in London but better than the one at Olympia.	
Jul 6 2009 	Well located with excellent staff	To start with the best aspect of the hotel: its staff. I have rarely, if ever, stayed in a hotel where the staff were so friendly and helpful. Not just one or two, but every one we came across. As for the hotel itself, it is much as you would expect a Hilton in central London. It is in an old building and the rooms vary a lot in size. We saw three which varied from a a decent size you would expect in a newly build Hilton right down to small.The rooms are are all recently decorated and refurbished. The bathrooms likewise. Breakfast was reasonable and typical of this type of hotel, but unless we had got it included in our rate we would not have paid the £17 standard rate for it.The location is good, in that you are only 20 metres from Queensway tube station on the Central Line, which will take you directly into the heart of the West End in just 5 minutes or so.	
Jun 10 2009 	Charming Small Hotel with Very Friendly Service.	Just spent a weekend at this hotel. Got a very good rate at Priceline. Did not expect much. Pleasantly surprised at very friendly check-in. Small but very comfortable rooms with clean bathrooms and nice size tub. Although hotel is on a busy street, inside room was absolutely quiet.Hotel is literally on Queensway tube station and on several good bus routes that will get you to just about anywhere in Central London. The surrounding area is very vibrant and sports restaurants and cafes for every taste. Finally, hotel faces Hyde Park with opportunities for lovely strolls and a 15 minute walk to Kensington High Street.All in all a great little find!!	
May 14 2009 	Where Hilton sends reject guests	My story - after a 14 hour plus working day, looking forward to getting something to eat and relaxing in comfortable room before pre-dawn start to Brussels - I arrive at my original hotel (Hilton Tower Bridge) and it's closed!!! Ok - burst water main, things happen, but despite having a pre-paid room, no one informed me (by email, mobile or text). Of course I call Hilton reservations to explain situation and arrange simple transfer... WRONG! From arrival at original hotel at just before 8pm, I am on phone with Hilton reservations for at least an hour - on hold for the most part and hung up on once! No one seems willing or ready to help; certainly no one is interested in making special effort to accommodate a customer stuck in London at 9pm with no room/bed, dinner or place to go... Eventually I am told to go to a Hilton hotel at Trafalgar Square - by taxi which I pay for myself... There a genuinely helpful person called Lisa Schwedt (thank you) eventually tells me while they had taken transfer from the Tower Bridge Hilton they are now full and I need to take another taxi - which I paid for - to the Hilton at Hyde Park... Let me tell you about the Hilton at Hyde Park - it is a DUMP... my room smells like a mini cab, no mini bar, filthy old bathroom, tiny - more like an Ibis than anything else. So in short having prepaid for a room at a hotel that I like and trust (returning customer) because I wanted a comfortable nights sleep, two hours later I am stuck in a hotel that is no better than a roadside motel. Thank you Hilton - I will not be staying with your group again and I will be advising my company, colleagues and friends likewise.	
May 13 2009 	Tiny room nice breakfast reasonable location	Reasonable for business travel - breakfast pricey like all Hiltons in London, but nicer breakfast room than many. Room pretty small (no bath) but otherwise OK - not sure if this is typical of this hotel. Small hotel meant slightly better service and general ambience. Reasonable location if you need to get to somewhere on the Central line.	
May 7 2009 	Excellent - no complaints - though only a short visit	Stayed here for one night only and I have to say in that very short visit I was impressed. Staff were very helpful and courteous, food was good, rooms were (for London) reasonably well sized and the public areas - lounge and restaurant - were comfortable. Having said that I've now stayed at Hilton Hotels so often that I have managed to worm my way through to 'Gold Card' level so I get upgrades, free breakfasts etc. so I'm not sure my experience refeletcs that of the non-Hiltonhonors member or if the rooms I am alocated are typical of the rest of the hotel. But from what I saw I would have no complaints - though I'm not sure it would be a great place to stay for any more than a two or three nights.One thing I have to say is that the position and accessiblity of this place is fantastic, Looking right out over Hyde Park and literally next door to the nearest tube (Queens Park) it is a dead easy to get to and has some of the best views in the capital (from the rooms at the front on the upper floor anwyay).	
Apr 28 2009 	small property	Rooms are small. not suitable for busines trips.	
Apr 21 2009 	Surprisingly good	My experience of London hotels hasn't been great so was expecting to be underwhelmed by The Hilton Hyde Park.It's situated right opposite what I think is one of the main entrances to the park and it's less than 15 minutes from the hotel to Kensington where I was working through the park - very pleasant. The reception area is small but checking in was fine with no delay, receptionist staff friendly. The lift was very small but as I was on the second floor it was no problem using the staircase.My double room was small but not claustrophobic. Good wardrobe space, desk, large LCD TV and an effective air conditioning unit. My view wasn't great looking over the inside courtyard of the hotel.Like the rest of the room, the bathroom was spotlessly clean. Again, quite compact but perfectly functional, lots of towels and toiletries and the the shower pressure was very good.Like just about every other hotel, room service food is a rip off - fortunately there are loads of restaurants nearby along with a Spar and Tesco Express.Continuing the rip-of theme, continental breakfast was £14. Totally unjustifiable. Internet access is £15 for 24 hours. If you can find alternatives to the extortionate food rates then this hotel is just fine,	
Apr 17 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised	Booked a 4 night stay through Priceline. Once we got the confirmation we came to TA to look at reviews and were worried. I know everyone's experience will be different but we had none of the issues mentioned by the most negative reviews. Thought the hotel was nice and clean and the staff friendly. We had a double room which was roomy enough for a couple gone all day anyways. The bathrooms were clean, water hot, and had a nice towel warmer. No ice machines in the hotel but the staff was always pleasant to bring us a champagne bucket full of ice upon requet. Queensway Tube stop literally next door made travel easy. Also took the Fat Tire Bike Tour which meets right outside their front door. Had a great time and hope you do too!	
Apr 17 2009 	good location decent hotel....	to tell you the truth i expected more from a hilton brand....while the location of the hotel was excellent, the hotel itself was just ok....the hilton hyde park is bang opposite the hyde park &amp; right next to the queensway tube station....there are a number of restaurants &amp; shops within walking distance from the hotel....oxford street is a 15-20 minute walk as well....like a stated before, the location is excellent....as my colleague &amp; i were in london around christmas for work, we managed to get a great deal of only £69 per night for 7 nights....my having diamond status with hilton helped as well as we were upgraded to a deluxe room....the hotel was quite small &amp; the rooms seemed a little dingy by hilton standards....there was also only 1 restaurant which was not open 24 hours &amp; had a limited menu choice....the hotel was clean though &amp; the staff was polite &amp; helpful....next time i am in london i would probably stay at the hilton metropole or the hilton paddington as they are both very centrally located &amp; having stayed at both those properties before i can easily say the hilton hyde park does not come close to either one of those two....	
Apr 8 2009 	Tries hard... falls short	My wife and I were put in two single rooms for the first of a three-night stay owing to overbooking. Changed to a twin room for the next two days. Twin room was hardly any bigger than the singles, even with two beds. Hot water off the second night when we wanted to shower. Otherwise, great service from wonderfull staff, brilliant location (out of town, but 12 paces from the Queensway tube, and plenty of passing cabs). Directly opposite Kensington Gardens (but quite a way from Hyde Park), and a 30minute stroll to the Albert Hall. Excellent multi-cultural food a few yards away. Would go again, becasue having travelled the world, have learned to overcome small setbacks. For around £100 a night, very good value. They do try very hard, and I admire that - but human error can't be entirely factored out.	
Mar 28 2009 	This is a very nice hotel in a great location.	The Hilton Hyde Park gave us great service whenever we needed it. From storing our luggage even before we checked in to serving us (and even cranky guests) very kindly at its very good breakfast, all the staff at this fine establishment quietly made us feel quite welcome and comfortable. Sitting across Bayswater Street from Hyde Park, this is an older hotel, which was nicely made over in the Hilton image, and this provides an excellent location for sight seeing and enjoying the diverse population of this part of London. It nearly overlooks the children's playground dedicated to Princess Diana. It is literally just around the corner from a tube stop on Queensway Street, which provides access to all of London including King's Cross Station (think Harry Potter) and St. Pancras (international Eurostar trains) that share the same tube stop. Queensway Street also has innumerable modestly priced ethnic restaurants, a real benefit unless you really enjoy English food! It's also within a brisk 30 minute-or-so walk of Notting Hill (of same-name movie fame) and all the unique shops and atmosphere it has to offer. We really couldn't have asked for more in a location. Our room was more than adequate for tourists on the go who only required a comfortable bed to crash in and a good bathroom to clean up in. It did have a very nice flat-screen t.v. for use when we were unwinding from pounding the cobblestones of the Tower of London, which wasn't close at all to our hotel, but quite reachable by tube. Our room had a bay window overlooking the park and Bayswater Street, which was a bit noisy with the window open (it was unseasonably warm during our stay), but it wasn't enough to bother our jet-lagged sleep. We felt it just added to the whole experience, which was great. We intend to return to this hotel the next time we're fortunate enough to make a trip to this amazing country. London is one of the great cities of the world and the Hilton Hyde Park is a fine place to see it from.	
Mar 20 2009 	Good location reasonable hotel	Spent one night at the Hilton as I had a layover between flights. Good location, next to the Queensway tube stop. I walked from Paddington station and it took about 10 minutes though a mix of residential buildings and other hotels. Booked through Priceline and was very happy with the rate.The hotel itself is fairly typical London: A little tight at times, small check in area, reasonably sized bar/restaurant. The two staff members at the desk did a good job getting people in and helping answer questions for people on their way out. The room was small, but really not that bad. Two large closets with hangars would be nice for longer stays. As previous reviews note, it was very warm in the room when I got back at night. The cooling system was not working and opening a window didn't help much. It cooled a bit overnight and I slept pretty well. The double bed in my room was a good size although a little creaky as it was a mattress on top of a platform and springs.One minus with this hotel is lack of wireless internet. They do have wired internet for £15 per 24 hours, which seems steep.	
Feb 26 2009 	Pleasant surprise	Selected this hotel primarily for central location for business trip to London, and was wary as friends had been (admittedly a couple of years ago) and were not impressed. Very small reception area but warm welcome and very efficient check in. Was heading for dinner so did not get a chance to eat in the hotel, but had a quick drink in the bar and service was again good. Nice library bar area also quite compact but good selection of magazines and papers.Good night's sleep although one issue (which I heard other guests mention) was that the rooms and hotel in general were very warm. Breakfast was fine - again highlight really efficient and polite service.Check out also fine - all in order. Overall kind of a &quot;mini&quot; Hilton but no worse for that. Would stay again for a 1 night stop over.	
Jan 31 2009 	If you don't mind being in a youth hostel...	This hotel should not be considered a Hilton. There are certain standards, which I believe the Hilton name should hold - good service is at the top of the list. The moment I walked in, they couldn't find my name. I waited in the lounge for close to an hour as they kept taking other guests and after each one would say, &quot;we'll get your room shortly&quot;. Finally they found my name and took me to my room. If you've ever been in a hostel, you'll know what these rooms look like... small with no ability to change the temperatures. The breakfast the next morning took the cake. I was told the buffet is 17 pounds, but if I walk back out and go to the reception I can obtain a breakfast voucher and buy it for 10 pounds. So, I walked back to the reception, they couldn't find any breakfast vouchers and had to retrieve some from the back... then they said to walk back to the restaurant and give them the voucher so I could post it to my room. An incredible waste of services and my time for sure... the rest of the trip was pretty much in uniform with this type of service.... very very poor.	
Jan 12 2009 	Great experience and fantastic location	All I needed was a place to sleep that was quiet and in a good location. I was really surprised by the Hyde Park Hilton. The room was tiny by American standards, but I didn't care. I took the Heathrow Express from the airport to Paddington Station and then toook the tube only one stop to Bayswater. The hotel was just a short block away from the tube. I was able to check in before 3 (which was god because I was exhausted).As others have said, the neighborhood was really convenient. Restaurants, shops, Starbucks, a Catholic Church all within a minute's walk. Also, the Queensway tube station is right around the corner from the hotel (even closer then Bayswater!) so travelling around London was super convenient.Jorge was the one who checked me in and he addressed me by name every time he saw me. Andreja was another helpful staff member at the front desk. They made me feel welcome and special. This hotel has a great bar (the Library Bar) which looks like a comfortable old library in an English manor house. The bar staff was attentive and nice. It was great to come back to the hotel after a full day of sightseeing and just relax in the bar.The only minor drawback was a little bit of noise one night (the doors are not soundproofed), but otherwise, it exceeded all my expectation. I highly recommend this hotel.	
Nov 25 2008 	A Good Hotel	The hotel is situated at the NorthWest corner of Hide Park.Rather quiet place. If u book a room at the front side, u 'll have a Park view...just good.It is exactly besides Queensway station of Underground (Tube).So it takes 15 min. totaly (changing the necessary train lines) to the central places. e.g. BigBen , or Picadilly Sqr , or National Museum...The entrance-reception Area of the Hotel is small , however it is more comfortable at the Lobby &amp; Breakfast area.Breakfast buffet is really a BIG advantage of this Hotel.About the rooms, the most of them are rather small , without minibar. They offer u a bottle of water and the choise to make sth to drink using the evaporator of your room.The hotel is clean , as rooms , too.The staff &amp; the servise general is very kindly &amp; helpfull ! We'd stay again in the future.	
Nov 13 2008 	great vacation stay	well this place was all it said they were doing some remodeling but the room was very nice and clean and room service was great every evening when arrived back at room the bed was made and clean towels and they made sure when you got back to your room it was like you just checked into it great job. The room service was a bit high i suggest breakfast walk out the hotel go to your left and a block and a half good breakfast good price. Now as far as all other service at hotel hard to beat everyone there was ready to help with any question you had about the area or attractions they looked up times for us at differnet places to go do things and they told us what trains to catch witch was very helpfull due to this hotel is like a 2 mins walk to the underground tub station and right by bus station if you go to london make sure to check out and get the london pass and one pass travel card this will be very helpfull and worth the money in the long run but this hotel was close to very nice park, and alot of resturants, and shops. If you go to london you wont be disapointed at this hotel i read other reviews before i went some good aqnd some bad and to be honest i didnt see anything bad here and had a great stay and vacation there and i am planning on going back next year and will stay at this hotel again.  Thank You,  Hilton Hyde Park &amp; hotels.com	
Nov 11 2008 	Dirty Small and basic things do not work (heating)	This Hotel has a brand that is supost to be the a leading brand in the world.Heating not working, the desk in the room could not be use even me i am 5 feet 10 not that high, due to room so small.The ruber rug to put in the shower for non sliping, has mildew all over the back and is so old this rug at least a couple years.I ask for a room change due to not heat working and they said that they could not, So I ask to speak to the manager in 5 minutes I was changed to another room. this other room againg filty and again no heating working, The hotel does not deserve to be in a Hilton Chain and worse charge 200 £ a night. I would never recomend this hotel	
Oct 25 2008 	Nice Hotel	I liked this hotel. Was booked at the last minute so wouldn;t normally have choosen this Hilton but we were glad we did.When we arrived the hotel had scaffolfing up as they were having work done, but to be honest this didnt disrupt us.This hotel is within easy walking distance to the subway so getting about London is easy.Rooms were small, it was a single room but for one person it was enough space. It was very warm in London when we were there so the air con was fab.Staff were ok, noone really sticks out for giving great service to us though.	
Oct 12 2008 	Should not be a Hilton hotel	This hotel should not be a Hilton hotel. The rooms are very small (even for London standards) and very hot. When I arrived in my room all lights were out, the TV was on and the heating was put to the highest temperature. The windows cannot be opened. At 2AM in the night the fire alarm went off. It was totally unclear for me and some other guests what to do and what was happening. The next day I heard that it was a technical error. The staff is not very friendly and hard to understand because of their (East European?) accent. I really don't advice you to stay here, there are better places in London to stay for the same price (it is not a very cheap hotel)	
Oct 10 2008 	Loved the Hilton Hyde Park and recommend it	We booked and paid for the hotel on the website months before our trip. Our stay included a special rate with breakfast and dinner included on the first night. We arrived around 8am on a Saturday morning from a 22 hour flight from Sydney, Australia and were greeted by a beautiful smiling friendly face. As it was so early we had expected that our room would not be ready and on checking in asked where we could freshen up, and to our surprise were told our room was ready for us. The staff both at reception and in the restaurant were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.The room was a double room and was very comfortable and clean and fully functional for our 2 night stay. The bathroom had a full size bath tub with shower and a large vanity unit.The double glazed windows keep out any noise and you wouldn't know you are on a main road. The view to Hyde Park is a bonus.We would definately stay there again, even for more than 2 nights. Highly recommend this hotel for comfort, affordability and convenient proximity to all forms of transport.	
Oct 8 2008 	Good Hotel Great Location	This is a good hotel. The rooms wont be the same size ANYWHERE in europe, as they are in North America, so dont even expect it. I had a double room, which was small, but I wasnt spending much time in the room anyways. For around 100 pounds, which is the MINIMUM you will spend in London, you arent going to find a better deal on a centrally located London hotel. Directly next to Queensway station on the Central line, or a 5 minute walk from Bayswater on District, its very easy to get around London quickly. Queensway St also has a ton of chinese, persian, lebanese, indian restaurants as well as your typical fast food, and convenience stores all open very late.	
Sep 29 2008 	Great Location but not a typical Hilton experience	We stayed here for 3 nights. The location is great !Bayswater and Queensway Tube stations literally around the corner. Notting Hill Tube station is one stop away. Main street around the corner has tons of restaurants, pubs, a Starbucks and souvenir shops. I felt safe walking around at night. Across the street is Kensington Park and the Princess Diana Memorial kids playground is right inside the park. The park is beautiful to walk around or just sit on a bench and write in your journal. The hotel itself was more of a &quot;boutique&quot; style hotel. The rooms were small and bathrooms small (typical of European hotels). The stay was nice and I would stay there again, it just wasn't as nice as some of the Hilton hotels in the US.	
Sep 24 2008 	Good Hotel for London	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while visiting London. As far as London hotels go, and we've stayed at plenty, it was above average, but I feel it was not up to the standards of a &quot;Hilton&quot; hotel. The location is the best thing about this hotel, located right across from Hyde Park and close to two tube stations so it's super easy to get anywhere in London from here. There was a mix up with our check in, we had reserved a double room, but were told there were none available, so we were put into a room with two twin beds. It was extremely small and smelled simply awful, very moldy and stuffy. Even opening the window did no good. Fortunately, after reviewing our reservation the next morning, we were put into a larger double room that had room to move around in and didn't smell. We had no problems with this room, it was clean (I was very happy with the daily cleaning service too) and well ventilated. The staff of the hotel was friendly and helpful, but one of the receptionists did not speak good English and she was difficult to understand. I found that odd, thought that a Hilton hotel would for sure have an excellent English speaker at the front desk. Breakfast is good, includes everything you would possibly want for breakfast, but some of the foods were not very tasty, so it was not of a high quality. Overall, however, we were satisfied with the hotel and will probably stay there again when we visit London in the future.	
Sep 24 2008 	Pleasently surprised!	My mum booked this hotel recently for our three day trip to London Which was a slightly early birthday treat. I have to admit from reading the previous reviews before I went I was a bit aprehensive, but I really don't know why people are rating it so bad....and I can be quite fussy. The room was adequate enough (stayed on 5th floor)- nice decor, good lighting, bath/shower, ample storage space for belongings, comfy beds, iron/ironing board, safe, tv, hairdryer, complementary refreshments, toiletries, daily papers. They were cleaned to a high standard and there was ample enough space to move around our twin bedroom aswell. The staff were friendly and helpful and the meals which we had included as a special price deal were really good. It certainly worked out cheaper than eating out all the time.Breakfast consisted of a huge choice..full english cooked breakie, toast and pastries/cakes, fruit salad, cereals, tea, coffee, juice. Dinner you had a choice off a menu (starter/main course/desert all fullfilling/nicely displayed) and there was enough options for vegetarians and other dietary requirements. My only two gripes were that the room did get very stuffy and quite hot at nights and we was unable to change the air conditioning control..but having the window open slightly helps as does bringing along some vics vapor rub,lol. The noise out the front tends to quiten down considerably around 2am even at wkends. Also even though there was a shower curtain the bathroom floor still got slightly flooded so it's advisable to put a towel down (a few supplied already) . The hotel in itself is good value and is especially close by to a couple of tube stations, lovely parks, shops, restaurants all of which is very handy. Sure in a few places it could do with a lick of paint or the carpeting washed but nothing was that bad. After all one doesn't come to London to be holed up in their hotel all the time do they?	
Sep 19 2008 	Average Hotel at best	Pretty good location with 2 Tube stops really close. That was about the only good thing. It's a bit pricey for the quality even in London. Bathroom and toilet is way too small. Way below standards for a Hilton.	
Aug 28 2008	I really like this hotel but you have to work a bit...	I've stayed at this property twice. Neither was a perfect stay, but overall this is my favorite midpriced hotel in London. Best feature is location: Hotel is located adjacent to two Tube stops which give you quick access to a large portion of the city. Across the street from Hyde Park, and on Queensway, a busy street with many affordable ethnic restaurants. Try the Kebap House about a block and a half north of the hotel.The rooms are mostly recently painted and remodeled... I would recommend against booking the cheapest rooms. They are quite small. Others can be spacious, and still relatively affordable. I also like trying to get rooms on the back of the hotel. I found the rooms to be well insulated from exterior sounds... even when your window is above Bayswater, a busy road. I had an air conditioning issue... and have heard of others. The staff were appropriately apologetic and took action quickly to solve the problem. Made for a long night, but they made it up to me the next day with a room upgrade.Showers/plumbing are workable, nothing fancy, and fairly small.Breakfast buffet is &quot;eh&quot;... I prefer the place next door, which is also cheaper.Overall, the tremendous positive of the location, plus caring staff, make this one a keeper for my travels. I've had a tough time with London hotels in this price range...	
Aug 27 2008 	Not up to Hilton standards but convienent.	Hitchcock used this hotel in the filming of Frenzy, and it this was a favorite place for the famous in the 60's and 70's---so says the brochure and tourbooks. Too bad the hotel hasn't been kept up to date.My first problem was my own. The hotel website says to use the Queensway tube station, turn right, go to the corner, turn right, hotel 3 minutes walk. Well, I made the rights and walked for three minutes. Then walked back. The hotel is just around the corner. The entrance is small, just beyond and ice cream shop. And if I had gotten of at the Bayswater stop on the Central line, came up to ground level and turned right, in about thirty feet I'd have been there. The check in person said yes that is a problem.The staff was friendly, and I liked the location, across from the northwest corner of Hyde Park, near Kensington Palace and Notting Hill. The room was quiet, but beyond that I should have saved my HHonors points and reserved a dorm room at a local university for a cheap price. The bath was dated and the tilework needed to be redone. I've been in much cheaper digs with better bathrooms. The room was tiny. I had about a foot and a half around the bed before hitting a wall or furniture. The air didn't work well, and the windows were hard to open, and let in the noise. I went into and checked out the Ramada up the street. It would have been a better choice.The saving grace was Queensway street. Full of a variety of ppeople, and ethnic restaurants. I especially liked the Thai place called something like Tam on the east side of the street.Next time I'll stay in he same area as it is great for transport and walking the park, but I'll try to get a dorm room at a local college instead. It will have more room, and the bath, while shared might be more modern, at a lower cost.	
Aug 3 2008	A horrible hotel.	This hotel is a joke. I was given a room in which in order to get to the window I had to jump over the bed. The desk was blocked by the bed. It was an absolutely horrible experience. The people at the front desk could not have cared less. I was offered a bottle of wine by three different people and the bottle never made it to my room. The safe deposit box in the room didn't work, and nobody could figure out how to fix it. DON'T STAY AT THIS DUMP!	
Jul 26 2008 	Nice hotel good location good service	This hotel was ideal for a sight seeing vacation in London. It sits on the Bayswater tube station (Red line) and the Yellow/Green line station is a short walk. The street of Bayswater is a bit of a tourist street but did not feel unsafe. The service at the hotel was very good - we had trouble one night with a bad A/C in the room but was moved to another room the following night for the rest of our stay without a problem. We had breakfast included and the meal was good each morning. The hotel is not really in the downtown shopping or theater area but is a short tube ride away to either location. The hotel was a fairly good price performance but still a little expensive - (most places are in Londan). I would stay here again - I would recommend the hotel as a median priced hotel.	
Jun 30 2008 	Great location Accomodating staff	Great location for getting around London on the tube. Queensway tube station on the Cental line just steps from the front door. Receptionist was very helpful in a complicated arrangement of four rooms some of which were paid for with breakfasts included and one dinner others were Hilton Honors rewards with breakfast for some of the days etc.. She took the time to get it right when we checked in.Good breakfast buffet statisfied hungry teenager as well as parents. Really good orange juice.Rooms are varied. room 223 too small with a set of steps inside the door and no place for more than one carryone on the floor. Room 410 very nice. Double paned windows on Bayswater cut the sound nicely. Rooms overlooking Queensway had some traffic noise.Hyde Park entrance directly across the street. A nice attraction for walking in open space in a crowded city. Would go back again, just be smarter about which rooms are given to you.	
Mar 4 2008 	Good Hotel - Great Location	We were very happy with our stay at this hotel. Our room was at the back of the hotel on the fifth floor , very comfortable and clean.Our room was very quiet . Unless you particularly want a view over the park I would recommend you ask for a room at the back as you get hardly any traffic noise !We found the staff to be very attentive and friendly. The breakfast service was not the best but we found the food and variety of choice to be of excellent quality.Our room rate included breakfast and at £120 per night for a double room in central London was an excellent deal.Location is fine with two underground stations within 5 minutes walk enabling swift travel throughout the capital. Kensington gardens immediately opposite for a nice quiet stroll. We walked into Oxford Street but that is a good 20 minutes brisk walk .Quite a lot of restaurants in the immediate vicinity and a Tesco Metro (open long hours).All in all a very good experience.	
Feb 26 2008 	Great Position	My sister and I stayed here for four nights 16th to 20th Feb.I was a little worried by some of the previous reviews but was pleasantly surprised. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The only gripe would be the water pressure in the shower.The position of the hotel can't be beaten close to two tube stations and buses right out side. Beautiful Kensington Gardens directly opposite.Would definitely stay here again.	
Feb 15 2008 	great location good food  great hotel	my husband and stayed 2 nights in this hotel, right outside queensway tube station very central! hotel was clean and pleasent, staff very friendly, bedroom was average size nice decor good size bathroom. bathrobes for use also nice touch !bar was nice and food was fab good choice on menu and lots of it ! breakfast again was plenty and good!over all was a nice stay, everyone friendly , good location would defo stay again !!!!!	
Jan 9 2008 	Never never accept Room 224!	What should you expect of a 4 star hotel in London when you are paying a very low price through a last minute (don't know hotel until booked) deal? Well, you certainly don't expect the executive suite but you don't expect a grim room either- there should be no grim rooms in a 4-star hotel. However, grim room is what we got.Beware Room 224 - never, never accept it! I asked for only one thing from my budget-price room - as quiet as possible. The deputy manager gave me such a spiel - no view (definitely right - rubbish on fire escape - view so bad they covered the windows with non-see through film!) but , he said, very quiet - indeed he slept in that part of the hotel when he needed to stay overnight.Is this man deaf? We were (I think) over the lift shaft of Queensway tube station. So, from 5.45 am until after midnight you could have assumed that the TWO lifts were in the room with you, so loud was the noise and so constant. I asked to change rooms but was punished by being offered a poky room which you could barely move around. I got the message - and as we were there for 4 days I took the noise and bought earplugs - which I needed all the time when we did not have the TV on to drown the noise.Plus points? Well, the room was relatively large, there was a flat screen TV and the chambermaid kept it as clean as she could. HOWEVER, it was scruffy (chair just about to get a hole in the upholstery, bath grimy around plug, grout coming away around the bath, cracked tiles on bathroom floor) and the flat screen TV showed only Channels 1-5 and Sky News.I paid only £69 per night for the room, which is cheap by London standards but cheap was definitely what I got. I got the impression that the cheaper the deal, the nastier the room you get, even if there are better rooms available as the hotel was far from full.And with breakfast costing £20 each (no, we didn't take it) and drinks in the bar at £5 each there is a definite feeling of rip-off even at that low price. No, I shall not be going there again.	
Jan 4 2008	Better than the reviews	Having read some of the reviews on TripAdvisor before going we were prepared for the worst: small rooms, dirty rooms, indifferent staff, mildew, lack of hot water etc. In fact we found none of these things and had a very pleasant night there in a smart, clean, warm, good size room which would have had good views over Kensington Gardens if it hadn't been too dark to see. We had booked it via lastminute.com so we didn't expect to get premium treatment, which only added to the pleasant surprise. We would definitely stay there again.John Jacobs	
Dec 13 2007	Mediocre hotel with small rooms and mildewed shower	This was not value for money. Overall quality was poor: ignorant receptionist; room service trays lying about all day; grubby literature; decor exceptionally ordinary. All the signs of a slack establishment. The room we were offered was very small: it was impossible to walk round the bed easily; the bath was badly chipped. There was only one chair for two people. The second room we were offered was slightly bigger: it had two chairs but only a shower, no bath. The shower was filthy with mildew. Although promised in the voucher there was no minibar and no PlayStation. Not worth what we paid.	
Dec 12 2007 	Quality and Comfort dont live up to expectations of a pricey kensington	The hotel is in a fine part of London over looking Hyde Park, and is a hotel which pronounces charm, sophistication and prominence over other hotels located in the same road. On entering there are two welcoming reception desks, not counters, offering a chance to check in as a person not as a number? Beyond reception is a small bar and small restaurant, so on initial views this is a hotel to stay over night, but not to spend a day relaxing as there are very few public spaces in which to enjoy the limited amenities.The room is typical of many Hiltons with the standard smart decor, and the beds extremely comfortable. The room was spacious and had all the amenities you would require, including large TV, coffee, hair dryers, complimentary water, etc. Again the bathroom was spacious, well presented, although extremely disappointing was the paint failing off the ceiling which looked terrible. The bar area is small but with a range of comfortable sofas and chairs. The bar staff however where less than polite, rushing us in our selection of drinks as if it was some take away food outlet. I felt perhaps he felt we where not of a high enough society level to be in his bar almost implying that we had walked off the streets, despite spending over five hundred pounds for a two night stay. The restaurant is again small, however the quality of staff was exceptional, and achieved the highest standards of service I have yet encountered in any Hilton hotel. The food was average, with the ceaser salad being basic with a dressing akin of a cheap supermarket brand and the majority of the cheese board made up of those packaged cheeses such as babybel. Breakfast was superb, with a good choice of food. However unlike other Hilton hotels, no food was freshly cooked, and on asking for fresh fried eggs, the waitress emerged ten seconds later with a plate of 15 fried eggs prepared some time earlier and equally dried up. That said, it was a good choice on the buffer selection and no real complaints.Overall this is an ok hotel hence my mark, but only as a hotel to stay in overnight. I will end with my main complaint, although this was probably a one off, and is down to room availability only. I had specifically paid full rate for a deluxe room on the premise that **Most rooms have a view over Kensington Gardens**. On top of this being a valued Hilton honors member, I expected a room with views, where as instead I had a room out the back. One window over looked the fire escape and another window directly overlooking other peoples hotel bedroom windows. As I was attending a mind challenging course, the choice of hotel was extremely important to me, and therefore the prospect of views over Kensington gardens was for me the balance of a city hotel with country views. I was therefore extremely disappointed.	
Nov 26 2007 	Dissapointing	My Wife and I booked this stay over 3 months ago and were looking forward to this trip as it was also our honeymoon. On arrival at 215pm, we were informed that our room wasn`t ready and to come back at 3pm. The room was clean if a little compact, a nice LCD TV was in the room however the picture it recieved was pretty poor. There was the usual tea, coffee, water etc but no mini bar. There was a free safe though which was handy. The staff were helpfull enough, up untill the point I asked why the room was so hot and asked how the AC worked only to be told &quot;its winter sir and isntt turned on&quot;!! I ordered 2 papers which took 10mins todo at reception and in the morning they had not arrived, when asked where they were I was told the Hotel didnot get the ones I asked for!!!! Another 10mins taking off the non arrived papers from our bill. The staff were helpfull with travel advice, ie directions for Harrods to walk rather than 3 changes on the tube. Breakfast on the 1st morning was very busy and not up to much, the toast machine was very slow to say the least. 2nd Morning- We were awoke by knocking on the door by a maid asking if she could clean the room......910am!!!! NOT HAPPY. Breakfast again ruined by faulty toast machine also both the tea and coffee was vile everyday. The 2nd morning we were unable to have either a bath or a shower as there was NO hot water!!!On the last night we had dinner as part of the booking package and in all honesty it wasn`t of the standard I could eat. we both ordered steaks and both were greasy and inedible, we sent both back and told the hotel we didnt want anymore food. To their credit the hotel took off money off our bill for this non-meal.On the whole I found this hotel to charge top dollar for a 2nd rate service, the staff were ok and the hotel clean. Location was great...would I return? probably not...........	
Nov 21 2007	I would go Back	Really enjoyed my stay at the Hyde Park Hilton in London. Booked using londontown.com and received a free dinner with booking, both the food and the service were very good. Free english breakfast is included (bacon, eggs, pancakes etc.). Our room was nice and clean, and had a big bathroom with a bath tub, which my wife was happy about. A lot of the other hotels we have stayed at in Europe only had stand up showers.	
Nov 6 2007 	Will stay again....	We stayed at the Hilton London Hyde Park Hotel for two nights whislt we visited Gordon Ramsey's restaurant at Claridges. The hotel is next door to Queensway tube, but you wouldn't have known. As part of our package we were entitled to a free meal on the first night of our stay plus breakfast each morning. On arrival, check in was a little slow due to a queue of arrivals but the reception staff were very apologetic and checked us in quickly when it was our turn. They immediately booked us into the restaurant at the time we requested. On arrival into the room, it was small and faced the rear of the property, which faced another building, not the greatest of views! However, the room was clean and superbly kitted out with an iron, ironing board, hairdrier, modem connetion. The bathroom had bathrobes and all the normal free shampoo's etc.On arrival in the restaurant, we were greeted immediately, seated and advised of the menu available. The food was great, including the vegetarian option for my wife.The following morning, we went down for breakfast and had to wait for a table. The restaurant was very business as you would expect at breakfast time. The breakfast selection was superb from full english to continental and more.The only downside to our whole stay was the room was a little warm and no matter how we adjusted the air con, it never got cooler. We didn't complain as it was unbearable.	
Nov 3 2007	central and quiet	Hilton Hyde Parks staff are not as attentative i thought on the other reviews. I had a meeting in london invited my wife with me for the weekend and requested an early check in, the reception staff let my wife sit in the reception and ask her to wait for the room for almost 3 hours. this is bad service and then in the end gave us a less good room than expected! Apart from the bad start, the breakfast buffet was nice and the approxmity to everything was good!	
Nov 2 2007 	Not quite 4 star	I was so excited to be staying in the hilton hyde park, but my excitement didnt last long, there is no parking available so we were advised by the reception to park nearby in a car park costing £22 FOR THE NIGHT. The paintwork along the skirting boards could do with a coat of paint, and the room was very cold when we arrived we put the heating on full. I was looking forward to a lie in as it was my birthday but we had a cleaner knock then enter our room at 7.30am!!! which woke us up, then as we were just getting to sleep another cleaner came an hour later so this was very irritating. Overall, it was okay we got a last minute sort of deal but i wouldn't hurry back.	
Oct 8 2007 	Great location and lovely staff!	Hi stayed at the Hilton Hyde park for 1 night last weekend as we were in London to see Grease as a treat for my daughters 18th. We booked 2 double rooms on a good deal. One overlooked the park and the other overlooked the street at Queensway. Both rooms were equally clean and comfortable. They were not enormous but all you would expect from a london hotel. You could not beat the location right next door to Queensway tube you literally turned the corner and you were there. Also a couple of mins walk from Baywater tube making it easy to visit various locations in the city. The shops, bars and restaurants in Queensway were wonderful. There was such a varied selection of restaurants it was hard to choose which one we wanted to visit! The best thing about the Hilton was the staff. They were so friendly. When Rukhsana on reception found out it was my daughters 18th she went out of her way to wish her happy birthday and later when we were sat in the bar she and some of her staff crept up on us with delicious chocolate cake and free champagne to celebrate! What a lovely touch. I would certainly recommend the Hilton Hyde Park to others, it may not have been all marble and luxury but it was warm and welcoming and thats worth a whole lot more in my book.	
Aug 22 2007 	Friendly Staff but somewhat clueless Clean Quiet Hotel Great Location	This was my second stay at the Hilton Hyde Park. Although I'm going back for another stay there were some issues. When I arrived at 11PM on a Saturday night desperately needing some antihistamines the consierge told me I'd have to wait until Monday as nothing was open. As I wandered down Queensway I found 4 places that sell meds still open and a Boots open until midnight every day but Sunday. Obviously he hadn't done his homework.Room service was slow, and when I needed ice for a black eye (don't ask, wasn't a pub fight!) they were a bit confused by the request. I needed to extend my stay a week and called the hotel directly and spoke to Emma. After much humming and haaing and asking my name 5 times (no joke) she finally said I was confirmed for an extra week. When I arrive at the hotel that evening my extension was NOT in the system and Emma had gone home. The desk staff helped me get my stay extended.The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable but get a double since the singles are tiny. Bathrooms are small and if you get a room with just a shower expect to hit your elbows to the walls. I'm not a big woman and it was tight for me. It's a great location, tons of restaurants and pubs on Queensway right around the corner from the hotel: Chinese, Japanese, Lebanese, Indian, Greek and Italian. Portabello Market is 4 blocks away and the view of Kennsington Gardens and Hyde Park can't be beat.When booking be careful because they quote some prices with VAT and others without on the Hilton web site. Makes comparisons difficult.	
Jun 28 2007 	Fantastic Location!	Very convenient for any traveler wanting to get around via the tube (instead of taxis)! Close to Paddington (1-2 tube stops), and across from one of Hyde Park's gates.Right around the corner from Queensway (on the Central Line) - literally about 30 steps from the exit! Bayswater is only about 1.2 blocks away - not too far, but might be tough with luggage. If going into LHR, take the Heathrow Express to Paddington station (if you are leaving out of LHR, buy a return ticket to save you time on your return to the station at the end of your trip), then follow the signs to the Underground. If you are going to use the tube for more than one journey in downtown London, buy a day pass for zones 1-2 (it is 5.2 as opposed ot paying 4 pounds for only one segment of the journey).Rooms were clean, beautiful and spacious (compared to many other London rooms at comparable prices I've stayed over the past 6+ trips there) and the beds were firm with wonderful comforters, pillows, tea/coffee in room, complimentary bottled water, Locking safe in closet, etc. Lovely.If you are bringing a wireless laptop, the Ground floor gets very busy, but the 1st floor has seats, desks, and wireless access easy (and free). I would advise taking the stairs or elevator to the first floor (it was impossible to access wireless from my 3rd &amp; 4th floor rooms during my 2 stays there during this trip).A little way past the Bayswater Underground station is a wonderful Italian restaraunt (Ristorante Italiano). Both pasta dishes and the appetiser we had were amazing (and the garlic bread was delightful). Don't bother with one of the Bella's! We tried this as well (it was the only thing open after the theatre at 11pm, and it wasn't worth it). There are many other eateries in that same area (very local area), including an Indian restaraunt, Moroccan, Greek, Pizza Hut, Deli, and more (including a local grocery store).We walked Hyde park at different times of the day (6am one morning, 9pm one night, etc.) for about 3-4 miles (all on different paths), and it is amazing. Worth it to see all the locals picnicing, walking dogs, exercising, lush gardens, horseback riders, feeding swans/geese/ducks, going to work, etc. I highly advise crossing the street from the hotel, and exploring the park (which is very friendly and seemingly clean).Enjoy your stay. I was there for business, and still enjoyed my visit much more due to the hotel's location and atmosphere.	
Jun 28 2007 	A fantastic hotel in a great location!	We stayed at this hotel during the fall of 2006. The location was fabulous! I was able to walk to many places, took a taxi easily to shopping locations, and there was a double-decker tour bus stop just across at Hyde Park. The hotel staff and concierge were so helpful and friendly. The room was a bit on the small side; there were only 2 of us and it did feel tight. However, I went to London to see London and not stay in my hotel room, so it wasn't that big of a problem. I would absolutely stay here again! Great for couples and families with teenagers. I don't know if I would bring my 4 boys to stay here - it was definitely an upscale business crowd!	
Jun 23 2007 	Friendly and Incompetent	Having stayed at a number of Hilton hotels in London, I tried the Hyde Park location. The area is ok - but restaurants and bars are a bit lacking - jump down to kensington instead. Tube is right near by - which is good. Rooms are fairly standard - but the Hilton Trafalgar, Paddington, and Heathrow are all a step above Hyde Park. The service is very friendly, but basically incompetent. Concierge appears to be useless - and almost asks for tips at every point. Room service was a joke - 20 minute service turned into est. 1 hr, then never showed and I ended up cancelling.Likely won't stay here again!	
Jun 23 2007	Had a great 3 generation stay	My husband and I (mid60s/70), daughter and niece (mid20's) and grandaughter (4) stayed for 4 nights in August 2006. We had a double room opposite the park, and the girls had a double + bedsettee on the corner of the building. We were very pleased with our stay despite doing lots of research on alternatives (the girls have tight budgets) we are about to book again for this year. It was excellent. The staff were very obliging. The location was great - tubes and buses (got Oyster opasses each) took us everywhere easily, and the park was great for Diana playground etc., and the girls went running and swimming in the park before breakfast. More than happy to go back again. I don't think £25 is a lot for a dinner - its the usual hotel rate, and we would spend that if we went to our local pub and had 3 courses. There are loads of eating places in Queensway if you want to eat elsewhere.	
May 11 2007 	Hotel is great for Tube Location	This Hotel, while certainly not a luxury hotel, is clean, efficient and the staff is courteous. My mother (age 75) and I (33) stayed for 6 days. Breakfast Buffet: We are diamond members, so as many other trip advisor members have noted, the breakfast was free. The selection of items on the buffet was impressive. I particularly recommend fresh French bread with Black Currant Jam (found on your table). It isn't something we find here in the states often. Also included, Fried Eggs, Scrambled Eggs, Mushrooms, Sausage with Leeks, Bacon, a selection of canned fruits in bowls, Cheese slices, Cold Deli Meats, Assortment of Breads you can slice off yourself and white bread for toast, Waffles (I don't recommend...they are crunchy), Cereals, Pastries and of course Tea, Coffee, and Orange Juice (Plus other juices located at the bar. We had tea, and can recommend it. They give you a little pot at your table so you can refill it yourself (a nice touch on a busy morning).Check-in: Flawless experience. Upgraded to a deluxe room. They were fine with redeeming reward points and we didn't have to pay any taxes on the room or anything. Entire stay was indeed Free.Room: Deluxe room on 4th floor away from Elevator. We had 2 twin beds that were really comfey and a desk, chair, TV on a stand (under which was the tea service) and a nice size bathroom for English standards. We were very satisfied with the room. It was quiet, as it was tucked away from the street and we did not hear any other guests, even though the hotel was booked.Local Area: Hotel is located next to Tube Stop &quot;Queensway&quot; on the central line. It is a short walk down the street to the &quot;Bayswater&quot; stop on the circle line (which gets you to Every main attraction). It was easy to use the tube and the doormen always give lovely directions. Directly across from the Hotel is Hyde Park. I found it safe all times of the day and night (up to 9 PM). It is an easy walk to Kensington Palace and the round lake. Also, it was a 10 min walk to Portabello Road. Local Restaurants: Try the Waffles along the street adjoining the hotel. I particularly liked the Toffee Waffle...so delicious. Also, the Fish &amp; Chips at the Queens Arms pub was quite good. And, there is a little italian restaurant close to the Bayswater tube stop (NOT Bella) that is to die for...the lasagna was amazing.Taxi's: A trip to/from Heathrow should cost no more that 40 pounds. Always ask the price to the taxi Every time a driver picks you up...even if the hotel tells you the price, ask the driver. We found the hotel gave us lower numbers that the drives and we could negotiate the hotel rates...so ASK. And Never get in a Mercedes cab...they are considered luxury vehicles and they charge way to much. ATM: There is an ATM on the side street adjoining the hotel approx 1 block away. Never had any difficulty getting monies and always felt safe. Enjoy your stay if you decide to go with this hotel. It isn't fancy, but it is comfortable and located well for using the Tube.	
May 2 2007 	One night in London	Recently stayed at the Hyde Park Hilton for the first time in 2 years. The check in was very efficient and as a HHonors member I was upgraded to a Deluxe Room and offered complimentary full English breakfast.The rooms were smaller than I remembered but OK for an overnight stay. The bathroom was of a reasonable size but overall the room would benefit from being redecorated.Had a nightcap at the bar downstairs  surprisingly cheap for a central London hotel. However, Ill be glad when such areas are smoke free.Breakfast is served either in the restaurant or in the area near the bar and is very good  the selection is great and apart from a problem with the non-appearance of our coffee the service was fantastic.Overall this is a very good property but it is a £10-£15 cab ride from the West End  Id use the tube if you want to get around from Hyde Park.	
Apr 28 2007 	Hated it	This is not a 4/5 star Hilton property, although it is advertised as such. More than a few problems during my stay - Internet did not work in the first 2 rooms I was put in (death to the business traveller), no water pressure, paper-thin walls, and constant construction. The staff was very nice, and pretty much said that their hands were tied - I get the feeling that Hilton corporate is not putting any money into this hotel. Ideally, it should be refurbished and revamped to justify it's price point. In fact, I wouldn't have had a problem if they branded this hotel as a Hilton Garden Inn - that's what it's equivalent to.	
Apr 24 2007 	I liked it	It is no news how hard it is to find a decent hotel in London without paying a small fortune. When I got a good deal for this hotel I booked it straight away. After booking I checked at tripadvisor and got a bit worried. Doing my best to charm the woman in the reception I ended up with a &quot;deluxe&quot; room on the fifth floor facing Hyde Park. I really liked my room even though it was quite small (London...). Bed was great, two different types of pillows, a/c worked fine. One detail I really appreciated was the possibility to plug-in your i-pod to the little alarm-clock next to the bed. To avoid the sound of music you don't like from the TV. Breakfeast was very nice, fresh and good selection. Small sitting area though. Only downside is that there is only one lift, but that's all. Personally I could live with it...	
Apr 3 2007 	Good value for London	Central location, old refurbished hotel. Very good value 2 nights B&amp;B with one dinner included. On arrival we were given a room at th back of the hotel which had the windows covered over and wired, it was impossible to see out! We returned to reception and complained and were immediately offered a complimentary upgrade. This room though not large looked out over the park, was clean and quite adequate for a 2 night stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, dinner was OK but lacking any ambiance. Breakfast was plentiful with lots of variety but on one morning there were no tables available and we had to eat sitting in the lounge at a coffee table - not ideal	
Mar 12 2007	Nice Staff - Central location	My husband and I went for my 30th Birthday - the hotel knew this and sent us a bottle of champagne to celebrate, which was very much appreciated. The staff were very helpful and always around when we had a question. The rooms where nice and clean, bathroom bit small but clean. The girl that cleaned the room every day was very good and we recieved a daily paper delived to the door each morning, with out charge. The breakfast was brill everything from fresh fruit to a fry. We really enjoyed our trip and the hotel staff helped alot. Thanks - would go back again and bring the family!!!! If you stay at this hotel the Tube Station is at the corner of the hotel as well as the bus stop - Number 94 takes you to Oxford street and Regent Street and the Number 148 takes you to Victoria Station, excellent routes.	
Mar 7 2007	Not Good But Not Bad Either	We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in November. I've certainly stayed in much nicer hotels, but given the price and the location, I'd say it was decent. Though the tube station next door was closed for renovations 2 of the four days we were there, there is another station two blocks away. As a result, traveling around the city is fairly easy. (And you can't beat its proximity to Kensington Palace...just a 5 minute walk through the park.) They put us in a upgraded room, but it was still pretty small (even by European standards). The only major issue I had was that they mistakenly scheduled our wake up time for 6:00 a.m. instead of 5:00 a.m., so we weren't woken up until the cab arrived at 5:45 a.m. to take us to Victoria Station to catch the Gatwick Express. Everything turned out alright in the end, but that was a fairly stressful way to end our trip to London. In the end, I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you're looking to spend a lot of time in your room -- but who goes to London to spend time in their room?	
Feb 28 2007 	Good Choice if You Don't Need Extravagance	I stayed here in February for a two night business trip. The biggest plus was the room was very clean - a problem I've had at other London hotels - including the private bath. The staff was also quite friendly and responded to all requests with a smile. And you can't beat the location. Very short trip to/from Paddington, and accessible to/from the rest of the city, both business and tourist districts. There didn't seem to be much in the way of high quality restaurants around, although I didn't really look too hard for them. The buffet breakfast that was included with the room was nothing special, but again decent. Be aware that it offers a lot of carb-heavy dishes, although there was a reasonable selection of fresh fruit, yogurt and cereal. The only true negative was the room size. I had a single which was probably seven feet by ten feet, plus the bathroom and closet. It was enough to fit a desk, nightstand, bed and television set with just enough walking room in between. Again, I've had this same problem at other London hotels. If you're not claustrophobic or hold very high expectations, this is a good hotel choice.	
Feb 22 2007	Not bad!	Stayed for a weekend in mid febuary. Very handy location, queensway tube next door! The hotel is very clean and staff very friendly, the room we had was stated as a 'delux' room. It was very cosey to say the least, good standard of furnishing all round but everything on the small side, the bathroom was tiny. We also experianced a fair amount of traffic noise at night when trying to sleep, the hotel is situated on a very busy road and the traffic is constant untill 3am but even after then does not become that quiet. Take some earplugs if u are a light sleeper like me!We had dinner included in the price on our first night and i'm glad it was free because the £25 for 3courses is massivley overpriced for the quality of the food. They seem to try hard but its of a very average standard. The breakfast on the other hand is very good, loads of choice and eat as much as you want.We found the hilton hyde park a decent place to stay overall but maybe a little overpriced for the standard given.	
Feb 10 2007 	BAD experience again	This was my 6th. stay in the Hyde Park Hilton and the worst one ever.All rooms are different, some recently remodeled, some awful awful awful... not at all Hilton standard (not even the remodeled rooms). This time I had a Deluxe room and that was a joke! Noisy (elevator noise kept me awake all night), twin bed was uncomfortable, light from the corridor came through to the room, the windows were blocked (light beige semi-transparanet tape, so I couldn't see daylight!!!!!), A/C didn't work, breakfast was so-so...The front officer (French?) guy was nice, but all in all lots of staff whose English was BAD! I really hope next time I get a room in another hotel. My company has deals with several hotels and Hyde Park Hilton seems to be one of the few hotels that has vacant rooms when booked last minute.	
Jan 30 2007 	A fine stay	Stayed the w/e for my wife's 40th - we had a great time (except for Gatwick security going home on Sunday night - an absolute shambolic disgrace). Anyway, we chose this hotel for its location and it was spot on - 2 tube stations on the doorstep, Kensington Gardens just opposite, Queensway and the excellent Whiteleys shopping centre just a few minutes away. All we needed was a decent room with a good breakfast - we weren't disappointed. We'd stay here again. Yes, we get the point about it not exactly being a true Hilton, so what, unless you plan to live in your room the whole time. The staff were very helpful throughout and unless you're looking for luxury, I'd recommended this Hotel to friends	
Dec 31 2006 	A real nightmare	I have stayed at dozens of Hiltons across the world and this was the worst, with an overall quality very far below Hilton standards. Actually, I was surprised that this &quot;hotel&quot; is called a Hilton.Since I had to switch between some rooms on my first day (in an attempt to find an acceptable one), I can assure you that even the so-called Deluxe rooms were so tiny that you could barely walk around the bed. The walls were thin and the doors badly isolated with the light of the hall penetrating the rooms. The windows were bolted hermetically shut, the air conditioning was not working. Thus, the only chance I had to get some fresh air was to open a small window in the bathroom. The bedspread was clean but worn out, the curtains were dirty and mold was evident on the walls, the windows and the bathroom. There were 5 TV channels but no cable TV. Minibar was not available and the shaver outlet was not working. The built-in wardrobe was useless, due to a grave constructional defect.The quality of the breakfast was acceptable but the service in the restaurant awful. Apart from two bellmen and a young lady serving at the restaurant, who were friendly, attentive and efficient, the staff of this hotel were confused, disinterested, had in most cases no good command of English and were unprofessional.	
Dec 17 2006 	What a dump	What a terrible place to stay in. Its a circus not a hotel. We arrived at 2.45 to be told the room will not be ready for another hour and a half!!!! What a joke. Then we were told they could provide us a single room to get ready in so that we can get to a wedding in time. OK we felt like sardines in a can, it was ridiculous. When we eventually got back and got our room, we decided to order room service. The choice was pathetic - 5 sandwiches... So we ordered a sandwich which took 30 mins to arrive, only to be stale. The mini bar had left over food from previous guests, that was not cleared away by anyone. How disgusting! I feel the rooms are tiny, the service is aweful, and noone listens to anything you say. If you wish to throw money away, give it to the poor, but do not stay in that rat hole.	
Nov 23 2006 	location location location	My wife and I have stayed at this hotel many times and it is out favourite of many in London.The key factors are location and quality.It is located reasonably centrally but literally next door to an underground station with another on a different line only 5 minutes away. Hyde Park is across the road, with huge potential to escape from the madness of London. There are many varied restaurants very nearby as well as shops.The hotel itself seems small for a Hilton and is an old building. Some of the rooms are small and can be a bit stuffy in the full heat and fumes of London but generally are very acceptable by London standards.The staff are consistantly wonderful and so helpful.Breakfast is excellent, although not quite as good as when it was a Stakis hotel. Dinner leaves a lot to be desired and the dining room tends to be very quiet. We usually stay on a package that includes some dinners and these represent tremendous value for money, but otherwise we would not choose to dine there.	
Nov 23 2006 	Started bad ended ok	My experience with this hotel started out quite terribly, but I have to commend the staff and management for making an effort to improve the situation. The best thing about this hotel is it's location: Right on Hyde Park and practically on top of the queensway tube station. Most of the rooms are TINY. I know this because I switched between several rooms on my first day. All of them were so small you could barely walk around the bed. And bear in mind, these were the &quot;Deluxe&quot; rooms! (I was upgraded since I am a Hilton Hhonors Gold VIP member). The rooms contents are ok - the bed is comfortable, linen is nice, there is a desk, Tv, etc. Everything is Small but cleand and ok. Nothing like Hiltons in the US or elsewhere in the world - but ok for UK standards, which I've learned are... &quot;different&quot;. The main problem I had with this hotel was the maintenance - when I got there I was told the A/C does not work in 90% of the rooms &quot;due to maintenance&quot; issue. I was about to spend the entire week there and they did not think the A/C would be fixed during the week. (These kind of issues are something that I would expect the hotel to state on their website!!). The first room I checked into was so hot and stuffy I could barely breath in it. I asked for a fan, but there were none. The windows only opened a crack and didn't help much. The phone didn't work so I had to go down to the lobby with every question I had until the phone got fixed. Then, just as I was getting ready for a mjor business conference call I find out the internet does not work in this particular room (#410). I missed my conference call and was furious. I was switched to another room (#414) - also deluxe, same size (tiny), still no A/C (but wasn't nearly as hot for some reason), but at least the internet worked (for 15 GBP per day) and the phone did too. After some complaining, the manager called my room and offered 50% discount on my first night and promised to switch me to another room with A/C the next day. The management kept their promise and I was switched to nicer room the next day. This one was slightly bigger and nicer (Room #407) and - finally - all the electrical appliances were working (including A/C). The other main complaint about this hotel is the noise - the street noise is very loud - but I guess that comes with the location. In the end, the last room I had was defintiely ok, and I was pleased with the management responses to my complaints and how they handled the situation (though I was disappointed with the low quality of maintenance of the hotel). I did receive 50% discount on the room rate for all the sta, after all. Bottom line: kudos on the service, low marks on the hotel itself. I will not be staying there again.	
Oct 22 2006	Depends on the room they give you	I stayed at the Hyde Park Hilton for a business trip. This being my 2nd time in London in 1 month I knew what to expect from the hotels --small rooms, small lifts, etc. When we arrived at 12 am, they said they did not have non-smoking rooms as requested. The agent told me that he only had smoking rooms, so my colleague went up to the room to check it out to see if she could stand it. While she as upstairs, the agent started to get my info. He saw that I was a Hilton Honors member and then immediately said that he DID have non-smoking available. He checked us in right away.My assigned room was cute, I thought and comfortable. The shower had mold on it, which would be tough for me due to a mold allergy. My colleague on the other hand, wanted to switch rooms. She was in a lower level, with windows that were blacked out and she didn't feel safe. They moved her to a &quot;deluxe&quot; room on the corner overlooking the park. Meanwhile my first night was comfortable, however in the morning I noticed something strange. There were about a dozen bees at my window trying to get in! It was really creepy. Their windows are set up to have the old windows and then they inserted a newer set of windows in front. So it is old window, curtain, new window. Luckily I had shut my window the night before, otherwise the bees would have been in my room in the morning. Anyway, the bees were really creeping me out. (check out the pictures) I asked for another room because of the bees and the front desk agent showed no emotion when I told her there were bees, she just said, &quot;I don't know if we have another room&quot;, to check back when I come back from work that day. She didn't even acknowledge what I said, it was like she knew that there was a bee problem in that room. I came back from work and they had assigned me room 105, on a lower level. The room was smaller than my previous room, the window looked out to A/C units and a rooftop. I did not have cell phone service, which was critical to keep in touch with family in the U.S. and for business reasons. So, I asked them to move me again. This time I was smart like my colleague and asked them to move me to a room facing the street. They did and what a difference! The rooms facing the front are bigger and cleaner. The only reason that I gave this hotel a 3 rating is because the staff was very friendly (besides the bee incidence and her lack of empathy or acknoledgement). The concierge/bellman was so polite and went out of his way to help us every time. Also, they were willing to move me when I asked.	
Aug 7 2006 	Excellent one night stay and was up-graded	Booked a one-night stay thru hotels-- and was very pleased. They have a secure luggage room that only the concierage can open, so your bags are safe if your room isn't ready. We were upgraded for whatever reason to a deluxe room overlooking Hyde Park. The entire place seemed entirely refurbrished. (This is the old Coburg Hotel, used in the Alfred Hitchcock move &quot;Frenzy&quot;. The lobby wasn't altered a lot from when the movie was shot in 1972. If you ever stay here, you must see the video). One tube line next door (Queensway on the District Line) and one a half a block away (Bayswater on the Circle Line). If your breakfast is not included, there's a little bistro next door.	
Aug 2 2006 	Not Up To Standard for the price ....Hyde Park Hilton	Not Up To Standard for the price ....Hyde Park Hilton Date: June 3 rd 2006My wife and I wanted to stay in a Hotel in London that would have a good level of service and comfort, so we thought Hilton would meet the requirements . Well we were wrong ! When we arrived at the Hyde Park Hilton in May it was undergoing repainting and construction.... some thing that Hilton forgot to tell prospective guests. As we stepped our way through the mess we thought , Oh well the room will be alright ...wrong !The Hotel was under repair, the room was small,the air conditioning didn't work, the tube station next door was also being reconstructed so it could not be used and noises were heard through the night as they did their work, the internet connection did not work in all rooms. We know as we wer moved to three different rooms trying to find one that had everything working, What was worse was that Hilton management were difficult to find and were somewhat indifferent to the issues....Oh I see, complaining American's.Add this to $28 for per person breakfast, same thing at down town pub, $8 ! The extremely small room at the rear and was american low price &quot;motel&quot; standard (say $90 no more value) for nearly $300 a night and it spoiled our stay in LondonHilton was just full of excuses, and only when really pressured did anything to make things better.kevin lane	
Jul 27 2006 	Good hotel for a london trip	Stayed there in July. Good hotel - Tube next door - breakfast excellent. Would stay there again. For that price a good hotel. Ask for a renovated room.	
Jul 21 2006	Good location ok hotel	Recent stay at the London Hilton on Hyde Park. Right across from the park and around the corner from the tube and busses, so location was excellent. Breakfast was included with the room and was excellent. Staff was helpful and friendly. Rooms were ok, but nothing special. Otherwise I would give this hotel a top rating.	
Jul 14 2006	First time visitor to the UK	We were so impressed with the service, the helpful staff in every way. We could not say enough for our most pleasant stay. We will recommend this to our friends. The breakfast was super, and had a variety of foods. The location was just perfect. We enjoyed the park every evening during our stay. We used the subway system and found the hotel very convenient. Once again we had a wonderful visit and plan to return again. Thanks for providing a restful and informative vacation.	
Jul 2 2006	Perfect first visit to London	Needing to insure my husband had high speed internet access our travel agent booked the Hilton Hyde Park. Flying overnight from Boston we arrived at the hotel at 9:30am and were pleased to be told a room would be ready for us in 20 minutes. We were served tea and coffee in the library lounge and in 20 minutes our room was ready.It was a lovely room with a window overlooking the Black Lion gate to Kensington Park. The bed was cozy and the room spacious and nicely decorated.The staff was always helpful and friendly whether we were interacting with people at the front desk, the bar, or the restaurant. The high speed internet access worked everytime it was needed.The continental breakfast offers a good variety and was quite plentiful.We would stay at the Hilton Hyde Park again and recommend others do also.	
Jun 27 2006	hotel staff below par	We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights during June 06. My husband, son and I stayed in one room, and my parents stayed in another.When my parents checked in, the hotel gave them a very dark and dirty room (probably unrenovated) with no view under the excuse that their &quot;real room&quot; was not ready. My father took it because he was assured that he would be relocated to his real room once it was ready. But when he went to the front desk to inquire, was told that his real room was now taken by someone else (within a matter of a couple of hours!). My father, being a life long Hilton customer, wrote an angry complaint to the hotel (via some &quot;comment box&quot;) and the next day, was give a better room. The hotel staff gave the excuse that they didn't know my father was a &quot;gold member&quot; or whatever; their excuse was beside the point.The hotel promised us room on the same floor as my parents, but when we checked in, we were not given that room. Instead, the staff changed the subject and urged us to take a room that was ready then, because our &quot;real room&quot; was not ready yet. Hmm, heard that one before? The staff I dealt with did not speak English very well and what he kept saying was very confusing. We held our ground, insisting that we have a room on the same floor as my parents, and finally, someone equivalent to a manager came out and apologized that there were no rooms left on my dad's floor but that they would give us a really nice room if we waited 3 hours until 3pm. So we did.The rooms were very small with limited drawer space but clean and decent. Ours was renovated and everything, except the shaver electric outlet, seemed to be in place. We could not stick any plug in the shaver outlet and my husband had to go without shaving the entire stay. My parents room was not renovated yet, but was clean enough as well. Theirs was what the hotel called a &quot;deluxe room&quot; but besides the existence of a mini-bar, I didn't see the difference. Their shaver outlet was broken down too and so was the mini-bar fridge.When dad called to have it fixed, the staff said she would have someone right up, but when nobody came after 30 minutes, we called again only to be told by someone else that the maintenance guy was not in that day. The hotel didn't have the courtesy to call back to inform us that.This is just one example of how confused the staff are. Everybody seems to say something different, and they don't seem to know much about what is going on. We borrowed a step-down electric converter from the hotel but nobody seemed to know that and was confused when we tried to return it. On the other hand they charged my dad everything in the minibar even though he didn't touch anything. By the end of the stay we had deep distrust for the staff and could not rely on the hotel to give us a morning call because we feared our request might be lost. We had to re-iterate our request over and over again.Hotel location was great especially because we were with a toddler. There was a fabulous playground nearby. But the majority of hotel staff were not up to par, did not have good command of English and seemed to have communication problems among themselves.	
May 23 2006	Good Hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 10 nights during our vacation to London. Our experience with the facilities and staff at this hotel was very good. On our initial stay of 6 nights we had a double room which was adequate for 2 people. The room was clean and daily service by the staff was excellent.We left London and returned for 3 additional nights and the duty manager upgraded our room to the deluxe room. This was really very nice. The hotel is located very conviently to the Bayswater tube station. The Queensway tube station which is located by the hotel was closed for improvemnents during our stay. The hotel is located in close proximity to the Kensington gardens and lots of restaurants in the area.	
May 4 2006 	Nice Location	I stayed in the hotel for 2 weeks while on a business trip. The hotel was under renovation at the time. My room had not yet been renovated but it was still in decent shape. I had a &quot;Deluxe Plus&quot; room with 2 twin beds. The room was really small and there wasn't much room between the desk and the bed. The hotel itsself is in a great location right across from Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. The Queensway tube station is underneath the hotel and Bayswater station is just around the corner and up a couple of blocks. Overall, I felt the hotel was in a great location for getting around the city.	
Apr 18 2006	Great location good clean hotel	After securing a great deal on the internet for this hotel, and then reading some of the reviews on this website I expected the worst, especially as it was Easter bank holiday and the hotel would be busy. However I was actually very pleased with the hotel. My room was recently re-decorated and was clean and bright with a great view of the park. The location of the hotel is ideal and the staff were very polite and pleasant. I would definitely stay again, especially when the special rates are applicable.	
Mar 24 2006	Not in a good shape	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with my wife as a treat for her birthday. The hotel is in a nice spot opposite Hyde Park so it's ideal if you want to cut across to Kensington. The hotel itself though is very dated and really needs some TLC and/or good management. The rooms are very drab and worn and the bathrooms are ancient and they only provide enough shower gel for one wash? Most odd in a Hilton.When we visited a lift was out of order and one room had it's 'no smoking' sign stuck on with duct tape and it was so obvious that there was no maintenance person. We had Breakfast on one day and it was not very nice, the spread was good and promised much but the food was cold and tasteless but the service for the tea etc was good. Drinks are very expensive in the bar so I'd avoid that one.If you stay here and want to venture out I would recommend that you keep some cash for a taxi as it's a long walk to the nearest anything.Oh and when you leave don't allow the concierge to book you a taxi, he told us £10 for a taxi to the high street and when we got one ourselves from across the road it was £5!The staff are nice and helpful but this place really needs a shake up.We got a late deal so can't complain about the cost but if we'd paid full rates we'd have been very upset.Come on hotel, shake it up because you have real potential.	
Mar 22 2006	Good Location	Stayed over weekend and found no problems with the hotel at all.Built on the Queensway tube station which is closed until May but the bayswater tube is only 100m away.No problems from the construction work at Queensway never heard a thing.Breakfast room seems small for size of hotel and you are given a small note advising you to avoid 08.30 until 09.30 (busy time)but we had no problem either day.reception small and a bit dated but staff ok.Location for us was very good .1.25mile from marble arch (start of oxford street)tube 100m and buses 30m from the door.We went on the low rate weekend deal but I would have been dissapointed if I had paid the advertised (in reception )prices.Queensway at the side of the hotel is a great street with restaraunts pubs and even an ice rink and is a very lively place with a shopping centre .All in all we enjoyed it.Rooms not badly sized althogh no view at the back but clean warm and confortable.	
Mar 12 2006	we got robbed..	I stayed at this hotel 6th to 10th march with my boyfriend for my birthday holiday break.despite the hall is very small and we had left our suitcases and stuff on the chairs just 2 metres opposite the reception desk while checking in..my boyfriend got his valuable camera stolen, nobody saw a thing. the staff couldnt check the security records but had to wait 2 days for the police to come and do it. apparently it had been a team job of 2 men, 1 inside the hall, the other on the street, talking on the mobile to give instructions and when nobody was looking,camera was gone! the man in the hall was surely dressed as a businees man so being a hilton nobody suspected a thing. there should be somebody at the entrance to check who comes in and out, if not security, a bell boy would do, just to see if the person arrived needs to check in or steal stuff around..after this we got a small room, back facing, with view over the 1st floor roof and buildings walls, leaving just a tiny space to see a bit of sky. renovating works were still on but going on fast and not giving any trouble, even if we could hear drilling in the morning, not clear if from the hotel or tube station right under. our room was the first under 3 steps in the corridor and the door was not certainly noise proof as we could hear every step taken outside. the hairdryer in the bathroom was noisy as the engine of an airplane but not as powerful.. breakfast was very good but it's not clear how such a big hotel has a such small dining room.on our second day we asked for an umbrella at the reception, nice and big..which we returned the day after, but on departure day we saw it charged for 25 pounds!they thought we had kept it.. infact they had asked me the room number when i took it but not when i gave it back..smart eh!for each day they also charged 2 pounds for some charity fare, with no notice about it previously.all in all for what we paid, being mt boyfriend hilton staff too he had special fare for 30pounds a night with breakfast, it was ok, surely not valuable the usual rates. if u ever go there just pay extra care to ur stuff! never lose sight of it!	
Mar 10 2006	Be careful	Got to the hotel and went to the reception to check in. My Camera was stolen within 20 seconds after I entered the hotel in a lobby 3m x 3m. Staff couln't use the CCTV. Police seems to take care of it after reporting it. Receptionists at the hotel don't check who comes and goes in that hotel, a bomb could easily be placed there, they won't even notice!!As a Hilton Employee myself, I must say this is the WORST Hilton in the Hilton Hotel Chain!!	
Feb 28 2006	Construction Zone Hotel	There is construction going on in this hotel and next to this hotel 7 days a week, including Sundays. In any room, you can hear continuous hammering and drilling going on all day long, including sunday morning. The hotel is renovating the stairwell and elevator areas and in addition, there is a tube station construction zone immediately east of the hotel and this work goes on 7 days a week. Additionally, the mattresses and pillows are hard, the king size bed was really queen sized, and the quality overall is just not up to Hilton standards. We ordered flowers to be present in our room on arrival, but the flowers came without a vase and we had to call repeatedly over two days before we got a vase, which was a pitcher wrapped up in aluminum foil. I would not stay in this hotel again nor recommend it to anyone.	
Feb 25 2006	If you stay here insist on a renovated room	How bad could it be, the location is ideal, and all I want is a clean bed and shower, I thought when I made my reservation at the Hilton Hyde Park. I was to find out, pretty bad.The Hyde Park Hilton appears to be undergoing renovations and maybe it will be better in a few months, but right now you are taking your chances. Upon checking in I was shown to a room that undoubtly doubles as a movie set for a down-on-his luck drug dealer's flat! The carpet was threadbare, the bedspread looked about 30 years old, not dirty, just worn out. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, there were stains on everything and what looked like mold along the wall close to the window. I refused to stay in the room, it was that bad. The bellboy, bless him, was a savior and he called to the front desk and suggested a different room which was freshly painted, clean, and with new covers and pillows on the bed. The staff was for the most part delightful, they were helpful and courteous, made calls to check on restaurants for me, called cabs, carried my bags, etc, they really raised my overall impression of the place. However, I did have trouble with the breakfast wait staff who insisted my rate did not include breakfast and announced this rather loudly to the entire dining room without asking if I would like to eat there anyways. After a quick check, it was included, but still when I checked out, there was an additional charge. I am still trying to work that out. I got the impression that this is a very inexperienced company running this hotel and that once the renovations are complete (there were wet paint signs everywhere) and the staff procedures in place it will be ok. Until then, you are taking your chances.	
Feb 6 2006	Hilton Hyde Park hotel	Last week I stayed in this squalid little place. For any hotel, this was dreadful, for a Hilton it was completely devestating.To anyone who may visit my home city of London, please do not waste your hard earned cash in this place.	
Nov 11 2005 	Not Hilton standard	We stayed here for three nights and were very dissapointed. We have stayed at a dozen different Hilton hotels around the world and this is easily the worst of them.Bad things:*The staff was unprofessional.*We had a deluxe room but it was still very cramped.*The interior is old and dirty.*Thin walls and badly isolated doors.*Some maintenance was heard all during the day(drilling?) maiking it impossible to rest.*Expensive.*Only 6 tv channels. No CNN.Good things:*The complemenatry breakfast was good.*Very good location.All in all we would never stay here again.	
Aug 1 2005	Truly Awful	This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only reason it didn't get the lowest rating was that the staff are very polite and curteous at all times. However, the hotel itself is in desperate need of a refurb! Initally we thought we had stepped back in time to the 1970s. The room was shabby. The net cutains were dirty, the shower door did not open and close properly, there was paint peeling off the ceiling in the bathwork and the light from the hall penetrated the room to a disturbing degree.In all, the hotel was poor and we will never be staying again, indeed, having stayed a many Hiltons across the world this hotel means that I would re-think ever staying in one again.	
Jun 29 2005 	Worst Ever	I have just read some of the previous reviews and had to set the record straight. When I stayed at this 'hotel' I was amazed that it is called a Hilton.It had a grubby front foyer, the rooms were very tired and very small and the overall feel was more than disappointing.I was on a business trip, so it was easier to get on with it, not a place to go for a break.	
May 28 2005	Very satisfied - would stay again	Stayed for a 2 night leisure break in May 05 - combined with Bryan Adams Concert - and everything went like clockwork. In fact we were upgraded to a junior suite which was particularly spacious for London and I'd requested a high floor so any street noise wouldn't affect us so we were very pleased. Staff friendly and helpful plus breakfast was brilliant with civilised times too at the weekend. Queensway station was closed at the time and we used Bayswater which was only a 5 minute walk away. The hotel is well situated opposite Black Lion Gate entrance to Hyde Park which puts you near Kensington Palace - the Orangery there was well worth a visit for afternoon tea. Our package included dinner on the first night which we changed to the 2nd with no problem and the food was good but the atmosphere was lacking as there were only a few other tables being occupied. All in all good value break with no niggles at all.	
May 21 2005	it has its ups and downs	stayed at this hilton property for 6 nights. staff was corteous but not very responsive. plus: location. it's built right over queensway station. beware that this tube stop will be closed for refurbishings for one year! so you might consider noise levels. it's opposite hyde park and convenient to shopping, eating (although quite expensive) and public transport. the room was spacious, but didn't have a/c. i would rate cleanliness a 5 stars!minuses: although i am a smoker couldn't open the windows for fresh air. no ice machines available and the staff, sometimes very friendly and sometimes...... not.but for the price i payed (£99) i still consider this one of the best bargains you can get in london. beware of staying there in the hot months though!	
Apr 13 2005	decent	clean, decent-sized rooms (i was alone), back of hotel not too bad, had view of other apartment buildings and greenery, good location near tube stations, short walk to several &quot;high streets&quot;, fairly safe area, nice-looking but old hotel, elevator is small, area is suitable for young people in their late teens and early twenties, across the street from hyde park, presentable staff, i got a cheap rate for my stay in november around thanksgiving (80 pounds per night - including taxes!)	
Mar 19 2005 	Lousy place to stay	I visited this 'so called hotel' in August 2004. Firstly, the reception area of this hotel had 2 sofa's which they called the lounge. I mean, this was supposed to be a 3 star hotel ! The elevator could fit 2 people &amp; 1 suitcase and that was it. The rooms were really tiny like pigeon holes.You had to stand in a que to get to the breakfast table which was badly furnished.I'm used to Hotels in Asia, where if they charge you 250 US$ per night, they give you fabulous service. All in all, a lousy place to stay.	
Mar 3 2005	No pool or gym but ...	We stayed at Hyde Park Hilton from 1-3 March 2005. Location excellent as right beside Queensway tube station, room had beautiful uninterrupted views of park opposite, breakfast/evening meal delicious, staff very friendly and helpful, room/bathroom very clean and comfortable. Only negative - room too hot but there was a fan. Would definitely recommend this hotel for the 2 night break inclus of 2 breakfasts and one night's dinner. We will return ...	
Jan 17 2005	GOOD LOCATION	We got a good deal here, 2 nights, 2 people, dinner on 1st night and breakfast both days - £169. Got upgraded on arrival to room overlooking the park. Had all ameneties, trouser press, tea/coffee, mini bar. Staff were excellent. The location was right outside the tube station so not much walking. Breakfast was great and buffet style. We couldnt fault this hotel! Definately stay again. Rooms were slightly hot, but open the windows before you go out for the evening and you'll be fine.
