	Great Hotel. Lively 	This is a great hotel. Stay in room 609 which was very spacious. Friendly staff, large rooms and easy access to central london (about 25mins by tube). The rooms and the hotel itself could do with a facelift, but for comfort and quality I would stay here again. I got a good price online because I booked early. I have stayed in many London hotels with cramped rooms and rude staff but this is a very professional place	
	Do not stay here the rooms and food were awful!!!!	Me and my partner stayed here for the weekend just gone and we thought the hotel was not very nice. The rooms need up dating, it was all old fashioned furniture and style. At first we wasnt too bothered about that then we went down for breakfast and the food was terrible. The scramble eggs were runny, there was not veggy option which was not good as i did not have a good choice of food i could get. The tea and coffee was cold and the fruit was not fresh at all!!!! would not recommed to stay here!!!	
Nov 23 2009	Fancy breakfast with strangers? If so go here.	My mum and i travelled to london for the weekend in october and we were lucky enough not to have to be in the room for very long at all. The location is good as it is only a small walk away from a shopping centre and the tube station and as you enter the hotel it looks lovely. We arrived on the friday afternoon and were asked if we would like to upgrade our room for £25 extra.The lifts were slow to arrive and sometimes didn't arrive at all even after pressing the button countless times. The view was good but the window did not open and the air conditioning was broken so the room was very stuffy. The beds were resonably comfy and the bathroom as quite nice, but the breakfast had to be the worst breakfast i have ever had you go in and sit at large tables with people you dont even know, we ate breakfast as quickly as we could and went to buy it elsewhere. I did not enjoy being in the hotel much but thankfully had a excellent time seeing wicked and ross noble while there.	
Nov 21 2009 	Don't Stay Here	I too suffered attempted blackmail at check-in. The receptionist wanted £30 for a 'better' room. All indications were that he expected this to be in cash into his hand.Whilst the room was adequate (and the shower - the best part of the stay - surprisingly good) the bathroom suffered from nicotine stains on the ceiling. The restaurant staff are rude and at breakfast required full payment before you could even enter the breakfast room so be prepared to make your English/Continental selection before you even see any food.From their website you could be fooled into thinking there is WiFi available but this seems to be restricted to certain room types.The hotel is tired and run by bandits - my advice is to spend your money elsewhere.	
Nov 16 2009 	Good experience except for attempted blackmail when checking in	The receptionist explained that we were in an exec-deluxe room (or something like that) which was very good and our rate was an excellent one. Pause. But for only £40 more we could have an excellent room. &quot;No, thank you,&quot; I said. He then scribbled a room number on a slip and pushed it towards us. &quot;Smoking is fine&quot; he said, more of a statment than a question. &quot;Smoking is not fine,&quot; I said. He then stated dimissively, it will have to be a Standard room. More scribbling and &quot;Twin beds is OK?&quot; No, I said, we paid for a non smoking double and that is what we expect. He muttered and then waited, no doubt expecting us to say, go on then, we'll pay the extra but then his colleague shouted across a room number and he scribbled some more and gave us our room number without saying anything else. I can't help but feel he was working to a script or on commission but it was disgraceful.The room itself was clean and comfortable. Quite a new toilet and tiled floor, carpet looked clean and fairly new, bed was comfortable and clean, room temperature was fine and it was fairly quiet. Dining room for breakfast was hot and crowded but cooked breakfast was fine.I was charged more than the overnight parking rate given on the web, if fact more than the 24 hour rate. I only realised that later though :(I booked in a rush before getting a chance to read reviews, and my heart sank when I read some of the bad experiences. But apart from the check-in blackmail I was very pleasantly surprised. It must be hit or miss. The extortion attempt would make me avoid it in the future and not recommend it.	
Nov 14 2009 	It´s amazing and very British Kind	Very nice Hotel. Good bed, good shower, good apartment.There is a very good Bar and Pizzeria restaurant.The location is next to the Canary Wharf tube station and it is easy to go anywhere.I strongly recomment it.	
Nov 14 2009 	Stay here at your peril....	We stayed here and here it is in simple terms....We ordered food, bits of the order didnt show we were then late for our West end show!The staff were rude and just did not care!The maid came into our room without stopping to call out or knock!There was a party in the rooms next to us and the hotel took a long time to sort it!We complained and they gave us a complimentary room, the hassle it took to get it booked was clearly designed so we would quite simply give up.DO NOT INSULT YOURSELF BY STAYING HERE THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT JUST DONT CARE, WHICH IS A PITY AS THE LOCATION IS OK....REAL PITY.	
Nov 5 2009 	Awful - much nicer hotels to stay in for same price	I recently stayed for 1 night at the Britannia Hotel and since I was on business I wasn't looking for a luxurious stay, just a clean comfortable room that I felt safe in. Sadly the room didn't tick any of these boxes. The room was extremely noisy with the tube just 150m away running past my room and I could hear next doors telephone conversation. The bed linen was worn, tatty with stains, drawings on the wall, dirty carpet, TV was on the floor, and the mattress was very old and uncomfortable. My door was banging every 30 secs from the wind whistling down the corridor. Somehow I managed to ignore all those things, mind over matter they say and attempted to log onto the internet. I couldn't connect so telephoned reception to be told they don't have internet access from the rooms but there is access down in the lobby however it was broken at that time - genius! That was the icing on the cake, I packed up my things, proceeded to reception, demanded a refund and moved to a hotel down the road who upgraded me once I told them about my awful experience at the Britannia Hotel.This hotel is in desperate need of a big shake up. I've stayed in better hostels than this.Don't waste your money, find another hotel.	
Nov 4 2009 	Conveinent for O2	We picked this hotel based on its location: one stop on the tube from the O2 (after an event) and very close to my husband's office in Canary Wharf.It's fine if you just need a place to crash for the night in that area and get a good deal but don't expect anything special. The main drawbacks are:-very hot rooms, very noisey and poor A/C and unable to open windows;- next to DLR line (although it doesn't run all night)-thin walls so you could hear your neighbours flush their loos, shower, tvs etc;-noisey loo flush (so take ear plugs if you're a light sleeper);-generally tired and out of date decor;-hard beds; and-poor quality linen.It could really do with a refurbishment.	
Oct 31 2009 	Very poor value	Badly in need of refurbishment.Wallpaper was from a scene out of Only Fool's &amp; horses.Decor is pre 1970's, television in our room could have been bought at a car boot sale for about £20.Room was hot and could not turn down temperatureDouble bed was 2 single beds pushed together, and not at all comfortableIf this hotel is 4 star then I rule the world !!!	
Oct 25 2009	Mouse in dining room!!!	Just got back from the worst hotel stay of my life here. My daughter and I had a day in London planned when i received an email from Britannia Hotels offering a special deal so we decided to book in and make a weekend of it. Bad decision. The room was smelly and stuffy, it was very hot even though we had the heating turned down to 16 degrees, and there were no windows that we could open. There were 10 very noisy fans on the roof right outside our bedroom, room 503, which were on all the time and were so loud it was almost impossible to sleep. We were put on the same corridor as a group of school children who were incredibly noisy and were running up and down the corridor screaming into the small hours. The decor was very tatty, the bottom of the bed was frayed and it was so narrow it was difficult to turn over in the night without falling out. To top it all, we tried the carvery in Jenny's restaurant on our first night and as we were finishing dinner we spotted a mouse running around under the tables scouting for supper. We pointed it out to the waiter who didn't seem too surprised because it wasn't the first time he'd seen it there. Definately a hotel to avoid.	
Oct 25 2009 	Grubby worn and unhelpful.	I stayed in the International Britannia Hotel with about 15 pupils and staff as part of a conference being held for two days, three nights. ROOMThe room was incredibly dated to say the least. The decor was hideous and without a theme. The artwork was quite raunchy, including naked people in suggestive positions (remembering I'm a student). The TV didn't work and the only way it could be turned off was at the switch, neither did the remote. The toilet door wouldn't lock, one person was put on a camp bed, the front door broke so it was a struggle for it to lock so no-one could come in without a card. The only way to boil the kettle was to balance it on the bed due to the immense lack of normal plug sockets. We phoned up reception three times to get someone to come up to fix the TV, they managed to do it but the manager who came said he would send up maintainence to fix the doors. He didn't. We had to call a further three times and even then it only got fixed as we was leaving on the third day despite all the calls occuring on the first day. The mirror was broken and the view was of a construction site (including the lovely sounds at 6am). As we walked into the room we found an apple on the chandelier from the last inhabitants. The air con was noisy and it never had a decent temperature, it was either glacial or boiling. The beds weren't too bad except the camp bed. The hot drink facilities were good as there was a variety to choose from such as hot chocolate, decaf, tea etc. FACILITIESPrior to the stay, we had been reassured that there would be a swimming pool and gym avaliable to us when we wasn't in the conference room. So after a day of meetings all the group wanted was to work out and go for a swim, however, the swimming pool was shut for the Friday and Saturday we were there for and the gym was unavaliable on the Saturday due to a class being taught. When we did manage to get into the gym, it had a nice range of high-tec machines and there was a bar closeby for anyone wanting the spa or some fruit, an energy bar or a drink. The swimming pool was surprisingly small compared to the photos shown on the website and incredibly cold, quite clearly unheated. The sauna and steam room was very nice.RESTAURANTSIn the mornings, our group had the breakfast buffet at Jenny's restaurant, in the afternoons we had pizza in the pizzeria and in the evenings we had the three-course carvery meal. The food from Jenny's restaurant is faultless. It had a wide range for both vegetarian and such. The meat from the carvery was outstanding and the entire breakfast was brilliant. The pizzeria didn't quite have the same effect with me. The pizza was burnt and airy and the coke that came with the pizza was barely a drip until our last meal there where they decided to give us full pint glasses. I would recommend Jenny's restaurant to any stayers of the hotel but I wouldn't recommend the pizzeria to anyone.EXPENSEI didn't have anything to do with the booking and such so I haven't got much of a clue about the costs of the stay itself, only of the bar. For a 200ml bottle of coke it was £2. I thought that was really taking the mick as the restaurant sold pints of coke for £2. I was not impressed by the price of that.I think that anyone who wishes to stay in London should look elsewhere. For a &quot;4 star hotel&quot;, I would struggle to give it 2 stars. I can imagine it being very expensive and very disappointing to people who paid for it. I definitely think that there are far better hotels in the area.	
Oct 25 2009 	A promising exterior but seriously lacking inside	I stayed here with friends for one night &amp; that was more than enough.The room was a good size, but dated and poorly sound-proofed. We were kept awake at night by the DLR and extremely noisy air-con, then woken by the noise from the construction site next door, then a cleaner letting herself into the room at 8am. We pre-booked the continental breakfast at £6 per head, which consisted of oily croissants, two cereals, some rolls and processed cheese, along with horrendous coffee and stewed tea.This hotel claims a four-star rating - I've stayed in two-star accommodations that have been far better.	
Oct 22 2009 	Nice Hotel nice staff dissapointed discusted with duty manager decision tho	Dec 2008 i had a 10 day Holiday in London, brittannia was recommended to me. I booked cheap on line for 3 nights, to treat myself. Very impressed with the front desk and staff. I got little sleep, due to train noise from 6.30 Am til 11.30 pm odd - plus the heating/cooling system would not regulate to a comfortable level. The room was spacious enough and bath luxurious. Last day I used the health/gym/pool facilities downstairs, decided to treat myself to a tanning booth session (the minimnum 6 odd minutes). Being used to regular tanning at home &amp; having recently returned from Africa, my colour fading.. The booth was DEF faulty or had BRAND new bulbs in the pod... I WAS S E V E R L Y B U R N T after just half my session. Pods with new bulbs normally have a warning sign on them to reduce tanning time. When I Panicked &amp; rang through to reception to explain, the Hotel refused to take any responsibility &amp; the duty manager said I must have had an allergic reaction - which was ridiculous being used to regular tanning. I WAS BADLY BURNT ALL OVER / SICK &amp; needed EMERGENCY Hospital attention, this was getting late at night - the burning had taken all evening to become sore. . After an hour of pleading and explaining at the desk the Hotel were kind enough to phone / book me a taxi (At my expense) &amp; printed me a &quot;Courtesy&quot; map of the nearest Hospital. Even though I told them I had no cash left for a taxi &amp; I was lost in that area of London. The desk staff took my mobile tel no &amp; said they would call me later on, I had no credit on my Mb either. A female, sick &amp; Alone at Midnight I walked out lost towards the Hosp with their map. {My travel pal was not with me the last night} When I returned 3 hours later on strong coedine pills, with medicine &amp; a prescription for the morning I was FURIOUS at my eve ordeal. In severe pain, nauseous, shaking, no body temperature control, &amp; scared for my own safety out on foot in dark streets. In the Hosp the desk staff had rung my mobile, but my phone was switched off in the hosp. The manager even made me then beg him to let me check out later than normal in the morning. In the middle of my holidays I had to make alternative plans to get straight home, which was expensive and inconvienient to say the least. After a 2 week recovery period &amp; various doctor's visits - I wrote in length to Brittannia with details from the Doctor who had examined my burnt skin &amp; letter of proof to say i used tan booths regularly, etc.... STILL Had N O reply as yet. P.S. the morning I checked out, the tanning booth was open as usual, as if nothing had happened.  Now I am curious to see if I get a reply on here ! ! TOTALLY discusting treatment in such a high class Hotel.	
Oct 15 2009 	Fantastic Value for Money!	A place to stay for a trip to see The Jersey Boys and, after trawling the internet I came across the Britannia. We got a special deal for a twin room that included breakfast so to be honest at £158 for two nights for two people we weren't expecting The Ritz. However how wrong were we in fact what we got was a warm, smiley welcome which set the theme for the weekend.I have to be honest we were given a room that immediately put me in the 'grr' frame of mind, one right by the lifts and one that although it backed on to the waterfront also to the DLR railway. I always travel with earplugs so to be honest it wouldn't have been a problem however we never had any distubance from the lifts and the railway, due to engineering works only ran on the Friday evening. My only other three issues with the room were that the twin beds were single ones, I guess that comes with being spoilt at other hotels that provide doubles, the shower head (tiny) and lack of lighting (make-up application). Other than that everyting was pretty much spot-on.We decided to eat in on Friday, no booking required and headed to Jenny's Carvery. Fantastic helpful, friendly staff one of whom when we departed on Sunday morning after our ample full english, shook our hands and said 'It's always sad when nice people check out'! Three courses for £15 - excellent! Our only critiscm here was lack of signage - nothing to say three courses, some of the food items on offer and refreshments on the tea/coffee table didn't have appropriate signage. The whole bill for both with drinks came to £40.Saturday morning we sampled the breakfast selection, fruit, yoghurt, toast, cereals and full English. Obviously we didn't have all of the above (no yoghurt) and again it was excellent. We dined in the Pizzeria Saturday evening - total bill with tip for starter, mains (including perfectly cooked sea bass) came to £47 for two. The only disappointment were the coffees in the bar later in the evening, although the Baileys cheered them up!Again on Sunday we enjoyed the breakfast. All in all I'm looking forward to staying there again in the near future. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff. It's worth mentioning too that the waiter in the Pizzeria has worked there for several years which for the hotel/catering industry speaks volumes. A big thumbs up Britannia International - in a climate of financial doom and gloom you certainly put two big smiles on these 'girls' faces! On-site parking too at excellent rate - Thank you!	
Oct 13 2009 	1st class hotel	Stayed with friends at Brit. hotel canary wharf , great all round hotel , very good food rooms very comfortable,and very good and friendly service, would use again.	
Oct 11 2009	Not too bad alright to stay in	The first thing I noticed about the hotel was after seeing the typical characterless outside the inside seemed like another world. I thought it seemed very odd but it didn't bother me much although it's not my favourite style. Staff seemed alright but lived up to the 'international' part of the name.It's a bit further out than most hotels but as I'm used to doing a 30min each way commute back home, 15 minutes on the tube to Central London wasn't an issue.Beds in my room were pretty horrible to sleep on, and the lift to the fourth floor was like trying to catch public transport (wait 5 minutes then it's too full to get in). The selection of restaurants wasn't to crash for the night if you get a good deal price wise.great but overall the place is alright	
Oct 5 2009 	Great value very comfortable.	Was offered an upgraded to a deluxe room at no extra cost- very quick sign in from courteous staff.. Had a 9th floor room with the most amazing views of both the Thames and Canary Wharf. Spacious room - nicely decorated and pristinely clean.Couldn't have asked for anything better.Wonderful location right next to DLR and Jubilee Line ( check weekend works closures for Jubilee at present). Also within a stone's throw of Canary Wharf pier with Clipper boat service to Westminster, O2 and Greenwich .Brillant boat service, but pricey. Best to but a Roamer ticket to give all day hop on and off travel- you can even go through the Thames Barrier on Clipper. An evening Clipper trip in the dark is wonderful- but beware that the ticket expires at 10pm and you will be charged again after that time.Combined with inclusive continental breakfast this stay was a brilliant deal. I would reccommend it wholeheartedly. I was put off by other reviews on this hotel on Tripadvisor, but I did not experience any of the negative comments posted there.	
Sep 29 2009 	Poor quality - tired and in need of update	Look I'm sorry but for a hotel of this location where everything in Canary Wharf is ultra modern, clean and gleaming, this hotel stands out like a sore thumb the moment you enter it. Gaudy and kitch - way out dated and very tired.The decor in the room is a mish mash which all looks incredibly dated - not to mention the incredibly odd (and raunchy!) artwork. Above my dark wood ornate headboard is a very bizarre print of naked men!The bed is way way beyond it's sell by date and I can just about feel the springs pushing through. Bedding is cheap and basic with hard pillows.The skirting on the bed is frayed and so creased it will never be straight and smooth again.The room is clean and doesn't smell - the view is OK and the noise levels are well contained. Those are about the only plus points.Seriously, go somewhere else if you have the option.	
Sep 26 2009 	Noisy and unfriendly	Not worth the price, the DLR drove me nuts, the aircon was erratic the staff could only speak basic English. I have backpacked around the world by myself and have never felt as uncomfortable as this place, I ended up putting the chair against the door handle. It was sleazy, the pool area was staffed by greasy men that were just revolting.	
Sep 20 2009 	Great stay-as usual	This was our third stay at the Britannia and we have enjoyed it on each occasion.We stayed for seven nights this time and if anything the hotel has improved since our last visit.We arrived at 7.15 am and were met by the concierge who come outside and carried our cases into the hotel where we left them until we came back to check in at 4pm when we had probably the swiftest check in ever in our many visits to London.Whilst our room did not have the fantastic views we have enjoyed on previous visits,as usual it was larger than normal for a London hotel.As ever it was spotlessly clean and had more amenities than we often get in4* hotels in London.We had a trouser press,iron,ironing board and even a set of bathroom scales.Our one gripe on our previous visits was that breakfast was rather chaotic and the serving staff disinterested.Now however breakfast seems to served in separate rooms depending on which type you are having with coach parties having a restaurant to themselves.This resulted in us having a very relaxing continental breakfast in a light and airy room looked after by a very obliging young waiter.We had a choice of fruit juices,cereals, yoghurts,rolls,croissants,toast ,cheese and cold meat.This is a very comfortable hotel with great travel connections practically on it's doorstep and it is good to see that opinions on this site are starting to reflect this after going through a period of very critical reviews which I could never understand.I would have no hesitation in recommending it to others.	
Sep 14 2009 	Nice and Quiet in a Clean Part of London	was nicely surprised with this hotel on approach from the clipper service it does look a bit tatty but the entrance is very inviting and the staff are very courteous. the rooms are air conditioned and there is a choice of smoking or nonsmoking very rare these days!!! we had the top flor room with a nice view down the Thames and a slight view of Canary Wharf and the O2. Could do with dressing gowns in the rooms but this is the only complaint really. transport links are quite good with DLR, and tube services close by, also the hotel seems to have its own chaffeuer service, at very reasonable rates, we used this service to go to Mayfair and it was the same price as a black cab! all in all a decent hotel	
Sep 9 2009 	Tired hotel Tired Traveller	I stayed here for 1 night having been bumped from Radisson NPW, my usual haunt. (grr). First impressions were ok, reception staff ftriendly if a little slow. Then up top the room, walked in and hit by a wave of depression (ok I was tired). Room was gfloomy, outside the window were the noisy air handling units, decor is just plain odd, bathroom did not have a free standing shower but one that you have to stoop to get into (pet hate), and no minibar (this is 4*?!)Room service was grim, got sirloin steak that I think had been cooked for 2 hours in vinegar. No cold beer in my choice.No iron in the room, and an age to track someone down to answer the phone to send one upGym does not open till 7, no good for a business traveller who likes to be at the desk for 8. Avoided breakfast, and joined the long checkout queue instead.In summary, I will be avoiding this place. It needs a complete revamp, and a decent chef.	
Sep 7 2009 	Fantastic Hotel - Penthouse Suite a must!!	I booked the Penthouse Suite for myself and my boyfriend. After booking I read some reviews of this site and was a bit nervous about it as some reviews were saying the hotel was a bit dated and the rooms were in need of updating.But upon arriving at the International nothing could be more wrong. The foyer itself was beautiful and the decoration is by no means tired and dated. It is traditional and quite grand. Maybe the people writing bad reviews prefer trendy, modern and minimalist decor hence the comments. The reception staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.The penthouse suite itself was stunning. Upon entering the room there is an iron spiral staircase taking you up to the suite. The living room is very spacious with mahogany sideboards, dining table and dresser and leather sofas with floor to ceiling windows leading out onto a private balcony with stunning views. The bedroom was spacious although obviously smaller than the living area and beautifully decorated again with stunning views of Canary Wharf and beyond. The bathroom has a jacuzzi bath big enough for two! The location of the hotel is a bit far from the centre of London if thats were you want to go and I believe there is a train not to far away to take you into the centre but we took the Thames Clipper fast ferry which is only a five minute walk away from the hotel which takes you to all different parts of London and I would recommend this. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay again.	
Sep 2 2009 	Good value	I stayed at this hotel with my mum and 8yr old Nephew for two nights. It was very reasonable and not booked directly with the hotel. The room was fine, three single beds as it was a family room, we overlooked the water which is quite a lovely view. The room and bathroom were clean. The breakfast was included as continental but we just walked into the main place and had the buffet full english. We were not challenged but it was about twenty mins before closing time as my nephew wouldnt get out of bed! The food was lovely, trying to get a hot drink was very difficult. The staff are very busy and seem to forget. The pool was quite cold and there was a terrible smell in the changing rooms, if you were looking to stay at a hotel just to enjoy the pool facilities I really wouldn't reccomend this one. Overall this hotel was fine for two nights, the location was good, about a ten min walk from the tube and docklands railway.	
Aug 29 2009 	We had a great stay in this place!	I have just returned from a five day break in London with my friend. The hotel was booked as part of a package so we had NO idea what to expect. I am glad I didn't read all the reviews on this site before I went. It was clean, comfortable, the staff were helpful, our bedroom and bathroom were clean, spacious and well equipped. So maybe not evryone likes chandeliers - you can choose your own decor at home, how are hotels supposed to please all tastes? And if you don't want to see and hear a train or a tube from your window - don't choose a hotel in Canary Wharf area right next to a DLR stop! I would stay here again, the location is fantastic and my only very slight complaint is the way some of the tour groups were shoved upstairs out of the way in a conference room for breakfast.	
Aug 28 2009	Britannia International Hotel canary Wharf London	I have just come back from a four-night break in London with my friend. It was booked as a package through a coach tour company and we had no idea what to expect but we were most impressed! It's a brilliant location, a lovely clean hotel, helpful staff, great breakfast. The room was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was lovely - even had a bathroom scale!. Since returning home I have checked out the reviews on this site and cannot believe some of the negativity - although I get the feeling that some of the worse ones go back a year or two. Speaking as of now, August 2009, I absolutely recommend this place. So what if you don't like the decor in a hotel, all you reviewers out there? You get to choose your own at home. How do you expect hotels to please everyone? And if you don't like being able to see or hear a train or a tube - go to the countryside!!My only slight grouch was that coach parties were expected to be separate in some sort of converted conference room which is a bit less atmospheric than the main dining room and has quite a bit less choice, although it was still the full brecky. Reminds you that maybe some of us package hol. travellers are the poor relations?	
Aug 24 2009 	A very pleasant stay - would definitely go back	After reading some of the reviews on here I was a little dubious about booking this hotel but took a gamble and it certainly paid off. We had a pleasant stay and the room was very spacious and more than up to our expectations. We were put in a double room on the 10th floor at the front of the hotel in the direction of Canada Square with a wonderful view over the water. The room was very clean with a nice en-suite and was decorated in what I would call non-offensive classic style. The bed was comfy and certainly not lumpy as per some of the other comments on here. We actually had a very good nights sleep. People who complain about things like chandeliers, mirrors in the lifts and ornaments in the corridors are quite frankly just looking for any little thing they can to moan about!! The hotel staff seemed friendly and helpful enough, and the hotel itself certainly wasn't smelly. In fact the corridors and room had a noticeable fragranced smell about them.I agree that the included continental breakfast in the pizzeria restaurant is quite basic but you have to accept that as a freebie you're not going to get a banquet. If you're really not happy with the selection offered then you do have the choice of walking 10 metres across to the main restaurant and paying £13.50 per person for a much bigger choice of breakfast, including full English. We didn't pay any extra ourselves and were quite happy with the basic breakfast of cereals, croissants, rolls, toast, cheese/conserves, yoghurt and juice/tea/coffee.If you want a good deal then make sure you search one of the travel supermarket type websites instead of booking direct with the hotel. This is what I did and got our double room for a nightly rate of £59 including breakfast which was an absolute bargain and even cheaper than a lot of budget type hotels with a lower star rating and no breakfast included.Based on our experience we would definitely go back to this hotel again.	
Aug 13 2009 	How many chandeliers!!	Hi,Having read previous reviews i though 'well cant be that bad', i mean chandeliers aint always a bad thing.As we got dropped off to the hotel i was thinking, good move here, the place looks pretty darn sweet. Into the reception area, i was suddenly reminded of a review i had read, serious chandelier overload!The reception lobby was a kind of victorian theme but in a bad 80's style!I always gauge a hotel on how long it takes to get checked in, well there was only one member of staff on, at 7pm on a Sunday evening!Waiting for the lift we had a chuckle about the number of chandeliers, and into the lift. Seriously, remove some mirrors, i've already been to the barber, i dont need a mirror infront, behind, and all around me, i've no need to be reminded of how great my hair looks from each side, nor do i need to see an infinate number of myself, getting smaller and smaller as i peered into the mirrors.Out of the lift, we were greeted by some strange fat chineese warrior holding some sort of a weapon, oh come on, victorian/80's and now some chineese ornaments!Into the room, twin beds that might as well have been a double there was such a small gap between the beds. I mean we are friends but not that close friends!Another good guage of a hotel is the TV in the room, well this baby should have been on antiques road show, i was suprised not to see a Fergison Video Star beneth it!The beds were hard as nails and i had a spodge of blood on my sheets, always makes a good impression!I did like the bar downstairs that was level with the water outside. The pizza's are quite nice, although it did come with olives i asked for no olives but that was easily fixed.Needless to say i very much doubt i will be staying at the Britannia Hotel London again very time soon!I think the hotel should rephrase the hi speed wifi sign as well!Thanks for reading.	
Aug 5 2009 	EXCELLENT	Really good service and it smelt good too. The beds were very comfy and i loved the cable TV that really made my night, as well as my boyfriend ;) the pool was nice and clean and the jacuzee was pengting	
Aug 5 2009 	I see things haven't changed in 3 years	Me and my partner stayed here some time ago but I had to look it up and can see from current reviews that the hotel has not changed in all this time. The place comes across as being built in the initial heyday of thw wharf and then running out of money.We stayed two nights and the staff were unhelpful, some trays left outside rooms on our first night were still there when we left. The room was shabby and there was no mini bar. When we asked whent he restaurant closed we were told it closes when there are no more orders. Great we thought but the food was poor and the room service was no better.It's hard to believe it is 4 star compared to nearby hotels. One to avoid.	
Aug 3 2009 	Pleasantly surprised!	Stayed at this hotel for 1 night as I was going to a gig at the nearby O2. Kind of expected a very basic hotel due to reading some reviews here, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sure the hotel is a bit dated and a bit shabby but for me its location to Canary Wharf and the O2 along with the very resonable price made it a great choice. Room was bigger than I expected and was good for a single room, except that the bed was a bit hard for me (but for 1 night that was ok). Didn't eat in the hotel but did use the pool which was a fairly decent facility. Staff were helpful enough. Not sure if I would stay here if I was visiting central London, but would recommend for concert-goers looking for a place to kip after a gig!!	
Aug 1 2009 	excellent stay! I must defend this hotel	Having read some of the reviews from people I feel i must defend the hotel.Myself and my wife stayed at the hotel on the new year break package 2008 and there is no way i can fault it at all. My standards no in no way low and i would be the first person to complain if i had to But some of the reviews by people are totally unfair to the hotel and staff unless something drastic has happened in the last seven months. Anyway the room was excellent i cant remember the number but it had a spiral staircase from the room door up to the bedroom itself and a patio door out onto a balcony were you could see the Thames-excellent clean and all we needed.Next the food as much as we wanted to eat sometimes the chef would come round to your table and ask if everything was okay -a nice touch.Staff in general were very good and pleasent -Thinking back are we talking about the same hotel ! We are definately Going to stay this New year	
Jul 27 2009 	LONDON DOCKLANDS MAGIC.	I stayed here for 2 nights with my husband, the hotel is very grand in the foyer but the dinning room is very tired and needs a revamp. The tables are made of wood and they didn't have table covering so looked rather grubby, the setting is great actually overlooking the water. The rooms were clean but very dated, the view we had was GREAT from the seventh floor, we overlooked the dock and the O 2 arena, the docklands light railway, and canary wharf. Food was good and plentiful, commplimentory bathroom goodies, tea making facilities, but the bed left a lot to be desired, lumpy. The location was fabulous with 5 minutes walk to underground and light railway. I love water and trains so this more than made up for letdowns for me.would definately stay again. 10 minutes into town on the underground or light railway, buy a day ticket very good value.we took the open top bus which also includes a trip on the river either to geenwich or westminster and the jack the ripper walking tour at £24.00 excellent value.	
Jul 25 2009	With excellent service and accommodation this hotel provides fantastic value	Despondent, having read so many negative comments about the hotel, I arrived as part of a bus tour from Scotland, expecting grubby and noisy surroundings. To our delight, we quickly realised that we were about to be treated to four very pleasant nights. I had asked for a quiet, single room and found that, without any fuss on our arrival, I had been given this on the tenth floor, overlooking the Thames. The bed was comfortable and, although a light sleeper, I slept well. The room and en suite were spotless and attentively attended to by housekeeping every morning; the buffet breakfasts and dinners offered a wide choice in the restaurant, which looked out over Canary Wharf (indeed, if you sat by the window, it felt as though you were at sea!); and all of the staff were particularly helpful and pleasant. There was no question of being treated as a second-class citizen because we were on a bus trip. Independent travellers need have no fear, since, although a lot of groups were staying at the hotel, it seemed that they had separate restaurant accommodation, although I cannot be certain about this. The hotel is ideally situated for all of London, since it is very close to Canary Wharf Tube Station and to The Docklands Light Railway. It took me twenty minutes to reach the hotel from the National Theatre on the South Bank and the same time to Greenwich Maritime Museum on the DLR. A Day Ticket will cost you only £5.60. So, please, do not be put off by the complaints below; I don't understand how anyone could find fault with the hotel.	
Jul 14 2009 	So bad that I left a day early despite having paid in full	The staff had ignoring guests down to a fine art, the breakfast was pure slop and the shower in the room was a mere trickle, the room was stuffy and noisy, the hotel itself was a bit on the dirty side, the only good thing was the concierge who was always pleasant	
Jul 7 2009 	Hmm...old and smelly	I've been to some nice hotels in my time...this definitely wasn't one of them. Only stayed for one night (thankfully). When I got there, for some reason there wasn't a room booked for me...annoying. Then when I finally got a room, it was decorated in an old fashioned way (not my style) and it had an old smell about it. It wasn't too far from canary wharf which was probably the best thing about it. Wasn't impressed...don't think I'd stay there again. Maybe I'm being a little bit harsh...it was good enough for the night really but wouldn't want to stay a bit longer. I have become a bit of a snob when it comes to hotels as well now!	
Jul 6 2009 	Not 4 Star	You can stay in this hotel, but do not expect anything. Rooms are more or less clean, but we had one dirty towel, and two dirty pillow sheets. Breakfast (continental) is very very basic (bun &amp; croissant with marmalade, and some cereals, orange juice and coffe/tea).Definitely okay if you just want to sleep there.	
Jun 16 2009 	Fine Hotel	Stayed 4 nghts in April. After reading the reviews on this page I was concerned but I think some people like to complain. The room was bigger than expected, the bathrom was clean, furnishings in good condition, breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice. The walk to Canary Wharf was closer than I thought it may have been. If you prepurchase a Travelcard it is cheap to get around. Stayed at a more expensive hotel closer to the city centre after our trip to Europe and it was nowhere near as good as this one.On the downside we found everywhere in the UK was overheated and this was no exception.	
Jun 13 2009 	Great views  nice place to stay	Although showing its age our stay at this hotel was very enjoyable. It is close to all Londons tourist attractions. The Bar facility is quiet and enjoyable to Chill out after the hustle and bustle. The staff are very attentive and a credit to the hotel. A word to the wise 90 Pound cab fare from heathrow.	
Jun 11 2009 	SOMEWHERE TO LAY YOUR HEAD!!!	If you want to tour London all day and just need a place to rest your head after a days journey, then this is the Hotel for you. And that's is exactly what we did for the 6 nights we stayed in London. The hotel is pretty much what everyone says, a three star hotel at best, the beds are not the greatest-you do feel the springs poking your body, and the rooms could by all measures use a face lift. My friend did ask for another mattress and he was provided with one in the same day. The bathroom was decent, the shower was probably the best aspect of the entire room. The room was smal but I guess that should be expected. We had one problem, the sink would not drain our second day there. But Housekeeping fixed the problem by the time we returned to the room later in the evening. I really didn't have too much interaction with the staff, but the little I did went relatively well, no coplaints there. The hotel is not far from the Tube either but the cab ride from the airport to the hotel cost 40 pounds, way to much. We ended up taking a series of trains to the airport for the return journey home. Took about an hour and a half and 4 - 5 different trains, but well worth not spending 40pounds on a cab. I will not stay at this hotel if I visitt London again though. It's an OK hotel, it doesn't require more than one extended stay.	
Jun 10 2009 	My first trip to london	I booked my weekend with superbreak and paid £180 for the 2 of us for 2 nights and rail tickets superb value for money.The hotel in docklands was clean and spacious the food wasnt great but that was ok as we were out most of the time.We went to see britney spears and even though the DLR wasnt working the rail replacement service was superb we were there within an hour and back within 45mins without a single problem.I think the London transport system is fantastic the longest we waited on a train was 8mins.We did some of the tourist spots but didnt have enough hours in the day to see everythingI loved London and cant wait to go back	
Jun 2 2009 	A bit old fashioned - needs updating!!!	I stayed here for 1 night as i was going to the O2 to watch a concert, so in terms of location it was fairly good, although when you come off the tube at Canary Wharf i wouldn't really want to be lugging suitcases as is still a 10 minute walk from station across a bridge and through a carpark!!!The foyer was very grand but old fashioned, very green with chandeliers, and it had a bar in the lobby area which was quite nice.We upgraded to a superior suite for £20 which they were saying was a 1 day special only, but not too sure of that. Quite frankly not really worth the £20. The room was big but looked like a 70's sitting room and even though it had a nice view it was a communal balcony which shocked me as a random man walked past!!! When you open the door there was a spiral staircase to take you to room, again if i had suitcases i would not be happy, it was bad enough after a few drinks!!I did not have breakfast as left early but don't think i would've missed much.All in all a good budget hotel if you stay for maybe a couple of nights max, but no more than that.	
Jun 1 2009 	What a stunning view!	Great deal (£58 for 2, inc. excellent continental breakfast.) View from the 6th floor room was wonderful- across Heron Dock to the Dome. Staff were very pleasant, room very clean. Only 1 drawback- near bye Underground is closed at the moment (May 09)	
May 31 2009 	Definately Not 4 Star!!	Where do I start? Well when booking, we requested a room on the first to third floor as my husband does not do elevators. When checking in we were given a room on the 8th floor. We were told that the rooms on the first to 6th floors were only twin beds that could not be moved together and were smoking rooms. Meanwhile we noticed that our room had two twin beds pushed together! The hotel needs to put some money into refurbishing.....it is very tired looking. The bathroom had peeling paint on the ceilings, the toilet flusher was attached to the wall and very loose and the taps which once must have been a gold color were now a scatchy looking silver brown.We had a very uncomfortable sleep as the springs in the mattress were sticking into our ribs and we heard the trains going most of the evening and early morning. Noticed that the window was missing some screws and was open at the top. We informed Front Desk about our problem with the mattress and window. They sent someone up to fix the window. At first they were going to switch us to another room and then suddenly there was not another room. We asked for a second duvet to make the mattress more comfortable for sleeping and when we returned from our evening out, they had only given us the blanket that was in the closet. Our friends gave us their blanket from their room and when we lifted the sheets to put the blankets under them, we were appauled at what we saw. The mattress was worn, stained and on the side it was falling apart. My friend took pictures with her camera and hopefully will post them but her comment was &quot;I wouldn't let my dog sleep on that mattress!&quot; Don't expect too much in the continental breakfast....it only consists of cereal, croissants and buns. We had a difficult time getting someone to give us more cream for our coffee....none of the staff are very accomodating or attentive to their customers needs. (A little note here.....we were visiting friends in the UK from Canada and stayed here to see some of the sights of London. We are all very open minded, but we felt more of an intrusion on the staff, none of whom seemed very excited about working at this hotel). The Front Desk staff are not very pleasant to speak to....(usually you get a smile and a &quot;How can I help you&quot; when you approach the front desk....but not at this hotel)....very somber and stodgy employees!! On our second night we were talking to the barman and as he seemed very unhappy working there, we asked him if he liked his job. His response was &quot;of course not&quot;. Apparently he is an aspiring Polish IT guy who cannot get a job in his field in the UK as his written English is not very good and so he lowered himself to the job of Barman for now. The only time we got a smile out of him was when we gave him a nice tip. I think the only way to get him to show a little more enthusiasm and life would have been to light a fire under his butt.I think I have covered pretty much our experience with this hotel. Would I go back....no way....would I recommend it to a friend....no way....Would I recommend it to an enemy....DEFINATELY!! (just to get even)Anyway....take my advise....or don't....I just want to make sure that people are advised about our experience before they make their own decision. I am sure that by putting in some of the money that is charged for the room to upgrade the Hotel it may one day be the hotel that it once was.....but for now I would stay clear!!Nora WhiteCambridge, Ontaro Canada	
May 29 2009 	Only if you're desperate!	My husband and I stayed there last night. The room temperature was 25C! We were absolutely roasting all night. Tried to use the tempurature contol in the room to lower the temperature but it didn't work. We were only able to get about 4 hours of sleep we were so hot. As the hotel offers no facilities for smokers, if you want to have a cigarette you literally have to get completely dressed, go out the front of the hotel, past the drop off point at the entrance and stand on the pavement. If you're a smoker, definitely stay in another hotel that will treat you with dignity. To sum it up, we were out of the hotel at 7:30 am, decided we'd rather go sit in Paddington Station for 3 hours and wait for our train home, than stay at that hotel. The decor is out dated, the prices astronomical We have another concert at the O2 in October, we will be booking our hotel room at a different hotel!	
May 27 2009 	Has - been	Great student hostel but business forget it. This hotel had it's heyday about 15 years ago when it was the only hotel close to Canary Wharf. It is tired, worn out and desperately ready for a makeover. Although the room service staff were very polite and helpful the rest of the staff wiped that out . Particularly the teenager behind the bar in the spa ( broken the trade descriptions act there) who spoke to me so rudely I nearly checked out. I could give you a whole list of unpleasant experiences I had in this hotel over 4 nights but I won't. However, if you are a student, and the hotel was full of them - it's a great place to hang out. For some reason I didn't check Trip Advisor - big mistake.	
May 19 2009 	No real problems here.	Stayed here with my wife for 3 nights in the middle of May.The main reason for the visit was sightseeing and catching a show or two.I usually check on tripadvisor before I book a hotel and if I'm in any doubt I err on the side of caution and do not book a badly reviewed hotel. On this occasion my daughter who is a travel agent said that they have sent people here and had not had any adverse comments so I did not bother checking it out first. I'm glad I didn't because I don't think I would have booked it reading some of the recent reviews.I found the hotel to be very clean and tidy. The reception staff were very efficient and we checked in without a problem. The room although not massive, was perfectly adequate and was also clean and did not appear to need any refurbishment etc as has been reported previously. Everthing was in a good state of repair etc. There was an ironing board, hairdryer and trouser press although we only used the hairdryer. When travelling as a tourist I tend to use my hotel for sleeping in and possibly having a meal or two so the size of the room is not a major factor for me.The bar staff were also very polite although a bit on the slow side. I also thought that the prices were expensive even for London.The only real minus points were that I thought breakfast was on the expensive side (£13.50 p.p.) so we did not bother. We simply got something to eat in the shopping area of Canary Wharf which was much more reasonable. Also it would have been nice to have something in the room which told us what time the bar / restaurants were open along with some idea of the price.The other factor which would probably put me off stopping here again is not within the control of the hotel or anyone else come that. I just thought that it was a bit too far away from the main tourist areas of central London. We found that it took between 30 - 60 minutes to get where we wanted. This is despite the fact that there are two tube / DLR stations within 5 minutes of the hotel. I have no doubt that it is perfectly placed for the O2 and if you have business in the Canary Wharf area. As I said above this is outside of the control of the hotel but it was a minus point for our stay. I have only reflected this comment in the location score.	
May 11 2009 	Absolutely Fine!!!!!!!	I've never written reviews before, but wanted to with this hotel for all those people , who like me had booked this hotel &amp; then read the awful reviews on here &amp; started to panic about what they were letting themselves in for!I've just come back from staying at this hotel with friends as we wanted to be close to the O2 arena &amp; it was absolutley fine. Whilst I agree it isn't a 4* hotel anymore, the room was large (we had a triple room), with clean bedding &amp; towels, tea/coffee making facilities with biscuits &amp; the bathroom was more than adequate with decent shower pressure. Check-in was a doddle &amp; the reception staff seemed very nice.Having stayed there I can sort of understand some of the points made:- yes the room was quite warm &amp; the air con didn't seem to do a lot, yes you can hear the tube (but then if you book a hotel right next to a tube station what do you really expect!!) &amp; yes the rooms are VERY kitsch, but overall for the price &amp; location it was all good.If I wanted a hotel near the O2 at a fair price, I would definatley stay here again.	
May 11 2009 	Awsome and nice place	Britannia is a nice hotel with high privacy and peace.you can enjoy yourself, staff is really supoortive but you do need to take care of your belonging at the cleaning staff is external.	
May 5 2009	Great rooms and lounge area restaurants and bar open late good service.	I traveled with a large group of high school students to this hotel. I would recommend it for its large rooms and baths, and for its large lobby and lounge. The restaurants and bar were open until 2:00 am for food and beverages The hotel was easily accessed from the tube, but was far enough from London center that the students could not leave the hotel at night. They could convene in the lobby area for cards and socializing.For the adults, the lounge was situated on the Thames with floor to ceiling windows to take advantage of the beautiful views. Many of our rooms had river views. Breakfast was continental with yogurt and fruit in addition to croissants and rolls, ham, cheese and cereal, milk and juice.A very good hotel with great amenities. The entrance to the RER is only a 1-2 minute walk, and it is very easy to access all areas of London center from this location.I would compare this hotel to a Radisson or Marriott in the USA.	
May 5 2009 	Tired and worn out with awful food	We travelled to London to see Tina Turner at the o2 and looked at the trip advisor site after we had booked. I wish I had checked this out before. The hotel is in desperate need of a refurb and although we were offered a room upgrade this did not compensate for its general grubby worn out feel. The bath was dirty and had a crack in the tub which had been fixed with tape!!! and the room had a really odd aroma.On booking in we were offered an upgrade for an extra £30 which included breakfast but I have to say it was just not worth it. The breakfast was stone cold and when we queried it with the restaraunt manager he advised that someone had turned off the heater in the food cabinet which was why the food was cold. This was patently untrue as we were stood next to the cheff when he brought so called fresh food to the counter which was already cold and indedible. Interestingly when we booked out several other people were complaining about the breakfast as well.As far as accesssibility to the main attrractions, the Thames Clipper Service is only five minutes walk up river and this gives great access to all of the main attractions including the 02 and is definitely the best way to get to it. If you are going by boat then book your return ticket at the 02 as soon as you arrive to avoid the queing afterwards.My advice would be to find somewhere else to stay and definitely avoid this hotel, I wish we had.	
May 4 2009 	Should have Checked with Tripadviser FIRST!!!	Where do I start? One of the worst hotels no the worst we have stayed in for a very long time. I am so sorry I didn't check Trip Adviser before booking I would have saved my wife and I a lot of aggravation. Yes it is near to the O2 but that is about all there is to report favourably. The rooms are clean but were worn out 10 years ago. I asked at the front desk for a refurbished room and was given 819. If that is the updated version - my granny is a one legged circus performer. The room was stuffy, the air conditioning didn't work, the bed squeaked if you moved your little finger so almost impossible to get any decent sleep. The food wasn't the worst feature but the level of service was poor. One of the staff - a very grumpy blonde East European that it would take her a half an hour to bring fresh tea to our table. we had to ask the manager to do it for us. Whoever owns this place should be ashamed of the impression it gives of Britain to the European visitors who use it. It appears that the manager reads these reviews but it seems that other than apologies no action occurs. I would never ever stay here again even if I got it for free!	
May 4 2009 	Book elsewhere!	Not a joke, hotel was very poor! Bath that could not be used, staff that could not be bothered! Health facitilies that were not working, broken windows!! Needs major refurb!! I wasted money!!	
Apr 28 2009 	Do Not Stay Here	Booked this hotel through &quot;Hotels near the O2 Arena&quot; site. Our room was like a 19th C Boudoir. Horrible decor, ripped &amp; sun-bleached hideous net curtains, broken bath, no plug in sink, no mini bar etc. Docklands Light Railway rumbling past our window. DESPERATELY IN NEED OF A REFURBISHMENT. How can they possibly call themselves 4 Star ?? Good location for O2 - only 1 stop away on tube. We took the Thames Clipper from Canary Wharf pier to the O2 pier - very pleasant way to travel. HOTEL VERY DISAPPOINTING - especially since we had travelled so far to get there.	
Apr 16 2009 	Not a 4 star hotel but obviously a struggling hotel.	The whole hotel is in need of updating,the room we stayed in was of good size but far from deluxe as stated. Everywhere was grubby especially the restaurant which reminded us of a spanish 2 star all inclusive where the food leaves a lot to be desired, poor choice, kept luke warm for long periodsand not well presented. The waiting staff, apart from one, obviously found the guests to be an added hinderance to their duties as you were eiher ignored. or spoken to as they backed away from your table as though they had something more important to do. Come on Britannia pull your socks up it was embarassing to think that our foreign visitors thought that was our 4 star standard. Stay at a Premier Inn, far superior!	
Apr 14 2009 	Definately NOT Four star! I wouldnt give it One Star.	For Valentines Day my partner and I decided to book in to this 'Four' Star hotel after previously staying in a Four Star Hilton the month before. Which was amazing by the way (Hilton Metropole - London).On arrival the Lobby was beautiful, the reception staff (day) were grumpy and looked at us as if we were scum. We headed to the lifts which were small and shabby. Hall ways are decorated relatively nicely. Our room needed serious updating and as we asked for a non smoking room even though we are smokers, I was suprised to see an ashtray but no opening windows. The janitor opended it on request and he was the most pleasant man. Bathroom was lovely. Could not get a signal on the tv so nothing to do there.We tried to eat in the pizza lounge and bar on two occasions. On both we encontered other guests shouting at the manager for bad service and food. The waitor did not write our order down, I told my partner I would be suprised if he remembered, he didnt! Came back 15 minutes later with 'what was it you wanted?'. 40 Minutes later we got our food and the pizza looked like a burnt tesco pizza. The waitors were rude, ignorant and not trained. The restaurant had three other couples and seated about 100 people so they were empty and no excuses could be given. The bar staff ignore you so they can carry on their conversations and I was not given cutlery or sauces and when I went to ask all staff had disappeared. Cutlery turned up dirty. Ordered our drinks and they forgot them repeatedly!!!! I was fuming after the second night.The best meal we had is when we walked to Gauchos about 10 minutes away.I would never ever stay here again, worst service I have ever encountered, even a smile would have been nice. The cleaners however were very polite. Considering the price and the star rating I expected alot more. Would have been better in a caravan. Location is amazing just a shame they put this hotel there, what a waste........	
Mar 31 2009 	Great Hotel Fantastic Location	I have stayed in this hotel twice with my fiance and we are probably going again later in the year. The hotel itself is lovely, nicely decorated, perfect bedrooms and a wonderful bar and lounge overlooking the river. Canary Wharf is a fab place to stay as it is outside of the city centre but within easy travelling distance (by DLR and tube). The shopping centre is great, with a variety of shops and prices! The hotel staff have always been helpful and accommodating and one actually joined us for a drink one evening! We have stayed in London quite a few times and this is by far the best hotel we've stayed in. Don't be put off by other reviews and by the outside of the hotel which does no justice to the inside- I gaurantee that you'll love it.	
Mar 19 2009 	Frequent visitor had enough though	It was the 3rd time I went there and I can say I'll try to find another hotel next time.This hotel has been left to time, as no refurbishment has taken place over the years. The main reason i've chosen it so many times is the location, as it is in a business/stylish area, with access to the newest underground line.However clean the rooms are, the time has left its marks. I can't expect a room of 284 GBP rate (indicated at the reception) to have this kind of facilities.Please bear in mind that i stayed in two different rooms, due to a short trip i had and both rooms where in the same bad condition.If you expect Internet connection, you should a take a pair of slippers, as you should visit the lounge room (next to reception) to connect in the wifi network. There is no wire broandband connection, only wifi, which doesn't work properly.I can admit that the hotel has a top classic decoration and great view (to a Thames branch river and O2), however, I'm not sure whether you will find this view again after mid 2009, or 2010, as a new building will be built very very close to the east side of the hotel (see more on www.ballymore.co.uk).Some photos of the horrible bathroom and main room conditions, as well as of the great decoration and view, here:http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/6274/britannia.jpgI almost forgot: get a portable heater with you, heating is set to Alaska temperature levels.	
Mar 1 2009 	Good location but not great levels of service	Second time staying here, mainly due to price, availability for going to the O2. Only did room only so can't comment on the food - apart from to say that don't expect to get a hot drink after 11:00pm - not even a cup of hot chocolate is possible apparently. Also - anyone who is allergic to caffeine is stuffed as they can't do decaffeinated coffee - the alternative offered being herbal tea! It's all looking a bit shabby these days and the decoration is just bizarre - even by normal hotel standards. I've selected would recommend to a friend - but note only with suitable warning notices attached!	
Feb 19 2009 	Bloody awful shabby decor rude staff appalling food	It all started going wrong at check-in; after a hard day at work I just wanted to collapse on my bed for 10 minutes before grabbing a bite to eat and retiring for the evening to do some work. I arrived at check-in where some chap started my check in process and half way, without saying a word to me disappeared never to be seen again! Eventually someone else picked up the process and checked me in.The decor is shabby throughout, the hotel has motion sensitive lights in the corridors that don't work properly leaving the public areas in semi-darkness (not a safe feeling for a woman travelling alone in London); the doors slam loudly and make a horrible racket.The decor in the rooms is dreadful - no taste, no style - my recommendation - leave the curtains open and focus on the view of Canary Wharf from the window. I don't even want to think about what the stain on the wallpaper in my room was!  There's no sound insulation in this hotel and its very near the Docklands Light Railway so its very noisey with trains.The bed was so uncomfortable and squeaked loudly if you so much as twitch a finger. The shower was a mixer tap attachment - no power, no way thermostatic control, so you have to twiddle with the taps alternatively freezing and scalding yourself under a miserable dribble of water.The 'complimentary' coffee is more of an insult - I'm not sure what brand it is but I don't even think Lidl's would stock it.As for the food - for heavens sake don't eat here! You're surrounded in this area with some fabulous places to eat and this isn't one of them. Its shockingly poor quality and ridiculously high prices.Theres a Holiday Inn Express not far from here for less per night and less pretentions - with that hotel you know what your getting and its reasonable value for money.	
Feb 16 2009 	Okay but not what I'd call four star!	Having read mixed reviews of the Britannia International, I was a little nervous as to what I'd find when I stayed there, but overall it's a perfectly acceptable hotel, though I wouldn't rate it four star.I found all of the staff I had dealings with to be nothing but helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.My standard room was well-sized, with plenty of storage space (triple wardrobe, with a trouser press inside, two beside chests of drawers and a dressing table), and the three pint (1.7 litre) kettle and teapot were appreciated, though the latter would have been more useful if a tea cosy was provided as well.Whilst the room did have air conditioning, it took some time for it to switch from heating to cooling after being turned on.I thought that the secondary &quot;night light&quot; in the bathroom was a good idea, though the bathroom is very small, with barely enough room for the washbasin, toilet and bath.The corridors are rather gloomy, as the carpets and walls are in dark colours, as are the doors, and there's not much lighting along them.The &quot;double&quot; bed comprised of two, individually made up, single beds pushed together beneath a solid wooden headboard.Breakfast was a hit and miss affair, with a single slice conveyor toaster that appeared to have settings of &quot;charcoal&quot; and &quot;warm bread&quot;, with nothing in between, and which didn't eject the toast far enough, so you had to fish around under the toaster with a pair of tongs to extract it...Though that could have been a problem with the output &quot;tray&quot; not being angled correctly.Tea and coffee at breakfast came in jugs, which were left on a couple of tables for guests to help themselves. As a result, unless you were lucky enough to get a jug as soon as it was brought out, the tea was almost invariably stewed.The windows in the room were filthy, seemingly not cleaned for weeks, and the soundproofing was minimal, with noise pollution from inside the Hotel (there appeared to be a Disco going on the night I stayed) and outside (the Docklands Light Railway runs virtually behind the building, and it's on one of the main roads in the area).In addition, use of the Hotel's Health and Leisure Club is chargeable for everyone, even Hotel guests, whereas the majority of similar Hotels I've stayed in include use of such facilities as part of your stay.Finally, there's the price. At the time of writing, the rack rate for a Standard Twin or Double room is £105 (room only), rising to £349 for the Penthouse Suite (with Breakfast and Dinner), and breakfast is £10.50 per person for the Continental option, or £13.50 per person for the Cooked option.In my view, those are excessive for the overall quality of the Hotel, even allowing for the size of the rooms and the location, and I'd be unlikely to stay at the Hotel again if there wasn't a promotional rate available.	
Feb 5 2009	Made our first trip to London very special.	My friends and I and my two kids had decided we were going to have a long weekend in London in the summer hols. We wanted to go to see the Tutinkamoon exhibition, which actually we were disappointed in, but that another story.We decided to travel by train to London as it was the easiest and cheapest as we booked it in advance along with the hotel, London Eye tickets, King Tut exhibition and Theatre tickets. We wanted somewhere that would be easy to get to everywhere we wanted but really, thought it best to be nearer the Dome as we were going to that on the first night and didn't want to be travelling around London on our first night too far. So that is why we picked this Hotel. We got a great deal. We had a family room and a double room.We found it easy enough to get from Euston station via the tube to Hotel, advice to buy a tube pass either on the train or at Euston. We didn't have to pay for my son as he was only 10, he travelled free, if I recollect correctly he may been free at the hotel as part of the deal.Anyway the views were gorgeous from our very large family room, we could see the Millenium Dome and it was just lovely. The room was very spacious and beautifully decorated. Everything was lovely. We found the staff very helpful, with advice etc.Breakfast was everything you could require and set you up for the day, a drink and small snack was all that was required for lunch so no time being wasted in restaurants during the day not to mention money. We would then have a good evening meal. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially if you have something you want to see at the Millenium Dome. We actually walked down with the river Thames from there and to the Greenich tunnel under the Thames which we did not know even existed and then caught a boat trip from Greenich and got off at Tower Bridge. Not that centrally located but if you want central location for hotels you have to pay the price. Also if you get the tube 3 day pass you cannot travel on the underground during rush hour unless you pay the higher price. So if you intend to get anywhere via the tube and are centrally located you would still have to wait. Strangely enough the first morning we were there my daughter's Geography teacher who is married to her English teacher came in as they were staying there. Apparently they go to London every summer holidays and this was a new hotel for them but would definately use it again.	
Feb 3 2009 	Old and Shabby	This hotel was a let down - it was booked as part of a Superbreaks package for a Christmas present. Not ideally located for travel around the city of London - I expected the rest of the place to make up for this fact, however I was disappointed.Parking is available at the hotel but there is no reduction in rate for using it if you are staying in the hotel. At £21 it is pretty pricey, as it takes a £30+ taxi journey to get anywhere or a couple of changes of tube (not ideal for a lone woman)!!On check in the gentleman was nice enough although with his grasp of the English language should not have been put in a reception role.We were given a room that was adequate but very tired looking. The bed was atrocious, it squeaked loudly if you did so much as turn a page in your book. The walls were very thin and the cleaners were very noisy after 7am.The second night we ate in the hotel which was extremely average and the service on a level with McDonalds. The barman would circle the service charge on your bill if you bought so much as cola from the bar.In summary - do not book this hotel to stay in unless you absolutely have to. There are plenty of better located, better value places in London.	
Jan 30 2009 	Very good deal	I was very impressed with the hotel, actually we were trying to get something near Victoria, but the prices were either rocketing high, or the quality was a trash. Some places looked really disgusting. We decided for the International Hotel and paid only 60 Euros per night in a double room, there were no hidden charges or anything.Plus: closeness to Canary Wharf tube - about 15 minutes to the downtown. Price. Personal.Negatives: We couldn't open the window and we almost diyed during the night, it was so hot and we just coulnd't turn off the heating; personal in the bar was rather not helpful; don't even bother paying 2,5 for the welness, it's disgusting and reallly not worth it. I guess the UK people just don't know how to use a sauna and pool. A lot of sweaty people jumped to the pool right after they left sauna - no shower, so if you like swmming in sweat, you're welcome to purchase a ticket.Over all, I was very satisfied and definitely would stay there again.	
Jan 27 2009	Would NEVER go back!!	I stayed in this hotel with a group of friends whilst we were in london seeing a show, so therefore a number of rooms were booked. Hotel rooms were shabby and looked like a grandmas living room, although clean, one room had damp in the corner and another had what looked like blood spattered on the ceiling. We only had one meal in the hotel, we ate in the pizza place, service was poor, food was burnt, cold and some was partially under cooked, it took over half an hour to receive our drinks and when we complained, the waitress was extremely rude!! Hotel reception wasnt much help either. Overall, not a good experience!	
Jan 26 2009 	Good hotel in a great location	Having read reviews on this site shortly the day before I was due to arrive at the hotel, I experienced a little trepidation thinking about what I might be going to. I'm pleased to say I had no problems with this hotel whatsoever and had a very enjoyable stay.First impressions were that the hotel was in a good location. The hotel was a five minute walk from the Canary Wharf underground station (if you cut through some buildings) or a ten minute walk around the quay (if you're unfamiliar with the shortcuts). The lady who served me at check-in was polite and friendly and the whole process took less than two minutes. On entering the room, rather than a shabby-looking 1970's room as I'd been led to expect, I found a pleasant normal-looking hotel room. OK, so maybe some of the furniture, e.g. the wardrobe, was a little worn but the wardrobe isn't a major part of a hotel stay! The room was clean and warm and that's all that matters to me. The room also had air con and, as with others, I did find the room a little too warm at some points and turning down the air con temperature seemed to have little effect. Kicking off the quilt worked fine though. The only thing I would say is that the single beds are quite narrow. I work on a ship so I'm used to that but there were a few times when I had to grab onto the side of the bed to stop myself from rolling out of it!As for breakfast, I never had it and instead chose to go to the nearby Starbucks. I had one evening meal at the Pizzeria and admittedly I wasn't impressed, so much so that my sister and me ate at the Canary Wharf mall from that point on. Our pizza we had seemed to be a pre-bought thing with little flavour and our 200ml Coke (smaller than a can) cost £2!!! I didn't use the gym or swimming pool, although I had intended to, so can't comment on that.I found the staff at this hotel very polite and friendly, which I was also a little surprised about considering some of the earlier reviews. I only observed one incident where a staff member was rude to a guest during my whole stay (although most people would say one occurence is one too many).Overall though, I'd recommend this hotel. It's location, taking about fifteen to twenty minutes to get into central London by underground, really does make it great value for money, especially if you can get an online offer as we did (3 nights cost us £165).	
Jan 25 2009 	Decent enough	Stayed here for one night while I was attending a concert in the O2 Arena. Hotel was overall very nice and the room was pleasant and comfortable. Decent selection of eateries in the hotel. Friendly staff. Good location for getting to and from the O2 Arena - i used hotel organised taxi.	
Jan 25 2009 	Old Britannia	Both the positive and negative reviews have the essentials right; this hotel is: 1) Relatively cheap -- But only if you can get a real bargain. My corporate rate was 138 GBP, which was far too much. 2) Close to a tube station -- But that tube station (Canary Wharf) is in the middle of the docklands. So you're likely a long ride away from anything you came to see in London. 3) Desperately in need of a renovation. All -- every single piece -- of furniture was tired and chipped. The television stands on a very low podium (see photo). If two people sit on the bed to watch tv, the person on the right won't be able to see the tv over the legs of the person on the left. The desk chair has wide gaps between the slats (see photo) and is woefully uncomfortable. The bathroom was clean, but for a black stain on the bottom of the shower curtain and the fact that the soap dish looks like it has been used as an ash tray. The bathroom door lock was missing the cover and a screw (photos). As reported, the double bed is two single mattresses, which is disconcerting even when sleeping alone. Bottom line: Only if you pay next to nothing and even then only if you really want to stay in the Docklands.	
Jan 10 2009 	Nice hotel with good location	We stayed here for four nights in the end of December, and had two double rooms. The hotel was nice, and had a good location in Canary Wharf. Our rooms were large (for London standard), with a beautiful view to the wharf and the large buildings in Canary Wharf. The rooms was fine, but old. The breakfast buffet was OK. For me the hotel was more a 3 star, than a 4 star, but we enjoyed the hotel, and we will recommend it if you could find a good rate.	
Dec 31 2008 	great hotel	britannia international christmas 2008  we stayed in a double deluxe room which was spacious and clean. Fantastic views of the warf from the bedroom and also from the bars. Drinks were cheaper in the hotel than surrounding bars. Food plentifull and good.we got the 4 nights full board for £250, so was very pleased. Tube station miutes away. Shops,cafes and bars on the doorstep.	
Dec 24 2008 	Interesting international	My wife and I have just spent 4 nights at this hotel and enjoyed it. It was very clean.The room was large,had a huge bed ,two singles joined together. Nice bathroom. The room was bright with large windows, overlooking Canary wharf buildings and former dock water. We could see as far as the Dome across the other side of the Thames in the distance. It must be said that the Docklands Light railway ran fairly close by,and was rather noisy the first night until we got used to it ,then it didn't bother us so much. The main thing we had to get used to was that the room did get very warm,and no matter what the thermostat on the wall was turned down to,it still stayed around 25C. Still this did not spoil our stay. We did ask at reception for an electric fan and this was done immediately. Other requests were also dealt with speedily by polite and efficient staff,such as another iron ,as the one in the room was badly scratched somehow[ yes there was an ironing board and iron in the room] . There is an indoor pool but we didn't get a chance to use it.  We went to and from the West End every day as the DLR and Jubilee stations were only a short distance away.  Although not in the centre of London, we would recommend this hotel if you are not too sensitive to noise -- from outside not in.	
Dec 7 2008 	OK nothing more nothing less just OK	A tired hotel in need of rejuvenation! Just returned from a long weekend at the International ans it could be a great hotel. Its tired and in need of a ot of TLC. Rooms (furniture/bed/bathroom) appear to be 'so last century' but at least are reasonaby clean, just so tired looking. Had breakfast on 2 mornings and this is perhaps the greatest let-down for a 4-star hotel. very small area for a small/poor selecion (sausages are good though), below par for even a 2-star hotel. atfer 9 it gets too busy, not enough coffee/tea, tables noet cleaned (insufficient staff?). 5 stations on tv (cable/satellite...no....). Staff were friendly and kept a wild wedding party in check. Did have WiFi internet in the room. location is fine, 5 mins from Canary Wharf DLR/Jubilee line. Great Resaurant in mall (Le Plateau). Anyway not 4 start currently I'ld give it 2. Cos housecleaning tried to do our room at 815 on a sunday-morning!!!!	
Nov 25 2008	Princes Trust Dinner	firstly did not stay at this hotel thank god! but attended a dinner dance in aid of the Princes Trust . It was so cold in there i cannot tell you.It was a black tie do so all the ladies wore gowns or dresses with bear shoulders. my feet were like a block of ice they tried to turn the air con off but only made it worst.the food came out which was fine but cold straight away the only thing that made it was it was indian so it was hot and spicey . everywhere from the toilets upstairs or downstairs was freezing.In the foyer some chinese guests were sat there in gloves and coats most uncomfortable . have now got a chill and off work thats why i had to write this.also very very dated hotel would not have been happy staying there	
Nov 25 2008 	Pleasantly surprised	My wife and I have just returned from a weekend break in London (2 nights). We paid a total of £184 for two nights at the International, including return (Standard Class) train travel from Nottingham. Having seen some of the recent reviews of the hotel (after we had booked!) we were somewhat apprehensive about the accommodation. We were pleasantly surpised to find that the hotel met our needs. The room was a good size, clean and well-decorated. The aircon was a bit substandard but quite tolerable. The hotel is in an excellent location, with easy access to good eating facilities. We therefore didn't make any use of the hotel breakfast/dining/bar facilities. To underline our positive view of the place, we have booked again for early in the new year.	
Nov 21 2008 	This Is Not 4 Star!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11	Booked through Superbreak my experience at this hotel was awful. Even though the hotel was in the Docklands and a couple of tubes from the centre of town, I booked it because the pictures looked fab and the hotel was meant to be 4 star. I booked an Executive Room and was really looking forward to my theatre break. The show was great. The room was awful. The rooms are furnished it tired broken and chipped 1980s furniture, pictures broken, bathroom dirty, grids over waterjets were broken or had pubic hair in them. It was an awful experience. The staff were not very friendly and spoke poor English and the swimming pool is tiny compared with the website picture. This is not a four star hotel.	
Nov 17 2008 	Think carefully and get it cheap very cheap!	The tag line for this hotel is &quot;Striking Modern Hotel situated in popular Docklands area&quot;. Ok so it is in the heart of the docklands but striking and modern? The initial impression of the hotel as you approach is a large brown looming building that looks like some old 80's office block. The attractive night time shot displayed on this website is taken from across the water. I read somewhere that it was built about 15 years ago but to say that it is modern is a joke! Its very dated internally, think a 1970's poor attempt at oppulence! We booked through an internet website and got two double rooms for 65 pounds per room. I think this is the limit that you should be looking at spending. There are prices in the reception stating in excess of 200 pounds per night but to pay this you would have to be mad. You would then be very angry at yourself for the rest of the stay! It states that it is a 4* but more realistically think 2*. The reception itself is very dated - a glimpse at things to come! As we checked in I noticed that nearly everyone else appeared to have internet bookings. In terms of the staff they were friendly and the concierge was very helpful. The bedrooms themselves dont appear to have been updated since the hotel has been open. They were both reasonably clean however our duvet cover had a small rip in it that at any other establishment you would have expected it to have been repaired or replaced. For any 6 footers be careful of the low slung chandeliers that are precariously positioned just by the windows - beware mild concussion! The windows themselves were dirty on the outside and quite possibly like the interior hadnt been cleaned since the opening! There may have been a good view out there somewhere but it was hard to tell! As per many other reviews here the air con didnt seem to make any diffrence to the temperature of the room but in late October we werent at all bothered. You can hear the DLR late into the night and again early next morning but not so much that it is too intrusive. I suppose this is one of the negatives for having it conveniently on your doorstep. We did put our Do Not Disturb signs up as the maids seemed to be about from just after 7 but we werent bothered right up until we checked out just after 11. We used this hotel as a base to attend a gig at the O2 arena and as such it fitted purpose perfectly. With Canary Wharf five minutes walk away and the O2 just one subway stop away the positioning of the hotel was perfect. Prices in the Hotel bar are reasonable for London, just under 3 pounds for a bottle of beer.Compare it to the pub around the corner where we payed over 4 pounds for a pint of beer! We didnt pay for breakfast but instead went to the shopping centre at Canary Wharf and had a lovely meal for alot less money! In summary, I would use this hotel again if I was going to the O2 but only if I couldnt find one nearby for about the same money. If you book for less than 80 pounds its hard to argue with that price! Dont go expecting 4 stars it simply is not! If you're using it for a short stay then give it a go but get it cheap. You're never going to rave to friends about this hotel but hopefully you're going to be talking about the wonderful gig you saw at the O2 or your brief visit to merchant London.Hopefully this review was helpful to you, all the best!	
Nov 15 2008 	Oh Dear! Go anywhere else	10th-14th Nov 08. I booked my stay in this hotel via hotels.com and was given an average price of £174 per night. Pricey yes but a 4* in Canary Wharf must be good, right? Well, after pressing the confim button on the website i found that i'd been charged an extra £30 per night in &quot;hidden charges&quot; and there was a 100% cancelation fee. I needed a room for this week so dicided that although i should have cancelled the transaction via my credit card provider and found somewhere else it wasn't worth the effort. How wrong i was. Apon arrival at the hotel it was like stepping back to 1982, which is when i'd guess the last time this hotel was decorated. Flowery carpets, badly varnished wood, fake gold and brass everywhere. It's under a delusion that it's grand when in fact the only word that can describe it is Tacky. I booked a double but had to demand a different room when confronted with 3 single beds instead. Even the so called double i was moved to was 2 single beds pushed together. The hotel website offers wireless broadband throughout the hotel which is a lie as this only works in the lobby area and is slower than dial-up. The air conditioning throughout the hotel is awful and even after setting mine to its lowest temp and turning the fan up my room was never below 26. The Gym is advertised to open till 10 but closes at 9 everyday and again has air-conditioning problems so felt like running in a sauna. This seriously over priced for the lack of facitities and comfort. AVOID THIS HOTEL!	
Nov 14 2008 	THE WHORST HOTEL AT CANARY WHARF	Certainly the worst hotel I have stayed in!!!!!!1- they don't have mini bars for a 4* this is not normal2- the double bed is 2 single beds put together so you have to sleep on one side otherwise you feel the junction and it is very unconfortable3- The decoration is just very hold and the hotel desperatly need a renovation4- Breakfast: hot chocolate are done with only water and tables are very unclean5- Don't look under the sheets of the bed you will find spring box with wholes and very dirty....Let's try to find something good to say..... mmmmmm.... I can't find anything... tube station is not too far....The worst hotel in Canary Wharf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT STAY THERE	
Nov 6 2008 	Comfortable clean hotel.	Booked a 3 day 2 night London Spectacular with National Holidays travelling from Ashton-Under-Lyne. Would recommend this trip to all ages wishing to visit London. Clean coach with a friendly driver. We were dropped off at good locations in London. The hotel we stayed in was the International Britannia situated in the Docklands area of London. The hotel is well situated for underground and docklands light railway also large shopping area. The hotel was very clean the rooms warm well furnished and spotless. We were on the 9th floor overlooking the front of the hotel and could see the london eye in the distance and other sites. If you stayed in a room facing the rear of the hotel overlooking the water you did experience noise from the docklands light railway. Tip ask for a room overlooking FRONT of hotel. We arrived on 31st Oct and it was bitterly cold weather. The hotel bar area and resturant were cold and a lot of people were sat in coats. The bedrooms very warm ind. temp controlled. We were on bed breakfast and evening meal and these were very good all the food was tasty and hot. I was not really sure what to expect after reading other reviews but I must say we had an enjoyable stay at this hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it.	
Nov 2 2008 	Don't Stay Here!!!	Well my new husband and i decided to get away for a few days as a mini honeymoon and stated this when we booked, therefore expected to get some kind of special offer or a free fruit basket but nothing. I got asked if i wanted to pay for upgrades all the while i was checking in. We proceeded to our room on the 10th floor after driving for 6 and a half hours(obviously knackered) and got a nice surprise- our door wouldnt open. So we had to go back to reception and made to feel like we were stupid because they kept asking if we had used the key card right!!! They gave us a new key and same happened so thinking we were just not doing it right sent somebody up with us.They said they would get it fixed before we got back from looking around london. Few hours later we were told it was fixed but no. We were told it was a problem with the door and we would be moved rooms but that never happened.We had to get somebody to let us in our room the 2 days we stayed which was annoying.The bed was so uncomfortable and the pillows-what pillows?? They were so flat it was unbelievable so had to use the spares aswel as those!The staff were so unhelpful, they didn't smile once throughout our stay and when we ordered room service they sighed all the way through our order and just frankly couldn't be bothered. We asked for french fries with a burger and an extra portion so we received burger and crisps! And no extra fries, we were too tired to argue though as walking around london on and off tubes does tire you out and im 5 months pregnant! When we checked out we didnt even get a goodbye! And £42 for parking is ridiculous! How this hotel is still open is beyond me! Never staying again!	
Oct 17 2008 	Not good	Stayed at this hotel about 3 years ago and would have recommended it then.Don't know what has happened since, but I won't be staying again, most other reviews have already said it all- hard beds, poor breakfast, in general need of an overhall. If you stay have your breakfast early otherwise the self service area gets over crowded. They do not have feedback forms- which says something to me.The only plus is that it is within Docklands- which may suit if visiting the commercial centre.	
Oct 17 2008 	Name isn't enough	I stayed 4 nights at the Britannia near Canary Worth for business and will definitely never go back.The decor, furniture and facilities were really appalling for the hotel standard: No safe, no minibar, no alarm clock, no wi-fi, loss of water pressure, poor AC (28C in room). All of this is OK for simple leisure hotels/B&amp;Bs, but the hotel aims at the business market and you pay for it (&gt;120GBP).But the final straw came with the bill: I was charged for a breakfast I never took (£14), paid £4 for a soft drink at the bar and... £50 for a 12min-phone call (to Europe). rip-off!	
Oct 6 2008 	Dated decor and uncomfortable bed but not terrible.	We stayed here as part of a competition prize for two nights during the week, and were upgraded to a jacuzzi room. The room itself was large and comfortable with good furnishings and a shared balcony as well as the well featured bathroom with spa bath. The room, (actually on the 12th floor) was actually accessed via a small private staircase from the 11th floor, which may be an issue for those with mobility difficulties but provides an additional measure of privacy and isolation from the main corridor, there was a connecting door to an adjoining room but this was securely locked and presumably can be unlocked to create a larger suite of the two rooms.The décor throughout was in good condition, but outdated - a rather chintz combination of patterns on the wallpaper and carpets in all areas, although the corridors showed some signs of refurbishment.Breakfast was served in the restaurant, and was hot, fresh plentiful and had a good range available.'Spindles', the health club within the hotel is available to guests for an additional charge, was clean and seemed well run, the pool was small but adequate and the spa, steam room &amp; sauna were all fine.The hotel advertises WiFi availability in public areas, and this is available and provides a fast and reliable service in the bars and lounges, and was popular with several users at most times of the day. There is a signal available in the rooms on the upper floors, but we were unable to use this despite the computer being able to connect.Unfortunately, there were elements that detracted from the stay - the bed was a double as advertised (rather than the 'two singles zipped together' mentioned by other reviewers), but was uncomfortable and could be noisy leading to a poor night of sleep. The air condition was also not functioning, although the in room fan was working proving an element of air circulation if not cooling. Overnight the balcony door could be opened for additional cooling, but the Docklands Light Railway runs past the front of the hotel and starts operating sometime before 6am and is noisy.The spa bath in the room worked well, and had an integrated shower, which was low on power but adequate to clean oneself.The staff were friendly, helpful and professional at all times, with a competent concierge service available as well. The hotel has good transport links and is a very short walk from both DLR and London Underground stations providing rapid links into the centre of London and the rest of the Docklands area. The hotel does have a car park, but this also has an additional charge.	
Sep 20 2008 	Poor Quality	I stayed here one night with a group of colleagues and this hotel really needs to go back to the Basics. Check in staff didn't tell me breakfast times or where the restaurant was. The receptionist also seemed confused about the booking. Worse, however, was to follow.Although my room was a bit faded, the main problem was the lack of air conditioning. Despite this being September in London, the temperature in my room was 26.5C. Apparently, the air conditioning in this hotel has not worked for some time! All I could do was to get the window open and ask for a fan, which turned out to be quite small. Once the windows are open in this hotel, traffic noise is loud, especially from the Docks Railway.Other complaints - my bed was hard and uncomfortable and the buffet evening meal meant cold gammon and cool vegetables. At breakfast, one of my colleagues found a long black hair in the mushrooms. Our lunch that day was so poor, I could only eat some salad and a roll.If you don't have to stay here, look for an alternative.	
Aug 27 2008 	me and my husband never come back to this hotel again	The only thing I and my husband liked about this hotel it was just the view from on our room but the room quality, service, staff attitude, and the food was poor and the room it wasnt modern at all. the money we had to pay for the room was expensive for what it is, we think this hotel should be 2 star not 4 star .	
Aug 27 2008 	Not so good....	In common with most of the other reviews I was disappointed with the overall condition of the rooms. Poorly appointed bathrooms, terrible beds, non functioning aircon and a lack of interest by the reception staff.And the noise....to get anywhere near cool (even in this bad summer) I had to force the window open and then it's too noisy to sleep. Your choice - you can be boiled alive all night or kept awake by the general city din.Buffet was OK and actually quite good value and the bar is good.Breakfast is standard help yourself fare, OK but nothing special. There are better budget hotels in the area.	
Aug 22 2008 	AVOID - WORST STAY OF MY LIFE!!!	My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights and were absolutely shocked at the condition of the hotel, attitude of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms. Our room had nightstands with broken handles, the TV stand was broken. Upon getting into bed we found hairs in the bed, I don't think they clean the rooms much. We also had asked for a 6am wake up call as we had an appointment set up for the following morning which we never got. The night before we departed we inquired about the &quot;flat-fee&quot; taxi to heathrow, which we were told needed to be booked before 11pm. Upon returning from dinner (about 9pm) we went to the front desk and booked the taxi for 8am, and a wake up call (which worked this time). The following morning upon going down to the lobby the door man came over to us and told us our taxi was ready and took our bags and put them into the car. Upon arrival at the airport we were told that this cab was NOT a flat fee taxi, and cost significantly more that the flat fee. I have since called the hotel to understand what happened and they have basically said that I did not book the taxi. The people over the phone made snide remarks that I must not stay in alot of hotels and flat out told me that it was my error, a simple apology would have sufficed. I found this extremely frustrating. As it happens I stay at alot of hotels on business, but I have never stayed at a hotel quite this bad. I have no idea as to how they claim to have 4 stars, I have stayed at better 2-star establishments.	
Aug 6 2008 	Okay for Business Travellers	Stayed at the International for 2 nights on business in Docklands. August 2008.Check in fast and welcoming. Staff friendlyRooms are comfortable and generally clean, but like other reviewers the rooms would benefit from a little TLC to spruce them up. Nevertheless all the requirements I needed were provided, trouser press, tea/coffee making, tv etc.Would have liked breakfast included at £105 per night. So didn't try breakfast at £13.50 but found a great deli in Harbour Exchange Square ( Bacon sandwich &amp; coffee £2.90!) Overall for the business traveller needing a reasonable base in Docklands the International would be satisfactory.	
Aug 5 2008	Loved this Hotel	After reading the reviews on this hotel I was a bit worried about what to expect, but after staying there 1st &amp; 2nd August 08, I came to the conclusion that the reviewers must have had an exceptionally bad experience. I only paid £99 per person which included breakfast and transport to and from the South coast. The room was quite large with a fantastic view of canary wharf and the O2 Dome (8th Floor), it was clean and had everything that you could need for a short break. The air conditioning worked fine, we kept it on during the day which made the room nice and cool and turned it off at night. After going round the Canary Wharf museum on the first afternoon we decided to eat in the hotel and used the buffet/carvery which we thought was £15.00. The starters included soup, smoked salmon, mussels, smoked fish, ham, cheese and a load of salad and bread rolls, the main was carved beef, chicken in BBQ sauce and salmon in a cream sauce with many veg and the roast potatoes were actually crispy. The sweets were plentiful and then we had a nice plate of cheese and biscuits. When I went to pay it was only £12.50 which was very good for a 4* hotel in London. I dont think I would have it every night but for what it was it was very good. The buffet breakfast the next morning was also very good with most things you would expect from a hotel breakfast, in ample quantity and quality. All the staff were very friendly and helpful at all times and the bar had a happy hour between 7-8 o'clock.The tube was about 5 mins walk but we used the river boat hopper which was about 8mins walk and took you into central London, we returned on the 12.40 early on the Sunday morning after going to a show. From my experience I would without doubt stay here again. We were a party of 4, 2 being in mid 40's and 2 being pensioners.	
Aug 2 2008 	Don't stay here	Ok hotel if it wasn't for the terrible beds. All the mattresses are lumpy, hard and worn out. My husband and I spent four sleepless nights here. We asked to upgrade and pay for it, but they said all the rooms have the same beds, even the suites. So do your back a favour and don't stay here!	
Jul 25 2008 	Terrible Hotel	Shabby room, shabby service, shabby food!!! only thing going for it was the location, we shall never be staying there again and it wasn't that cheap!!!Claire	
Jul 12 2008 	Poor value for money	A rubbish hotel. Living off its location close to the heart of Canary wharf. It mops up business travellers like me without trying too hard.I'm guessing the decor was installed during the heyday of the rapid rise of the area, when tacky faux gold plated everything would have been considered opulent. The flock wall paper and the vomit inducing carpets look like they have been dreamt up during one of Oscar Wildes more camp moments.The room was shabby.The staff were, however, polite and efficient.I paid GBP239 for a basic double room. A thoroughly ridiculous price for a poor hotel.	
Jul 10 2008 	Great hotel	The hotel was excellent. I went there in July 2005 with my sister. It was not our option, but we were removed because our original hotel was close to the subway station blowed in a terrorist attack. The hotel received us perfectly. Very efficient check-in and check-out. The only problems were: a) if we wanted to make a phone call we should leave a guarantee in the amount of GBP 750, as well to use the safe box; b) the continental breakfast, although very clean, had a bad taste: you should choose the british breakfast to eat better. The hotel is far from center but half a mile from a huge commercial center and from train/subway stations. Generally, is an excellent choice.	
Jun 29 2008 	Truly awful hotel	This is one of the worst hotels I have ever had the misfortune to stay in.It is only about 15 years old but it is in terrible condition.The air conditioning in the first room I was offered did not work; after speaking with the manager I was offered an upgrade to a slightly cooler room. However, chatting to the concierge I found out that the air conditioning in the hotel just cannot cope when it is busy. Top tip: get a room with an easterly view so that you don't get the sun heating up the room in the evening.The bed had a mattress that was ruined, and the cover was stained. Overall the room was not very clean and it was a depressing place to spend any time in.This hotel is cheap but other budget hotels offer a far superior product.	
Jun 17 2008 	Nice hotel comfortable beds in ok location	Hotel is nice, clean and has lovely views of Canary Wharf. If you are visiting London from outside UK, I wouldn't reccommend it as you will have to find local tube links and at night this could be difficult. It is niced to stay near Christmas as it is close to the Canary Wharf Ice Rink.Hotel itself is comfort and plesant. I wouldn't pay more than £80 a night though, as you can get better hotels in the Centre of the West End.	
Jun 13 2008 	Great Location for O2 Arena	Looking for hotel as was attending an event at the O2 Arena and found the Britannia International Hotel on hotelstayuk.com. The rate was highly competitive, the location was great and it comes highly recommended!Will book again.	
May 29 2008 	would recommend for weekend break...	i stayed in this hotel for a weekend and found it lovely, Great tube network from city centre with 2 tube within 4 mins walk of hotel..Room had balcony with great views of river and Millenium Dome..The only drawbacks were that there is nothing around the hotel, it is in an office district, but over the bridge into the Canary Wharf you will find lots of restaurants and shops, The only bar nearby is the hotel bar itself which is very basic, but the seating is comfortable with big sofas overlooking the river, As I was travelling alone it was nice to go down in evening and feel comfortable sitting in the bar on a sofa reading..The Restaurants aren't great in hotel... breakfast finishes early enough, and the buffet dinner at night wasn't great for the money paid, The italian restaurant was a a bit poor with presentation,On a positive note this hotel is clean spacious friendly and only 10 mins from city centre..I would stay again and would recommend it as a base to anyone who wants to go into city for day and come back and chill at night.once you not looking for anything wild it is a good clean safe base in London	
May 23 2008 	Do not stay here	Hotel is very dated and needs an overhaul. A/C did not work in our room, and we were upgraded to a very slightly larger room where the A?C also didn't work.Decor is stripey wallpaper and garish carpets. In-room hairdryer rubbish. Shower was falling off the bracket, and put out around a dribble a week.Staff did not appear to care at all, apart from the time where they were taking your money.Bar had no snacks/crisps at all, which is a minor issue - but as the hotel is handy for the O2 arena, after a concert a beer and some snacks are a good thing.The next morning the housekeeping lady knocked on our room door four times between 7:15am and 9:00am looking to get in to clean. The housekeeping and room service trolleys were parked outside our room and the noise was awful.I would never, ever stay here again, and certainly would not recommend it to anyoane. Needs gutted, re-furbed and started again.	
May 17 2008 	Excellent	Excellent. Booked online and got a fantastic deal, upgraded to an executive room on arrival for a very reasonable fee.Fantastic views, fantastic service.Shame paying guests have to pay for the car park when there's virtually no street parking in the local area.	
May 13 2008 	Location is pretty well all this has	Lobby is ok and was quiet when I checked in mid afternoon for 3 nights. I thought I had upgraded to an executive double but the bed was dreadful - springs popped every time you moved and poked into you, my husband's feet were several inches over the end of the bed. The furniture was dated and looked in dire need of a refurb. This hotel was on lastminute.com as a 4 star. The breakfast was like a poor canteen standard. I asked for a river view and got a great one on 9th floor but the DLR was very noisy - the only thing that would ever take me back is the great location for Canary Wharf Jubilee line and DLR. We only sampled breakfast once and then found alternatives along the banks of the river - much more pleasant!	
Apr 23 2008 	Okay but nothing special	Stayed on business for two nights, I have been here before and knew of places to go nearby for food and drink etc and was happy to stay again. The reception area of the hotel is very nice, comfortable and clean. The room (a standard double) was fine, but the air con seemed to be stuck and forced out hot air, making the first nights stay hot and uncomfortable. I reported this to the reception where they advised me that they were aware of the problem and offered to open the window for fresh air. This cooled the room down but then you get the problem of the noise from Docklands Light Railway trains from about 5:30. Also if reception were aware of the problem, why had it not been fixed?Breakfast was pretty standard fare, cooked or continental buffet and served its purpose without being great.There are plus points for the hotel, car parking is £15 per night, it is only 5 mins walk from the Jubiliee Line and DLR to get you into central London. There is a selection of shops bars etc on Canary Wharf, 5 mins walk, and driving to the hotel is fairly stress free and outside of the London congestion charge.It is fine for a couple of nights, however don't go expecting fantastic luxury or fine dining.	
Apr 4 2008	It was great - can't believe it's the same place described in the other reviews	I returned from here yesterday after a business trip. I didn't choose the hotel and when I read the reviews beforehand, I was horrified and expected it to be awful and that I would probably need to move hotels. I couldn't have been more wrong. Maybe I was just lucky and got a decent room (634)?So... a balanced review of my stay. Check-in was swift (although my colleagues reported that the front desk was slow and there was some confusion about their booking) and hassle-free. The lobby of the hotel is pretty grand - chandeliers, marble tables, vases and stuff, with a bar with views over the water.The room was above average size. Very clean, comfortable. It was not decorated in a modern style, but it was definitely not dirty or shabby or faded. The bathroom was tiled/marble effect; again very clean and a reasonable size. The bed was 2 single beds pushed together, although I slept across both of them and didn't have a problem with the divide (which I have done in other places where beds have been pushed together). The room was hot, very hot and the windows were non-opening. The aircon didn't seem responsive, although, to be fair, I didn't try querying this with any members of staff. I hate hot rooms and can't generally sleep in one, but it did seem to calm down at night and I was out like a light, so not the problem I expected it to be. My room faced towards the dome and over the DLR tracks. I could hear the trains going past, but they weren't particularly intrusive, they ran less frequently during the night, and they certainly didn't keep me awake (and I'm not a good sleeper). Breakfast (if you choose that option) is served overlooking the water. It is a buffet which was not the most extensive I've come across but certainly more than adequate. Tea, coffee, cereals, breads, cold meats, cheeses, juices, fruit, and a selection of cooked items. I didn't have any of the cooked items but they looked nicely cooked and did tempt me. Check-out was again quick and easy, as was paying for parking.The hotel is well located. 5 minutes' walk gets you to Canary Wharf station, which connects with the wider London transport network via the Jubilee Line and the DLR. Despite being fairly central and in a busy area, it was quiet during the night.I went expecting bad, bad things and was more than pleasantly surprised. If I had paid with my own money for it and gone for pleasure rather than business I would also have been more than happy with it. So I don't know if mine was just an isolated happy experience, but I would like to give some comfort that my time there did not reflect the critical reviews on here. Hope that helps!	
Mar 14 2008	It's Okay	The room is a little scary with too many haunting pictures hung on the wall. The shower is the problem that I have to spend several minutes adjusting to the right temperature. The A/C vent sometimes makes some noise. No fridge in our room tho.The goods are the location and given the room is clean I would give it 2 stars, otherwise 1 star for its price.	
Mar 3 2008 	Go for a YMCA	I stayed here on a business trip for 5 days after not being able to get my usual hotel. The business travel department told me that there had been may complaints and problems about this hotel. I can hear you saying well why did you stay there ??? Well foolishly I thought that it cant be that bad... its by Canary Wharf so it must be half decent. How wrong I was.Firstly I had problems checking in because the concept of charge everything back to my company account was alien to them. I was then spoken to like a 2 year old as they explained to me how much I was allowed to spend each night - all of which I found quite rude. I was forced to discuss my room charging everytime I ordered something which got right on my .... When I eventually got upstairs, all I wanted to do was sleep. I walked into the room and it was like walking into a Blackpool B&amp;B. The gaudy and tired interior was depressing as was the TV. Four channels, 2 of which where the same one and channel 5 was stuck on a frozen picture for 2 days.... well I didnt miss much when it did come back on anyway.The bed was like sleeping on a park bench. The springs where completely gone on both of the single beds which had been pushed together. I was forced to sleep on the top of the bed, in the hope that the polyester quilt would soften the bed but it just made my hair go static.I ordered breakfast which I had read in another review was a complete rip off... and I agree. It again was back to the B&amp;B breakfast of a tiny glass of orange juice, 2 pieces of toast and a fudge (was supposed to be fruit) yoghurt, all for the grand price of £13.50. Nice one. The meals in general where bad, microwave rice, rock hard garlic bread, dirty looking chicken ... £3.00 for just over half a pint of diet coke.The only thing that kept me sane in the hotel was the pool. Its quite small - 4 strokes and youre there.... but it was one way of staying out of the room. Please if you are reading this - go and stay somewhere else... someone needs to shut this hotel down, do it up and start again. Its old and dirty and just lacks the basics which you can get in a newer cheaper hotel. Dont waste your money.	
Feb 26 2008 	Nice hotel at a reasonable price	After reading the trip advisor articles, my expectations were low but l found this hotel to be very pleasant. l would rate it a 3.5star. The rooms had an antique style decoration which l like &amp; the location is excellent for getting to and from central London without paying London prices. Canary Wharf is a new part of London but peaceful &amp; safe from the intense crowds. l particularly thought the gym was the best l had seen in a hotel. The free weights were a little old but the running equipment, pool, spa &amp; layout of the gym was big and refreshing. The staff there were lovely &amp; chatty.l only ordered a hote chocolate &amp; dessert from room service but loved that the hot chocolate came in a pot and was actually hot when it arrived to my room. l didn't have breakfast there as it was nicer to walk to Canary Wharf Square.My main negative was the shower in my room. l could not get the temperature right &amp; the water pressure was weak. However, the showers in the gym downstairs were very good.	
Feb 24 2008 	Horrid!	The Britannia in canary wharf is seriously in need of a decoration it feels like it was last decorated in 1950, my room was awful and came with strong sewage smells. Need I say more...	
Feb 13 2008 	Still hideous	I last had the misfortune to stay at the Britannia almost 18 months ago and thought (naively perhaps) that the varied and numerous problems at the hotel would have been addressed. How wrong I was.Problems started at check in when the gentleman manning reception could not work out the prepaid booking I had made to avoid the usual lengthy check in and check out. Even this was beyond him and 15 minutes later he had to call in his manager to sort the problem out.On the plus side the rooms are clean. On the downside they are in need of redecoration with old fittings, peeling wallpaper and worn carpets. The rooms are also rather old fashioned with plenty of dark wood and a wonderfully kitch chandelier. Presumably this was the height of decorative opulence in the early 1980's but it's now more reminiscent of a Blackpool B&amp;B that's trying too hard.The bed was akin to sleeping on cobblestones covered with a thin layer of cloth. The double bed was actually made up of two mattresses so there was the additional pain of a hard ridge running through the middle of the bed. God forbid I should actually try to roll over during the night without running the risk of breaking my spine. Added to this utter misery was my misfortune at being put in a room overlooking the water. I understand these rooms command a premium although I'm not entirely sure how a view of the Docklands Light Railway and a building site is worth the extra cash. The DLR runs from early in the morning until late at night and is very, very noisy. The sound proofing in general is non-existent. At one point I thought I was on the set of Crossroads as my headboard wobbled when the room next door closed their door. I could also hear every grunt, groan and splash of my neighbour's early morning bowel movement.Even though my stay was at my company's expense, I refused to pay the absolutely extortionate £13.50 for breakfast. Doing so would only encourage the hotel, especially as their profit margin doesn't seem to be going into the hotel itself.Please don't make the mistake I did. My positive outlook and willingness to forgive was horribly abused by the Britannia International. Frankly, I feel violated. I've stayed in more comfortable one man tents. Even though the location is so convenient for Canary Wharf, there are DLR stops within a couple of minutes walk from Ibis, Novotel and Marriot hotels. I wouldn't hesitate to choose these over the Britannia.	
Feb 4 2008 	Not recommended	Upon checking in, they offered to upsell us to a more expensive room with complimentary breakfast (which is a rip off at 13.50GBP). I went for it, and we found ourselves on the 11th floor in a room which, once you enter the room you must climb a spiral staircase to get to the actual room. The room was huge by London standards and had a balcony. Unfortunately, the first day while lying in bed getting over some jet lag, I heard some guy yelling on the phone, presumably from a nearby room, using obscene language. It went on for some time. Also, we had the smell of greasy cooking in our room (on the 11th floor!) in the morning. The breakfast was fair, but not great. The front desk was unable to even provide me with antacid when we returned in the evening, and they told us there was no store open at that hour either. In the States, even basic hotels can at least sell you a roll of antacid. We would not stay in this hotel again, though we liked the area.If you use a calling card (the only reasonable way to make international calls) dial '9' for an outside line, not the code listed on the card by the phone. If you dial '9', you won't be charged for the toll-free call; otherwise it's 2 quid.	
Jan 25 2008 	NEVER AGAIN--Would NEVER recommend	We stayed for 6 nights a few weeks ago at this hotel. The only reason we stayed was because the hotel where we were could not accomdate all of our parties and this was in the budget of the division paying our expenses. We were on a business trip and the funds were coming out of the global budget.Trust me---none of our senior management would stay in this hotel voluntarily.Our problems started with reception. The girl checking us in had terrible communication skills and it took FOREVER. Our rate was different that what our agency was quoted, by that time we were all tired and just wanted to rest up before dinner.It looks like it may have been a nice hotel in it's day, but it needs a serious refurbishing and overhaul. Everything is old, worn, saggy, peeling wallpaper, etc. It is overly decorated with heavy, ornate, dusty fixtures, wallpaper, threadbare carpet. The hallways are dark, etc.The only plus was the size of the room and bathroom, which were both generous. Oh, one other plus was it's location to our office, which was nice, in walking distance.No alarm clocks, bed was two twins pushed together with sagging mattress. VERY noisy at night, loud noises coming from the room on either side of me (bathroom pipes, etc.).We finally escaped to the Hilton Canary Wharf, which was a breath of fresh air!!!! Beautiful hotel.Seriously, for 140 pounds a night the hotel should be ashamed of itself---spend some of that on updating!!!	
Jan 4 2008 	Musty! No Other Word For It!	well we booked this on expedia, saw the reviews but as it was last minute thought that we would risk it, but i have to say that all the reviews were spot on, this place is very old and very musty. My first impressions from the outside was that it looked quite nice, but inside completely different story! Upon checking in we were amazed at the amount of brass and ugly statues everywhere, reminded me of somewhere which would have been grand thirty years ago but is now passed its sell by date.We were told that our booking could not be found on their system and the guy that was dealing with us looked and sounded like he didnt want to be there.Room was very old in decor- great view of the 02 dome and canary wharf and that is about it! Lighting in the hallway came on as you walked, felt like I was staying at the shining hotel. Dont stay here if you can help it. Shame because canary wharf is a really nice area which nice shops locally and good acesss to jubillee line to central london.	
Dec 12 2007 	Looks like good value but it's not	A smart-looking 4-star fifteen minutes from central London at half the rates of others? Don't be misled: the rates are soft here for a reason.The location's OK if you're doing business in Docklands (and you work for a firm with a tight travel policy) but otherwise you wouldn't want to be here. None of the traditional sights of London are within walking distance, the taxi ride is long and the tube crammed with commuters most of the day.The ironic thing is that half the money in England is within a mile of this place, sited as it is in the heart of London's new business centre. With a decent product, this hotel could charge whatever it wanted. Yet the Britannia suffers badly from under-investment. The bathrooms and the bedrooms are the only old-fashioned things left in Docklands and the whole place is looking a bit 1990s.Some of the investment needn't be huge: how much would it cost to clean the lifts of graffiti, or to replace the bulbs in them so they're not so gloomy?There are several better hotels in Docklands and many more appealing four-stars in London. I'd stay elsewhere, even if it meant paying more.	
Nov 26 2007 	Fine for a overnight stay following a concert but not for a holiday!	We booked this hotel as we were going to a concert at the O2 and wanted a hotel nearer the O2 rather than the middle of London.We weren't disappointed with the location. The hotel is one stop away from the O2 and was in walking distance of both Canary Wharf (Jubilee Line) and South Quay (DLR).Our room overlooked Canary Wharf and the water and was very quiet as well as being very picturesque at night.As it was a very late booking when we arrived we found out that the people we booked with hadn't notified the hotel! The man serving us at reception was extremely helpful and even upgraded the two rooms we had booked and moved them so they were adjoining as he had kept us waiting (it wasn't a very long wait by the way)!Our friends made use of one of the many comfy sofas in the reception area whilst they were waiting for us to check in.He was absolutely fantastic and I wish I'd made a note of his name so I could write to the management praising him.As we arrived there just before the concert doors opened we didn't have time to eat there, visit the bar or use the pool so I can't comment about them.Our rooms were fine size wise, however they were decorated and furnished in a very old fashioned style using faux antiques...why?? The hotel is in the middle of a very modern part of London why didn't they not make the interior modern??Our beds were comfy (we had room 710) and I had a perfect nights sleep and the room was very clean and tidy. Even though there was only 1 pillow on each bed, as usual, there were extra ones in the wardrobe.The heating in our room worked very well and it was plenty warm enough for us when we returned from the concert.The bathroom, however, was a let down though. It was clean and the shower and bath functioned very well as did the hot water, but there were some craked wall tiles near the floor opposite the toilet and it just all felt a bit old and in need of replacement.We then left the next morning without having breakfast as we didn't want to pay £13.50 each for it!We paid £99 for each room which I didn't think was too bad for a room in London at very short notice, but I would have been dissatisfied with the hotel had I paid more.The Britannia International did exactly what we wanted it to which was somewhere to shower and put our heads down for the night.I would book this hotel if you want somewhere to stay after a concert at the O2 it's perfect, but if you're going on holiday to London then I really would stay somewhere else as it's neither in a tourist area or a hotel you would want to spend a lot of time in.	
Nov 18 2007 	One night enough	I stayed at the International 6 years ago and due to the location booked again for a weekend break recently. With just one stop to the O2 it is perfect for a concert break. However, I had expected the decor to have changed as it was dated when I last visisted! The beds are uncomfortable with springs coming through, the walls are paper thin and even the card entry system is giving up (it took us 3 card changes and a porter forcing the door open to get into the room - not what you want just after checking in).The bar is convenient and reasonably priced although the beer was flat and wine choice poor.	
Nov 10 2007 	tired	I have to stay at this hotel regularly as the company book it. If I was paying I'd stay else where. It is a clean enough hotel but it is very tired and worn at the edges. The staff are helpfull enough. Food wise Jennys carvery is a good deal with a nice selection.If you can get it for under £100 then it is a good deal but the advertised price is too high. And the towels smell of vinegar and the TVs have fuzzy pictures and about 6 channels.Over all fine for a night or 2 if on business.	
Nov 8 2007 	Not bad really	I stay at the Brit a couple of times a month. The hotel itself must of been around for a while and the interior is a little old school. The staff are very helpful, the rooms are very nice, always clean and nicely made up. Room service is good, and the bar is very handy, it also has a gym, never used it myself. On the whole a good hotel for a couple of nights in london, handy for the jubilee line and the DLR, your also right on the doorstep of canada square and lots of bars and restaurants. Always ask for a room above the 8th floor if you want reliable internet access, always ask for a room facing the road if you don't want to be kept awake by the DLR, or woken up by the building site next door.	
Nov 4 2007 	good base for what we need	After reading the reviews on this website I was dreading staying here. It was my 40th Birthday combined with going to watch man utd play arsenal on the sat. Stayed for two nights, didnt have any problems with rude staff everyone was polite. Food was ok we eat in the pizza place and the meal was fine. The bar was a bit expensive but it is london. The best thing about hotel was location. Right next to Canary Wharf with shops bars restaurants all on your doorstep. We got a all day tube pass and went all over london it was excellent.. On the saturday night we went up to the west end to see a show and getting back after was just as easy think last tube was 12.15 back to canary wharf but there are night buses. Felt really safe in canary wharf as they have 24 hour security. The hotel room was fine, bit of a problem with lack of hot water but this was sorted straight away, Rooms are a bit dated but we only slept in ours. beds were comfy, dont let reviews of this hotel put you off, if you dont want to be in central london but still want bars and restaurants this hotel is a great find, will use it again if we go to concerts at O2	
Oct 28 2007 	Location is top but overall average	My second visit to Britannia International hotel, this time a spur-of-the-moment thing.Didn't think they had parking, so was intending to park on Byng Street (just a 30 sec walk away with no restriction parking over the weekend). But they do have limited underground parking, £15 overnight, which I can somewhat except for the city, except that expires at 9am after which its 3 quid an hour. Check-in no problem. Like other reviewers, I too had problem with the room card key, and other guests too who resorted to calling a staff member for help. My first visit I was fortunate to get the river / Canary Whalf view, which is an extremely attractive feature of this hotel, but disappointingly this time we were facing the street side. Not sure if you can, but I'd certainly recommend asking for the river view. Room has a nice warming feeling with all the usual facilities, but the TV channels were limited - just Ch1-5, Sky News, and something else.There is free wireless Internet, which is a bonus if you've brought your own wireless device.Choice of three restaurants, nice lounge area with nice settees overlooking the river. There is leisure facilities on-site, but I didn't use or look at them.Rather disappointing experience at breakfast next morning. I was Room Only and wanted to pay for breakfast as an extra. Went down to the main breakfast restaurant, was asked if I wanted Continental or Full English. Opted for a Continental, so was redirected to the restaurant next door. In there was basically two choice of cereals - Rice Crispies and Corn Flakes, a basket of bread, and Tea/Coffee. All the available tables had no cups on them, so couldn't get a Tea/Coffee. Waiters were wandering around not actually helping. So thought sod this, went back next door to upgrade to Full English and explain the problem. Was told I could have my Continental in this room alongside the Full English (why I couldn't in the first place, I don't know). Then had the full selection of Continental items that you'd expect and more! So feel they tried to fob me off with a cheap lousy service.What I love about this hotel:- Location. Perfect for exploring Canary Whalf area. DLR station just down the road. Safe feeling area.- The view, if you can get it.- The free Internet access gets my vote.- The free papers, magazines, and journals scattered around.What I hate about this hotel:- Nothing really! One or two disappointments, but nothing to complain about.	
Oct 25 2007 	Would never have stayed here on my own money	I stayed at this hotel in Sep 07 as it was a highly convenient location for work at Canary Wharf. At £160 a night for a double room it's very poor value for money though.Bad: The bed was not comfortable. Spongey mattress, flat pillows. LOUD LOUD LOUD. I've been here before and got a room facing the DLR which groaned and creaked loudly into the night and early in the morning. Impossible to ignore. This time I asked for a quiet room, and got one facing away from the DLR, however, the noise of the high volume air-conditioning on the roof of the building below was really really loud. I mean, I checked about 6 times that the window wasnt open. Traffic noise also came through strongly. I'd brought some earplugs in case, but they werent up to it. Telly only had about 5 channels and wasnt tuned in or setup well. There was no safe in the room. Found this staggering. Valuables (eg. passports) would have to be stored at reception, and as other people have noted, the staff down there arent exactly snappy so it'd be quite a pain to have to check-in your stuff with them all the time. Keycard for the door only worked in 1 of 15 swipes. I went down and got a new one, and it was just as bad. Check-in seemed to take an eternity, with several going into the backroom. While I was checking in, another couple of gentleman also seemed to be having difficulties because their rooms had been reserved through work, and the staff couldnt seem to find the reservation.Good: The curtains were black-out so at least it was dark and loud. The room was clean, if a little worn. Facilities like ironing, trouser press and so on present. Convenient for Canada Square/Canary Wharf, but its actually a longer walk than you think because you have to walk quite a way to get to a bridge. Staff didnt seem rude, as other people have said, but were a bit slow/inefficient.As the room was paid for I was fine, but I couldnt stay there again because its just so ridiculously noisy.	
Oct 5 2007 	Not as bad as I expected but not great either...	My company booked me into this hotels for 3 nights this month (October). After reading reviews on here, I was prepared for the worst. Maybe that's why my views on this hotel aren't as strong as some. Indeed, although there were some problems, all in all I still didn't think it was awful. Maybe it's also because I could claim all the money back on expenses...First of all, let me tell you this is very much a business hotel, and is not suitable for tourists mainly because of its location in the middle of office buildings. That is unless you're going to a concert at the Millennium dome (or O2 Arena as it's called these days). It's only 1 stop on the DLR then 1 stop on the tube (Jubilee line to North Greenwich).I checked in just before 2pm and it was pretty quick. Reception staff was polite too (this time round anyway). Came up to my room and it was big (for London anyway) and fairly clean. TV's got the usual terrestrial channels plus Sky sports, Sky news and ITV3. Bathroom again fine size with powerful enough shower. The only thing I didn't like was the bed which really was VERY uncomfortable: you could feel every spring when lying down on the mattress, and the pillows were as hard as brick!Anyway, later on I checked my bill. I turned out they hard charged me on the first day for all the nights, and they had charged me £455 instead of £315. So I went back down to reception and was refunded the £140 difference. Just wished they'd apologized but there you go. Lucky I noticed, because that's quite a big difference in cost.I had all my meals at the hotel, simply because at this time of the year when it gets dark early and after a long days work I didn't feel like going out. The choices around the hotel are quite poor as well. Even though you're 10mins walk from Canary Wharf, all there is there is either sandwich places and shops, or restaurants that are too expensive.So the first evening I had dinner at the French-style restaurant. The food was ok, but even though the restaurant was half-empty I had to wait nearly an hour and a half to be served my bit of chicken with cherry tomatoes! As I was on my own as well I was very bored, and by then I was so hungry that I ate everything there was for me to eat: 2 small breads with butter on the side plate! Other people in the restaurant complained as well. As soon as I finished eating it I just left my table and asked to pay and go. That's when I finally got an apology.There are two other restaurants at the hotel. A buffet one which is fine for the price (plus as it's buffet you don't have to wait to eat), and an Italian-style one which really didn't serve nice food. They do the room service as well. I especially had one thing which was inedible: the garlic bread which just seemed like a burnt, hard and oily pizza base...Anyway, that's it for my bad experiences, apart from not being able to get back into my room once but it's just because you've got to push the key cards to the right while opening your door. A colleague of mine though had a TV which didn't work, and reception just told him to go and watch TV in the lobby which really wasn't acceptable...Facilities at the hotel also include bars, a pool table, a gym and an indoor swimming pool. The gym and pool are in the basement. The pool's fairly small and shallow, so it's more for relaxing than swimming. The gym's got a few bicycles and running machines, nothing special but better than nothing if you like looking after your shape. I guess it's why this hotel's got these stars, and also probably because of the imposing entrance which makes it look better than it really is.Looking back at my review, it really seems like an awful hotel after all, but really I didn't feel like my stay was ruined and I didn't expect the moon for a business hotel in this area. I would say it's below average, but far from being the worst hotel in the world...	
Oct 4 2007 	Think long and hard	We stayed at the Britannia as it was very close to the O2, where we went and saw a gig. On arriving at the hotel we were told that they did not have a booking under our name, and then they suddenly found it 5 mins later. Then some of our friends arrived and they were not so lucky!! They were told the same - no room. They ended up having to book in to a different hotel, even though they had a room confirmation email. The hotel were not interested at all. When we asked to speak to the manager no-one came out. We were told to wait - 1hr later no one had come and we were then told that the hotel was fully booked and there was no room. We requested a non-smoking room, what we got was a smoking room that had had the ashtray removed. It stank of smoke, to the point where we requested for all the bedding to be changed.The rooms and general decor looked tired, and we were woken at 07.30am to have a room service even though we had a &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign hanging on the door.The LDR (London docklands railway) is situated 1/2 a mile away and was trundling past every 20mins from around 06.30am. Made quiet a noise.	
Sep 24 2007	Don't waste your money	Britannia International Docklands LondonTerrible, Terrible,Terrible. I would not waste my money.Just let me say I was there from late July to late Sept.It was for business in the area. Now a person would think that any hotel would try to be accommodating to a long term guest. I was there with a big group and not the only one that had problems. I would say about 98 percent of the people had problems.They promised our group a lot but didn't follow though. For example: new comfortable beds. We got beds but you might as well have been sleeping on a concrete slab.Refrigerators were also promised for our group yet never received.It took about 3 hours to get checked in. The rooms are out dated with wall paper falling off the walls.The water pressure in some rooms were poor at best (The water pressure had a hard time keeping the shower valve up)I had to change my room once. I was lucky some had to change even more times before they had a room they could live with.The Staff were not very helpful. They sure didn't seem like they wanted to be there. let alone enjoyed their work. On one occasion, I left my room to go out &amp; placed the 'please service room' placard on the door handle. When I returned a little later, the placard had been turned around to show the 'do not disturb' side. Apparently, rather than actually service the room, maid service just flipped the sign around! Just gettting change at the front desk became an onerous task. Regardless of how small the currency being offered, the front desk clerk ALWAYS had to go in the back. But only after wasting time looking in their cash drawer up front, seeming to stall and looking confused as to what they were doing. How hard is it to change a 20 pound note into smaller bills?If you want a drink at the bar and there is a line of more than 5, be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes.In London you cannot smoke in an enclosed space(that's cool) but if you step outside and smoke on there outdoor patio, the bartender will tell the manager and the manager(Jason) will call the police. The police came gave the manager a dirty look and smiled at us and left. During the course of my visit, I was constantly harassed when going out to smoke. It was ridiculous!Everyday it was something else.If you have any say about staying at the Britannia International Docklands London...Don't.Its not a friendly place.	
Sep 24 2007	Worst Hotel on Earth	Food was terrible, service non-existant, front desk had very few people who could speak english and nobody seemed to have any idea about reservations.It took 12 hours (no joke) to get my room sorted and a key that would work. Hotel staff was out right hostlie. I was in a group of 50 people and several people were sick from the breakfast.Room had no running hot water and staff seemed unconcerned about this.I travel for a living all over the world and this was the worst I have ever experienced.Stay away!	
Sep 23 2007 	Enjoyable stay!	Fabulous location, decent service and room luxuryBest part is the lovely view from the window. Enjoyed the stay!	
Sep 23 2007	Average	Stayed three nights in September.Rooms a bit musty (can't open windows) with dated decor but spacious enough with all you may require e.g. tea/coffee, iron, tv, AC, etc..Location good (five minutes to Jubilee line at Canary Wharf, or DLR to Bank).Wouldn't be my first choice the next time and wouldn't like to have paid the rack rate.	
Sep 20 2007 	Poor quality and attitude	We have stayed in this hotel to visit a play in the West End and to visit Billingsgate the next morning. The experience was not what I had expected.As noted by other reviewers, the staff is not very friendly and the service is rather slow; in particular when most of the staff is trying to avoid customers in the queue. The room we got was alright, hower, it was difficult to book a wake-up call. The advertised number did not work, reception did not answer and the switch-board was grumpy.The first surprise was, that the hotel bar closes for 15 minutes and guests have to wait to get something to drink; this is quite unique and I have never experienced this before. The next one was that the hotel ran out of nibbles on a Friday evening; the bar had nothing and sent us to room service - the room-service didn't have anything and complained about the bar sending guests to them. Finally, the hotel concierge did not know that the hotel had a pool - he had to ask a colleague whether there was one and how to find it.When I arrived back home, I sent a letter (on paper and by email) to Britannia complaining about the service in the hotel. Foolishly, I expected a reply; a justification, an apology or at least an acknowledgement. So far, I have heard nothing and I do not expect to do so in the future. This has been the final straw and I will avoid this group whenever possible.	
Sep 11 2007 	great location	Myself and my husband stayed in the Britannina International Hotel London In September for one night . Its location was a 5minute tube journey to the O2 Arena where we went to see Prince in concert. We flew into Heathrow hoped on the tube to the hotel. The hotel is located 5min walk from the Canary Warf tube station in the docklands. Its a 4 star hotel, old style decore, staff very friendly.It has a bar, restaurant and niteclub we did not get a chance to try them out. Bedroom was very clean, spacious with aircon, tv, tea/coffee, iron and room service. Mattress was a bit springie but sleepable. Price was very good at £99 for a executive double with unsuite. Breakfast was not included and cost £13.50 per person. We thought £27 was too expensive for breakfast , better option was a lovely deli accross the road from main entrance to hotel served all day breakfast at £4.50 each.Over all experience of hotel was good , great location for a nite out at the O2 Arena and very close to city by tube for site seeing	
Sep 8 2007 	Bad Services and Worst Hotel Ever	I just returned from a one week business trip to London and this was the worst possible hotel I have ever stayed, for the price I paid. Just to mention a few things:Staff is extremely rude, in person or over the phoneThe phone in my room wasn't working and when I called for repair, I was told that they could only do it the next morning - room service?? Emergency?? Who cares...?Dirty towels were folded nice and neat, as if I would not notice they were dirty with huge black stains when I open them up...The bed sheets are not clean, contained hairs, and also had holes on the corners, as if they got ripped out of barb wire... Toiletries are not replaced - bring your own to be on the safe side...Good luck if you are expecting a phone call from family or friends - no one answers the hotel's main phone line and when someone answers after 10 or more rings, they transfer to the wrong room...The mattress on the room was so old and thin and the springs worn out, not comfortable at any level...Breakfast at the hotel? Only if you want to get sick! I had it on the first morning and never again.... Good luck in finding clean dishes and silverware... And don't expect to be greeted or served by anyone; however, expect to be charged before you are get seated!If you plan on using swimming pool, sauna, etc, be prepared to pay extra too...Safety is another issue - you can enter and exit the hotel as you please, and cleaning staff leaves rooms wide open while cleaning them, making it possible for anyone to enter your room at those times.Room service knocked at my door 3 times late at night, in different nights, even though I had never ordered anything...Don't even think about sleeping in past 7:00 in the morning: there is a Docklands Light Railway running very close by and a building site construction right outside of your window.I was really disappointed with this hotel and definitively would not recommend it to anyone.	
Aug 29 2007 	Lovely facilities	I went there for the great views, it was quiet, gym, and jacuzzi in the rooms, and the pool table. The staff were ok but if it they weren't I would have liked it anyway. I liked the gym as you can be a member even if you don't stay there. There was a lot to do too, but we couldnt do everything. I would go there again.	
Aug 17 2007 	Bad stay	We were due to stay at this hotel for 5 nights as part of us moving house - paid for by my husbands company. We arrived on Friday evening at 9pm to check in. The lobby was packed and full of drunks. The check in process was lengthy and unfriendly. Our room was a family room which had the appearance of old folks home. The windows do not open at all due to the design of the hotel and the air conditioning didn't go below 25 degrees. This made me hyperventilate in bed! Breakfast next day was again unfriendly and full of workmen and old people. The choice of food was appalling and the staff unfriendly. The whole place had a very grubby feel. We decided over breakfast that we would check out and go and sleep on the floor of our new house - yes it was that bad!! When I went to check out I was asked why I was checking out. I was honest and told the member of staff I hated the place. This was met with no argument whatsoever. The car park is £15 from 6pm to 9am and the room we were in was £160 a night. A complete and utter rip off. Thankfully my husbands company paid the bill.	
Aug 15 2007	Disgraceful!	I had booked a room for my wife and I for the Bocelli concert at the O2, it was a spur of the moment thing booked three days before arrival, I travelled from abroad and my wife from Newcastle where we live. I arrived at the hotel at about 5pm first where I wanted to check in and then meet my wife from the train and return to the hotel. I was refused a room as I did not have the booking credit card on me, I explained that my wife had the card and would be at the hotel within the hour, the hotel would not let me check in.Where is the rule that the card holder has to arrive before there partner? We did not stay at the hotel. Eric Smith is the general manager, I found him to be arrogant and useless. A month later when the credit card statement came through they had taken payment for the booking. Fay in the accounts departmment refunded the money, she was most helpful. I telephoned the head office and asked to speak to the MD, I wanted him as boss of the company to be aware of what went on, I was put through to his p.a.. Gayle Sainthouse, who tried to fob me off and refused to give the name of the M.D., why, is he not interested in customer service in a customer service industry?One thing is for certain, Gayle Sainthouse certainly isn't! She was also useless!I will never again attempt to book with Britannia hotels, absoloutely disgraceful.Keith Barrett, seghill, Northumberland.	
Aug 7 2007 	Below average	Have stayed here a few times as I spend a bit of time in Canary Wharf with work. The hotel lobby gives a reasonable impression, but do not be fooled. I have stayed about 5 different times as the company I work for have this at the top of their list (£80 - £100 for a night roughly). The rooms are very dated. Chinz is the order of the day. Flaking gold taps, tiles from the 80's, pattern wall paper, and none of it particularly well maintained. My shower this moring either froze me to death, or caused my skin to blister. Move the tap a millimeter and suffer! Room 934 for reference. I ordered room service. Sirloin steak, fries and a side salad, along with a half bottle of house red. This came to £30 and was without doubt the worst meal I have ever had. I could not actually tell whether it was a sirloin of beef, or pork. I left the salad as it was mostly old lettuce, and the chips were awful. I paid £30 for this, so be warned.The bed's are not comfortable in any of the rooms I have stayed in. Old mattresses, and get this, they do not have duvets, but rather old fashioned blankets and an eiderdown! Again, think 70's or 80's and you are there!In short, this hotel has a good location, and is cheap, but apart from that, forget it. You have been warned!	
Aug 6 2007 	Beautifull - I love this hotel	This was the 2nd time I stayed here and this time I was much happier with it. The room was beautiful, very comfortable atmosphere. It was all very clean and the room was serviced everyday to a good standard. The breakfast was much improved and is now actually quite good. It was an English breakfast that you could help yourself to, so you could have as much as you like. There was alot of choice, too, even a boiled egg! Breakfast room was very nice and reasonably comfortable to be in. I very much enjoyed my stay here and didn't want to leave!	
Jul 26 2007	Worth it for the cheap deals..	I have stayed here before at some bargin rates - and it you are working in Canary Wharf it is better than the average Holiday Inn Express or Ibis hotel.It's getting a little shaby however some of the rooms are tired - but some of the rooms have great views and the staff seem happy to move you to a better room if they can.I don't rate the food however and quite often the hotel is full of confused tour groups / conference delegates.Full rate is a complete rip off - but looks for the specials and it is worth it!	
Jul 24 2007 	Average	For 70 pounds for a double room it's not bad. You could do better though. Dated room, uncomfortable bed, quite far from central London. Plus points- excellent view of the Wharf, big room, a few minutes to the nearest tube station.	
Jul 19 2007 	A missed opportunity	I've stayed at the Britannia twice now. The first room was a reasonable size but very dark and with a bathroom that needed refurbishment. For my latest stay I had a huge room with views over the water,Canary Wharf and the Millenium dome. The decor is fairly old-fashioned - I think the aim is for a Victorian look. The room and public areas were very clean. The bed was two singles pushed together with a cheap uncomfortable mattress and although the bathroom was in a better condition but the sink plug wouldn't stay closed and getting the shower temperature right took a while. Although included in my room cost, I didn't bother with breakfast this time. The restaurant has fantastic views over the water but the food was unappealing and the jugs used for tea / coffee don't seem to be kept separate, so you get tea that tastes of coffee. There is a decent sized kettle in the room together with coffee sachets, teabags and biscuits. My overall feeling was that the hotel was missing a great opportunity - c,ean, good sized rooms in a great location very close to a DLR station and only 10 minutes over the walkway to Canary Wharf with its shops and restaurants. All this let down by poor food, a poor mattress and dirty windows spoiling those great views. It looks like another hotel is being built close by and I think the Britannia may lose custom.	
Jun 18 2007 	Yep you do get what you pay for...	Booked one night here through lastminute.com for an 'executive double' (which I know I didn't get - was definitely a standard). Fairly good first impressions - rather old fashioned but warm and welcoming. Staff completely unremarkable although efficient. My room was, well... old fashioned to say the least, but very clean. Clean sheets and towels and generally tidy - no problems in that respect. The only thing I'd say was the windows on the outside were very grubby, obscuring the view. However this can only be attributed to the massive building site right outside the window... I have to admit, being there on a weekend there wasn't much noise from the building site at all, but it may be a different story throughout the week. It wasn't the quietest room in the world and it was very hot. The fans were too noisy to have on throughout the night and they didn't seem to do an awful lot anyway... spent much of the night fighting with bedclothes and attempting to cool down!The shower was rather appalling - very much hot/cold/hot/cold... pressure not bad. Oh and the hairdryer didn't work...The main thing that irritated me about this place was someone bursting into the room at 7:30am Sunday morning. Admittedly I didn't have the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on my door, but isn't it customary to knock first anyway?? Certainly not a great move on their part.Anyway all in all, despite everything above, I actually had a fairly enjoyable time. There was nothing about the hotel that 'wowed' me or my boyfriend, nor particularly impressed, but it was clean, tidy, anonymous and in a great location. Exactly what I was hoping for.	
Jun 16 2007 	You get what you pay for	Staff and service were good, and the hotel was very clean. The mattress must have been older than the hotel, though, as it had NO padding over its springs. Hot water was available---if I took my shower before 8am. After about 8am, the hot water tap produced air and intermittent spits of hot water. My colleagues had similar reports on their mattresses but most had hot water.	
Jun 3 2007 	Great hotel - HUGE room and very good service	We stayed at this hotel during the bank holiday weekend and I can honestly say we had a wonderful time. My jaw almost hit the ground when I saw how big the bedroom was and the bed was so comfortable even though it was two singles pushed together. In addition, the view from the 6th floor was spectacular.My only major concern is that there is going to be a swanky appartment block built right next door so a) there is going to be a lot of building noise soon and b) it will probably block the view across the Thames to the Millennium Dome. Because of this I am unlikely to stay there again unfortunately.I can't comment on the food because we were room only.The location of the hotel was excellent - only a few hundred metres from the nearest DLR station.	
Jun 2 2007 	Good Hotel	Very good for business travelers, if the internet will work in all hotel rooms.	
May 31 2007 	Terrible hotel at the price stay somewhere else!!	I travelled to Canary Whary regularly for a couple of years and stayed one night at the Britannia once but never again!I was on a rate of GBP 130 for an &quot;executive room&quot;. On arrival I was informed that, despite booking such a room, there were no executive style rooms left. I was then given a room that can only be described as awful. Tiny, outdated and with a single bed with a scratchy woolen bed cover. The hotel is right beside the DLR line, so in addition to the awful room I had to put up with a great deal of noise from passing trains. There was no reduction in my room rate when I checked out which was extremely dissapointing given the box that I was put up in.Breakfast was a free for all. Little staff coordination and instead of normal tables, guests are expected to sit at galley style benchs which afford little privacy and are pretty uncomfortable if the hotel is busy. Food was poor.The only good thing I have to say about the hotel is the location. It is to my knowledge the only mid price hotel in the Canary Wharf area as both the Marriott, Hilton and Four Seasons are top end. That said, if you have to stay locally, take the Hilton Docklands across the river which, although not good, is much better than this joint. Better still stay at one of the hotels up river and take a clipper or the tube to Canary Wharf.	
May 28 2007	Cheap not	We stayed for one night, which cost around £70. The set rate is far higher (and ludicrous - I don't expect anyone pays it).The hotel is rather old-fashioned, with extremely naff decor (tonnes of chinz, gaudy chandeliers etc). Don't go expecting a styish stay, but it's OK for the price.The staff were, with one notable exception, sullen and uncooperative. Checking in and out was a pain. I've seen worse, but I'd expect better, even at a low price.The room was as ugly as the rest of the hotel, and fairly small. The double bed was clearly two singles pushed together, with a big ridge down the middle. It was clean, though, as was the bathroom. The shower was a bit crummy, but it did work.Breakfast is best avioded - it's a free-for-all buffet (to get tea or coffee, for example, you have to help yourself to a thermos-jug from a counter). The tables weren't set properly.We didn't use the basement pool, but we had a look - it's fairly small, but looks OK.Overall - if you need somewhere to stay at a lowish price, this hotel is OK - just make sure that you don't pay the standard rate, which is ridiculous. If you want a good hotel, there's a Hilton down the road.	
May 21 2007 	It's OK...nothing special...but not bad	I was in this hotel for 10 days on business. I stayed in three different rooms so I have a pretty good idea of what this hotel is all about. From what I was told you don't get internet on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th &amp; 5th floors which was an inconvenience. We needed internet so we were moved to the 8th floor. The rooms were standard to small in size, but they did have a nice view of canary wharf and the staff was very accommodating to our requests. They even hooked us up with some room service very very late at night even when the kitchen was closed which was nice.I spent a couple of nights in two rooms both with two small beds. I have to be honest I think this is the smallest bed I have ever slept on in my entire life. If I rolled over I would fall out.(In fact I did fall out of bed...no joke). The bed I had on the 5th floor was not very comfortable, but the one on the 8th floor was very comfortable so, this is fairly hit or miss.The last few nights I was in a suite on a upper floor. OK this room was very nice, big with a great bath room, a dining/desk area and a large very comfortable bed. I was pretty happy the whole time I was in this room..and the bathroom was majorly upgraded with a jacuzzi tube ect.Food: The buffet was very good and offered a wide variety of &quot;english&quot; food. I enjoyed the meals there a lot....in fact I gained 5 pounds in 10 days. LOL.It was very convenient to the Canary Wharf business district but was not really where you would want to be as a tourist.If I could make one suggestion to the owners of the hotel, I would tell them that they need to quit pushing two small beds together to make one big bed. Just get a big mattress. It makes a HUGE difference in comfort. Overall I have no regrets about staying there, and I would happily do it again. It was not a bad place at all but was certainly nothing special.I have not done a lot of travel though England so I don't have a lot to compare this property with, so take that into account when reading my review.	
May 21 2007 	Fine if you can get a bargain rate	From the outside it looks like a 70's concrete block. On the inside it's all chintz and ornaments which is a bit odd. After some confusion on checking in (we'd booked a twin room and were given a double; then the next room we were given was already occupied) we were upgraded and consequently got a bigger room than anticipated. Room was fine although the curtains don't exactly keep the daylight out and one bed squeaked an awful lot. The bathroom was nice though with good shower/bath. We'd got a last minute bargain rate though so were perfectly happy with value for money. Great location if you need to be in Canary Wharf etc and very handy for anywhere on the DLR route including Greenwich.	
Apr 30 2007 	Fine	Like the previous few reviewers I found this hotel to be nowhere near as bad as some have described. Lounge areas are comfortable, bedrooms (standard ones) are a little dated (and yes we also had problems with our 'key') but clean and quite comfortable; staff were generally very pleasant aswell. The Carvery in Jenny's was pretty average, so one night we had a pizza from the pizzeria and that was fine. Probably not worth paying the £75 a night but if you can get it cheaper it's well worth it.	
Apr 22 2007 	No problem at all 	Booked this through AIRMILES &amp; we haven't had a bad deal from them yet but nearly cried when I read the reviews here. However I was ready for battle when we arrived at the hotelAt just after 9pm, I timed it &amp;, it took 10 minutes from being greeted in the foyer to getting to our room - I'm not unhappy with that &amp; it was about the same to check out at 10.30am.The room was a good size with extra pillows &amp; blankets in the wardrobe. Only complaint was that there was no luggage stand. I hate putting cases on the bed, you have no idea just what you have dragged them through on the way! Decor was good &amp; the bedroom &amp; bathroom were very clean.In the cold light of day the wallpaper &amp; skirting boards were a little scuffed (shame on the former occupants who haven't informed Housekeeping so that measures can be taken to remedy faults!) but the bed linen &amp; towels were pristine. The air conditioning worked OK once we had figured it out.We had a DLR view room so it was a bit noisy but it didn't bother us after the first night &amp; it was great being so close to public transport. We had Continental Breakfast included with our booking, an upgrade to Full English was £5.50 which we thought was a bit much for what was available. Nobody actually checked what you were taking though. On the first morning many of the tables were uncleared when we arrived for breakfast BUT we asked if we could have a table cleared next to the window &amp; this was done straight away. Breakfast isn't up to Hilton or Le Meridion standards but is OK to get you past lunch time. There are no signs for tea or coffee, it is help yourself (coffee is in the blue thermos flasks, tea in the white) but if you ask the staff will bring you fresh. The breakfast buffet does seem a little understaffed but if you don't pay a lot for the room you can't expect the hotel to overstaff the restaurant. The Conservatory Bar is a great place to have a drink at the end of the day &amp; the staff are very friendly. Drinks don't seem to be overly priced either.The room keycards do seem a little 'eccentric' but when we asked at reception a very nice lady came straight away to get us sorted out. After that we just jiggled the card, twiddled the door handle &amp; muddled through.Think I read about the showers - well on the first morning I got the bath taps running, temperature OK etc, then switched it to shower, the shower head jumped off the stand &amp; soaked me &amp; quite a bit of the bathroom. Second day I did the same - some of us never learn! Third morning I took a bath.We had no real problems here, nowhere in London is quiet. The staff were friendly &amp; helpful &amp; even though the hotel was undergoing refurbishment &amp; was full it was a really great place to stay.	
Mar 15 2007	Loved it!	Stayed here for three nights, don't understand all the terrible reviews the hotel was very nice. We booked an excecutive room and it was comfortable and very clean did a finger test for dust!!!!!!!! sheets were nice and crisp. Bathroom very nice and very clean shower powerful and hot not like people said in other reviews. Only two negatives, if you decide to have a cup of tea or coffee downstairs beware very expensive! and if your thinking of an upgrade on your room think again. We had an excecutive room and the people we were with paid £100 more for their room and it wasn't as nice it was tired and floral! Good location would stay here again. Excellent break and by the way go and see We Will Rock You absolutely brilliant.	
Mar 8 2007 	Cold showers	We couldn't get in to any hotels in the immediate vicinity of Canary Wharf, so this place was offered as the next best thing.One of the most important factors about a hotel for me is the shower, I'm happy to put up with weak showers as long as I don't have to spend ages trying in vain to tweak the temperature! However, the showers at the Britannia are attrocious! Not only are they weak (despite the tremendous pressure from the bath taps), but if you mix some cold water into the mixer you'll find that the cold water pushes the hot water back down to the boiler and you have to completely turn the shower off and turn the bath taps on to restore it! The net effect is, you can only use the hot water no matter how hot or cold it happens to be.We told the concierge and he said &quot;we get a few problems with the showers, it's normal&quot;.Moving onto the bar, it's a fairly low-rent affair, the kind of place you'd expect in a less salubrious part of a city. I felt quite out of place in my suit :-) Interestingly, the bar is surrounded by heavy duty cage-work, not sure why!I didn't try the food as I wasn't filled with much confidence in their abilities, besides, the tube is nearby and you can eat easy enough nearby.I won't be staying agin, next time if there is no availablity in the Wharf, I'll simply stay nearer to the City and use the tube in the morning.	
Mar 8 2007 	Horrific!!!!!	We arrived to be greeted by hotel receptionist with the biggest attitude problem ive come across- service with a smile i think NOT!! there was a problem with the rooms an honest mix up that could easily of been resolved, however it appeared to be too much trouble, on finally being allocated a room we found it dirty, with a musty smell and to be perfectly honest if it wasnt for sheer exhaustion and desparation i would not of stayed there! we were given no assistance with our bags and put on the top floor of the hotel in the smokers area despite the fact i am heavily pregnant!!! we were kept awake by passing planes all night not the hotels fault understandably but they dont exactly warn you! the hotel bar was in a nice setting overlooking the wharf shame about the staff! we ventured into london for a LOVELY meal and on our return to be greeted with the same poor attitude from hotel staff we decided to leave the next day. we were made to feel uncomfortable and checked out at our first opportunity the next morning, which was not much less smooth that our arrival. this shabby hotel (yes the pictures look nice its a different experiance once you venture in!!!) and the attitute of its staff ruined our break.	
Mar 1 2007 	Great at a bargain price look for alternatives if it's full price	Been to stay at this hotel twice, in 2004 and 2005 at Christmas. At the time, they were running an offer to make the rooms £21 per person, per night - including taxes - which for London is outrageously cheap.On my second visit I noticed the base rates - upwards of £100 per night. If I had paid this, i'd of been disgusted. The hotel is quite a treck from all the attractions, but finding the Tube is easy enough. You're probably looking at about 30 minutes journeytime including the walk to either the DLR or Canary Wharf Tube stops.As for the htoel itself - Rooms are pretty basic, but clean. Tea making facilities in room. The heat bothered me - as another reviewer has said, it won't go any lower than 22.5, and the windows don't open, which would really irk me had I paid a lot for the room, as it was cheap however I can overlook such thingsI am currently looking to stay in London again, and they don't offer the bargain rates, which puts me off and compells me to find something closer to the attractions.	
Feb 26 2007	Enjoyed the Britannia - Loved the location	Booked a double room through [----] at a bargain £55 PRPN, including breakfast, and overall was well satisfied with our stay.Read some poor reviews and was a bit concerned. However, found most aspects well satisfactory. Reception and a downstairs bar/setting areas that look right out onto the docks give the impression of a 4 star facility. Our room (entered by key card) on the 5th floor had Victorian decor in keeping with the rest of the hotel, generally in good condition although some bits approaching re-furbishing time (carpets a bit worn etc).Did complained that air-con was too hot, maintenance man suddenly appeared and opened the locked window, seemed to do the trick. Breakfast was a just adequate buffet, although we were told we only qualified for cold continental, which we ignored. Finally the best aspect of the Hotel is the location, right on the South Quay dock, a nearby footbridge takes you into Canary Wharf, skyscrapers, bars, underground shops, with tube and DLR ready to take you into old London town.	
Feb 23 2007 	Simply a rubbish hotel	This review is from someone that stayed there more than 20 times. The only reason I did so was its convenient location to Canary Wharf (this is where my office was at the time). That being said, I often decided to stay much further away from the office just to avoid it.The hotel itself, if renovated, could be Ok. Unfortunately, it's old and tired. 30% of the time (at least), there is something not working in the room. If you get a room facing the DLR, it's really noisy for forget easy sleep.If that was all... the problem is really the personnel. Sorry to say that but they should first replace the management that is entirely failing at their duty. I had many problems with my stay (typically something not working in my room). The worst part is that it often took hours (or days) to talk to a manager. When I was able to, he was just about as capable as the fake plants in the hotel...I strongly suggest that unless you are picking this hotel for his proximity to whatever your goal is, you simply avoid the place. An hotel like can't please anybody, not even with the lowest possible standards.	
Feb 13 2007 	What a catastrophe . . .	The Hotel Britannia International is a sad and sorry hotel whose lone attraction is the fact that it is centrally located in Canary Wharf and close to the Tube station.The facilities are out of date, the structure tired and old. Worn carpets, mouldy tile, andshabby, back-breaking beds are but a few of the amenities that await. The glum staff meanders listlessly through their assigned tasks, looking almost as unhappy as the guests they are compelled to serve. In fairness, this attitude perhaps stems from the fact that the staff members themselves are compelled to work in the same, second-rate environment being flogged to the customers at exhorbitant prices. The substandard workplace makes even routine items such as checking out or changing a 50 Euro note an utter nightmarefor all involved. If you are travelling on business and need a bed in a central location in Canary Wharf, then the Britannia International is a tolerablealternative though hardly a desirable one. If you are not so constricted, then look elsewhere and save yourself the money and grief.	
Feb 12 2007 	above expectations	the hotel is situated very near the canary warf tube. the place looks wonderful. its very clean, all rooms have amazing Thames view (even the back side ones). the restrooms are very clean and modern, and the beds are fine. one small problem might be the heat but it was ok.i was scared of all these reviews here but when i was there i found out that the hotel is GREAT and worth the money.the breakfast was also wonderful.dont hesitate and book it if you want a 4 stars london hotel but cant afford Hilton!	
Feb 5 2007 	Tired hot and shabby.	My partner stayed here for 4 nights during the Toy Fair, I was lucky and only had to stay one night.Air con did not work so the room was at a constant 22.5 degrees. The bed was hard and lumpy and the sheets threadbare.The lighting was dull and grey.The service is dreadful, they look half a sleep and you feel as though you are putting them out. Breakfast is not a good experience, no tea or coffee is offered, go find it yourself.The only redeeming feature is the location.There are other hotel. Do not go here.Dreadful.	
Jan 14 2007	Dobule booked	Booked the Britannia International with Alpharooms.com 3 months in advance and paid up front. Received our voucher by e-mail and had no more correspondence. We arrived on the due date on the due time, only to be told that there was no room at the Inn!Apparently, at the time of the booking (in September) their system was down and a double booking occurred! 3 months in advance remember and no further correspondence. They sent us to their other hotel, &quot;of the same standard (4*)&quot;, but no pool, &quot;but they would make it nice for us&quot;. This hotel was the Britannia Hampstead. It was NOT 4*, I would have been pushed to give it 3*. We received a bottle of wine to &quot;make it nice&quot;, which was not very nice at all!The room was a smoking room - not requested by us! The smell in the corridor was bad, but even worse in the room! There was stains on the carpet, and on the wardrobe door, the lamp was not working, there was old, old furniture, frayed bedspread - no duvet, campbed for the child that sagged in the middle, no view of the Thames as we booked! The view was condensation on the windows, complete with mildew.We were not the only people to be moved, speaking to other people at breakfast, showed that they too had been moved after arriving at 9.00am and told that their room was not ready and to go shopping for the day, it would be ready when they got back! They arrived back in the evening to discover that there was no room, that they had doubled booked!!!When we arrived at the International, it was very, very busy with people wearing badges, there was clearly a conference taking place a the hotel, and we believe that they took our bookings. The International clearly thought that it was okay to lose our bookings for the conference - probably for a lot more money!We will never book with Britannia again or Alpharooms.We thought that we would take it up with Alpharooms when we got home as we booked with them and paid them in advance. However, they don't accept responsibility. You have to take it up with the hotel at the time!Totally spoilt our weekend.	
Dec 15 2006 	Mediocre but at least it had A/C	I stayed here because I had client meetings in Canary Wharf over 2 days, so I thought it would be convenient. It was, but the stay was pretty mediocre, so I am not sure it was worth it.The hotel was being swarmed with guests when I arrived, so I waited 30 minutes in line to get checked in.My room was very large, but it had old carpet, worn sheets/comforter, and the furniture was a good 30 years old.On the positive side, I got a good rate (I think due to the location), and the pizza restaurant made a good pizza for dinner. Otherwise it was kind of a disappointment.Also, I stayed in August when it was very hot, and I was very thankful for the A/C. So I guess that counts for something...	
Dec 11 2006 	a poor experience	Stayed commencing 20th October 200625minutes to get checked in,electronic guest room door keys did not function, therefore I had to return to reception for a further 20 minute wait, leaving my family waiting in the corridor.Many of the staff had a surly attitude, some waiting staff appeared to be lacking in their personal hygiene, 'not a very pleasant experience when one eats in the hotels restaurant'.Some bedroom and bathroom fittings were broken, a poorly maintained shower head resulted in a flooded bathroom floor.We only became aware that the swimming pool was out of order when we went to use it and was confronted with a handwritten note hanging over the stairs, explaining that it was out of use and would be for some time.I have advise my friends and family not to consider this hotel, it was advertised at the time as a four star hotel, I have stayed in far better three star hotels.	
Nov 27 2006 	Complete disaster	Don't bother booking. Hotel overbooks routinely meaning your pre-paid room counts for nothing. Service is appalling. Failed to offer satisfactory alternative accommodation. Disgrutled customers fight in the bar. In my opinion, avoid at all costs. You have been advised......	
Nov 14 2006 	This place needs to get with the times.	Stayed here in conjunction with a seminar that my place of work was organising in the city. Not many free rooms in London at the time, hence I had to stay here. This hotel seems to be very unsure of its own identity as its very modern on the outside and very chintzy on the inside. Rooms are at best average. My room, a double with a jacuzzi, turned out to be two twin beds put together. But getting into it was the problem as it took me three attempts to get into my room as the room keys didn't work. When I spoke to staff about the problem, all I got from the duty manager was &quot;I can't help you speak to my colleague over there.&quot; The overall experience with this hotel seems to sum up what is wrong with the Britannia chain. They just seem to plod along while all other hotels in the area seem to evolve with the times. Refurbishment should be an option for this place, if only for the benefit of the customer. There's a brand new Hilton just along the road from this place, I'll probably be using that in the future (and I'm sure I won't be woken up by the constant rumbling of the DLR trains).	
Nov 1 2006 	Not sure what the fuss is about	I stayed for 4 nights, and before going read the reports on Tripadvisor, i was therefore expecting a horror stay. check in was smooth, room spacious, breakfast was good, plenty of choice, and the room was cleaned every day with a change of towels if we wanted them. Only slight downside was that the twin beds were a little small and slightly uncomfortable. yes the pool was shut, but all hotels have to do maintenance at some time. was easy to get to from either Canary Wharf Tube or South Quay DLR (which is the nearest station).	
Oct 30 2006 	Only if you are stuck	Room: It was supposed to be ready at 2pm but because I requested a non smoking room this was not the case. The room itself was dated and because of this gave the impression that it wasn't very clean. My double room consisted of two single beds pushed together. Keycard did not work properly which involved numerous visits to reception.All reception staff appeared to be trainees. Breakfast is poor, all the fruit is canned fruit and the &quot;English breakfast &quot; looks terrible.I stayed here for business purposes and it is just a short distance from London City airport and a 5 minute walk to Canary Wharf. This is the only good thing about this hotel.	
Oct 23 2006	Pool not even open!!!	I booked and then saw people's reviews. So I contacted the hotel to make sure my booking had been recieved. A day later it was confirmed. When I sent the email to confirm, I also asked if the pool was open (one review said it was not) and was told it probably wouldn't be - I think this is awful, when you book you should be told this, I wasn't	
Oct 23 2006 	Book elsewhere. Anywhere	I stayed here for a business trip as I foolishly believed the ad on lastminute.com. After flying from Australia, I was looking forward to a bit of comfort in London. This place was something else, it took them about 30 mins to check me in, whcih largely consisted of a gormless looking young girl, constantly pressing the same key on the keyboard. My room had a remarkably kitsch naval feel to it and I don't think it had been cleaned since Francis Drake's time. The room did have a jacuzzi alas. I tried it, after 5 mins all the water had run out of it. I look back now and it's quite amusing, at the time it's not though especially as you pay good money for the privilege. The hotel has a feeling of neglect and lack of customer care. Believe me the reviews are not misleading. Do yourself a favour and book somewhere else. I was due to stay for a fortnight, I checked out after 4 arduos days and booked into a very nice hotel a couple of minutes away.	
Oct 8 2006 	Book Elsewhere	Without doubt, the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay in. Rooms are an absolute disgrace, wallpaper is peeling, furniture is shabby and the double room consisted of two (very uncomfortable) single beds placed together.This hotel requires a serious make over, and should not be allowed to advertise in the current manner	
Oct 4 2006 	Tired and shabby	We stayed at the Britannia for 4 nights late September 06, taking advantage of a special offer on the room rate. From the word go it was not a happy experience. A late arrival at after 1am found a queue at check in because a new booking system was being implemented according to the sign on the desk and the receptionist clearly didnt know how to use it properly (maybe adequate staff training is needed?) There was only one member of staff on the desk although several others could be seen to be lurking in the room behind reception. It took over 45m to get the room. However we did get a free upgrade to an executive room. The hotel in general is very tatty and in urgent need of complete refurbishment  lots of peeling wallpaper, holes in walls, chipped floor tiles, worn carpet, chipped faded paint etc. The room was big but very tatty like the rest of the hotel, the door key (swipe cards) didnt work properly, the security lock was broken, there was a loose floor tile in the bathroom, all the bath fitting plating had been polished away, and it overlooked the light railway that runs near the hotel (5am train noise  great!) A room change to the front side of the hotel solved the noise problem but not the tatty décor or faulty door swipe cards which failed to work properly for the duration of our stay. What was billed as continental breakfast was included but this was so poor as to be an insult, served in a breakfast room with all the ambience of a prison waiting room and only one waiter, so tables and counter were dirty. We only took one breakfast and for those unfortunates who get booked into this hotel there is a nice deli over the road and down the steps opposite the front of the hotel (not open weekends but lots of food places in nearby Canary Wharf). In summary  I suggest you dont stay here. On the plus side, there are plenty of free newspapers provided.	
Oct 3 2006 	Not the best place to stay	London was fully booked last week so I ended up out in docklands. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from canary wharf station, reception was not the best as he was a trainee and confused when I his explained I had actually booked a none smoking room. Thankfully the supervisor took control and I was upgraded to a penthouse room, this was a little date but the views where fantastic.Breakfast was awful, I felt I was in a works canteen and wanted to escape, on top of that the food was cold and not appetizing at all.I stayed for two days and visited the bar on both days, like the breakfast room its not very inviting and the stock levels are poor/none existent. Dont ask for slim line tonic...On the whole I dont want to go back, its not really a pleasant stay...	
Sep 30 2006 	Staff Not Friendly	I read the reviews before I went so I was prepared and it went about what all the reviews said.The front desk staff desparately needs a customer service class. The checking in process takes forever and they disappear behind this door constantly and you stand there not sure what they are doing, why they are doing it or if they are ever coming back. Not the greatest feeling.When you check in, make sure you tell them to leave your card open for phone calls, breakfast etc. No idea why they charge the hotel and nothing else, then you can't make a phone call and have to go ALL the way downstairs, wait in the line again and straighten it out.The breakfast is VERY expensive, if you can get it elsewhere, do it. The coffee is pretty bad.The biggest thing is that the consierge never answers the phone and the maid took a big pile of my belongings cause she thought I checked out of the room and left it there. MY luggage was lost and wouldn't come in till the next day. That took 6 full days to straighten out.The pool was under repairs during my stay which was a bummer.The only bright spot was the bar. Very friendly staff, could have been a better selection of beers though.I'm staying at the Mariott Canary Wharf next time.	
Sep 16 2006	Keep away	Arrived with reservation but told me that they had no record of it and was bluntly told to go away as they could not help me. Thankfully I was able to find an alternative hotel quite quickly (the internet is great when you really need it but shudder to think what would happen if it was late at night) The next day contacted the people who did the reservation and was given a copy of the confirmation from this hotel. After a few days got a short e-mailed apology from the Brittania and a promise of a free upgrade next time. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED	
Sep 11 2006 	A hotel with Character which is misunderstood	I stayed at the hotel from august to september on and off having to work hard all day like all business men we look forward to getting back to the hotel and hit the bar to get back to normality. i have stayed in many hotels where the bars have always had a quite and solom feel but not here the bar is lively have it being groups of guests enjoying themselves to the friendly bar staff talking to me about sport or their travels this is a nice personal touch which some hotels lack.i remember i was checking in and i had a bad flight delayed the usual with added security measures and all i got to the hotel wary of it's rep but to my surprise the taxi door opened to see who i saw on his badge head concierge this was refreshing to see a manager leading by example he brought my bags to the reception desk and introduced me to the receptionist and the young lady checked me in with a smile which after my flight is well needed.went to my room to find that even though the room didn't a modern decor it was functional and comfortable. having unpacked and thought i'd see a bit of london i went down to the lobby via one of their three lifts were i meet a well suited gentleman who asked how i was i ignored him as i thought he as just another guest but it turns out that this chap was a manager he assisted me with my information that i required as the concierge was busy.without dragging on my stay was refreshing to say the least. the staff are friendly expecially the front office team and the bar staff. i can't comment about breakfast as i'm always out by 6am.i would suggest that wth any hotel i'd take everything with a pinch of salt everyones taste are different i'd stay here again given the chance.	
Aug 18 2006 	2nd time unlicky	I stayed at this hotel in June 2006 - when I arrived at 2am, after a long, delayed flight I was told that there were no rooms available and so was moved to another hotel. I finally got to the 2nd hotel (far from Canary Wharf) at 3.30am.I returned for the second night of my stay and had been upgraded to a suite, which was a pleasant surprise.Because of this, I decided to give the hotel a second last month. This time was even worse - I was given a room which, although 'non-smoking' smelled strongly of smoke. The bed was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable and the food was horrible (they covered a plate of boiling soup with clingfilm which melted into the soup.....). When I called to ask if I could be moved to a better room, which didn't smell, they told me the best they could do was to open the window - then failed to return to close it when I asked so I had to sleep with the window open while it was 11 degrees outside overnight.Just don't ruin your holiday by staying here!	
Aug 17 2006 	Best value in London a good hotel	I booked this hotel a while back (I got a very good deal through the Britannia hotels website), but after reading the reviews on this site I was rather worried about my stay as there seem to have been lots of negative comments left about this hotel.I have just returned from a 3 day stay at the Britannia International and I honestly could not find any fault with the hotel or it's staff. The hotel claims to be 4 star, in truth it is probably more like 3 star but if you can get a cheap deal through the website then this hotel offers fantastic value for money. Our room was on the 12th floor (top) so had lovely views on Canary Wharf towers. The room was very large (when compared to most central London hotels), had a large bathroom and comfortable bed. The decor of the room was fine, while it may not be cutting edge design the room was practical and perfectly clean, as was the rest of the hotel I might add.The only meals taken at the hotel were breakfast, these too were fine and there was lots of choice on offer. All the staff I spoke to were helpful, friendly and efficient. In my opinion the hotel is in a great location as it is far enough away from central London to get away from the crowds but yet it is within easy reach. Both Canary Wharf tube station (Jubilee line) and South Quay DLR station and within a few minutes walk so you can be in central London in about 20 minutes. The Canary Wharf area also has lots to offer as there is a large underground shopping mall and a good selection of bars &amp; restaurants nearby.To be honest I don't think this hotel deserves such a low rating, I can only assume that some travellers have had bad experiences. I think this hotel is excellent value for money and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value London hotel	
Aug 17 2006	Worst hotel 	There were a catalogue of problems when dealing with this hotel and I cannot say strongly enough that no-one should ever enter this hotel let alone pay money to stay in it.I got married on 5 August 2006 and had this hotel booked for my husband and me on our first night. I had negotiated a discounted rate for my relatives that were flying over for the wedding so I was hopeful that the rooms and service would be top notch. Prior to the wedding I had to spend several hours correcting the major mistakes that reservations had made with regards to bookings made by family. The reservations department got every booing wrong, one example being they booked my mother in for 3 nights in 3 rooms. Bearing in mind my mother lives in London and was only booking one night, one room!On the wedding day my brother was unable to check us in, despite being told he could by my contact there in (Travel Trade Manager). The &quot;lady&quot; in reservations told me that I had to leave my wedding reception (In Corney &amp; Barrow - Cabot Square), walk over in my dress, check myself in, and then walk back to my wedding reception! My brother wanted to arrange for flowers and champagne to be put in our room but that wasn't to be. I was then told by the &quot;lady&quot; in reservations that there was no booking for my mother - that the booking they had for her was for night of 3 August! They didn't have a booking for my mother at all and they were fully booked. I was dealing this phone call mid-way through my wedding reception and understandably was getting very upset. The &quot;lady&quot; on reception then told me that if I &quot;continued to talk to her in that way she would hang up!&quot;To make matters worse, when we got to the hotel after my wedding reception we were met by another bride and groom, the bride was in tears. They had booked their room back in March only to find that they had a twin room on their wedding night! I believe they got a better deal in the end though as they were transferred to the Marriott. The bar wasn't open when I was told it would be and no effort to find alternative accommodation for my mother was made so on our wedding night, my mother had to spend the night in my room - a very romantic first night wouldn't you say?!When we got to the room it was shabby, with big chunks of wood having being taken from furniture (it looked like a dog had bitten it off!), the staff were rude and could speak very little English, the food at breakfast was under cooked, cleaners left their gloves on our clothes, the list goes on. On the Monday it took me going through my personal emails to prove that had made an almighty muck up and even then we didn't really get a satisfactory outcome. Managed to get the money charged for my mother's room refunded and we got our room for 2 nights for free but that was it. No compensation for our ruined wedding night, no sorry, not even a token bottle of champagne - NOTHING!I implore you to never, ever stay in this shoddy, shabby hotel - it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and most definitely the worst customer service I have ever received. I am inmidst of making further complaints but funnily enough - I am still waiting for a reply!	
Aug 11 2006	Nice hotel near Excel	The hotel is very close to excel which was ideal for our trade show. Its a big hotel with great facilities which is needed as you are out of the city. The location is fine and is close to the Docklands Railway transport. The restaurants are very nice in the hotel and I would like to thank the staff for a pleasant stay and helping me with my late night taxi! Cheers.	
Aug 7 2006 	absolutely terrible	Booked a room for ONE night, and asked for a double bed. What I got was a FREE upgrade (?!) that turned out to be TWO single beds pushed together! Not only that, but the upgrade was not worth anything, except that there was lots of floor space. BEDS were very poor, hard, could feel the springs and were very squeaky. There were no duvets, only horrible old itchy 10 year old blankets with clean sheets (a plus point). Bathroom was adequate, barely. It had a poor shower. Asked for a bottle of wine at the bar and they only had ONE white, a pinot grigio. Had to go to the restaurant to get a bottle of something different and then had to pay extra to get it delivered to my room, very much later.We couldn't bear to even try the breakfast, so I went for a walk and got it myself. I saw the queue full of tourists, very early and so we'd have to wait for 40 mins at 0730 on a Sat morning ! Not acceptable. All in all, a terrible nights stay and they will not have my business again. If I were you, I'd look at the Marriot or the Hilton nearby and pay the extra.	
Jul 28 2006 	should've wrote this earlier	I saw some bad things about this hotel, but in 2004 the stay was nice. The price we got was excellent for London. You felt like you were in a 4 star hotel. It's on the water, so the views were very nice. The room was clean and spacious. The breakfast was good. Didn't eat dinner there. It's very close to the rail system to get to the attractions. I'm guessing that the bad reviews are from people that are never happy. At the Underground station by the hotel, there is an underground mall. Very nice.	
Jul 19 2006 	Don't stay here...	Without doubt this hotel had the worst service I have ever experienced.On arrival at 4.05 pm myself and 2 colleagues were informed that our rooms had been cancelled and resold because we hadn't arrived by 4pm. Nowhere on our documentation did it state this was a requirement. The receptionists were gormless in the extreme before finally calling a duty manager who made Basil Fawlty seem like a reasonable person. She explained that it wasn't the hotel's responsability and that they would try to find alternative accomadation for us but basically it was tough.Eventaully 2 and a half hours after we arrived, we managed to secure a twin and a triple room so we all shared. This was something we had to work hard to achieve as the duty manager insisted there were no other rooms available as the 'twin rooms all get let out to tour groups' she didn't check she just talked over us and said that this was standard hotel practice - having just travelled around the World I can confirm it is not 'normal' for a hotel to cancel a booking if the customer hasn't arrived by 4pm, especially without giving the customer any warning that you might do that.The rooms were hot (aircon was ineffective), dirty and small.The bad service continued from the concierge sending us in a completely the wrong direction to a 'nearby restaurant' to room service turning up with a breakfast order at 6.45am as requested only to demand cash for the breakfast. The roomservice then argued with us that we couldn't put the bill oto our room (even though they had our credit card number) and proceeded to barge into the room pick up the telephone and talk to reception before handing the phone to us and saying we would need to speak to them.I have honestly never stayed anywhere with such terrible service and would implore anyone thinking this might be a good place to stay to think again. It's a terrible place in need of renovations and without the slightest understanding of customer service. Don't stay here.	
Jul 16 2006 	Awful stay	I stayed at the Britannia International for one week in June as I was working in Canary Wharf and no other hotels were available in the area. It was a terrible stay. The mattress in the bed was incredibly uncomfortable - I think I could feel every spring in it. And overall the room decor was incredibly ugly (there must have been at least 6 clashing patterns). Further there were no clocks in the rooms and the wake-up call service did not work for two days while I was there. The staff were not very helpful when I explained that this was a problem. The hotel itself was generally shabby and uncomfortable. Both the food and service were well below what you would expect from a supposedly 4 star hotel. The gym is small, with old equipment, and is not included in the price of your room. During an evacuation because of a fire in the hotel (yes a real fire!) I had the opportunity to speak with other guests who complained about the air conditioning not working in their rooms (there was a heat wave in London) amongst other problems. Not recommended. I have since then stayed in a hotel in Central London when I was unable to find accomodations at the better hotels in Canary Wharf.	
Jun 22 2006	Worst ever	I stayed in this hotel thinking it was a four star accomodation but its hardly 2 star in terms of the the quality of rooms, service and discurtious staff. If you really want to pay for punishment then this is the place for you! otherwise if you are really stuck, sleep in your car or hire a tent but dont go there! There is nothing bad about this place but WORST!!!	
Jun 19 2006	Very disappointing	My wife and I were due to stay at this hotel for three nights and checked out after one.The reception staff spoke very limited english and did not seem to be able to handle the vast amount of tour groups that stay here.The room was spacious and with fantastic vies of Canary Wharf. This was marred by the delapidated state of the furnishings including a mattress that was so old the springs were poking up into my back. We tried to make an outside phone call and couldn't. The front desk informed us that we needed to set up an account. After complaining and convincing tham that we had given our credit card details at check in thay gave us an outside line.We parked our car in the underground parking garage and was told it was 15 pounds for 24 hours. After two hours I had to take my car out to go shopping. The front desk told me that I had to pay the parking for the two hours at 2 ponds per hour before we could take the car out. This made no sense, if I had to go out a few times during the 24 hours it could end up costing me 48 pounds total. I complained to the manager directly and after 15 minutes of heated conversation at the front desk he gave me a ticket saying I would only be charged the !5 pounds total. He even tried to make out to me that he was doing me a favour.I think it sad the way a hotel like this can promote the fact it is a 4 star when it is a 2 star at best.This hotel fell far below our expectations.We will not return to this hotel.	
Jun 8 2006 	Horrible	I stayed here in June for a conference and therefore had no choice but to take up the offer of accomodation. However, I can only describe this hotel as a 'hell hole' which is in serious need of an update. This hotel might have been state of the art in the early 90's but is now past its sell by date!!The room was shabby, outdated and very musty. The net curtains (yes net curtains!!) had holes in them, the carpet was threadbare in places and the decor was very 'chintzy'. I was awoken very early by the constant sounds of the DLR as it rattled past the window as well as man shouting and swearing at the top of his voice at 6am in the morning (be warned the walls are very thin!!)Breakfast was also a dissapointment and despite the sign indicating that guests had to wait to be seated, several staff completely ignored me when I waited at the reception desk and one even stood next to me swearing loudly because he could not unlock a store cupbard. In the end I walked to my own table and was not even offered the option of tea/coffee!! Whilst there was a choice of continental of full english both were below average.Like the rooms, lunch and evening meals were also very dubious and some of the dishes tasted like they had been re-heated several times. As a result I came home with a rather upset stomach!On the plus side (and there is only one plus!) the rooms were rather large and spacious but this did not really compensate for the rest of the hotel.In terms of location, I would not choose to stay in Canary Wharf again unless I was on business and I would certainly never go back to the Britannia. The area is busy on weekdays and there are plenty of bars which are nice to sit outside in the summer but is deserted at weekends and is therefore not recommended for tourists.	
May 28 2006	Great value for the internet price	Went on the internet to get the directions for this hotel and accidently came upon Trip Advisor. Read the reviews which were mostly appalling about this hotel and was somewhat apprehensive about my stay there. By this time it was too late to cancel my internet booking and I was expecting the worst. What a pleasant surprise I had, the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful, the room was clean and the breakfast (the only food we consumed) was absolutely fine.The only thing i do agree with is that the hotel could do with an uplift as it is slightly dated.I don't have any qualms about staying there again!	
May 25 2006 	Rude Staff Stale Rooms Poor Food - what more could you ask for	I was looking for a cheaper alternative for business travel in canary wharf. This place was not the solution. After 6 weeks of staying here 3 nights a week I couldn't take any more. Absolutely consistent- rude staff- no iron in room (for business travel!)- terrible food- non smoking rooms that smell like astray- bed covers must never have been washed- v slow check in / check out- painful decor- no points program for frequent guests (the main reason I'm not going back!)To be fair - a couple of plus points- FREE wireless internet access (a first for UK hotels?)- good location for the wharf (10 mins to main block)- it does have a small fitness room with pool. (but you pay extra)	
May 23 2006	Kitch and rude	The decorator of this hotel should be fired, and so the personel manager. My room caused the most severe degree of visual indigestion ever encountered. The hugely mismatched floral fabrics, torn, discoloured lace curtains, red and blue patterened carpet, long over-used quilted beadspreads, gold and red armchairs...best to keep your sunglasses on. Staff acted through-out as if they were trapped in a policy they did not support. Upon check-inn there was no mention that all extras was to be settled in cash. WIth no minibar in the room, I ordered a bottle of water from room-service. This arrived half an hour later and had to be settled in cash. Served myself from the very mediocre breakfast buffet, when leaving the restaurant, I was asked what I had and then told to settle in cash. My reservation was made one month in advance with a Gold Card...upon arrival at midnight after a long flight, the front office manager could not retrieve the booking depite me holding a copy of the email confirming my reservation...overall, who gave this hotel four stars?	
May 18 2006 	There's got to be alternatives...	I would like to echo some of the thoughts of other reviewers - this is not a hotel of a 4 star standard. The hotel is very tired and dated, as is the &quot;red carpet&quot; outside the hotel, it feels more like the staff entrance rather than a guest main entrance! The service was slow checking me in and out, and they tried to charge me the full rate even though I booked a cheaper rate over the internet of Euro 75.The rooms were tidy but furnishings were tired. The bathrooms were a reasonable size but don't expect any quality bathrooms products. I did not use any hotel facilities so cannot comment. On the upside, the hotel is well located in Canary Wharf which was the main reason why I chose to stay here and the price. The hotel is also close to the Canary Wharf underground station. That said, if you do not need to stay in Canary Wharf, you can definitely find better value for money options elsewhere in town, there was just not &quot;feel good&quot; factor.	
May 13 2006	Not even a 1 Star	This hotel is rated at 4 star and it isn't at all. Rooms were horrible, very old fashion, very basic and very cold!!Staff were rude and Manager advised me to wirte to the Head Office for a resolution.. Wrote to the Head office, but the Manager who responded just regurgetated my letter in his reply and just said sorry, no resolution offered, wasn't happy at all. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!! Very poor quality and over priced. Travelodge at Liverpool street far better than this one and that is a 3 star and much cheaper!!	
May 2 2006 	Not even worth 1 star	We chose this hotel as part of a business dinner, based on its star rating and location to central London. How shocked we were.The hotel is about a 10-minute walk to Canary Wharf and the many bars and shops there, as well as a 5 minute walk to South Quay Docklands Light Railway Station, with its links to the City and the rest of the Docklands area.Even though it's a 4-star hotel, the decor of the bulding is incredibly dated. It was maybe a 4-star 20 years ago, but our room was dirty, with furnishings that should have been thrown out years ago.On arrival the staff, though efficient, weren't very polite. We headed down to use the pool and that was an experience. The pool area was dirty, the changing areas looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in weeks and there was no help how to get a key to use a locker. We had to just leave our valuables by the side of the pool. The floor of the sauna was also littered with rubbish. Disgusting.The rest of the hotel could best be described as okay. The room on the first floor where we had the dinner had good views of Docklands and the service staff were pleasant enough. The bar area afterwards lacked any sofas or seats - many people were standing.Give this a miss if you can. This isn't even worth one star.	
May 1 2006	Only stayed for one night but would recommend	This hotel is easy to find from the tube station and also located near a shopping centre. From our bedroom window we could see the Millenium Dome!! I have read other people's reviews of this hotel but I did not use the pool or eat in the restaurant so I cannot comment on those facilities but if you are looking for a hotel to impress this is the one.	
Apr 25 2006	Average hotel - Good location for Docklands	Stayed here for one night before the london marathon.Pre-booked room on a discount website - check-in was very fast and efficient.Room was very large - looked like it had been re-furbished recently but bathroom certainly hadn't been redecorated for a while. Everything worked apart from the Air Con that was rubbish (a number of other reviews have stated this) Did not eat at restaurant as I point blank refuse to spend £14 on breakfast.Location was good, 5 minute walk from Herons Quay DLR station - nice views over London.Fast, efficient checkout and a concierge service to look after your bags (charged £1 per item per day)In conclusion - a decent hotel if you were looking for a docklands based trip.	
Apr 24 2006	Would not return to the Britannia International	My husband and I booked this hotel as a treat for our first wedding anniversary, on paper the hotel seems very nice - especially it's location, but in practice it was a complete let down. The hotel reception area was very nice but was not a true reflection on the rest of the hotel. The rooms were basic - you could find more luxury in a Travel Lodge - but the view from the bedroom window was exceptional. The staff spoke extremely basic English which was really akward when asking general questions about the hotel facilities or directions - They were also really unhelpful. We had taken with us a vintage bottle of champagne which we wanted to drink in our room on our actual wedding anniversary - they begrudged us two champagne glasses. The weekend also had hidden charges such as you weren't allowed to take towels from your room to the pool and instead had to pay to hire towels in the pool area, which is something I have never heard of. The pool area itself had mould on the ceiling and wires hanging down which was neither pleasant nor safe and we were 'grunted' at when we asked for change for the lockers. Breakfast was a fiasco in itself. Usually you are given some instruction as to where to sit or to help yourself to the buffett. We recieved neither and were made to sit at a dirty table and were expected to use up the rest of the pot of tea that had been left from the people before us - we were made well aware of the inconvieniance we were causing by asking for a fresh one. The final straw arrived when we had asked the night before for a one hour extention to our check out time - which surprisingly we were granted only for the receptionist to try and charge us for the extra hour as nobody had written down the extention we had been given. The one saving grace for the weekend was the location of the hotel - Canary Wharf is a fantastic place with fantastic shopping/restaurants etc and is also really easy to get to central london - a visit to the Wharf is a must. However, I wouldn't recommend a stay at the Brittania International Hotel due to the exceptionally poor service and accomodation that is much in need to a face lift.	
Apr 4 2006 	You will Not get a better deal in London	The Britannia International Hotel offers jacuzzi rooms, carvery restaurant, hotel bar, car parking, swimming pool, gym and a cool canary wharf location.Anyone who gives this hotel less than 4 stars on this has never travelled before. Sound advice for travelling in London - &quot;If you want your bags taken up to the room, ask somebody&quot;.I stayed here on valentines day, in a jacuzzi room for 75 pounds through hotel-Assist. Excellent price, had dinner with the Thames just 2 inches from our table, in the riverside restaurant, and there was a wedding in the hotels banquet rooms - cant be that bad if people get married here. Dont be put off of this hotel by peoples rants, they would be more at home in a 2 star hotel, whining about anything and everything. Go here and you will be pleased!	
Mar 31 2006 	Horrible hotel	I am giving this hotel one star, just because it is actually meant to be a 4-star hotel. Rooms were average, service was dramatic, and staff were rude. Avoid this hotel. You can do better.	
Mar 12 2006 	Unfortunately cannot say good things about the Britannia International	We just returned from London where we stayed three nights at the Park Lane Hotel in Piccadilly and then four nights at the Britannia International in Canary Wharf. Whereas the Park Lane Hotel was very nice, we cannot say the same about the Britannia.To be short and to the point, I shall mention the things that need to be fixed:1. The dinning room that serves breakfast (Jenny's) is far from being clean. The plates and glasses are plain filthy as is the cutlery. I wanted to take an egg cup for a soft boiled egg but there was not one clean one. I also noticed how the staff set the tables, holding cups with their thumb in the cup and the forks by the tip of the fork instead of the handle. The floor was outright dirty. Service was non-existent. We had to call out several times for some passing staffer to bring us coffee. Yet, their were several staff members/waiters just standing around doing nothing. The food buffet was not arranged nicely and was not attractive. One evening, we had dinner at the same restaurant and even then the service was awful and it was dirty.2. The room decor is very unattractive, but that is not the staff's fault. What was their fault, was that the room was very stuffy as the ventilation did not work properly and the bathroom sink was clogged. We asked housekeeping to fix those two things, but nothing was done. So, to solve the air problem we wanted to open a window. In order to open and close the windows, one has to call the concierge, which we did. We then left the room and came back much later to find that it had rained in and that somebody from housekeeping had drawn the curtain over the open window, but nobody actually closed it, so it got wet all around the window.3. We had two phone messages, both important. There was no message light blinking or on, so we had no way of knowing that we had messages waiting. Only many hours later (one was actually the next morning), did we receive a phone call with the messages. That is not service and there is no excuse for it.4. We found the front desk staff polite but completely nonchalant. We asked wether we could check out one hour later and were told that they would have to charge us BP10 for that. Again, that is not a way to attract hotel guests to come back.I see that the Britannia Hotels are trying very hard to improve their Internet bookings. May be they should rather look at improving their hotels, at least this one.I for once, will never recommend to anyone to stay at this hotel and after this experience, I doubt that we will even want to try another Britannia Hotel.	
Mar 1 2006	Ok nothing special	We stayed here for the London Marathon Weekend as they were offering a package through the hotel. Te experience was pretty bland, the room was ok (although two twin beds pushed together is not a double), and the service was ok (nobody helped with bags and our room wasn't ready even though we arrived after the advertised check in time).We ordered breakfast to be delivered to the room (as we had 26 miles to run we wanted a bit of substinance). This didn't arrive and we had to get something and eat it on the way, although they still managed to charge us for this breakfast!On the whole, we got a very cheap price and had an OK stay.	
Feb 17 2006 	Pretty nice but uncomfortable beds	I decided to stay at the Britannia since it was half the price of the Marriott. The room was very nice - sort of an antique feel, without feeling &quot;old&quot;. I stayed in a superior room, which was the size of a standard US room. My only gripe was the &quot;double bed&quot;, which was really 2 single beds pushed together. The mattress was very thin and not very comfortable. But I got a room with a great view of the water, and the staff was generally friendly.	
Jan 25 2006 	Watch out if you're from a EUR country	When checking out with a non-UK credit card, the hotel tries to force you to pay in EUR instead of GBP, using a rate that is much higher than the rate commonly charged through credit cards. When commenting that I´d like to pay in local currency, i.e. GBP, only, the hotel staff starts using strange arguments and is very unfriendly when one insists on paying in GBP. This has happened several times now. I find this behaviour (that has happened to my colleagues as well) very strange. I think I have the right to pay in local currency!	
Jan 3 2006	What more could you ask for?!?!?	My boyfriend booked this hotel for my 21st and it has been the best hotel i have stopped in. I felt like a celebrity walking into reception on the red carpet. The rooms are lovely and i had a gorgeous view of canary whalf, millenium dome and the river along with all the buildings in the Docklands. Its a bit out of the way to get to west end.The only thing i can fault on was the breakfast which i was totally disgusted in. so im glad i didnt actually pay for it as it came with a deal as part of the hotel. I will definetely be stopping here again!	
Jan 2 2006 	A forgetable experience	A clean and value for money room with the discounted rates, but the buffet breakfast was a stampede on the first morning. The four star rating is very questionable, with the health studio and swimming pool one of the most unhygenic that I have seen. Will not be returning.Mike G.	
Oct 9 2005 	My worst hotel experience	I pulled up in a taxi and saw three men, who appeared to work for the hotel, standing around talking to each other. When none of them came to help me with my bags I assumed they weren't hotel staff after all. Silly me. I checked in. Still no mention of anyone to help with my bags, so I lumbered up to my room myself. The level of service described by this introduction to the Britannia turned out to be utterly representative of the rest of my experience. On my first morning, I did not receive my requested wake-up call. One night I came back to the hotel at about 11:15pm. I needed a quick meal and to get to bed. I tried to phone room service and couldn't get through. I finally phoned the front desk and they said they would get them to phone me. 10 minutes later I gave up waiting and after a couple more tries got through to room service. They never got the message. I ordered a turkey and cranberry sandwich - it seemed like the least offensive option on an extremely limited sandwich-only menu. When it arrived 45 minutes later, it turned out to be the most disgusting food I have ever been served in a hotel. Without a shred of exageration, the bread was stale, the turkey was represented by a thin slice of some processed turkey food product, there was not a trace of cranberry on it (and that was the only hope for flavor on this sandwich), and, worst of all, the lettuce was not only completely limp, but in places it was actually black and slimy with rot - the kind of thing that anyone else would have thrown away days ago. It was utterly insulting to be served that sandwich. When I complained, holding up a piece of the limp rotten lettuce, the room service waiter said 'That's the Britannia'. Straight from the horse's mouth. The replacement sandwich - hold the lettuce - was not much better but I managed to get some of it down before putting myself to bed shortly before 1:00am. The epilogue to that story is equally unreal. I had left the room service tray in my room. Housekeeping had removed it and placed it in the hallway, where it remained. It was there when I got back to my room at 10:00pm the next night, and it was there when I peeked my head out the door at midnight. To their credit, it was gone by morning, and so was I. When I got into the cab the driver figured I was going to the airport. No, I said, going to a different hotel. The driver laughed - it was not the first time he had ferried weary Britannia survivers to alternate accommodation. One comment he offerred was about the number of times he has pulled up with guests only to find the staff standing around talking, with absolutely no intention of helping anyone with their bags. In fairness, there was one waiter in the breakfast room who gave good service.I will never consider staying at the Britannia again.	
Aug 23 2005	Huge room great breakfast	Twin room very spacious, nice view over Canary Wharf to Millenium dome, dockland railway outside window but did not disturb us, breakfast excellent value, we had a three course feast. Takes a bit of time to get there on underground, but Jubilee line quite speedy.Leisure facilities could do with a coat of paint and bit of TLC. Last Minute price deal excellent - full price out of my range.	
Jun 12 2005	A mixed bag	Having stayed at the Hilton Docklands 3 weeks earlier it was interesting to compare the two. On the plus side the room we had in the International was bigger and access to the both the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and the Tube was only a 5 minute walk away. On the down side, the breakfast was worse than the Hilton with no yoghurt or muesli and no signs telling you what sort of milk or juice you were drinking. The promised free bottle of wine never materialised and as the weather was warm we kept the window open only to be deafened by the sound of the DLR as it went over the bridge between South Quays and Heron Quays stations. I find it very strange that there is such a big difference in the ratings between this hotel and the Hilton across the river - I think that taking all things into account there's little difference.	
Jun 10 2005	Bland!	After reading all the bad reviews was somewhat apprehensive about staying here. Check in was ok, but as mentioned before double bed was 2 singles pushed together. Breakfast was ok. Bad points are the horrendous stifling heat in the bedrooms at night time,the a/c must kick off. Everywhere including the non-smoking rooms smells of stale tobacco and the entire hotel needs a revamp. Major gripe is that you cant use the phone in your room unless you authorise £50 against your credit card to have it activated.Dont think I would stay here again.	
May 30 2005	Somewhat ordinary	Hotel was o.k. but unspectacular. We stayed one night only. The exterior is brutish and somewhat unwelcoming. Unfortunately, the interior (once you have cleared reception) varies between the garish, dated and downright tacky.The hotel badly needs an overhaul. The decor needs enlivening. Staff were fine though.Worst bit was the leisure facility. The pool was in a really poor state - with peeling plastework in evidence and mould all over the ceiling.For a purportedly 4 star hotel, I think the owners must really do better than this.I would pitch it at more like 2/3 stars - so to this extent £125 for a night for a weekend break family room did not feel like the good value I thought it would be !!We spent the two previous nights in a Premier Travel Inn at £48 a night. It was no worse than the International......	
Apr 28 2005	Excellent Stay	Excellent Hotel and a great location, many bars and shops close by. Also just a short walk away from the Undergound and DLR.	
Apr 9 2005	Good hotel but noisy	Recently took a 2 day break in this hotel. Extremely easy to find right in the centre of Docklands and next to Canary Wharf tower. Easy to drive to hotel with car parking at £15 per day underneath. Can also be reached by Docklands light railway and Canary Wharf underground station on the Jubilee line. Both stops around 10 minute walk from hotel. Initially presentation of entrance and reception to hotel very good. Staff are very helpful, with a tang of european accents as is the case in many uk hotels now. Room was perfectly adequate twin with ensuite. Great views over London and the River Thames from the 12th floor. Price was excellent value with a leisure break only costing around £150 including breakfast for both nights. Easy to book rooms on line. Large amount of building work currently taking place in the area although this is mainly confined to the working hours of 8 - 5 and did not cause us any problems with noise. Looks like planning permission has been granted for large 15 tower building to be erected next to the hotel but this has not started yet but will certainly restrict hotel views when completed probably in a couple of years time and I would suggest will create noise whilst being built. Biggest noise problem we experienced was the light railway which is elevated across the dock below. This runs every 3 minutes from 5.30am to midnight and sounds like a jet plane taking off. Should get used to this after the first night and does make interesting viewing from the hotel room. Hotel is well placed just outside the hustle and bussle of central London which can be reached by tube, bus or railway in 30 minutes from the hotel.	
Apr 6 2005	You can probably do better	My husband and I live in London and needed a place to stay between leases. We were at Britannia for a week and then at the Novotel Greenwich (which is much better). This hotel does have good points. It is convenient to Canary Wharf the DLR and Jubilee line. The room and bathroom are spacious and clean enough with old style furnishings that may be considered quaint (or tacky). The concierge on duty in the evenings was fantastic.The restaurant and pizzaria food was overpriced for the quality. But the worst parts were the uncomfortable bed and the eternity spent in the lifts every day. We didn't have a good night's sleep all week.We paid about 100 pounds per night and that was too much. The Novotel Greenwich is a little more out of the way, but we only spent about 75 per night there for an excellent hotel.	
Mar 15 2005	What a wonderfull hotel	This hotel was wonderfull, I could not fault it other that the breakfast being very overpriced, Two bowles of cereal and a cupper for nearly £13.The Room we had was a Jacuzzi room i was actually supprised how good it was(go easy on the bubble bath that thing multiplys them), It was a very large room with a very nice view, the staff were helpfull without being intrusive, the dinner in the resaurant was fab a 3 course meal for only £13.50 bargain no matter where you come from.The bar was comfortable with a view over the river,And most important it was clean through out .You wont be dissapointed .	
Mar 1 2005	Good lively hotel!	Ive stayed here a number of times now, the rooms are average in size and have a old style decor but are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is a tasty all you can eat buffet. The best bit of this hotel was the bar which seems to stay open till 5am in the week and 3am at the weekend. Really nice friendly atmosphere. I would definately stay here again. Prices vary but seems to be cheepest to book it through the hotel groups website.	
Feb 19 2005	Looks great actually very average	I have stayed in the Britannia a couple of times and have been amazed at the fluctuating levels of service. There have been times when I have been happy here but there seems to be no middle-ground in terms of service (which can be truly dreadful) and quality of the rooms.I am sure that when it first opened it was great but the general over-the-top decor and chintzy look belies the fact that this hotel really isn't that good.Expect to wait ages to check-out and for the lifts (which seem to break-down a lot). Also expect to have a fairly shambolic breakfast served by hard-worked imported staff that speak little English.I understand that this hotel teeters on the edge of exclusion by most major travel companies booking for business e.g. Hogg Robinson / BTI and it's easy to see why...The Hilton, Docklands is on the other side of the river but is actually a much better hotel - and is only an extra 10 minutes away. Alternatively, bigger budgets should stretch to the Four Seasons which is excellent.	
Dec 4 2004	Good for a night not a long holiday...	I stayed at the Britannia International Hotel for a night for a very dicounted price. My room was comfortable and quiet with a lovely view but the furniture and bedsheets/blankets were certainly in need of replacement. The staff were delightful, as they were completely overbooked the following night they found me a hotel room in another hotel at a discounted rate and this was extremely helpful. Every staff person I met was helpful so I have to disagree with some of the other reviews in terms of staff. I would not stay here more than one night since I found the decor quite depressing and very outdated but the area is safe, convenient to the underground and a very nice shopping centre is nearby. The views from the hotel are brilliant but the interior definitely needs some style and re-vamping, there were shabby reproductions of art, halogen lamps from the 80s and the most bizarre chandelier right above the window. I would stay again (and perhaps for longer) if they rennovated a bit!	
Nov 27 2004	Good hotel just a few things....	We stayed for 2 nights over a weekend in November, and overall found the hotel a nice place. We got a really good rate of£60.00 per night for a fairly basic but pleasant double room that had a lovely view of the Thames. The downsides were check in - we had to queue for 45 minutes on a Saturday at 4pm to check in.. when we finally got to the front the concierge (who decided to help out on reception) could not find our details for 5 minutes and explained she had not been trained in all aspects of check in. When we checked out on the Monday morning there was no queue but the hotel refused to credit our £11.80 deposit we had already paid to the booking agent saying they had not received (even though we had it in writing!) so we had to pay the full amount - we are still in the process of trying to get this back!On the upside there is a lovely bar/lounge area we used after going in to the West end each night, and hotel is nicely located just 5 minute walk from the tube station. Would consider staying again but would double check the situation with deposits first!	
Nov 7 2004	Great choice!!!	Excellent choice for whatever purpose, even holidays, though the hotel is located near the biggest business center of London (Canary Wharf). The hotel is located near the tube station and pretty modern shopping mall. There is also a DLR train station which can get you to the city center or to Greenwich in no time.If you get a room with a view on Canary Wharf side you'll be amazed. The view is fantastic. Rooms are pretty big, clean and bright.The only disadvatage of the hotel is that if you're there for the first time, it's pretty hard to find if you're out of the tube. But once you'll get there, it all get easy.This hotel is pretty expensive so try to book in advance through the Internet (you can get 60% discount rate).We've been there for a week (9-16 August 2004), and we would surely return there. Overall - great place.	
Nov 7 2004	glad i didnt pay full price	we got a cheap room here for our first night in london after the flight, so we basically didnt intend going sightseeing and just wanted to rest and take things easy. Found the room to be nice, the staff were polite. the only thing i could really find fault with were the fact that the room was very hot and the AC didnt seem to make any difference and that the double bed was in fact 2 single mattresses which made some things a little harder ;)location is secluded and peaceful, rooms on a par with most other 4* hotels ive stayed in around the world. Would go again if the price was as good (£70) but only as a first night after the long flight as there is very little to do in the local surrounding area.	
Sep 28 2004	Get a suite!	We were checked in quickly by the helpful staff. Unfortunately the legibility of the room number and departure date attached to the key meant we had to return to the desk to re-confirm both. The date of departure looked decidedly more like a 25 than a 26, and despite several assurances from the desk staff I was glad to find our door keys still worked on the evening of the 25th.The room itself was adequate in size but I had a few issues with the maintenance of the room. The lavatory flushing handle was hanging precariously from the wall and had obviously been so for some time. The back of the remote control was missing and I had to keep the batteries pressed in to make it work. I know these things are as a result of misuse by previous guests but these are obvious defects which should have been sorted out.Our travelling companions had a junior suite which was much better value. The view across London from the balcony was very impressive.I was disappointed with the rather petty £2.50 additional charge for the pool and leisure facilities. I would have liked to have commented on them as well but what they failed to mention at the time of booking was the restricted opening hours at the weekendDont get me wrong, the hotel isnt all that bad and I have certainly stayed in worse hotels in London (some much worse!). Shop around for weekend discounts  if you pay the full price you will feel very short changed. Get the suite if you can, its well worth the extra.	
Sep 9 2004	Excellent hotel in a peaceful area by the water.	My sister and I stayed at this hotel for four days during our stay in London and were very pleased with our choice. We got an excellent deal off the internet that included breakfast (supposed to be Continental but we were able to have a full English breakfast every morning from the breakfast buffet, in a nice dining room right next to the water). Our room was comfortable with plenty of storage, and with air conditioning that worked! It had a nice, private view over the water. The twin beds were narrower than I am used to here in Canada, but they were adequate. Tea and coffee service was provided in the room. The bathroom was large with a jacuzzi tub and a bidet (does anyone actually use these?).The location was perfect for us. It was very quiet and peaceful there - no loud traffic noise. We were a short walk from the South Quay Station of the Docklands Light Railway, and the Canary Wharf underground station was a short walk along the pedestrian walkway, over the water, behind the hotel. This took us into the Jubilee shopping area and the Jubilee Underground line which was excellent, modern, clean, and easy to access.If you are looking for a hotel that is right in the middle of the tourist attractions, then this isn't it, but if you want excellent quality in a peaceful area, with easy access to the underground, then I highly recommend the Britannia International Docklands	
Sep 6 2004	4 star not here!	This really is no 4 star hotel. I stayed for a night on 27 Aug. I was unable to get into my executive room, despite 3 key changes until a concierge &quot;thumped&quot; the lock!The room was shabby, the bathroom poor and towels dingy coloured (grey) as oppsoed to their true colour white. The bin contained the wrapper from one of the two packs of allotted biscuits. I had no fridge and no newspapers. The hallway needed cleaning and hotel staff must learn that DO NOT DISTURB means exactly that!The view and location are excellent and are worth 5 stars.	
Aug 27 2004 	Definitely not a four star hotel	I was greatly disappointed by my brief stay at Britannia International Hotel. I visited London for both business and pleasure, and I was glad my stay in Britannia International was for only one night. I have absolutely no complaints about the local Docklands area. There was a great variety of cafes, shops and entertainment in the local areas. The dockland views are very relaxing and the prestigious city building blocks remind you of New York or Boston skyscrapers. The location is conveniently located near the Canary Wharf train station which links to Tower Bridges underground station. In a very short space of time you can travel directly to the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace. We managed to fit in a whirlwind tour of London in two hours! It is a very good idea to buy an all-day travel pass on the local trains, underground and buses, which can be bought at the train station for about £4.70. The hotel was offering tours for £16, so we made a big saving.The hotel on the other hand was a bit of a let down. The standard of service and rooms were the poorest level I have ever experienced in a four star hotel. The hotel was a three star hotel at best, and only because it contained a number of restaurants and a swimming pool. Reception staff were rude and unfriendly, plus some did not have very good English skills. We ordered breakfast in bed, which the price was not stated on the room service menu and it ended up costing £21! The person who brought up our meal was again very unfriendly, spoke little English and stood in the middle of our room when we were not yet dressed properly. Furthermore, the cleaner tried to enter our room before 9am (some of us like a slight lie-in!). Breakfast was not very exciting consisting of a croissant, two small rolls, some toast and standard cornflakes, and not fresh orange. We went to the buffet restaurant to eat which was good value for money, but not a great standard of food. The room was fine, but was starting to become a little shabby. The mirror in the bathroom was starting to discolour, our lamp was on the verge of going in the bin, the bed sheets were old-fashioned and Im not very keen on shower curtains in hotels.However, there were some good points of the hotel. The best part of the hotel has to be the views. I decided to hold my business meeting at the lounge overlooking the docks, which was a very civilised and relaxed setting. Furthermore, I couldnt have any complaints about my room view, which looked over the water and even partially showed the Millennium Dome.I would not recommend staying in this hotel for a holiday break.It was ok for one night, but Ill be looking for somewhere else in the Docklands area next time I visit.
