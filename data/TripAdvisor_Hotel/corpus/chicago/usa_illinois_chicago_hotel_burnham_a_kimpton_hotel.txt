	Overall good although tiny room	We usually stay at the Monaco down the street, but we couldn't get a room for Saturday night. So, I booked a great deal with the Burnham. The room was cute, although really small (and we have a NYC apartment, so that's saying something). It was fine for the night, although it wouldn't have suited us and our dog for more than one day. Other than that, everything was fine. The service was good, very helpful and accomodating.	
	the Burnham my kind of hotel; Chicago my kind of town.	What a delight to stay at the Hotel Burnham. Our stay was perfect from check in to departure. Tracy and Sara at the front desk, Reggie at the door, Christine at the restaurant, all went above and beyond to make our stay warm and pleasant. Our dog Jack was treated like a royal pup, every effort was made by the staff to make our stay the best it could be. I slept like a baby in the comfortable bed. The room and the hotel are spotlessly clean. The restaurant food delicous and don't forget WINE TIME every evening in the lobby. Just perfect. Can't wait to get back after the new furniture is in place in the rooms.	
	Excellent stay at a historic landmark!	Stayed in the Burnham for 3 nights in September 2009. We won this hotel on Priceline and were very lucky with the Burnham. This hotel is just great: incredible staff, central location, amazing building. The Kimpton Group obviously did a great job in restoring this historic landmark! The rooms were smaller than average, but they were nicely decorated and added to the boutique atmosphere. We had a room on the top floor, overlooking the Chicago Theater, which was quite a view.We had dinner at the Atwood Café, which was lovely. Chicago's major attractions were within walking distance (The El, Chicago River, magnificent mile,...). For other attractions, public transport is not even a block away (red and blue line, and of course, the El). The blue line is the direct line to O'Hare, so we did not have to order a cab to get from and to the airport.This hotel was a great experience. Would love to stay here again.	
Nov 18 2009 	Worst Business Travel Expierence Possibly Ever"	I booked this hotel through my company's travel website. The rate was about $225 a night. When I got to the front desk they told me that they only had a room with double beds left. I said that I would prefer a room wiht a one king size or at least a queen size bed. They said they were totaly booked for the night. Are they are told to say this? We are in a rescession and no hotel is fully booked for the night.They did not even have a r0om key for me. i checked in at 6:30 pm.Then when I got to the room the bed was literally 5 1/2 feet long. I am over six feet tall. I called to the front desk and against asked if they could please see if anoter room was available. &quot;No sir I am sorry you will have to sleep with your feet hanging over the bed.&quot; was what I was told. REALLY?In addition, I ordered late night room service at 10:30 pm. They had a very limited menu - grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu. However, they didn't even have any one of the 3 items on the list. My only choice was a cold and soggy tuna sandwhich which was clearly over a day old. I ate it anyway and immiediatley began to get sick at both ends.My room was drafty and the noise easily wafted through the glass.The hotel gym is the size of a broom closet.The owner's should really close this hotel if they are not interested in running it properly. I am ashamed for this rat hole!	
Nov 18 2009 	Luxury attention to detail scrumptious food alluring scents and magical staff!	Greeted by a classy and friendly doorman who was also attending the dog bowls out front, as pets are welcome though unseen. Every portion of our stay was carefully planned and pampering... from Reggie's informative guidance to our room, to the coffee and tea service in the warm and cozy lobby. The room decor created a feeling of royalty and the view to the beautiful scene below of the Chicago street buzz and buildings were perfect. My only wish was that I could have eaten EVERY meal in the incredible restaurant. Each flavor was a delight to behold and the staff followed the attentive care all the way through out stay. A true delight in sights, sounds and smells to nurture the soul.	
Nov 17 2009 	Perfectly Small in a Big City	In large cities choices abound, and sometimes the best are the smaller boutique hotels that combine the cities history and accomodations enjoyed by a much larger upscale hotel. Hotel Burnham does both beautifully. Never thought you'd want to stay 24 hours at the office - but even though this hotel has retained this historical office feel and unique look - it is what a hotel should be clean, comfortable, spacious and inviting. Rooms are ample, baths are spacious. Housekeeping is top notch. Staff is excellent, the hotel sweats the details for coffee morning service in the lobby (even putting out a spread of donuts, croissants, muffins and juices when the restaurant (very popular) was closed for breakfast due to the holiday.Location is excellent to several El lines within blocks, shopping, Millenium Park, the theatre district, numerous restaurant and pizza choices and Sugar Bliss cupcakes!!! Yea!Excellent value - interior architecture and design feels like your living Mad Men. Beautiful!	
Nov 15 2009 	We loved this hotel.	It was perfect for our needs - and the service was unparalleled. The location was perfect for the theater weekend we had planned. Our room was lovely, if small, with very comfortable beds and a view of Macy's with its lighted Christmas windows. The desk personnel, housekeepers, and bellman were all very attentive - as well as the servers at the Atwood Cafe in the lobby. We walked to the Art Institute, Macy's, Millenium Park, two theaters, and Pizano's without difficulty. The El is only a block away. We would love to stay here again someday.	
Nov 8 2009 	Perfect location great trip	We visited Chicago the last weekend in October. Yes, Halloween weekend. Not that that affected our review at all.The hotel is right in the heart of Chicago. Perfect location. It's on the corner of State Street and Washington. A couple blocks one way is Millennium Park. A couple blocks the other way is the Chicago River. A short walk away from the Art Institute. A couple blocks away from Metro and bus stops. Making the entire city easily accessible.The hotel room was great. We asked from a room facing State Street when we checked in because there is some construction across Washington. We got an end room on the 12th floor. Great view down Washington toward Millennium Park and also down State Street toward the Chicago River, with a view of the Chicago Theater.The room was a modest size. The bathroom was nice. One thing that we found amusing was that the shower head was about 6-7 inches above my head, and I'm 6'3&quot;. That hardly ever happens.The fitness room was small. Not much to it. There are two treadmills, one elliptical, one bike, and a set of free weights. It was a means to get our workout done. There are water and towels provided.The hotel restaurant was one of the better reviewed restaurants in the city. Some thing we didn't expect. I was recommended to eat at the Atwood Cafe and upon looking it up, I discovered it was at our hotel. The food was very good. Reservations are recommended. You can make those easily through opentable.com. Overall, we had a great trip to Chicago. And we feel this was due in large part to the hotel experience. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. You can't beat the location and service. And if you keep your eyes open for deals, you can stay here for a great price.	
Oct 30 2009 	Unique and Inviting	Hotel Burnham brings life to a historic building. Room was unique and kept clean. Common areas were very inviting. Food in downstairs restaurant (Atwood Cafe) was excellent, but it was closed on New Year's Day and so we had to find another place to eat. Other than that, hotel stay was excellent and location was super convenient for seeing all the sights of Chicago. We would definitely return to this hotel and would certainly stay in another Kimpton hotel.	
Oct 15 2009 	Perfect hotel for Chicago Marathon weekend	Just got back from a long weekend staying at the Hotel Burnham. I was a particpant in the Chicago Marathon. Got a great rate on this hotel on Priceline (due to the weekend I did book about 8 months in advance). The staff was wonderful to my family and myself the entire weekend including providing my son with some free drinks while my family was standing out front of the hotel watching the marathon (the course goes right past at about mile 1.5). The hotel also provided all runners with a free breakfast the morning of the race and all of the staff came out to congratulate me upon my return to the hotel. The room was wonderful and the view to the north seeing the Chicago Theatre right up the street and the Chicago skyline was great. The buidling itself is beatiful as noted in previous post and the hotel does a great job of keeping the buidling updated but also appearing close to the original condition and providing a history of one of Chicago's landmark buildings.	
Oct 12 2009 	A great place to stay in the loop	On our first trip to Chicago my wife and I took Amtrak from Portland, Or. That was an adventure in its self. I did a lot of research on line about where to stay and decided on the Burnham because of various recommendations NOT from previous travelers but from other sources. My wife has MS and cannot walk long distances (a few blocks before being pooped out) so I wanted some place close to the attractions we wanted to see. The hotel location was perfect. The hotel got us a wheelchair, at no cost to us, and we went all over the loop area. We only used the restaurant once (for breakfast) because of the many places to eat just around the corners from the hotel.	
Oct 12 2009 	Great location good staff	The hotel is located centrally and it was easy to get to my client. The staff was generally knowledgeable about the area and gave good restaurant recommendations.	
Oct 10 2009 	Perfect	We checked in early with little expectations but were greated with huge smiles and accommodated immeditaley. The staff at the door and the desk could not have been nicer. The room although small was perfect and given it is an historic building -understood. Loved the Atwood cafe - wish more hotels had cool places like this to eat- Will definatley go again.	
Oct 9 2009 	A Perfect Place to Stay in Chicago	This hotel is a real discovery! We liked staying there so much that it may be the reason we go back to Chicago again. A man we met on the elevator agreed; he has been staying at the Hotel Burnham for the past 12 years! EVERY time he comes to Chicago. This hotel is beautiful and comfortable. Everything from the personable and helpful staff to the complementary morning coffee and wine reception make staying here a delight. The rooms were awesome... complete with animal print terry cloth robes and yoga DVDs. The restaurant downstairs is excellent for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night snacks (all of which we enjoyed while there). We had a corner room with a lovely sitting area and a view of Macy's on the opposite corner, and the park and lake several blocks away. It seemed that almost everything was within walking distance.	
Oct 8 2009 	The best post-vacation vacation!	Kimpton offered me a great deal for being a Kimpton Intouch member, so I couldn't resist the offer of staying in the historic Burnham Reliance building in the El section of Chicago. The location is prime. Walking distance to the Art Institute, two blocks away from Millennium Park, one block away from the Cultural Center. And the shopping, watch out! You're right around the corner from Nordstrom Rack, kitty corner from Macy's (Marshall Field), and across from Old Navy. From my window, I could see the Chicago Theater sign. After roaming around Eastern Europe for three weeks, I wanted to keep this trip low-keyed and slower-paced. Because of the location, I did not have to rush around and was able to do a couple of things a day at a leisurely pace and still make the wine reception at 5 p.m. The bed was comfortable and everything was spic and span. The staff was kind and helpful, and the lobby felt like my living room after a couple of days.	
Oct 8 2009 	Lots of character great value!	Hotel Burnham was much more than I expected. The hotel has wonderful character and a great staff. The room was very comfortable and richly decorated. The bed was to die for! Two plush robes are provided as well as very nice toiletries. I look forward to staying at Hotel Burnham again!	
Oct 1 2009 	Hotel Burnham is a special place	This month marked my 4th stay at Hotel Burnham which has given me ample opportunity to make a fair assessment. The unpretentious staff has been consistently courteous, eager to please, and seem to genuinely want guests to feel welcomed. The hotel is centrally located in The Loop with Millennium Park and the Art Institute a short walk away.The physicality of the hotel stands out: it is stunningly gorgeous and its meticulous renovation (it is a historical site formerly known as the Reliance Building) shines. Elegant, exposed wrought iron stairs, marble wainscotting, and period light fixtures all add to its understated elegance. The standard electronic room keys were replaced by keys on brass rings. The rooms are attractive and spotless (many have chaise lounges in the bay window), cozy but not cramped, and are equipped with stereos, and, by request, a goldfish for the lonely traveler. The curtains are elegant, sporting excerpts from Mozart scores.Newspapers appear at your door, gratis, free morning coffee is available in the lobby, and there is a daily complimentary wine hour which features quality wines. Wake-up calls are performed by the staff rather than the electronic way, adding a human touch. The staff will also print your boarding pass!While the hotel is a quiet one (I am sensitive to noise), I would recommend requesting a room on a higher floor (above 7) that faces Washington Street since State Street often has street performing drummers.While I tend to dine outside of hotels, I found the Atwood Cafe in the lobby to be excellent with a creative menu.My four stays at Hotel Burnham have been consistently outstanding.	
Oct 1 2009 	Chicago At its BEST	In the heart of down town chicago! Shopping, parks,public transit and great restaurants(Atwood cafe was superb)at your door steep or should say at the hotels door step. Staff was excellent and super clean hotel. No matter if Im in Chicago for visit or business i will defiantly come back to hotel Burnham.	
Sep 22 2009 	What a gem!! Absolute Fantastic hotel!	I only stayed here for one night (my last one when I was in Chicago) and got a room in this hotel for 129dollars (including cont. breakfast). I choose this hotel based on the reviews here on this site and the fact it is situated in a historic landmark in Chicago.I wasn't dissapointed! This hotel is very very special. Great, helpfull and very friendly staff but the big surprise for me was the room. I expected a normal room with a bed and bathroom but I got a suite. It was situaed on the corner and on the second floor. The room was very spacious indeed; if needed I had 2 tv's. A big comfy bed, de ceilingheight in thse kind of old buildings are alwaus higher then normal but here it was gigantic! Gives you even more feel of the space you got in your room.The free tasting of wine in the lobby (between 5 and 6pm) was nice for me, since i checked in between those times coming from Toronto. Friends of mine from chicago came to visit me in the room later and they were blown away by the room (even more so getting it for the rate i did!)Bathroom was of a good space and was very clean. Bath/shower combo isn't a problem for me.Situated near almost every subwayline you can wish for in chicago the location is just excellent. Even for shoppers since Macy is across the street!The lobby, elevatorsarea and staircase give it also that extra touch to the hotel.The free continental breakfast downstairs was good enough for me (I am not such a breakfast guy for that matter) but I would understand if somebody would find that a bit to little (although you can get extra stuff for offcourse extra dollars)Since my plane left the day after in the evening it was no problem to leave my luggage safe at the hotel after checking out so I could go around the city the last time before going back home!	
Sep 6 2009 	A bright jewel in the heart of Chicago	This hotel is styled with quicky 1920s touches such as art deco furniture, blue velvet music themed curtains/bedspreads. The beds are comfy, but do overtake the &quot;single&quot; king rooms. The bathrooms and rooms are on the small side - but I don't expect much larger when staying downtown in a city. The hotel is in a renovated bank building - so the elevators are a bit tiny and slow, but this is not a complaint.I loved the Kimpton touches: &quot;happy hour&quot; with free wine and sangria with Nintendo Wii in the small lobby, hot coffee or tea in the mornings with &quot;to go&quot; cups/tops, free wifi. The location is great - short walks to Millenium Park, the Chicago Museum of Art, subway and theaters. The staff were welcoming and helpful with directions, maps and suggestions. I loved my stay - would definitely recommend! (Look out for specials from Kimpton or other travel sites...got my room for $99 - can't beat that!)	
Aug 27 2009 	I might have found the best boutique hotel in the city.	The staff here is genuine and friendly. It's a wonderful feeling when each member greets you by name everytime you walk into the lobby. They were so accommodating to my dog and had treats for him which he really enjoyed. Also, the concierges and agents were helpful in everything from recommending the best jazz clubs to getting baseball tickets to helping us find late night Chicago eats. Speaking of late night ask about the pillow library! At the Burnham you're not only in prime location close to all modes of transportation, but the building itself it beautiful. If you're a fan Eric Larson's Devil in The White City or an architecture buff you'd really appreciate the interior design and iron work of this building. The hotel's restaurant, the Atwood Cafe, is some of the best comfort food you'll find.	
Aug 27 2009 	PRICELESS EXPERIENCE!	I must say staying at the Hotel Burnham really took the whole experience of Chicago up to another level. We just spent a long weekend in Chicago. As an architect, the fact that I am staying in the Reliance Building --- so brilliantly restored --- is a dream come true. It is part of American architectural history. This is one of the first skyscrappers in the world! The elevator lobby is a sight to behold. We stayed on the 14th floor. The room door had the original hardware. It is a very compact hotel, and the way spaces are utilized is very fascinating and efficient. Even though we were right next to the elevators, there wasn't much noise. We would hear the &quot;L&quot; go by, but that is lovingly considered as part of the experience of being in the center of the Chicago &quot;Loop&quot;. Even little quirks in the room such as loose cabinet doors and bathroom doors that wouldn't close entirely didn't bother us much. We are within walking distance to many historical downtown buildings, and two blocks away from the amazing Millenium Park and Art Institute (with its new Modern Wing). The Hotel Burnham is rated as a 3-star hotel, although with all the history, charm, and character I feel it is definitely a priceless 5-star experience.	
Aug 17 2009 	All the good reviews are true!	We stayed at the Burnham for 8 nights as my bf works across the road and it was a GREAT place to stay...for an incredibly good price!The rooms themselves are nice,comfy beds,good views but fairly small. Bathroom wasn't too small to cope with. Nice aveda bathroom products too. We were on the top floor and everyone was absolutely lovely and always greeted us warmly no matter what time of day...you really can't beat it for the price!Really enjoyed the Atwood cafe too...but so did alot of people.It's packed in there!Location can't be beat....easy 2 blocks to milennium park,nordstrom rack right next door and state st macy's 10 seconds away. Plenty of food in nearby blocks too eg gold coast hot dogs,sugarbliss cupakes on wabash (best cupcakes ever!) and oasis felafel sandwiches! could not ask for better shopping location and Chicago is easy to walk...I walked to the mag mile quite a few times and it was a breeze.A few teeeny problems, most of which we only came across because we stayed 8 nights. They wouldn't give us a 2 hour later checkout (on a monday!)which would have really helped my bf out as he was stuck in important meetings and they weren't very nice about it. That was annoying.The tv kept breaking but we were told it happens alot and new tv's were coming in next year. The cafe closes at 10am on weekends for breakfast...10AM! This one only really annoyed me but I would have liked it if you could enter through the side doors instead of exit only...it was annoying.Another slight problem probably only affected the top level and that was tours coming through looking at the architecture...man that tour lady could yell! but it wasn't really a big deal...you just have to fight through a bit of a crowd to get to your room..All in all for the price..it's a great deal and def worth a stay!	
Aug 13 2009 	Best Location in Chicago!	I loved this hotel - it was charming, well-kept and located right in the middle of everything! Very easy to get to from Midway airport (just take the orange line to Washington and walk a few blocks...looked like it was also easily accesible from O'Hare too), my friend and I hardly had to use our CTA passes! The rooms are a little on the small side - but you're not staying in a hotel to practice gymnastics now, are you? Most comfortable bed and pillows, and I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was considering we overlooked the busy street. You're right across the street from Macy's, the red line subway, a few blocks from Millenium and Grant Parks and near lots of theatres, restaurants and attractions. We did take advantage of the breakfast deal ($1 more a day) which was a good deal considering the continental breakfast usually goes for $13 I believe. It looked like the restaurant was generally pretty busy later in the day but we always got a table right away for breakfast! There's also coffee in the mornings and a wine reception in the evenings, neither of which we took advantage of (trying to cram in all our sightseeing took priority!). I wish I'd remembered about the &quot;guppy love&quot; program - you can get a fish to keep you company! It's a pet friendly hotel too - saw a few poochs while there who looked like they approved of the place.	
Aug 7 2009 	Great location great service	Was there for 2 nights mid-week on business. The hotel is historic and charming (real keys for the rooms!) with a very good restaurant providing prompt room service. Tho I didn't travel with a pet, I appreciate that it is pet friendly (and didn't see, hear or smell any pets during my stay). The location is ideal, Macy's, Old Navy, Nordstrom rack literally around the corner, and an easy walk to the trendier shops on Michigan Ave. Two or 3 blocks to Millenium Park and the waterfront, as well as the riverwalk, I had a great morning walk loop down State Street to the riverwalk, down to the lake and back up through the park. There was some construction noise nearby but not too bad. Only negatives were (1) a water leak through the ceiling near the door of my room, which someone came up immediately to address (and offered to switch rooms but I didn't bother) and (2) the bed linens were musty; I found out from the housekeeper that their laundry didn't dry them properly. This was a big annoyance to me as by the time I discovered it I was too tired to complain so just slept on top of the comforter, but the new sheets were fine the next day. I would definitely stay there again.	
Jul 28 2009 	Beautiful tiny jewel	This is a drop dead gorgeous boutique hotel with loads of thoughtful touches. The service is also impeccable. I felt like a pretty princess waking up here every morning. The complimentary wine in the evening is lovely as well. You should know that the rooms are very small, however. I didn't mind, but I am a small person used to apartment-style living and wasn't sharing the room with anyone else. It would not be the best place if you were on business and wanted to get work done - the desk is tiny and almost unusable.	
Jul 27 2009 	Good location Friendly Staff Somewhat Overpriced	My husband had stayed at this hotel several times in the past but this was my first experience. The hotel is located downtown, within minimal walking distance to subway stops, the public Library, Millenium Plaza, and the Museum of Art. My first experience wasn't very positive. I had called to verify that a crib would set up in a room and I was told the reservation was only for two adults and that there was no way they could add a child to the room. The woman stated there were no other rooms available and it was against policy to put a crib in the room, yet after speaking to management they decided that by raising the room rates they could accomodate us in that room. In the end we spent 299.00 a night before fees and taxes for 3 nights and 209.00 a night for our final night. So needless to say I didn't go in thinking this would be a smooth visit but fortunately the staff that we encountered were all very friendly and professional. When we checked in we were actually allowed to go to our room early. The rooms aren't huge but it was larger than I expected. The building is a converted office building so it's architechturally very interesting. There are a few downsides to the building- the elevators are VERY slow and at night we could hear a lot of traffic and sirens coming from outside the windows. Forget renting a car and parking it. First of all there is nowhere to park downtown unless you are willing to shell out an arm and leg. It was over 40.00 a day to park at our hotel. It was much more reasonable to utilize the subway system and taxicabs out to things like the Shedd Museum and Aquarium. The restaurant downstairs frankly wasn't worth the prices. There are far better places to eat, all within walking distance of the hotel. You can sometimes print coupon deals off the Kimpton website to get the continental breakfast for just 1.00. Considering it was over 13.00 for a bowl of fruit, piece of bread and glass of juice the coupon is an excellent deal. The bartenders were friendly and the service was quick but it was 23.00 for one glass of Champagne and a small Bloody Mary- not including tip. Overall we were pleased with the hotel. The crib was very nice- it was an actual crib instead of just a pack and play. We did learn that some of our friends stayed at a place down the road that was just as nice and far less expensive so I do believe that next time we might have to check them out. It's a good hotel but I don't think it was worth $300.00 (after taxes and fees) a night.	
Jul 23 2009 	The place to stay in Chicago	Stayed there June 2008, loved every single thing about it, the service, the warm and accommodating employees, the location, the price. Lovely and special in every detail. If I ever get to go back to Chicago, I will be staying there. We never liked a hotel better.	
Jul 23 2009 	Great hotel great location--all the Kimpton hotels in Chicago are special	I've stayed at Kimpton hotels in Chicago before and never had a bad experience. Their beds and linen are SOOO comfortable and, my pet peeve, they have a full size hairdryer , not one clamped to the wall! Tons of pillows, a goldfish friend if you want one or it is pet friendly if you travel with one. Mini-fridge in each room. Rooms can be small but luxurious. I've always found the staff extremely friendly. I like their free wine in the early evenings and good coffee in the lobby. This hotel has a fantastic location close to everything.	
Jul 22 2009 	The Atwood in the Burnham	This hotel is such a jewel, and the Atwood dining room is no exception. Lovely high ceilings with vintage detailing, red settees at some of the tables along the windows, and interesting chandeliers. After settling into a window table with settee, which my husband sat on being taller than I, we were delighted with the menu offerings and very nice wine list. Great service, delicious and inventive food, all with a window to the bustling State Street crowd.	
Jul 20 2009 	Charming	Everything about the Burnham is just charming and lovely. Yes, the rooms aren't the largest or grandest but the excellent service/staff, the location, the Atwood Restaurant, the fantastically comfortable bed, the lovely decor, and the amazingly beautiful restoration more than make up for the size of the rooms. The first time I visited, we were placed in perhaps the smallest room (Queen), with a rather small bathroom, on the third floor. Despite the not-so-great room/floor, I was still impressed enough to book reservations for a return trip. The second time I visited, we were placed in a somewhat larger room (King), with a view of State Street. Wow! The view from the &quot;Chicago-style&quot; windows was amazing. The service was fantastic--the person who cleaned our room left a hand-written welcome note. I would definitely recommend this hotel.	
Jul 20 2009 	Kimpton Hotels never dissappoint	My husband and I fell in love with the Kimpton Hotels a few years ago in Washington DC. The Hotel Burnham did not disappoint us. The location is perfect - one block to the Blue Line, across the street from the Red Line. Easy train ride from O'Hare to the hotel. The building is gorgeous. The view was great. The bed was a little slice of heaven. The Atwood Cafe has excellent food, and our bar tender, Doug, was wonderful.We are looking forward to visiting the newest Kimpton, Hotel Monaco, in Baltimore, and we are eagerly anticipating the opening of the Palomar in Philadelphia this fall.	
Jul 14 2009 	your own goldfish!! - the food from roomservice was to die for	very cute rooms, very quietstayed in a king size, bed and linens were PERFECTeat at the atwood cafe while you are therethe lobster ragoon was to die for, the mustard sauce, the plum saucejust wow!	
Jul 1 2009 	Highly recommended.	Beautiful hotel. It's always fun to stay at a Kimpton for the amenities and design, although the rooms are often small. The Burnham is a beautifully updated property convenient to everything in the Loop and just a short walk to the L. Don't expect a Sheraton-sized room. Do expect a well-executed urban hotel in a great, historic building. An annoyance: $10 daily charge for wifi. Grrrrr.	
Jun 30 2009 	The perfect Chicago hotel experience	My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week at the Hotel Burnham. This is a small boutique hotel created from the 1895 Reliance Building. Probably our finest hotel experience. Situated in the middle of the Loop, so you have quick access to the elevated trains and attractions like Grant Park and the Sears Tower. Excellent staff with attentive service. The building itself is magnificent, having been the benefit of a meticulous top to bottom restoration. All of the original details are there, with recreations made for those that were missing. The intricate iron grillwork of the original elevators is there, as well as the original iron staircases on each floor. Each room is actually fitted into what were office spaces in the original building. The Atwood Café off the lobby is first class and deserving of its own review. The hotel provides a complimentary wine tasting each day from 5 to 6 PM. Tiny bathroom, but we were so blown away by the rest of the hotel that we can overlook this!	
Jun 29 2009 	Charming hotel	We loved this hotel. Very charming. Very nicely decorated rooms in historic building. Very friendly staff. We also enjoyed the Attwood restaurant for lunch. Room rate was also terrific. Would definitely stay there again.	
Jun 24 2009 	Well worth a try.	Definitely the best service at any hotel in Chicago so far. Tracy at the front desk is a gem - and fixed any problem caused by others - but every employee is concerned with your stay - right down to the guy that changes the air filters. (No kidding.) Rooms are generally small but well appointed. Wine hour is a nice touch. Location is great for theater, shopping, dining, Millenium Park, etc. Easy access from El train. Historic building.	
Jun 23 2009 	Striking architecture - good hotel	Arriving at the hotel, the exterior is strikingly ornate and beautiful. The original architecture continues inside with pretty filligree in the elevators and mosaic tile that I believe is original?? There is a unique feel to the guestroom hallways with the frosted glass 'office' doors - they are very private, though. The guestrooms are standard hotel size and comfortable. I frequent Kimpton hotels and this hotel feels like a Kimpton - cool decor and design, good service, nice amenities in an interesting building. I had a late dinner in the restaurant one night when I arrived back to the hotel from a busy day - service and food quality could have been better, but I was tired and just needed a quick salad and glass of wine. Rooms were comfortable - great desk. The location was also good. I would stay here again.	
Jun 2 2009 	a classy place to stay in the heart of Chicago	When I walked into the Hotel Burnham, I immediately felt at ease. The staff was terrific, notably including the room service waiter who made sure we got exactly what we wanted for dinner, even when the kitchen was super busy. The entire place is decorated in a very classic style. Be sure to eat at least dessert at the Atwood Cafe, it's superb!	
May 14 2009 	Delightful.	Loved this place - great-but-not-snobby service, gorgeous, well-located, spotless, and charming. Our room was fairly small, but quite nicely appointed with a comfortable bed and a desk chair suitable for a human to use for more than ten minutes without having back spasms. Plenty of pillows and towels and blankets and so on (my husband's pet peeve) and nothing smelled of horrible floral detergent (my pet peeve). Meals in the Atwood Cafe were pretty good, as well. We also really enjoyed the dog-friendliness of the place, and the several small dogs visiting. Looking forward to the next visit here.	
May 5 2009 	When can we go back?	A beautiful small hotel! Spent three nights over weekend. An historical building with lots of architectural aspects. Room was small, but adequate; lovely bedding and drapery. The shower was great (this is how my husband rates a hotel room). Location couldn't have been better to enjoy museums, shop, theater. Service was excellent; everyone so friendly and helpful. They will even print out your boarding pass if you are flying. The restaurant was very expensive for breakfast, but the selections were good. We got a great room rate on Travel Zoo, so didn't mind splurging for breakfast one morning. No coffee maker in the room, but free coffee in the lobby each morning. Will definitely stay here again.	
May 3 2009 	Hotel Burnham is fabulous..	Spent 5 nights recently in the Hotel Burnham and can only praise it. *Location - fabulous location on Washington and State in the Loop area. It's near shopping (Macy's is directly across from it, Nordstroms beside it - and many more nearby), theatres and restaurants, parks (Millenium Park is only a few blocks away) and has excellent transit connections (bus and rail) to virtually all parts of Chicago. Couldn't be bettered.*Staff - pleasant, helpful yet non-obtrusive or overly fawning. Just how I like it.*Room - clean, large and well furnished with a fantastic bed. Bathroom was small, but functional and well equipped..the only downside I can find was no universal shaver plug socket..just US style ones. All in all, I really can't think of something bad to say about the Burnham. This is my second stay in a Kimpton Hotel, and my second excellent stay. I'd have no hesitation to recommend this hotel to anyone else.	
May 3 2009 	Visit 	We stayed at the Burnham thinking we were taking a risk staying at a non big name hotel. Instead we were treated to a room decorated with great detail and quality furniture. It was not a bed in a box like the big hotels. The nightly free wine service, the morning free coffee service taking place in their lobby next to the fireplace, very comforting. The restaurant in the hotel has an eclectic and exciting menu, and the items we had near closing time were prepared fresh. The service was personal, a benefit of a small hotel.	
Apr 23 2009 	Weekend getaway in the big city was spectacular.	My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Burnham for a weekend in the city getaway. We enjoyed being able to bring our dog, and the staff went out of their way to make sure he felt at home. Fans of architecture will enjoy this beautiful, historic building. I have stayed at several Kimpton hotels and will continue to frequent the brand.	
Apr 14 2009 	Class and Luxury	I stayed here for only one night while in Chicago to see a show last weekend. I have stayed at other Kimpton Hotels and have enjoyed them, so I was looking forward to this visit. The beginning was not great... I drove up and was valet parking my car with one of their special packages, but the signage was not clear on where to pull up for the valet. When I opened my window to ask if this was the right spot, it took a minute to get someone's attention, even though there were two doorman and another uniformed attendant standing about three feet away! When I parked and got out, nobody offered to help with my luggage, and I had to wait in line for at least five minutes in the freezing cold to get a ticket for my car. The valet attendant was definitely on the rude side.But thankfully, it all got better once I walked into the hotel. The lobby is tall and beautiful in the art deco style. The front desk attendant was friendly and quick getting me checked in. A bellman took my bag and led me upstairs, giving me an orientation to the hotel along the way and then getting me settled into my room. They use actualy keys here, not key cards! I had chosen a queen deluxe suite since the rooms looked small, and I am glad I spent the extra money! I ended up in room 1003, which was on the State Street side of the hotel, right on the corner of Washington. I had two bay windows, one of which looked right down Washington Street to Millenium Park and the lake! The living area had a comfortable love seat and chair with ottoman, coffee table, closet, end table, and armoire with TV, CD/tape player/stereo, and honor bar. French doors led to the bedroom area which had a small bedside table, desk &amp; chair, TV, and dresser. The bathroom was down a short hall off the bedroom and was small but nice and had Aveda products. The bed was definitely one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel, and there was a selection of pillows so I didn't even end up with a crick in my neck from sleeping on flat pillows! The shower head was high, so there was also no backbend for washing my hair. The window curtains were heavy, so except for a few cracks around the edges, it was nice and dark for sleeping. I could hear some traffic noise and drums from a sidewalk performer, as well has the whoosh of the el, which is one block over, but it didn't disturb me at all. If you sign up for their free Kimpton In Touch program, you also get free wi-fi. The connection felt quick and smooth.I ordered room service for dinner, which comes up from the Atwood Cafe downstairs. The prices were typical for hotel room service, but the food was delicious, and the service was fast! They had told me 25-30 minutes, but it arrived in 15 minutes.I felt safe walking the block over to the Oriental Theatre and back at night. Checking out was also quick and easy with another very friendly desk clerk, and they had my car pulled up to the curb in only a few moments. They also loaded my bag in the car this time, and the attendants seemed much more attentive than they had the night before.I will definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to just about anyone!	
Apr 9 2009 	Ideal Location!	My husband and I stayed at Hotel Burnham over a long weekend &amp; were very pleased! The location was ideal - a couple blocks from Millenium Park, near shopping &amp; great restaurants, and located mid way between North Michigan Ave and the museums.The hotel staff was quite friendly and the rooms were beautiful, clean and comfortable. We requested extra pillows and a fan - which were brought to us very quickly. The doormen were a pleasure - always quick to offer a smile.Though the hotel was fabulous overall, there was a lot of street noise. We stayed on the 3rd floor facing Washington and could hear most everything happening outside. There were young men drumming on 5 gallon buckets (nonstop) across the street from about noon to 9 p.m., and we could clearly hear the subway and El train at night. It's not like the hotel could control those things, but it could be a factor for travelers hoping to spend time relaxing during the day.Regardless - we got a great price through priceline.com and would go back to Hotel Burnham in a heartbeat!	
Apr 6 2009 	Best hotel in Chicago!	I have been lucky enough to have gotten this hotel via priceline three times and now i'd pay whatever to stay here. From Reggie the bellman (of whom we named our pet goldfish for the night) to the complementary wine reception to the complimentary wine and chocolates for my husband's b-day delivered straight to our room to the upgraded GOURGEOUS deluxe queen suite complete w/a pet goldfish for the stay (again, compliments for my husband's b-day), this hotel is TOP NOTCH!!!	
Apr 2 2009 	Beautiful Architectual Hotel	Very nice boutique hotel in the heart of The Loop. Easy walk to stores, theatres, parks and many restaurants. The room was newly redone and very stylish. The bed was comfortable and the staff very friendly. I really enjoyed my stay except for a loud fan in the bathroom which I couldn't turn off. I should have called the desk but was only staying one night. I would stay again but make sure that was not a regular&quot; feature&quot;.	
Mar 26 2009 	Cozy little hotel in the heart of it all	I love the location. The rooms were very nice and the staff was exceedingly friendly. Everything went like clockwork here without a hitch the whole way through. I would definitely stay here again. You are right by millenium park and right where you need to be in Chicago. Also, very affordable. Loved it.	
Mar 23 2009 	Excellent stay in Architectural Landmark	We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Burnham in Chicago! The hotel is situtated in a perfect location and is just a few blocks from the Art Institute and about a ten minute walk to the Magnificent Mile. The rooms are on the small side but are what you would expect in a boutique hotel. The hotel is filled with history and periodically tours will walk through the lobby talking about this landmark. The Atwood Cafe is a nice place to grab a cocktail at night. The staff are more than accomodating and lack pretension. We will definitely come back next time we are in Chicago!	
Mar 5 2009 	friendly and comfortable atmosphere	My husband and I stayed at the Burnham Hotel to celebrate our anniversary. When the staff found out, they were nothing but nice to us! They kept congratulating us, and recommended we dine at the cafe. For a historical landmark, the restaurant was surprisingly modern. We ordered dessert and it was exactly what we wanted. We ended up going back for breakfast and the frittata was amazing!The rooms were small but it didn't matter because the furniture was &quot;homey&quot; and comfortable. We took pictures of our view of the Chicago Theater. The only downside was the construction in the area. It made it difficult when sidewalks were closed. We were worried about it being noisy but it was such a quiet area at night. Well worth it!!	
Feb 21 2009 	Nice older hotel but no room service during restaurant renovation	I liked the look and feel of this hotel. It's older, but it has personality. My room was clean but also a bit worn, with an older Zenith analogue TV (but a very nice new and easy-to-use Sony clock radio) next to the bed. It was a bit dark, and could have benefited from a lamp next to the sofa for reading purposes. The service was rather friendly although not too polished at times. Attention to detail seems an issue: when I checked into my room, there was a card and gift addressed to another guest and my check-out took awhile owing to a credit card mix-up. Warning for those who like to use room service: there is none at this hotel during a renovation of the restaurant downstairs (there is, however, a complimentary Continental breakfast spread in the morning in the lobby, which includes a fireplace). One thing I really liked at this hotel was the long list of complimentary 'on request' amenities for the rooms, including humidifiers. I would return to this place, because the price is right and the staff have the right attitude. After the restaurant is open again, and with some more room modernization, I imagine it will be especially nice.	
Feb 5 2009 	Great location OK service	The best part of the hotel is the central Loop location. You are right across the street from the famed Marshall Field's department store (now Macy's), just a block from major theaters, and the life of the city.We were in town for a weekend getaway. We went and saw Wicked. The hotel was a perfect location. The staff was friendly and they were competent. But in the morning we went to eat down at the Atwood Cafe, and we waited for almost 15 minutes to get coffee. And it wasn't that busy when we walked in. We left in disgust and found a greasy spoon down the street that was 1/3 the price and had our food in about 3 minutes.The room was incredible. We had a king suite. It was on the 9th floor and had a Northeast view. We could see the lake and up State St. It was very cool. The bed was comfy. The TV was from about 1984, though. Could have used an upgrade there.All in all a pleasant experience sans the Atwood.	
Feb 1 2009 	Noisy and Tiny Wrapped in Faux Velvet	Had to stay at the Hotel Burnham for two days of meetings in Chicago--left after the first night. Here's why.The rooms and baths aren't just small--they're tiny. No fatties! Our first room had a bathroom reminiscent of an airliner's. The front desk staff--who were very pleasant and helpful--showed us to other rooms which resulted in a room that was a bit larger all around. This was offset, however, by the sound of the El running throughout most of the night and resuming in the early morning. Earplugs didn't help. The overabundance of silly decorating doesn't make the room any larger.We left the next day--once again, the front desk staff was very polite and friendly--and decamped to the Westin on Michigan Ave.--comfy bed and no trains.Oh, and on the way down we got stuck in the elevator--albeit briefly.Plus side--friendly staff, wine hour, architecturally impressive building.Down side--you can't sleep at night and feel like you're being prepped to be veal.You decide.	
Dec 15 2008 	What a GREAT weekend...	This hotel is not only beautiful, but the architecture is stunning! My mother and I came to celebrate her 60th and my 37th birthdays with a fun filled weekend of theater ('Wicked' which was spectacular) and endless shopping! Because we came at Christmas time (Dec. 12th-14th) the hotel was beautifully decorated with a sparkling Christmas tree and my mother couldn't get over how thick and gorgeous the wreaths were spread through out the hotel, just lovely. Our view was amazing, we stayed in room 302 and sat for hours just watching all the shoppers rush back and forth on State Street...so much fun! Everyone that works here is polite and wonderful, especially Taka, Anthony and Reggie. There was another gentleman who accomodated us by bumping us up to a room with two beds which helped us to sleep more comfortably, but unfortunately I neglected to get his name, but it was because of him that our stay was even better than expected! My mother commented that the bed and pillows (which by the way...they have a pillow &quot;Library&quot; TOO CUTE) were so soft and she hadn't slept that good in her life, which really made me happy! I only have a few MINOR complaints that may or may not make a difference to some who are contemplating on staying here. The towels are NOT soft at all - in fact they are hard and scratchy, which for this level of hotel was extremely disappointing (I've had nicer towels at the Comfort Inn!). I forgot my cell phone in the car the night before so I had to use the phone in our room to call across the street, they charged me a $1 per local call which is RIDICULOUS because I don't know any hotels that charge for local calls anymore! But after I had let them know that even at 4 star hotels in Paris I was not charged for local calls they removed the charges. Then upon returning to our room late in the day we were happy to see that our room was cleaned and straightened beautifully, but that they left dirty towels in the shower and on the towel rod. I just think if you're going to clean it, then do it all the way, it was just weird. Especially because the woman left a notecard with her first and last name on it stating that if we needed ANYTHING at all to let her know (which from my younger years of working in the service industry means &quot;it's okay to leave me a tip for my services&quot;) which would have been fine had she accomplished her job completely, don't ask for a tip if you are not going to finish the job completely. Needless to say my mother and I had a WONDERFUL time and will DEFINITELY be back again. Over the years using Hotwire, I guess I have just become a little spoiled in staying in 3-4 star hotels and expect them all to be at the same caliber as the others. I feel fortunate to be able to stay at these hotels at such a great price thanks to companies like them!	
Dec 3 2008 	Great experience	Spent 2 nights in early November...you could not ask for a better location. The staff at the front desk were very kind and personal. My brother and his wife were upgraded to a suite as they were celebrating their anniversary. Wine in the evening and coffee/teas in the morning was a very nice touch. Also, my wife left a shirt in the closet which she did not figure out until we had been home about a week. Sure enough, it was in lost and found and when she called the shipped it right out to us. The staff throughout were great. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again. We were on the 11th floor and street noise was not an issue whatsoever.	
Nov 17 2008 	Wonderful staff	Stayed at the Hotel Burnham last weekend. The staff was extremely friendly and professional. Very cozy. Our room was small, but tastefully decorated. Location is perfect. Loved it	
Nov 7 2008 	Wish I could have stayed longer!	Spent four nights at the Burnham after spending 3 nights at another Kimpton property just a few blocks away. There had been some mix up with our room at the other property, the room had been very small and the staff not helpful. So, I didn't have the best expectations for the Burnham. However, I was SO pleasantly surprised when I arrived. The room was 1403, a corner room, and it was really more like a suite. It was nicely decorated and clean. I forgot to take pictures this time but it had a canopied bed, two TVs (one in the &quot;bedroom&quot;and one in the little &quot;sitting area&quot;), a sound system, a very well stocked mini bar, robes, pajama nightie and warm socks (for purchase), L'occitane shampoo, conditioner and lotions. They have a wine hour every night from 5-6 with free wines. They have a restaurant which I did not try. The staff there is very friendly...each and every one of them I encountered! They bring ice to your room (although this was nice, sometimes I would have just liked to get my own) and the housekeeper left a handwritten note to say if there was anything I needed to just ask. The room was well equipped with Chicago maps, books and guides and had free wi-fi access.The hotel is in a fabulous location. It is within walking distance to just about everywhere I wanted to go. It's only a couple of blocks from Millenium Park. It is in the theatre district and several of the theatres are within a block. I was within a block of the train station. I walked to the Aquarium and Planetarium, rode the bus to the Magnificent Mile, Pier One, John Hancock Observatory and the Museum of Science and Industry. It is within walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago. Giordano's pizza and Uno's are also within walking distance. If you are easily annoyed by bucket drummers, this may not be the place for you. I thought they were kind of fun though. They usually started up about 5 in the evening and were done by 7 or so. The noise from the street really did not bother me at all but then I was 14 floors up. Although, I did not have my pet with me, they are pet friendly and are environmentally conscious.If given the change to go back to Chicago, I would most definitely look into staying here again!	
Oct 26 2008	Nice hotel.	I will say this, Kimpton hotels are consistant. It is an older building, refurbished and made into a great boutique hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the location is great. If you can get a good rate, stay here. Oh yeah, one more thing, the work out room is very basic, but there is a Ballys one block away (warning: the Ballys is a DUMP).	
Oct 21 2008 	Great Locations/Support for Chicago Marathon	stayed on th 11-12th Oct for the chicago marathon, was really surprise there was a complimentry breakfast for the marathon runners. They were very accomondating with my request for oatmeals/newspapers request. Good facilities for internet and reasonable prices for the internet use!! Fantastic location as opposite Macys next to Nordstorm and Sears. and 1 min walk to the CTA for the train back to the Chicago O'Hare Airport	
Oct 12 2008	Great Location!!	Great location. Easy walking distance to blue line (Washingon) or red line (note red line Washington is currently closed). Located a few blocks from Millenium Park and from Michagan Ave.Room was large for a big city hotel with a nice view of the Chicago Theatre. Check Hotwire for great rates.	
Sep 27 2008 	Anniversary Weekend	I'd recommend checking the Internet deals and then calling the hotel directly. They matched a rate I found on Orbitz and I was able to request a room on the top floor. We were worried about the construction noise levels as indicated on this site. We stayed for two nights 9/19 and 9/20. After returning on 9/19 we noticed the crew getting ready to work, but didn't hear a thing when we got up to the room. There was some noise the next morning, but it was after 7:30.We walked from the hotel to the Field Museum/Shedd Aquarium/Adler Planetarium. It was a long walk, but probably because it was so warm. On the way back we took the free trolley (green line). Be sure to ask for general tickets without the show (if you're not interested in the shows at the Planetarium and Aquarium). The general ticket prices are not listed-only general plus 1 or 2 shows.The one thing we were surprised by was how dead the downtown was on Sunday. We had hoped to grab a bite for lunch before taking the Metra back to Wisconsin, but nothing was open. Even McDonald's was closed-not that we would have ate there anyway. We ended up at a chain sandwich shop called Potbelly's, which was terrible. No one has mentioned it, but there were a lot of homeless people soliciting for $ as we walked to and from our destination.	
Sep 26 2008 	Great Hotel Great City!!!	Hotel Burnham - Chicago We recently stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Burnham and would definately recommend it. It is in a great location and the hotel's decor is beautiful. After a long trip there we received a warm greeting from the hotel staff and the room we stayed in had a fabulous view over the streets of Chicago including the famous theatre sign.We even had a goldfish in our room! The hotel itself is open to guests who wish to bring their pets however despite this the hotel is clean. It was great one morning when the lift doors open and a black labrador was there to greet us! The hotel offers a complimentary wine reception on an evening and Starbucks coffee and Dunkin Donuts on a morning - though tea and coffee facitilies in the room would have been welcomed. Been from England my girlfriends hair straightners that she took did not work however the hotel were more than happy to supply me with a pair throughout our stay. Highly recommended.	
Sep 25 2008 	Very Good Experience	Stayed two nights. As others have said, small reception area, small rooms but all very pretty. Staff was very good. Location was outstanding for what we were doing -- theater and getting married at City Hall -- all within 2 blocks.We enjoyed the restaurant: had a couple of breakfasts and a dinner. Even if you are not a vegetarian try the Lentil Cake entree if available. Excellent.As for the noise: The rooms seem to be excellently sound proofed. We were on the 12th floor facing the construction zone. The first night there were back hoes working but unless you really tried to listen for it, it was not discernible. The second night however, about 3am, they started up with some machine that let out a powerful whine, and a little later loud jack hammering.So until that project is done it appears it is just the luck of the draw for what the work schedule is for a given evening if it is going to be a factor.	
Sep 23 2008 	Loved it	I stayed a couple of nights at the Burnham recently. It's got the qualities of a small hotel and the amenities of a large one. The staff were friendly andvery professional. The restaurant is one of the best in downtown. The location is perfect for museums, shopping, strolling the waterfront. The room was immaculate and comfortable (the bed was great!). And not too expensive. What more could you ask for?	
Sep 12 2008 	Dependable choice for a boutique hotel	I've stayed at the Burnham this summer for a few business trips that I've had in Chicago and I'm always pleased with the top quality of the hotel. The rooms aren't that large, but they are beautifully decorated with high quality furnishings, and are always spotless. The restaurant is a little pricey and the menu isn't that diverse, but the food is always made from the best ingredients and prepared perfectly, and usually takes a modern twist on a traditional recipe.The customer service has always been very prompt, professional and polite. The only drawback is the construction on the roads nearby which can be noisy at night, but Chicago's doing a city project so the Burnham can't do much about that. Ask for a high floor away from the noise, if you can.	
Sep 3 2008	felt like royalty	My 2 teenage daughters and I wanted a short weekend away and i was lucky enough to take advantage of a TravelZoo promotion at the Hotel Burnham in Chicago. From the welcoming e-mail we received a couple of days ahead of arrival right to the loading of the car at departure we were treated like royalty. The luxurious rooms,the restored wood and iron grills on the elevator were even appreciated by my daughters which from teenagers is a real compliment. The offer of a glass of wine when I first entered the lobby after stressing through rush hour traffic was very welcome. I know there have been lots of complaints about noise but we had a corner room on the 12th floor and we had no problems with noise. Even though we were across from the elevator we never heard anyone in the hallway-it was as if we had the place to ourselves. We had an amazing deal for the 2 nights but I'm already making plans to go back with my husband this time and I would happily pay the going rate if there are no discounts available. The hotel is central to everything and we enjoyed walking in all directions to see what was around the corners. My first trip to Chicago but I'll be going back for sure.	
Sep 2 2008 	Great Old Hotel in Chicago's Theatre District	The Hotel Burnham is a great spot in Chicago's Theatre District and near many downtown tourist attractions (e.g. Sears Tower, Chicago Theatre, etc.). Some of the more unique features of the hotel include an old style elevator with gate and the use of keys to open your room...yes, real keys (not cards)! The rooms are small, but very tastefully done, with a beautiful poster bed and canopy. The windows are decorated with velvet like curtains with musical scores by Mozart in gold colored script, to emphasize the hotel's proximity to various performing arts venues. Each evening, the hotel hosts a wine reception in the lobby, which is a nice respite after a long workday. The breakfast menu is also quite enjoyable, especially the delicious eggs Benedict and fresh squeezed orange juice. I only spent two nights here, but would be happy to come back!	
Aug 31 2008	Not terrible but doesn't live up to the hype	This hotel is living off its former glory. It desperately needs a makeover. What was considered luxurious and well designed 30 years mow seems run of the mill and verging on tacky.The tv set was a 30 year old clunker from Zenith. I don't care much for television when I travel (I don't think I turned it on once). I just mention it because it's an apt metaphor for my entire experience.For starters, I arrived at 4pm only to find out that my room was not ready. They took my cell phone number so they could call me when they were ready for me, but they never called. I popped by at 6 to discover that my room was ready and was left to wonder if they ever would have called me. (no apologies either).When I got to my room (which was no easy task as room 410 isn't even listed as a possibility on the signs facing the elevator) I was shocked to see how small it was (considering the amount of time it took to clean, check out is at 11 am by the way). It's one of those deals where opening the door to the bathroom almost collides with your bed. As for the view, I suspect some people in prison enjoy a better vista.They offer a complementary continental breakfast but I wonder what continent they are referring to. No customary cereal, cheese, or yogurt options. Just a sad fruit salad and a muffin or white or whole wheat toast. Again, I thought of prison as the service was less than smiley.The best thing about this place is the wonderful location and the building itself, one of the Chicago's oldest skyscrapers.Everything else was a disappointment.	
Aug 28 2008 	Great Location and service	The Burnham is a lovely smaller hotel in an historic buliding right smack-bang in the middle of Chicago, great for shopping (right across the road from Marshall Fields) and access to the theatres. You can't beat the location, and the staff were friendly and attentive.My room was tiny (as you would expect from the location) but very well appointed and all the furnishings were extremely comfortable.Unfortunately at the time I was staying there they were ripping up State Street, so Taxi access was difficult and the subway station at State and Washington is closed for much of this year. It also took ten minutes to diagonally cross the road to get to Marshall Fields due to the roadworks - not the hotel's fault.On the whole a very pleasant stay all round.	
Aug 28 2008 	Wonderfully Plush	This hotel was an unexpected find! I searched several websites and had reserved a room somewhere else, when I received a notice from Hotwire about other hotels in the area. I took a gamble and hit the jackpot! The price was exceptional for the area, but especially the hotel iteslf! The hotel staff was very accommodating, personable and ready to assist. I even received a handwritten note from the cleaning personnel. The wine tasting was an excellent opening to a great stay in the historical and beautiful hotel. We didn't spend much time in the room or hotel itself, but the time we did spend was luxurious. The room was comfortably romantic, very clean and plush. This hotel was very close to many of the wonderful sites Chicago has to offer. It is in a nice area, walking distance to many attractions as well as train stations. I felt safe in the area walking as a single woman. The construction in the area was not bothersome to me, however my husband did have a little trouble sleeping in one morning as they start work at 8am or earlier. The first evening we stayed, we enjoyed a walk to see some of the shops, theaters and architecture in the area. We took an excellent Ghost Tour, which I would recommend as they provided an interesting history of the city. The architectural boat tour is also a great tour of the Chicago River and gives insight to the buildings in the area. We had breakfast one morning at The Atwood Restaurant, excellent food, poor service, but then there was only one waiter for about 8 tables. If you are looking for Chicago style pizza and have about 2 hours to wait for your table and to get food, try Gino's east, however, I liked the little pizza place by Frank Lloyd Wright's home, Giordano's, much better and the wait was not as long. I would highly recommend the Burnham Hotel and will look for other Kimpton hotels when traveling; you won't go wrong choosing this one!	
Aug 27 2008 	Disappointed	Our room was a disappointment. Our room was so small that I couldn't roll in my suitcase on wheels because the space between the bed and wall was too tight. It might have been suitable for a single business traveller for a single night, not for a couple on holiday.As well, jackhammers and road work outside all night long. Very annoying. And Red Line train is shutdown on weekends... would have been nice to have a warning.The breakfast at Cafe Atwood was very good, as well as the wine hour. Overall, I wish we had stayed somewhere else, a few miles north of the hotel, closer to the nightlife and restaurants.	
Aug 22 2008	Fantastic place !	Saw this hotel on Tripadvisor and booked. Fantastic !Excellent location, close to everything. I am on the 12th floor in a nice suite and despite the construction works in the street I am sleeping like a baby. Staff is polite and efficient, room is spotless and bed is very comfortable.This was the perfect hotel to end our honeymoon vacation.!	
Aug 19 2008 	Fabulous boutique hotel in the Loop	My husband and I stayed here for one night to meet up with old friends. We read very positive reviews of the hotel and the Kimpton chain, so we booked this at a wonderful price through their website.The hotel is in the heart of the loop--at the corner of State and Washington. Given its location, I was a bit concerned that it would be too busy, or too loud. I found none of this to be true. Instead, when you walk in the doors, the enticing yet compact lobby really silenced the outside. If you are looking for a grand ballroom of a lobby, this is not your place; but I never felt cramped as I enjoyed their beautiful furniture. The whole building is Old Chicago style with strong touches of Art Deco throughout. Every touch was perfect--and the choice to keep the upper floors true to the original design of the building was genius.Not only was the decor beautiful, the beds were comfortable, the shower and amenities (L'Occitaine) were upscale and the internet was fast and had wireless options. The free wine reception in the evening was a great plus and got you ready to head out for a nice dinner. The hotel's location is perfect for walking or taking the EL to your dinner/entertainment destination, and it is only a leisurely 10 minute stroll to the lake.  The free Starbucks coffee and tea in the morning was a kind way to smooth me into my day and the breakfast in the hotel restaurant was good fare that came quickly to our table.When we were informed that the gym was undergoing renovations, we were initially upset--but before that could settle in, the front desk staff immediately told us that all of their guests could use the gym at a sister hotel (another Kimpton property 3 blocks away). Since exercise was the goal, we were happy to walk there--and were treated well by that staff. Overall, this is a very nice boutique hotel. Details are a priority here and the staff is some of the best I have encountered. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.	
Aug 18 2008 	Loved it!!!	My boyfriend and I just returned from a wonderful weekend stay at the Hotel Burnham. We were able to book the King Suite room at an amazing rate of $180/night. As soon as we stepped into our room, we noticed the fabulous decor and wonderful view. Although I had requested a higher floor when I made the reservation, we were given a room on the 5th floor. The view was still great though, as we could see the Chicago theater and Millenium Park from our bedroom. The only setback to being on the 5th floor was at night, when there was major construction going on in the streets which made it pretty difficult to sleep. (I'm assuming the street construction should be over pretty soon though.) The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. We were able to walk everywhere with ease, from the Shedd Aquarium to the John Hancock Center. The wine glasses and animal print robes were also a nice touch. If you have time, do have breakfast at the Atwood Cafe' The food is excellent, and the decor is very pretty.	
Aug 13 2008 	Chic and sweet	My husband and I just spent a long weekend in Chicago and we stayed at Hotel Burnham. The experience was almost entirely wonderful. The biggest positives: the area, being in the loop just a couple of blocks from Madison Park was fantastic. The room was VERY clean and well suited with nice decor. The only negatives: the bed was a little uncomfortable for an extended stay, and the concierge service was less than great (we attempted to get tickets to a show and they weren't very helpful or resourceful. Likewise, they did not provide the best restaurant recommendations either.) All in all, I would recommend this hotel for all the high standards we hold Kimpton hotels to. It met every expectation.	
Aug 13 2008 	Amazing weekend getaway	My husband and I just returned from Hotel Burnham to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. I knew there was construction going on around the hotel, but I chose to stay here anyhow (I found an average rate of $155 a night on the hotel's website). Our stay was absolutely amazing. As soon as we said our last name at check-in, they wished us a happy anniversary. When we returned to our room the first evening, there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us. Our third day there, we had asked for some assistance finding places. They knew we would be doing a lot of walking, and when we returned, there was a bottle of water waiting in our room for us. The service we received at the Atwood was incredible as well. The server remembered us on our second day and seated us at the same table we had the day before, saying he would seat us at our &quot;usual.&quot; The wine reception in the evening was a very nice touch as well. Never have I stayed at a hotel that paid such attention to pleasing their guests. My husband and I never had a problem sleeping, but we were on the 14th floor. If you stay here, you need to know there is construction going on. If you do not request a room on a top floor, you will probably hear the noise. I know if we return to Chicago, we are going to stay at the Hotel Burnham again.	
Aug 12 2008 	Great hotel in a great location	The only thing stopping the Hotel Burnham from getting a perfect 5-star score was the poor internet service I experienced while I was there. Everything else was top-notch. The staff greeted me with a warm hello whenever I walked in and told me to &quot;enjoy your evening&quot; when I walked out.I ordered room service one night while I was there and they sent up a complimentary dessert! Granted it was a chocolate mousse-type dessert, so it was probably due to them having a few extra and the dessert generally not storing well. But it was a nice gesture at any rate. And it was a tasty treat!As for the photos people have attached on this site, they do not do the Burnham justice at all. It is a very nice place! Marble everywhere, very clean, great restaurant, good water pressure /hot water...like I said, everything was great. And the location is just about as good as you could ask for.As for the internet...I connected via broadband plug the first night to what is listed as &quot;complimentary internet&quot; and was promptly charged a $10 access fee to my room. This charge terminated my internet the next evening and did something to my laptop so that it would no longer connect to the internet at all. I called their tech support line (which is not in the city) and they spent a great deal of time trying to get it working again. It started working (ie, connected to Google) and they hung up.. I attempted to go to hotmail and it cut out and would not connect again...I called tech support and the next guy told me just to &quot;wait and try again in 45 minutes or so&quot; . I even attempted to use the wireless in the lobby but my laptop wouldnt' connect to their service at all (I have never had any wireless problem EVER). I assume that since they charge a $10 fee per night for internet access (although it is supposed to be complimentary) if you don't pay for ALL your nights at the same time, the system somehow excludes you from using the internet again...a poorly designed glitch. I stayed at the Hotel Burnham for 4 days and had usable internet only on the first evening.	
Aug 5 2008 	The historic Burnham Hotel offers much...	Date of stay: July 27, 2008 - July 31, 2008The Hotel Burnham is a true gem in Chicago's Loop area. The detailed architectural design was captivating and beautiful. Our room could have been a little larger. However, the pictures that the hotel provides on its website are very accurate. We had a King Deluxe room that included a comfortable bed with your pillow types of choice, a comfortable sized bathroom with L'Occitane bath products. There was a desk with free internet access. There was a mini bar and refridgerator. Not a lot of storage areas though. We were on the 11th floor and we even had a sliver view of the lake. Our first visit at this hotel included impeccable service at every level. The staff was very welcoming and went out of their way to make our stay more comfortable and enjoyable. I ordered flowers via the concierge to be in our room when they arrived. The hotel added chocolates and a nice bottle of red wine. The hotel itself was very peaceful...great for afternoon naps. Room service orders arrived in 15 minutes like clockwork. The hotel's restaurant, Atwood Cafe, served excellent food. The best Cobb salad that I've had. We paid $176/nt...a rate that I found on Travelocity which the hotel price matched. I highly recommend this hotel. It is centrally located near Millenium Park on the corner of Washington &amp; State St. Great if you'll be visiting the Art Institute. Cab rides weren't more than $5 to $7. Only downside was the L is only two blocks away and you could hear it at night...nothing a glass of wine or a Benedryl didn't solve though. Great choice for a romatic getaway. I would defininitely stay there again.	
Jul 23 2008 	Great location lovely hotel	Hotel is in great location, only a couple of blocks from Washington on the blue line which comes directly from the airport. Check in was quick and easy. Room was clean and laid out well for me and my mum to use together. Bathrobe (animal print!) and pet goldfish were great touches! Doormen were great.Only disappointment was the restaurant - food was nice enough but the waiting staff were a bit hit and miss both at breakfast and at dinner. Not awful, just not great but it didn't put me off the hotel and I would stay there again.Overall, great hotel for someone interested in architecture and who wants something smack bang in the middle of the Loop.	
Jul 13 2008	fraudulent reservations policy	Beware of making any reservations for this hotel. They have a policy I have never heard of at any other hotel. If you use their &quot;Hot Dates Great Rate&quot;, they will not allow you to cancel your reservation if you try to do it less than 15 --months-- before the stay, and they will bill your credit card for the whole stay. Most hotels allow you to cancel with 24 or 48 hours of scheduled arrival, this hotel would not let me cancel a month in advance.	
Jul 10 2008 	Great experience at Burnham	Spent three nights here before moving to another hotel for a conference. Should have stayed here for the duration. Beautiful, quite hotel in a historic building with an unparalleled location. Staff were uniformly friendly and helpful--all seemed happy to be working here. This will definitely be my Chicago hotel for future trips.	
Jul 3 2008 	Great Hotel Needs Updating	I stayed at the Burnham recently on business. This is my second visit to the hotel. The staff was very helpful and placed me in a quiet inside room.The room was fine but could use a some updating, as the shades were faded. The only problem I had was that I could not use the internet in the evening, however, I was able to use it in the morning with out any problems.	
Jun 17 2008 	Don't even try to sleep here	Management kindly placed me in a third floor room directly over a roadworks project which utilizes jackhammers nonstop between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. The building has15 floors and three sides that don't face the roadworks, but no attempt was made to improve my situation. I'm in town for a four day conference and not sleeping is hardly an option -- but neither is sleeping, in these circumstances. Remember, if you're going to Chicago, for the discounted rate of $828, you too could go four nights without sleep at this hotel.	
Jun 15 2008 	Fabulous	Best hotel service in over a year--people didn't simply do what was asked, there was a proactivity among the staff (the chambermaid leaving me a handwritten note with her name on it asking if I needed anything, the bellman introducing me to all of the in-room amenities--and getting me an in-room coffee service when I noticed none was there [they are optional]), and the cheeky waiter at the restaurant making comments about my soccer jersey that I wore for breakfast--made for a superb experience. The room was as well appointed as any I've seen. the view of a typical Chicago Loop skyscraper canyon was tremendous and the in-room coffee was Starbucks. Breakfast (not included) was ok (a bit of a funny menu), but hardly enough to spoil the effect.	
Jun 9 2008 	Beautiful Hotel.	Beautiful hotel. We got a great deal over Memorial Day weekend and could not believe what a beautiful room we got on the 10th floor. Using the hotel's website we paid only $127/night, plus $20/night in taxes. The hotel is in a great location, just a couple blocks from Millenium Station. We took the commuter rail in from Northern Indiana and only walked a few blocks to the hotel. No taxi needed.The whole hotel is stunning. If you love architecture, then this hotel is a real treat for you. They have done a beautiful job of renovating and redecorating this building. The interior design is bold and whimsical in its approach. The Atwater Cafe down stairs is a fun and bold it its design. Just lovely.Our room was stunning too-- it was a corner room with huge, huge windows on two sides. We had a sliver of a view of the lake and Mil Park (down Washington Ave). The furnishings were done in a deep navy blue and regal gold and were just stunning. The room had a king bed and a separate sitting room with work desk, divan, and entertainment center. The bath was very compact, but very nicely done. Our other windown overlooked the Chicago Theatre. I've stayed several times in the Hotel Monaco and have enjoyed that property each time. For a change we went with the Burnham this time and I was very glad to have the chance to experience this hotel. I like both very, very much, but I prefer the interior design of this one. The richness of the colors made me feel like royalty!As always, the service is very hospitable at Kimpton hotels. I can't say enough good things about this hotel.	
Jun 7 2008 	Great hotel 	I'd read great reviews before I stayed, but this hotel really must be seen and lived in to be fully appreciated! The attention to detail in the decor and restoration was amazing, I really felt like I was living in a building from a gloriously bygone era. The staff were helpful, food was good (though watch out for the slightly over-merry guests during the evening happy hour in the Cafe, when drinks are free -- had drinks slopped all over my sandals in the lift, not pleasant). Stepping out, there were shops and convenience stores, big and small, close by and the Magnificent Mile was within 10 minutes walk. Chicago itself is a beautiful city (it was my first time to visit), full of gorgeous architecture -- staying at the Hotel Burnham just added to the whole atmosphere.	
Jun 1 2008 	ARt Nouveau treasure	stayed 2 nights at this historic hotel-loved the original features such as lifts, doors, decor.Staff very helpful-lovely restaurant especially good for a woman staying alone.great views of the city from the window.Location -perfect for sight seeing by foot in the city.A delight	
May 28 2008	We and our dog loved the Burnham	My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at the Burnham and had an outstanding stay. They even accomodated our small dog, bringing a bowl of food and water to our room and giving him the royal treatment whenever we came into the hotel. Our room overlooked the Marshall Field's building and had a stunning view of the formal gardens and Frank Geary pavillion in Millenium Park with sailboats on Lake Michigan in the distance. Our small suite was beautiful with huge windows -- a comfortable place to lounge and soak in the city. Construction on the building across the street appears to be over. The location is fantastic. This is a wonderful place to stay for a car-free weekend. My only complaint was that the bathroom was a little small. But overall, we would stay there again in a heartbeat. And our dog agrees.	
May 21 2008 	Wonderful rooms and service.	Had a great stay at the Hotel Burnham. Only wish we had had a chance to join everyone in the lobby for wine. The location of this hotel is perfect if you are planning on staying in the loop of Chicago. It is close to everything. We walked to shopping, shows and dinner. Our room was beautiful. The king bed was so comfortable and that bathroom was gorgeous. The staff was very courteous. Could not have asked for a better place to stay.	
May 18 2008	Stylish and comfortable.	We arrived in Chicago for the first time and easily found this hotel from the unique address. The Receptionist was really helpful and quickly booked us in. Everthing was exactly as we had reserved.The Delux Double Queen Room was not spacious, but the decor was impressive and everything you could wish for, from a toothbrush to a book about the hotels history was available to purchase from the honor- bar.The Restaurant was equally stylish, with a range in the menu which made choosing difficult. We chose the fillet steak and were definately not disapointed. The deserts were superb. When we returned to the room in the evening, the housekeeping staff had turned down the bedding, placed chocolates on the pillows and placed bath gowns ready for use. The lights were turned down and music was playing quietly in the background. Very impressive and restful. If you wanted a romantic setting it was there in overdrive.Staff were very professional and the Concierge efficiently made reservations for two tours which we needed.As a 'leisure guest' the breakfast was a little stressful, due to a 'breakfast meeting' taking place on the table next to us. The loud, forceful sales talk took away from a peaceful breakfast. Guests should be aware of these 'intruders' from the outside world, or maybe the staff could be a little more 'guest aware' when positioning groups in the breakfast room.This is an excellent hotel and one I would recommend and I'm extremely hard to please!	
May 15 2008	great hotel	a wonderful hotel in a great location, our room was upgraded to a suite at no charge. The staff was very courteous and helpful, evening wine reception very nice. Neighborhood construction can make access difficult. We would definately stay here again	
May 14 2008 	classic in every way	I was looking for a hotel for my business trip that was walking distance to the work site. I tried to contact the usual big name hotels but they were all booked. I think there were several big events going on that week. After all, it is Chicago!I came across the Burnham during my Google search of hotels.I can't say I was impressed by what I saw online but I thought I would give it a shot since my options were minimal. I'm glad I did.Now the Hotel Burnham prides itself on being old school. In other words, it doesn't try to blow you away with a fancy, decked-out lobby. They stick to long time standards that still work today. Like great guest service and hospitality. They've conserved the building that has been around for many, many years but it's so cozy. The restaurant in the lobby was real good. Parking is sky high so don't try driving in. Besides, you really don't need a car if you're staying in and around Chicago. Especially downtown. My room was small but again, that's to be expected in an older building. I still felt comfortable and the area was nice and clean. During my stay (April 2008), renovations were going on downstairs so I advise you to request a room as high as you can get. My 10th floor location was good enough. The location is hard to beat. Right next door there is a Walgreens and if you bank at Bank of America, they are only 2 doors down. Not bad!Millenium Park is across the street and you can pretty much walk to most of downtown. So it's safe to say that I would recommend the Hotel Burnham. Probably not for a large family because of the small size but for everyone else, they should be welcomed.	
May 13 2008 	Wonderful Location!	A good hotel in a great location. Unique property, architecturally - not much of a lobby - the restaurant/bar takes up most of the lobby space. We had dinner at the restaurant one night and the food was very good while the service was so-so. Our standard guestroom was very comfortable and clean. Bathroom was a good size. I rated this hotel 'above average' but really only the unique architcture of the building makes it above average. Best part of our stay was the beautiful exterior of the building and the great location. We were able to walk and take public transportation almost everywhere.	
May 10 2008 	Nice Stay at the Burnham	My wife and I booked the Burnham through Hotwire for $134 and stayed two nights this May. We considered it a great value for such a charming and well located hotel in Chicago.The Burnham is relatively small, but the hotel is very pretty and has a classic look. The lobby is quite small but cozy, and there is a complimentary wine reception there from 5-6 pm everyday. Most of the lobby area is taken up by the Atwood Cafe, which is a very popular (and expensive) place to eat.The hotel maintains many of the original touches from when it was built in 1895, like marble stairs, doorknobs, and iron work. Kimpton Hotels made it into the Burnham in 1999. The decor is modern feeling but not overwhelming; just cozy and inviting.Our room was a standard queen on the 10th floor. The bed was nice and the view was impressive: our huge windows overlooked the corner of State and Washington, including Marshall Fields and the Chicago Theater. The bathroom was tiny and the tv and radio were a little dated, but these were not negatives for us. Everything was very clean, and the bath amenities were L'Occitane.People have complained about construction noise from the huge project going on across the street. We stayed directly overlooking the construction and didn't hear a thing. Not only that, but Looptopia was going on below us late at night and we were not disturbed at all. I was worried about this a little, but no issues to report.The location is excellent for shopping, bus and train access, and walking to and from Millennium Park/Michigan Ave. The only complaints we had are: one of the elevators broke down the Saturday we were there, which made it impossible to get down from the 10th floor. We had to walk down the stairs all day. Also, the business center is way overpriced (although wired internet is free in your room). Ultimately, these things kept us from giving the Burnham 5 stars, but this a strong 4-star hotel in our mind. It is a very charming and welcoming boutique hotel in the heart of the Loop, and you really feel like you are staying in one of the great historical buildings from an earlier era (I believe this was only the second &quot;skyscraper&quot; ever built in Chicago). We would gladly stay here again for these reasons.	
May 10 2008 	Week-end in Chicago	Location, location, location! combined with great staff, excellent restaurant, beautiful decor in restored historic building, that's the Burnham.	
May 4 2008 	My favorite work spot in Chicago	We have a corporate rate with this hotel and I can't be happier. It's an ideal location to our office (3 blocks away) and it's got great decor. Everything feels like its brand new yet looks antique. The huge windows afford a great look of the area outside and checking in and checking out is extremely easy and painless. The staff here is always trying to make my stay better than the previous one, which is great. Checking in at most other hotels is about as exciting as going to a bank and you get treated like a chore.There is construction going on across the street at a 24-hour pace. Surprisingly, it has yet to disturb me or disrupt my sleep.	
Apr 23 2008	Probably the best in the Loop	The Kimpton Hotel Group runs this place. If you're not familiar with them, get to know them. All their properties are very nice and Hotel Burnham is no exception.It's a great renovation of a classic downtown Chicago office building. It's incredibly charming and doesn't fit your normal Marriott/Hilton/Hyatt property mold.Staff is great, rooms and nicely decorated and very comfortable.Location is definitely the best. You're across the street from Marshall Fields (Macy's) and a 1 block walk from a major &quot;El&quot; stop where you can catch any of the trains. Beyond that you have all the shopping on State St and an easy walk to Michigan Ave.The only downer, hardwired internet only (no wireless) and it's pretty slow. Faster than dial-up but not by much. And that was the case during my entire week stay.Other than that, book it!	
Apr 21 2008 	A Destination	My significant other and I stayed here this past weekend and had a wonderful visit.The rooms have tasteful decorations and adequate room to move about and stow luggage. The service / concierge offered appropriate helpful dining suggestions and walking directions. The rooms were immaculate and the turndown service is a nice touch.Hotel Burnham, in some ways is a destination in itself. Definitely recommended.	
Apr 15 2008 	Great Hotel but construction noise was an issue.	I have just come back from a 5 night stay at the Burnham and can only say positive things. I booked a double double deluxe room for myself and friend and altho' the room was compact (a bit short on space for all our clothes!), the room was very clean and comfortable with excellent bedding. The 'turn over' service and the addition of classical music awaiting our arrival back after a hard day's sightseeing was a nice touch too. All the staff were helpful and welcoming and I would recommend the Burnham ONCE the construction work over the road is completed. The only downside of our stay was that it was noisy even through the night. If the other Kimpton hotels are of this standard in Chicago I would definately book with them again.	
Apr 10 2008	Beware Construction!!!!	The hotel is clean/nice, I found the staff courteous, location is good. But, construction has resumed in-full directly across the street!! I stayed two nights in early April. The first night was fairly quiet but the heavy machinery started up at 6:45AM. The second night they ran a crane lifting up and moving big metal pipes almost all night directly across the street. This is a major construction project that is easily 6 months from completion.	
Apr 1 2008 	Just the Best!!!	I can't rave enough about this hotel. So often the staff at a big city hotel consists of folks who are bored, angry, disinterested, rude, etc.. The people with whom I interacted, and there were many, were absoutely outstanding--friendly (sincerely), helpful, a pleasure to talk to. The hotel itself is a gem; read their website and believe every word of it. A terrific value for a lovely place. The restaurant is handy and very good, with a decor that blends well with the turn-of-the-century hotel decor. We stayed overnight and had two meals in the restaurant because it was so good. The room and bathroom were on the small side, but that is no problem because it is so convenient, laid out well, and elegant with every amenity you'd want. I hope always to stay there in the future when I visit Chicago. (Could be often, since I live in Madison, WI) I read many of the other reviews. The good ones (most) were TRUE! I read one negative one (written in French, so I'm not sure I understood every single word) and it was mainly for the construction noise. We had a room facing the construction and heard not a sound from there or from the hallway or the other rooms near us. Wonderful hotel!	
Mar 29 2008 	Fabulous value for business travel	I happend across the Hotel Burnham on a search for Loop hotels and found this one at a price I couldn't believe. After reading reviews on this site, I decided to give it a try.My office is in the Loop, but I usually work remotely from my home. On this occassion, I had back-to-back meetings (Mon-Tues) and did not want to return home only to head back to the Loop a few hours later.I found a great price at the Hotel Burnham. My room was small (queen-size bed, tiny bathroom), but the location was only three blocks from my office and the quality was much more than I expected. I was impressed by their attention to detail (&quot;I see you've requested a quite room, I have a room that's very quite, but there is no view, which would you prefer?&quot;).The NY Times outside my door and complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby was a nice touch.Since my needs really only included a place to &quot;crash&quot; for the night, this hotel exceeded my expectations and I'd recommend it to anyone needing a great place to stay in the Loop. The only recommendation I have for hotel management is to add dead bolts to the locks on the doors. Being a female business traveler, I am particularly aware of this kind of safety issue.	
Mar 11 2008	Favourite Boutique Hotel in the Loop	Following a mix up on my booking at another Loop hotel, I ended up here - it was no hardship in the end !Fascinating history - one of the first skyscrapers in the US - the building Burnham built before the Flat Iron in NYC. Beautifully and sensitively restored - the stairway is a particular gem.The rooms are lovely and well equipped (including a goldfish in a bowl !) and bathrooms are excellent. The lounge areas are very comfortable for the nightly free drinks hour.I'd also recommend the Atwood Cafe - excellent restaurant in its own right.Noise from the new shopping mall/CTA station was unobtrusive - when it's complete, the location will be even more convenient. Currently very handy for the Loop business area, State St, Millenium Park and a short walk from Michigan.	
Mar 10 2008	a fantastic stay	my wife and I spent 3 nights at the hotel burnham and it was hands down the best experience we have ever had at any hotel. we were upgraded to a suite (1503) on the top floor of this wonderful hotel housed in the reliance building(1895) smack in the middle of the loop! the kimpton group, pioneers in the boutique hotel business always do it right! we are on the top floor with these huge baywindows looking out at the lake,millenium park, marshall fields across the street (now Macy's but what a building!) spacious hip well appointed furnishings/lots of space/ extreme comfort on all levels. kimpton spent lots a bucks lovingly redoing this famous old building and what a gem it is. go on their website or google the reliance building . they can say it better than I can. ny times every morning! free GOOD coffee in the morning! a great restaurant (4 star).the atwood. Ill review it separately after I kick this back to california jet lag.  great service also. really clean. i actually looked forward to getting back to the room and looking out the window. thanx to the hotel burnham for making our trip to this world class city (my home town so im partial) so special.	
Feb 17 2008 	Still our favorite!	Just returned from a post-Valentine's Day weekend getaway in the Windy City and stayed at our favorite Chicago Loop hotel  The Hotel Burnham! We saw construction workers at the site next door as we overlooked the site but were not bothered by construction noise; perhaps being on the 10th floor helped.  Alyssa at the Front Desk was a gem! As were Anthony (Conceriege); Alex and Gus (Doormen); Alex (Bellhop); and the staff in Housekeeping and Room Service.We ate at the Atwood Cafe Saturday night prior to enjoying a musical two blocks away; many other theatre-goers were doing the same. Our meals were delicious, cocktails were well prepared and the wait staff were pleasant and professional. Were looking forward to out next Windy City getaway and will return to the Burnham.	
Feb 1 2008	beautiful history	I have stayed here twice and sent others- hands down everyone's favorite Chicago hotel experience! An incredibly preserved historical building with comfortable and beautiful rooms and a very freindly and helpful staff- the restaurant is a gem too and you can't beat the location.	
Jan 29 2008	Best Kept Secret	We have stayed at the Burnham three times and it is a jewel! The staff is amazing and the concierge will assist with any need!The location in the theatre district is so perfect. You can walk to Wicked at the Oriental, Jersey Boys at the Goodman and almost all the other theatres. (We saw both shows -- both are fabulous). The restaurant in the hotel, the Atwood, is outstanding for dinner, especially pre-theatre. Book your dinner reservation when you book the hotel -- very busy with theatre goers. The location is just wonderful for shopping -- Nordstrom Rack next door, H&amp;M, Old Navy, Filene's, TJ Maxx, Gap, and the State Street Macy's (formerly Marshall Field's flagship) are right there. It is an easy walk to Michigan and a longer but very convenient walk to the Mag Mile. Millenium Park is a quick jaunt and a wonderful place to run. From there, the Gehry bridge leads right over to the lake shore bike/run path. In the spring and summer there are free Yoga and Pilates classes in the Park! The hotel rooms are smaller but very elegant with fluffy and comfy bedding. The hotel and the rooms are very clean and the hotel is very well run. The archtecture is lovely. We will be staying there about once a month with my husband's business -- the staff has made us feel like we are at our &quot;home away from home.&quot; There is construction in the plaza across the street -- be patient if driving in and out. Most cabs know the detours. (Only drawback -- no fitness center on-site -- they do have nearby sister hotels w/fitness facilities -- the Bally's down the street is closed on weekends!).	
Jan 13 2008 	Hotel Burnham was Amazing!	I stayed in the Burnham hotel last July for 4 nights with my partner and we both loved it. We were doing a small tour of the USA and this hotel was our favourite by far.The hotel is in a great location with theatres a block or two away, 5 mins from Millenium and Grant park, Michigan avenue is a 5 minute walk and macys is right accross the road. There are also lots of restaurants nearby and the food in the hotel restaurant looked lovely and reasonably priced although we didn't eat here as we wanted to get out and see Chicago.The staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful and there were free glasses of wine and snacks every evening. There was also complimentary coffee and muffins for breakfast but you have to get up early or you will miss the muffins, we only found out about these on the last day! The hotel itself is non smoking and has a lovely art deco inspired theme. Our room was huge compared with other rooms we stayed in on this trip and it was very clean. Our window also looked onto the main road but noise was never an issue.The only downside of the hotel is that although the lobby looks impressive there was not really enough seating which was not great for the wine reception and breakfast although we just took our coffees to go.I will hopefully be back to Chicago soon and will definitely stay in the Burnham again!	
Dec 30 2007 	Good hotel	The Burnham is a very good boutique hotel that is ideally located near shopping and theater. Beware that there is loud construction taking place across the street from the hotel and that the hotel recently got rid of its fitness center. If you are able, book a suite -- the regular rooms are very small. The Atwood Cafe's food is outstanding, though a bit pricey.	
Dec 19 2007 	Room with a View	I spent a long weekend at The Burnham in December. After reading reviews here about massive constant construction across the street, I called in advance and they offered to place me on a higher floor, and to give me a sleep-kit if I should need it, but I didn't. All the exterior work seemed finished to me, and it was never a problem at all. I got a great rate (thanks to a Zipcar discount) on a room that was obviously worth much more. The queen room wasn't huge, but I've seen a lot smaller, and the view from the 12th floor was magnificent and made it seem much more spacious. It was very comfortably appointed, with a chaise in the bay window, where you can read, relax, or watch the snow fall if you're lucky enough. The hotel is also perfectly located for sightseeing and getting around to other neighborhoods in town. Complimentary wine hour is well appreciated and popular, so the small lobby can get cramped. Best to bring yours up to your room and enjoy it with the view. A 9AM shut-off for the complimentary coffee seems a bit early to me, but there's a Lavazza shop next door. Otherwise the staff was gracious and accommodating all around. A very positive experience for me.	
Dec 18 2007 	Burnham a recommended experience	The Hotel Burnham is a recommended experience for anyone exhausted of the bland environment of many major chain hotels. First of all, the ambience is quite nice, where the up-to-date interior design exploits the charm of the historic architecture with quite a modern flare. My wife and I stayed in the smallest room available (queen bed), overlooking State Street, but found the space large enough for my needs. The room was very clean, comfortable, and visually pleasing. The view of the Christmas Tree and Macy's made it all the more romantic and quaint. The staff was quite professional and friendly. Overall, it was top-notch service and a great experience. I am now addicted to Kimpton hotels and will stay there as often as possible in my travels. Now most reviews are not found credible without some constructive criticism. While I have very little serious criticism of the hotel, I found the food selections, and in particular, the wine, at their restaurant slightly overpriced considering the competition of world-class dining in the area. However, the food and service was still, by-and-large, above average. Considering many respected hotels have much worse food quality but at inflated prices, this hotel's dining is definitely ahead of the game.Overall, a more more memorable hotel stay. Hotel Burnham is luxury at a very reasonable price.	
Dec 16 2007 	One of the Best in Chicago	Just stayed Friday night at the Burnham (12/14/07). This is our Favorite Hotel in Chicago! Took advantage of the One day Sale in September, and received a great rate on the King Executive Suite. We had a corner room looking over State street, 6th floor. BEAUTIFUL ROOM, very spacious. Staff was Great. Centrally located in the Theater District. Quick trip from here up State to Morton's for dinner (1.5 miles, short cab ride). This is definitely a romantic hotel! Presently it is Noisy outside. They are building a new skyscraper across the street. You do not know what you'll &quot;Hear&quot;. We were awoken at 4:30 am Satuday AM, for about 1/2 hour. So UNDERSTAND that this may not be a quiet experience. If you are looking for a First Class, romantic place, right in the loop. THIS is your hotel.	
Dec 12 2007 	Wonderful Hotel	Stayed for three nights just after Thanksgiving. We were so impressed with this hotel it made our stay very memorable.The hotel is situated in the theatre district which is very convenient to everything being only a few minutes away.It is a beautifully renovated old building and is maintained immaculately. We had a corner room which was very large and had amazing views over the city. The staff overall, particularly the front desk and concierge, could not have been more helpfull and were exceptionally welcoming. Complimentary wine in the evening and coffee in the morning were lovely touches. The foyer was small but very cosy. One very small drawback is that there is only one small bar which is located in the restaurant. We did not notice any noise from the building opposite which appears to be nearly completed. Overall this hotel is a must to stay in while in Chicago and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something both central with outstanding staff and in very special surroundings.	
Nov 25 2007 	Dissappointed	Stayed during &quot;Looptopia&quot;.Some short-stay guests might have a great day or two.Our week-long stay however,allowed us to get quite familiar with hotel.It did have it's compromises. Paid extra for 2-room suite.Both rooms small.Lack of space for baggage (ok if just an overnight bag),bathroom very small w/chipped sink &amp; worn out showerhead. Front desk staff ok but gave us incorrect subway directions &amp; the florist they suggested was lacking in service,choice &amp; freshness of flowers.Doorman often non-existant..Poor service in the Atwood Cafe which included stained chinaware.Room safe located on floor of closet ..the low light &amp; on-the- floor- location seems thoughtless.As my wife requires injectable medicine,we asked Front Desk for a appropriately-marked disposal container. We were handed a small,plain plastic bag &amp; told room cleaning would pick up used needles when tidying the room (!). All other hotels we've stayed at in Chicago gave her plastic,sealable container with the renowned &quot;hazard material&quot; logo on it. Not the Burnham, though. To it's credit, the loop location,great windows, the historic &amp; charming ambience &amp; nice touches throughout hotel are very nice. But in tallying up our experiences for the week,we admit it's not our kind of stay.	
Nov 21 2007 	Great Boutique Hotel	We stayed at the Burnham for 7 nights early in November and despite the night time construction, we loved the place. On the 9th floor the jack hammering was audible, but not especially annoying. They clean up before the morning rush hour, it's really quite amazing, but maybe that's just the architect in me speaking. In any case, the service was excellent, the location cannot be beat and the room was adequate. It's a very historic building. Read the history on the boards in the elevator lobby. I was there for a huge conference and I am very glad I blew off the package deals and opted for this hotel. (at nearly the same rates as the deals)I am only giving it 4 dots because I feel that a courtesy warning about the construction was warranted. I would have still stayed there, but knowing would have prepared us.	
Nov 19 2007 	Great hotel despite construction	We stayed at the burnham for 2 nights and after reading many reviews were ready for the construction noise, which i can confirm does go on 24 hours a day. However i slept with ear plugs and had no problems, and my partner slept with out them and she said she slept fine and noise was no worse than some air-cons in hotel rooms, and we were only on the 4th floor and opposite the construction site. Perhaps we were lucky and work was not as heavy as when other reviewers stayed.The hotel is superb, staff friendly, beautiful lobby, and our room although not big was very clean and well furnished, and evening turn down service was nice.No coffee in room but starbucks is free in the lobby from 6.30 in the morning. Walk out of hotel and you are on state street, and washington station on the blue line is 1 block away with a direct service to o`hare.	
Nov 18 2007 	Construction noise unbearable	This is a beautiful hotel, but the 24 hour construction directly outside the hotel that is underway right now and will continue for some time makes it an unbearably loud place to stay. As noted in the other review, call first and get a detailed answer about the permits issued for any night work during your planned stay.	
Oct 28 2007 	Beware construction noise: CALL FIRST	Jackhammers were still going on at night when we checked in. Front desk gave us earplugs. They could not move our room to a higher floor. Make sure you call before you book. Will move tomorrow to another hotel.	
Oct 26 2007	Stay in an amazingly influential architectural gem!	Although the room may have been the smallest I have ever stayed in -- the accommodations were lovely. The linens, toiletries, and decorations were very lovely, and the lobby was amazing. Stay here because it's right in the middle of everything, and because as you walk to your room, you can see all of the great details of this famous building. They did an amazing job rehabbing the building -- leaving so much of the original character. It doesn't feel quite like a hotel, it still retains the office building feel, but not so much that it's uncomfortable. We are very willing to trade off space to do somersaults in our room to retain the look and feel of the Reliance Building. You'll love the huge windows in your room and the metalwork in the lobby	
Oct 15 2007 	Not worth the money you pay	The staff was friendly and attentive to my needs. However, the cupboard door that contained the refrigerator was broke. I had to call someone from the desk to fix it. When I opened the fridge, it was packed with alcohol. I couldn't get any personal items in the fridge. The arm chair in the room was dirty and the robes they provided smelled bad and were very old. The water pressure for the shower was very bad too. I had to spend an additional 10 - 15 minutes in the shower washing off all the soap. I couldn't recommend this hotel. When you pay the price they're asking, you expect better quality service and amenities. For instance, they don't provide you with an empty fridge, no microwave, no coffee maker, and the rooms need updating. The TV was very cheap/old too. They are obviously trying to save money.	
Oct 4 2007 	Increadible!	After much research and a few fears we stayed at the Burnham for a weekend getway to catch the Cubs and the Cowboys and Bears! My fear was I had read that the construction was going on and that it might be loud and a problem. How wrong I was on that count as my gamble paid off and we got as a great reward and an increadible experience. It is a Kimpton property so it should come as no surprise that the customer service was top notch and that the hotel and rooms were unique to say the least.We stayed on the 10 floor and had two rooms a corner queen and a king room. The queen was smaller than what I expected but having stayed in New York it was not a prison cell either. The Queen rooms are smaller but the one we had was a longer than wide and made use of that space in ways that the cookie cutter chains just cannot do. The bed and canopy was great and the bathroom was roomy enough for us but not huge either. The king room my folks stayed in was considerably larger but no less unique. It was not a corner room so it was more square than retangle queen room but if space is a concern the price for the king is not that much more. They only had the king and queen available so that is what we took but my finace and I loved the queen room though smaller but we spent so much time on the go that it was a cozy spot to curl up after a long night on the town. If size is a concern go king but I am a big guy and we had several bags and liked the queen room and it's corner location.We had a delay to retrieve our bags at O'hare following the Cubs game and had only about 40 minutes to check in and change and get to Soldier Field for the Sunday night Bears Cowboys game following our treck back to the airport. They zipped us in and got our bags upstairs in no time and had a cab waiting for us upon our return downstairs for the game. We made it just in time for kickoff and a Cowboys win!I cannot say enough about the staff and all their help and recomendations. Even at night when the street work was going on they let the cabs around the barracade to the front door. It is a very short walk to the red line and another block to the blue, perfect for seeing the town. The building takes you back in time and I almost felt like I was in a black in white movie with the old window type doors and the iron works on the walls. I really do not have the words to describe just how unique the building and hotel is but maybe this is the best way to put it. The Burnham is a true &quot;old school&quot; gem with the touches of 2007. If you have a chance give it a try it will be well worth it. Increadible stay!	
Sep 13 2007 	One of my favorite hotels anywhere	I've stayed at the Burnham a bunch of times for both business and leisure travel. The place is fantastic. Comfortable and stylish rooms, a really nice restaurant (great breakfasts and dinners), a terrific location if you're attending meetings in the Loop, and an ideal spot with respect to rapid transit and tourist activities. The Blue Line from O'Hare has a stop right around the corner, so you don't have to worry about a cab or long walks to get to the hotel from the airport. Millennium Park and the lakefront are just a couple of blocks away. You're also right in the theater district, so if you find yourself with free time during the week you can walk over and try for last-minute tickets to a musical. The Burnham's staff members have always been extremely gracious and helpful. This is my favorite Kimpton property in Chicago - the Hotel Allegro and Hotel Monaco are nice, but the Burnham is an extra step up.One caveat: it's an old building, so the rooms aren't huge. The building has great character and everything is spotlessly clean and modern, so to me the room size isn't as much of an issue. You also won't be in the prime shopping district, but it's very easy to take the bus or a cab (or a long walk) up to the shops on North Michigan Avenue. It's fun to do the walk all the way up Michigan Avenue, so bring some comfortable shoes and enjoy the scenery!Note that there is construction going on across the street at the moment, so there might be some daytime noise and altered traffic patterns if you stay here in the near future. Don't let that scare you off.	
Sep 11 2007 	Pluses and minuses	I chose the Hotel Burnham for my first visit to Chicago because of it's location, which did work well. I could easily walk to Millenium Park, Grant Park, the Loop sculptures, the Art Museum, the Magnificent Mile. The bed was very comfortable. The room was well appointed, but small. There was no place to put a suitcase. I set mine on a stand in the short hall between the bathroom and the bedroom. Labor Day was quiet, but Tuesday morning the construction next door (my view) started at ~7:30 am. The wine tasting was nice, but without munchies (which I need with wine) and the lobby was too small for everyone to sit. It's an interesting building architecturally, but with the small room, small lobby, no breakfast, no pool or other place to congregate, I felt it was overpriced compared to other properties I was considering. Of course I haven't stayed at those properties yet, but I will try some before returning to the Hotel Burnham.	
Sep 11 2007 	Really responsive to feedback	I've stayed at The Burnham four times now. In one of my earlier stays I had some difficulties and let the hotel know via a survey. They were very responsive so I gave them another try and it was worth it, they treated my very well upon my return stay. The rooms there are comfortable and in terms of cleanliness it's hit or miss. in two of my stays the rooms were very clean and in the two other stays the drapery was dusty and the furntire was dusty as well. I've also had the same experience at The Atwood, either it rocks or it's pretty darn bad. I've had really bad service twice now but about four other times it's been very nice. I also have found the restaurant to be very open to feedback via thier guest surveys as well.	
Sep 10 2007	Beautiful hotel - very pleasant and helpful staff	We didn't stay at the Burnham, but I felt I had to write this for anyone else who might. We walked in to ask directions to Lew Mitchell's (the well-known breakfast place). The front desk could not have been more accommodating. Not only did they look up the address, they printed out a map for us. They also let us print our boarding passes for a flight that afternoon even though we weren't staying there. The lobby is old-world (even though it's not old) and beautiful -- actually, the lobby itself is small, the rest of the main floor is the hotel restaurant which was packed with brunch-ers. We took a peek at the elevator area, and the whole thing led us to the conclusion that that's where we'll stay next time we're in Chicago.	
Sep 10 2007 	Like Everyone Else - We Love the Hotel Burnham	There's not much more to say about the Hotel Burnham, but we love it just like the rest of the reviewers here. I think it's a great value for the location and everything else about the hotel. Service was great. The only downside was rooms don't have coffeemakers....however, when I asked one was sent to our room immediately. Restaurant was great for dinner and breakfast. This has become &quot;our&quot; hotel in Chicago. Oh, you can't beat location on blue line of subway, which takes you right to OHare.	
Aug 31 2007 	Absolutely Wonderful	I have nothing but good things to say about the Burnham. My family travels to Chicago every year for Christmas, and we saw the hotel and decided to try it out. When we arrived, we were later then we origionally planned. So, we were in a hurry to make our dinner reservations. All of the staff understood our situation, and did thier best to make sure that we were taken care of, even calling the restarunt to tell them that we were on our way. When we got into the room, there was soft music playing, and the view and the room were gorgeous. We stayed for three nights, and already have plans to stay there again this year. I would reccomed this room to anyone travelling to Chicago.	
Aug 25 2007 	Wonderful!	Wonderful hotel, great location, really excellent service, decor, comfort. A great night's sleep too. Right in the heart of Chicago.	
Jul 19 2007 	Excellent Hotel	My wife and I took the advice of other TripAdvisor readers and were not disappointed. The Burnham is in an excellent location in the heart of the Loop. Convenient to public transportation. The Red line is just outside the door, the Blue line (to O'Hare) is a block away and the rest of the el lines can be caught via transferring at another station 2 blocks away. Marshall Fields department store (Macy's) is caddycorner to the hotel and Millenium Park is a short (3 block) walk. The area is lively and one feels safe walking in the evening because so many people were out.The hotel is a renovated former office building that is stylishly furnished and comfortable. Our room was small but very nice. There was construction on both wings of the hotel's outfacing sides, but it was quiet enough that we didn't have difficulty falling asleep. My wife was very happy with the buckwheat pillow she requested from the &quot;Pillow Library&quot;. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful obtaining tour tickets for us and printing our airline boarding passes. We did not have an opportunity to eat at the Atwood Cafe (hotel lobby restaurant), but it was usually busy and the menu looked good. We enjoyed our stay at the Burnham and Chicago immensely and were not disappointed by other members' advice in choosing this hotel. Our only disappointment, which was very minor, was that the hotel fitness room was eliminated in favor of a meeting room. However, we were directed to a sister hotel 3 blocks away (Allegro) where we exercised during the stay. We easily understand why the Burnham is so popular with other members.	
Jul 10 2007 	What's all the hype?	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights based on the reviews in Trip Advisor. Can't see what all the excitement is about. It is an average SMALL hotel. Yes the staff are friendly but that is really all that can be said about the hotel. The rooms are clean but VERY SMALL. My husband is 6''1 and his feet reached over the end of the bed by about 6 inches. The rooms are small, the lobby even smaller. They need a residents lounge. Not impressed with this hotel at all. Wouldn't go back.	
Jul 7 2007 	Attention to Detail	My wife and I returned from an extended weekend, OK-July 1-5, to attend the Taste of Chicago festival. It's been a number of years since being in Chicago and we were looking for something off the beaten path. The Burnham intrigued us and we decided to try it. It was a great choice. The Burnham is a refurbished office building. The conversion was tastefully done. What the rooms lack in size is more than made up by stlye and amenities. The staff here is quite impressive as you are seemingly always greeted by a smile and a &quot;Yes, sir; No, Sir&quot; answer to your questions. Would not hesitate in the least to stay here again!	
Jul 6 2007 	Loved it!	Stayed for a week while attending a course at the nearby French Pastry School. I was amazed to find such personal service at a Loop hotel! Very comfortable, very clean, very easy to get in and out of the building quickly. The entire staff was most helpful. The Hotel Burnham is my new home while in Chicago!!	
Jul 3 2007 	Class and location	Our stay at the Hotel Burnham was four nights, from June 22nd through June 26th.Upon arrival via taxi from Midway airport, we were greeted by Reggie, who took our luggage and directed us to the front desk. Check in was extremely polite and very fast. Reggie then showed us to our room on the 14th floor (of 15). He detailed a bit of the history of the hotel, and pointed out the various amenities. Our room overlooked State and Washington streets with a full view of Macy's (Marshall Fields) flagship store, the old Chicago Theatre (pretty at night, see pics) and in the distance the Marina City towers and the State Street bridge over the river.The room was adequate in size (bigger than we expected) with a queen bed, settee by the window, entertainment unit with stocked honor bar. It also featured a very nice Panasonic radio/CD player with quality sound. A desk was bedside with free high speed internet connectivity.The entry way/foyer allowed room for setting up the provided iron. A hairdryer was also provided. A safe took space on the floor of the closet, and was large enough to hold an oversized laptop computer, a good sized camera, and just about anything else we wished to put inside.The bathroom was of economy size, but was immaculate, and provided L'Occitane toiletries. The linens and towels were of high quality, and they weren't stingy with them.Temperature control was individual per room also.The hotel itself (outside of the room) was amazing. The detail, and history provided a nice sense of time and place. It was built in 1895 as an office building and was one of the original skyscapers in Chicago (post fire I guess?). The trim, iron works, lighting, and carpeting were all wonderful. Starbucks coffee was provided every morning in the lobby, and there was a wine tasting available every day at 5pm. The sitting area was small but quaint.The on site restaurant (The Atwood Cafe) always seemed to draw a crowd. Other than breakfast or drinks at the bar, however, we did not dine here. The breakfast, albeit pricey, was large and fulfilling and the service was a step above.A special notice should be made as to the service we received at every turn. From the doormen to the front desk, concierge, room attendants, and restaurant, we were made to feel welcome and that our business mattered to them even though the site was full all week.Very special thanks to Reggie, Alyssa, Keith, David, Antwon and Gus.The noise mentioned in earlier posts does occur, but we found it minor and not consistent through the trip. There is a new tower being built right across the street from the rooms facing Washington/State, but it is now reaching 20+ stories in height. Most of the noise came from the construction at road level on the street.The experience here was excellent and we highly recommend this hotel. Everything was in walking distance or a very short cab ride.Two thumbs up.Tips:Food: Cafe Iberico on N LaSalle. GREAT Tapas.VTK (Vong's Thai Kitchen) Lou Mitchell's for a classic Chicago Breakfast - All eggs double yolked!Sites:The Art Institute of Chicago - Could spend several days here.Millenium Park (The Cloud, Serpentine Bridge etc)Wrigley Field for a Cubs gameHancock Tower, less crowds and better views than Sears tower.Macy's (Old town shopping at it's finest)	
Jun 22 2007 	Great place to stay especially for architecture buffs	My husband and I just spent four nights at the Burnham and will definitely be back. The location is great, just a couple of blocks off Millennium Park. But we especially loved staying in an historic building. The public spaces (including the hotel hallways and staircases, as well as the reception area and restaurant) are a gorgeous throwback to another era. Having a leisurely breakfast in the Atwood Cafe is a great way to ponder how life has changed over the past hundred years! The rooms, while small, are beautifully decorated and have large windows. The staff were consistently pleasant and helpful. Only one word of caution: a new skyscraper is currently under construction directly across the street from the hotel. This is temporarily snarling pedestrian as well as car traffic at the corner, and it also creates a certain amount of noise, even overnight. We found the soundproofing adequate and slept well, but you can definitely hear the construction equipment in the small hours.	
Jun 1 2007	Great Location and Service	My wife and I visited the Hotel Burnham in Feb for Valentine's day and had a very pleasant stay. Everyone working from check-in to check out was great and very friendly. We were down in Chicago to see Wicked and walk around a bit downtown. The hotel is in a great spot! Everything we wanted was a short walk. We visited the former Marshall Field's flagship store (now Macy's), Millenium park (which has ice skating in the winter), the Art Institute and Ford Theatre for the show. I wouldn't recommend walking for those not in good shape, but everywhere we went was within a mile radius. There are also plenty of great restaurants of all types in the area.The room was a bit smaller than expected, but the bed was extremely comfortable. We stayed on one of the lower floors and apparently the upper floors have roomier rooms. There was also construction of a new high rise across the street, but we were never bothered by any noise. There is no pool on premises. We also did not try the restaurant, but it looked very nice. The wine hour is also a very nice, but it would be nice to have some treats with it. Also they have a fun pillow service, we ordered a bunch of different pillows. I slept very well on the anti-snore pillow!All in all, we would stay again. And make sure to check their website, we got a good deal through their &quot;hot deals&quot; program.	
May 29 2007 	Great Location!	My husband and I stayed here this past weekend. The location could not be better. It is right at the corner of State and Washington, one block from Wicked and three blocks from Millenium Park. We walked to Michigan Avenue and the Art Insitute. The only time we needed a cab was to go to a restaurant one evening. The room was tastefully furnished, quiet and comfortable. The bathroom could have used an extra shelf, but it was spacious with plenty of hot water. The staff were friendly from start to finish. The front desk always said hello when we came in, the doorman was always there to open the door and I don't think the concierge was ever away from his desk. The wine reception was very popular and the only issue was that there were not enough seats to relax in and enjoy the wine. We met some great people there and will definitely return!	
May 29 2007 	Would definitely recommend	I was in Chicago for a prep course over the Memorial Day weekend. At the last minute, I booked a hotel room through Hotwire. Hotel Burnham was the hotel I received. I cannot compliment this hotel enough. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. They allowed me to check in 2 hours early and then on my check out day, I had an all-day seminar which they promptly offered to hold my bags for the day. There was someone always ready to help or answer questions. The room was great. The bed was comfortable. The location was perfect, within walking distance from everything. I will definitely stay here again. I travel a lot and to find a hotel with such a great staff was refreshing.	
May 29 2007 	Okay Stay	Our stay at the Hotel Burnham was just average. A little dissapointing for a 4 star hotel! Their Standard rooms have a queen bed where as most hotels have 2 singles for their Standard. While this was fine for my husband and I, our 2 friends that vacationed with us were not happy to have to share a bed! Construction across the street gave a horrible view. (Not the fault of the hotel) Service was average. Nothing beyond our expectations. Stayed at the Swisotel same time last year. Would much rather stay there then here!	
May 18 2007 	Excellent hotel	Very comfortable hotel - while the rooms are on the small side, there are plenty of amenities - free Internet, TV, CD player, minibar etc. The desk chair (Aero style) was very comfortable.  Quality of food for dinner and breakfast was excellent.The level of customer service is high; all staff encountered were very curteous. Downsides - I had a rental car which had to be valet parked because the hotel is downtown, had to wait a while for it. Also, noise level can be high - windows are not sound insulating.Would definitely consider staying here again.	
May 15 2007	Renaissance complete!	I just returned from a stay at the Hotel Burnham in Chicago, and it is my new favorite place to stay there. The &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; door hanger says it all: instead of &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; it says &quot;Restoration in Progress&quot;, and on the flip side, instead of &quot;Please Make Up the Room&quot; it says &quot;Renaissance Complete&quot;. Those sentiments are completely true. While staying at the Burnham, I was able to completely recharge my batteries. The service (in both the hotel and the cafe) was exceptionally friendly, the room was exceedingly comfortable, the amenities were just what the doctor ordered (big fluffy bathrobes, thick scrunchy socks, a pile of pillows on the bed, plus a live plant and a goldfish to make it seem more like a home than a hotel), and the location was within walking distance of everything I wanted to do while I was in town. The one teeny tiny drawback was that there wasn't much countertop space in the bathroom, but in light of everything else that is so very positive about this place, I really can't complain. I am already looking forward to my next trip to this hotel.	
Apr 23 2007 	Noisy! Wait a year before you go.	Great boutique hotel - we've stayed here before several times and loved it. HOWEVER, they're building across the street, which isn't the big problem, although a bit noisy. The big problem is the city of Chicago is doing street repair in the middle of the night. We were there the weekend of April 20, 2007 and at midnight the jack-hammers were still pounding. When I managed to fall asleep, at 1:30 am, I was woken by the noise again. It went on all night. Since we were staying the weekend - management moved us to another Kimpton hotel, but what a hassle. Again - great hotel, but wait before you go. We heard from one hotel employee this has been going on for a while and is going to continue...for a year! Go only if you can sleep through anything.	
Apr 22 2007 	Burnham was great for a special weekend	I booked the Hotel Burnham from the Kimpton site for a weekend away to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. I wanted something special and historic and booked the romantic get away package in a queen suite. The staff upgraded us to the king suite without telling us and it was fantastic. The king suite was beautiful, the bed was comfortable, the 11th floor had all the historic details and everything was perfect. There was noise from the construction on the other side of the street, but only till about 9:30 and we had just come in the first night and stayed out later the next so it wasn't a problem. For a special occasion, I would definitely recommend the Hotel Burnham!	
Apr 22 2007 	Great Except for the Noise	The Hotel Burnham is a boutique hotel. The rooms are not huge but are very comfortable. My deluxe room had a comfortable queen size bed. There was a nice desk and an old-fashioned lounging seat. The hotel has a unique feel and style. Neither generic corporate hotel nor overly chic Ian Schraeger boutique, it tends to go for an old-style look but that doesn't mean dated or in need of a renovation. It may be a tad frilly for some but it isn't over the top. I like the old-style grille by the elevators myself. Everything was in good shape.I appreciated that wireless internet was included in the price of the room. The bathroom was good with nice soap and shampoos from L'Occitane. Although there wasn't really room around the sink for a toiletries bag, there was plenty of room to put out personal items.The hotel staff is excellent. I was running late for a meeting when I arrived and the check-in staff arranged to have my luggage taken up to the room without any fuss at all. I was consistently impressed by the professionalism and courtesy of the hotel staff. The hotel nicely puts out good coffee as well as tea and hot water in the morning. There is some free wine around cocktail hour though I was never there for that.Atwood's in the hotel lobby is an excellent restaurant which fits the hotel's style. However, the restaurant is separately managed from the hotel.The noise, however, from the construction project across the street is a major problem. It can be quite loud day or night and one simply cannot count on much tranquility. There were jackhammers in the afternoon and quite a lot of banging at 2AM. The hotel doesn't warn guests before booking which I imagine can lead to unhappiness. I did manage with earplugs I brought from home. I would've rated the hotel as excellent except for the serious noise issue.	
Apr 16 2007 	Top Notch But Watch the Nearby Noise	Excellent modernized historic-hotel in terms of price, location, and top-notch service. For the past weekend (April 12-15), I booked a suite on a top floor and it was fine. For those with interest in exercise facilities, their room is small but efficient, including two treadmills and two ellipticals. The afternoon wine, morning coffee, and internet without charge are friendly ways to treat guests. The only problem was the noise across the street where construction is going on 24/7 due to a city permit. The hotel staff is sensitive to the problem, and will provide ear plugs and apologies, but take care and check ahead if noise is a big problem for you.	
Mar 22 2007	Nice hotel great location	We stayed two nights at the Burnham on our first trip to Chicago. The hotel is beautiful... the renovation of this historic building was done very nicely. The staff was courteous. The location was great: a couple blocks from Millennium Park, a block away from the El and subway, theaters within a block or two. There's a Walgreens next door, very handy for munchies and whatnot. Also just up the street is Lazarra (?), an excellent espresso bar.The restaurant (Atwater's) looked nice, but we didn't get around to patronizing it. It's a little pricey.I was going to give this hotel a 5-star review, but I'm going to ding it a star because they added on a credit card charge after we checked out for (as I later found out) honor bar items. We didn't take anything from the honor bar, and they promptly credited us back, but it still bugs me.Anyway, it's a nice hotel and we'd stay there again, especially if we could get a better rate (we paid about $250/night).	
Mar 20 2007	Consistently nice	I have stayed at the Hotel Burnham about six times over the past 7 years and have never been disappointed. Yes, the non-suite rooms are on the small side, but unless you are a large person it won't be an issue. The hotel is centrally located and is within one block of the Blue Line CTA station. There is a construction project at the corner of State/Washington which is fairly noisy during the day. Construction ceases in the evening and if you get a room on the upper floors you won't be bothered during the day. Request a room facing north or east on one of the historic original floors if you are interested in that sort of thing. I will assume the previous post about an unmonitored entrance is referring to the State St entrance in the elevator corridor off the lobby. In my experience, this entrance is locked from the outside. The Atwood cafe provides nice meals but be sure you call for a reservation.	
Mar 8 2007 	Unique and Charming Hotel	This hotel has te right mix of charm, convenience, and understated luxury. Decor is interesting and unique throughout. Though the rooms are bit small, they are very comfprtable and more than adequate. The staff is great; helpful and courteous without being overbearing. At lots of upscale hotels, I feel like staff is overly solicitous but it's all in the hope of getting a bigger tip. Call me cheap but I don't think it's worth $5 for a bellman to show me where the light switch in my room is. Well, I ddn't feel that way at all at this hotel, nor did I feel in any way under-serviced. As with other Kimpton prpoerties, the evening wine reception is a nice extra touch.Highly recommended	
Mar 7 2007 	I just don't understand the hype	This hotel is perfectly nice, but I just can't see how it warrants the rave reviews other users have given it. I generally prefer boutique hotels to boring corporate places, but this property didn't have enough charm to compensate for its shortcomings.The location is pretty good; in the loop, close to many office towers and on the same block as discount shopping (Nordstrom Rack, H&amp;M, Sears, etc.). However, it is also across the street from a very large construction site, and that street is reduced to one lane. When my cab from the airport dropped me off, it briefly blocked off traffic completely, resulting in a symphony of honking.Check-in was fast and easy - I asked for a quiet room, and the friendly clerks gave me a room with a queen bed &quot;facing away from the street.&quot; What they did not mention was that it faced an airshaft. That evening, it wasn't much of a problem, but by the next morning, I had to ask to be switched to a room with more natural light. The desk staff on that occasion and subsequent occasions were polite, but not particularly warm or welcoming.The common spaces are nice; a small lobby, partitioned from a restaurant. The first floor I stayed on did not have any historical or architectural hallway touches; the second floor did, and the lamps, doors, and trims were indeed quite pretty.The biggest problem I had with this hotel was that the rooms were quite small. I'm from New York - I have a very high tolerance for small spaces. The reason both rooms I stayed in (like most of the hotel's rooms) had a queen bed was that a king-sized bed would not have fit. Indeed, there was only enough room on either side of the bed in both rooms for small shelves, rather than nightstands. I looked on the emergency exit maps on both floors, wondering if my rooms were substantially smaller than others, but they appeared to be average size.The rooms were high-ceilinged and nicely furnished in gold and royal blue, with gorgeous drapes and velvet throws, as well as several mirrors (likely to make the rooms seem larger). The room had good high-speed internet (not wireless) for $10. The first of the rooms did not have a desk lamp, and because the room was so dim, I very much needed one to do any work at the desk. The bathrooms were less impressive - utilitarian furnishings at best, with scuffed wallpaper. The bathroom in the first room had only a pedestal sink - there was simply no place to put toiletries at all. The bed was very comfortable and the bedlinens were quite nice, but the bathtowels were skimpy.Regular room service ended at 10pm, and although the hotel had 24-hour room service, the late night menu was horribly skimpy, consisting of a soup, a sandwich, about 2 salads, and a few small snacks. The room service fellow helpfully brought up a menu for one local place that delivered a full menu until late at night - but it had a one-hour wait for delivery. The food from both the hotel's late night menu and the full menu (ordered the next evening) was okay, but not great.Before I arrived at the hotel, I had booked rooms at it for a few nights on consecutive weeks, based on these reviews. After I got home from the first stay, I canceled the second stay. The main reason I canceled was that I knew I'd be arriving late again and couldn't stand the idea of eating the same late night room service. If I did go back, however, it would only be to stay in one of the hotel's few king bed suites - the queen rooms are just plain too small.One last concern. The elevators are also accessible from a doorway to the street that was not visible from the lobby or the front desk. In addition, in keeping with the historic furnishings, the doors opened with plain keys rather than card keys, and there were no safety chains or bars inside the doors. Although the hotel's neighborhood is perfectly good, I didn't feel completely secure.	
Mar 3 2007 	Beautiful hotel with a high level of service	Thanks to the advice of other trip advisor clients, I stayed at this hotel and loved it. My room was lovely, stayed on a high floor and it was quite. L'Occitaine products in the bathroom, along with all other amenities that create comfort while on the road. Had a nice meal at the restaurant, which made a late arrival easier. The staff was plentiful and willing to help on all levels. I have already recommended this hotel to others and will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Chicago.	
Mar 1 2007 	Cozy and Romantic	My Husband and I stayed here for a long weekend in mid Febuary. We loved the hotel. Loved the decor, elegant, contemporary , warm and inviting. Our room was great. Everything looked like it was brand new. Carpet, furniture, ect.. The only thing I would have liked was a little bit bigger bathroom. The one in our room was pretty tight, but I guess that is expected of a historical building. Loved the complimentary wine bet. 5-6 and they also had a complimentary makeup artist to do your makeup between that time. Just in time to get you ready for your evening out. Even I was impressed and I own a Salon! I thought it was a great touch for the female guests. We really enjoyed our stay here.	
Feb 25 2007 	great time	highly recommend....beautiful hotel, great service. located in the loop and easy to get to the el. rooms very comfortable, didn't feel too small, beutiful restoration. recommend higher floor b/c these rooms are restored from original design (the lower floors were damaged by a fire yrs ago) awesome views. restaurant downstairs serves great breakfast. also enjoyed daily wine hour from 5-6!!	
Jan 30 2007 	Looking forward to my fourth stay!	I stayed at the Burnham twice a year in 2005 and also in October 2006. I will never stay anywhere else in Chicago as this place is fabulous!! The hotel is located in the Loop area blocks from Millenium Park and the Geary stage (which I could see from my window), near the Art Institute, and close to all the major museums and acquarium. So, the location is fantastic. This area of town used to be very &quot;dead&quot; at night and not great for people travelling alone (which people who grew up in Chicago will remember) but has undergone a terrific change. Still quieter than the Magnificent Mile, but safe and not a problem to get around. Nordstrom Rack next door, Borders across the Street, and Starbucks a few doors down. I must admited I enjoyed it better when Marshall Fields was across the street--now its a common Macy's.The hotel staff is first rate and so helpful. The moment you walk in the door you feel pampered. They even honored my request for a room facing State Street. The bellhops are not just looking for tips but genuinly kind and wouldn't let me and my sister carry a thing to our rooms! The concierge is phenominal and greeted us by name the whole stay--also helped us get tickets to a show etc.The hotel is a historic building and so the room sizes vary but are exquisitly restored. Our room was smallish but very well fitted out with the typial Kimpton touches, velvet throw pillows, damask hangings, big tv, CD player, desk and chair, great amenities etc. I have stayed in a bigger suite room last year and honestly, the smaller one is great for two people and has a big closet. The bathrooms are small but marble and VERY clean!. My only complaint is the lighting in the bathroom. The makeup magnifying mirror has no light and the bathroom mood lighting is dark which makes makeup a problem. The Atwood cafe is great--a bit pricey but well worth it as the food was incredible. One of the best meals I have had and the recommended wine first rate. Tip: make a reservation if you want to eat lunch here--it is terrifically popular for the lunch crowd that works in the area. Breakfast is too expensive so we only ordered coffee and pastries in our room.I have stayed in many Kimpton hotels in SFO, Washington D.C., Boston, and Chicago while travelling on business. The Burnham by far is my favorite and I have just booked another stay in April. It is definately a trip to look forward to!	
Jan 28 2007	Absolutely perfect--YOU SHOULD STAY HERE!!!	Although I am writing this review a little late, seeing as we stayed at the Hotel Burnham, let that be a testimonial to how great it was, that I'm still thinking about it months later. We visit Chicago often, and now that we have found the Hotel Burnham, we will stay nowhere else. The experience begins when you visit their website, they play great music that gets you ready to relax! It is easy to navigate, and we stayed for $159/night booked right on their website, when Priceline couldn't even get us a room for $250 anywhere downtown. This hotel is just a block off Michigan Ave, down by Marshall Fields/Millenium Park. Location is fabulous, you can take the el anywhere, walk, or catch a cab. I was a little nervous when we walked in, there was only a small desk with two employees, but we were helped promptly. Our room keys (yes, real keys!) were not ready, so the front desk clerk (Carlos--yes, I still remember his name months later!) walked us up to our room himself, and the keys were to be delivered momentarily (we wound up picking them up right away because we decided to leave quickly to do some shopping). Our room had a large air purifier in it when we got there, it was removed immediately. There was also an odd odor, but we were in our room not three minutes when Carlos came back and said he had noticed the odor and offered us room freshener, which was not overpowering smelling. When we returned less than an hour later, our room no longer smelled.The room was fabulous with a neat city view, great furnishings, wonderful bed...the bathroom was spacious, there was a CD player, really great. There was a complimentary wine service in the evening, and the wine was actually decent! When we returned late that evening, turndown service had been provided, with soft lighting, chocolates, wine which the hotel sent complimentary because it was my birthday, and the CD player playing relaxing music. Just phenomenal. I haven't had this good of an experience in a long, long time. We never once saw or heard anyone else on our floor, we felt as if we were the only guests in the hotel. All in all, simply a perfect stay.	
Jan 13 2007 	Best Hotel hands down	My husband and I stayed at this hotel in Feb of 2006 for our first trip to Chi Town. We were only there for 3 nights but it was fabulous. I emailed the hotel ahead of time to get some ideas on what we could do close by since it was going to be such a short trip and they graciously replied with all of what we considered the best ideas and even made our reservations for us. I have to say the rooms at this hotel are great with high ceilings and a beautiful and very comforatble bed. We loved that you got actual keys instead of just cards. The reception every night was a great way to meet other travelers and locals. We ate dinner the first night at Atwood Cafe and it was our best meal the entire trip. I loved the Starbucks down in the lobby every morning. We were close enough to everything that walking or a quick cab ride got you just where you wanted to be. I just found out that I'll be traveling back this Feb. and regret that I will not be staying at this hotel b/c it is for business. I can't wait to go back not on business so that I can stay at this hotel again.	
Jan 5 2007 	Cool and Hip	This place is simply awesome! We stayed in a suite overlooking State Street mid-December. Hands-down the coolest hotel room I've ever been in. The decor in this hotel is mesmerizing. Enormous plush robes and a great room with a view made us not want to go outside. Steps to the theater and right across from Macy's and an el train entrance. Location is perfect. Food in the hotel restaurant is great. It's called the Atwood Cafe. I've eaten there three times and every time it's great. This is a hotel for people who want something different and appreciate great attention to detail. Great romantic hotel.	
Dec 31 2006 	Excellent value 	We spent a night here while in the area visiting family over Christmas, and had our dog with us. The Kimpton group, which owns this hotel, was always pet friendly when we had stayed at their other properties, and were just as much so here. Our dog is a 55 lb Shepherd mix, not a little lap dog, and that didn't phase them either.If you aren't into travelling with your pets, however, this place is still a gem. And as an aside, I didn't see anyone else there with their pets during our stay, so I would doubt the place is overrun with them for people who don't like animals. They also had us on a pet-friendly floor - so presumably you could also make sure you were on a floor without animals if you had allergies or something. The pet friendly rooms did not smell wierd or have anything wrong with them, they seemed just like all their other rooms - just, presumably, away from people who didn't want to be by animals!The location is fantastic - you could walk to all the great downtown spots from here, and you are smack in the middle of the theatre district. The rooms are small - but have very high ceilings and practically floor to ceiling windows, so they feel much larger than they are. Nicely decorated, that is the Kimpton hotel &quot;thing&quot; - all their properties are funky, boutique, edgy but always comfortable. Great bed at the Burnham, which I have luckily also had when staying at other properties of theirs. We didn't eat at the restaurant because we had other plans for our meals while there, but it was always full of people and the menu looked appealing.Staff was very friendly, even when our dog woofed at those wearing hats (she's a Shepherd mix, what else can I say?) and helpful (with directions and similar). We paid $152 + tax and valet parking - and again I think this is one of the best values for the money in downtown Chicago. We have stayed at a number of downtown hotels over the years - and (with or without our dog), this is definitely a hotel we would come back to next time.	
Dec 2 2006 	pretty nice	Stayed for 5 nights this past week. Hotel was nicely decorated including the room, which was small but comfortable. We had requested a king bed but only got a queen. According to staff there are only 13 king beds in the hotel, so we couldn't upgrade. not a huge deal. Was awoken 1 of the 5 nights by construction noise which STARTED at 11pm. Couldnt sleep until 3am. We were on a higher floor, so I can't imagine it being quieter lower down. Didn't find out there was a fitness center until the last day. Nobody went out of their way to tell us that, and we didn't see information about it in the hotel room book. Free wine 5-6 nightly is a nice touch. Restaurant also convenient. Location is excellent for shopping and the theater. Close walk to the art museum and millenium park. Train to ohare is only 2 blocks away. Anyway, this is a nice hotel with a historic feel. Rooms are a bit on the small side but comfortable enough. I would wait until the construction is done if you want to stay here, and they don't look too far along with it.	
Nov 13 2006 	Above and Beyond Service at Hotel Burnham!	My best friend, Karyn and I spent 6 nights at the Hotel Burnham November 4th - 10th. She was in a conference and I was on my own to sight-see during the day. Paul, the Concierge and all of the Front Desk staff were exceptionally helpful to me with planning where to go and what to see. They had numerous suggestions ranging from inexpensive to pricier ideas. All were well thought out and fun to do. One of our favorite and cheapest outings was supplied by James the Head of Housekeeping for the Hotel Burnham. He took us to a fantastic and FREE rooftop to show us a phenomenal view of the city! We were able to take panoramic shots of every point of interest in Chicago. What a beautiful sunset! The doormen were always wonderful and happy to see us safely back after our adventures. On our final day, we sadly contacted the front desk to see about weighing our bags (so that they weren't over 50 pounds for the airplane) and James the Bellhop promptly arrived in our room. He was able to reassure us that our bags weren't too heavy, and said he would be happy to deliver our bags to the lobby. After checking out, James asked us if he could load our bags in our vehicle for the airport. We explained to him that we were going to take the &quot;Blue Line&quot; train to O'Hare and that we'd just be rolling down the street to the underground train terminal. After a moment of stunned silence, James replied that there was &quot;no way&quot; he would allow us to lug our baggage that far and down that many steps. (We had 8 large pieces between us.) James enlisted the help of our favorite doorman Shimon and between the two of them, they carted all of our luggage a block away, down two flights of stairs, through the turnstills and explained how to purchase tickets for the train. We tried to help, but they insisted that they would do it, so Karyn carried her purse and I carried Shimon's hat. It was the least I could do. James and Shimon wished us a safe trip back to Washington State and to please come and visit Chicago and the Hotel Burnham again sometime. We're happy to report that thanks to them, we'll gladly return to the windy city and the beautiful Hotel Burnham sooner rather than later. Sincerely, Jenny from Washington State	
Oct 21 2006 	Highly recommended Hotel Burnham	Excellent location in the Loop in downtown Chicago, walking distance to shops, museums, parks, theatres, restaurants and the Magnificent Mile. Love the personal touch, the courteous service all around and the very helpful concierge. Great way of unwinding with the complimentary wine tasting in the lobby everyday. Very comfortable and cozy room with even a turn down service at night (bed ready, curtains drawn, ice buckets filled and chocolates)! Would recommend the Atwood Restaurant found at the main floor of the hotel-rated one of the best places to eat in the city. Would definitely return.	
Oct 9 2006	Location location location!	I was booked at this hotel for a weeklong business trip. This was my first experience at a boutique property (and my first trip to Chicago) and it was marvelous. The hotel's historic details and impeccable staff only added to the A-list location. It'sh in the heart of shopping (across the street from Marshall Fields/Macys) and just blocks from Millennium Park, the theater, etc.The decor was absolutely gorgeous: I felt like a queen on her throne. The small touches - large TV, CD players, CDs, chaise lounge, luxurious decor - went a long way. Drawbacks included small bathroom (but it was nice), construction across the street and so-so service in the restaurant.Still, I would stay here any time.	
Oct 5 2006	Perfect weekend getaway	Loved the Burnham. A great long weekend getaway. Now it is a boutique, so do not go there expecting massive cookie cutter rooms. The charm is the great restoration in a historic part of town. Room was beautifully appointed. Went with the King Bed room , which was by the elevator but we did not hear a sound. Upper floor gave us a great view of the City and Millenium Park.Staff was attentive from the bellhop to the concierge. Arrived early Friday and was allowed to book in early (with a little persistence). Location convenient and the Walgreen's next door came in handy more than once.Only complaint is the Atwood Cafe breakfast. Though I was not at all pushed to eat here, it is the only place in the building. It was good, but it also ran us $60 for two, which I found more than a bit much. No wine, mimosas or any bar tab that would explain such a high bill.	
Sep 26 2006 	Going down hill or just once in a blue moon	This hotel always receives glowing reviews so either I experienced a rare bad day at the hotel or they are beginning to cut cornors on who they hire. Usually when I read trip advisor I ignore the highest and the lowest ranking because the lowest is usually some crank who will never be happy and the highest is someone who never complains even when they should. I am usually the easy going guy who gives places the benefit of the doubt and ranks them a little higher than most because I have more tolerance than most. I am also the easy going guy who is liked by the doormen and the porters and the waiters because I treat them with genuine respect, tip them more than most others, and don't act like I am any better than they are because I know I am not. I was just luckier in life than they were. So maybe it was just a statistical fluke. Usually one strike and your a little down in the count, three strikes and your out, but eight strikes is a little bit much.The room was beautiful, the hotel building is beautiful. I called ahead for my car and cleary said 327, they repeated and said 327, I confirmed and then went down 20 minutes later and they had brought car 307 and the valet clearly had trouble with the english language. This resulted in my being late for a meeting and throwing the schedule off for the whole day. If this were the Ramada Inn I would take it in stride but I was paying over $300 a day for a suite and not using coupons.At dinner my chair was bumped from behind 4 times by the busboy who never apolagized even though when I looked my chair was in the central aisle and there was 6 to 8 feet of room behind it. We happened to be at the cornor of 2 aisles and he was cutting the cornor way too close. Once is understandable. 4 times is absurd. Especially when there is that much room behind you. My wife and I finally picked up the table and moved it inward so it was out of line with the other tables so I couldn't be bumped again.During a 25 minute period 3 sets of plates were dropped with a crash that was so loud it made your ear hurts. After the 3rd time everyone was sitting waiting for the fourth. Every business has its bad days and even the best have a 1 in a thousand horrible day by sheer bad luck. Perhaps that is what happened. If there are no more reviews like this I will say it is bad luck. If more reviews like this begin to appear I'd say they are beginning to cut cornors in their hiring practices in order to save money. For over $300 a day you don't expect cornors to be cut and you don't give second chances. I will go elsewhere in the future.	
Sep 17 2006 	Pretty to look at	This hotel is in a beautiful old building that has some great architectural elements. The location of the hotel is good for exploring the loop and it is not far from Grant Park. I thought the service was above average and our room was clean and decorated very nicely. Try to get a larger room if you stay here because the smaller rooms are really small!! Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and would recommend walking through or eating at the hotel even you do not stay here because it has some great architectural elements and is pretty to look at.	
Sep 14 2006 	Very nice	Stayed here last weekend with another couple. We loved everything about this hotel. The service was wonderful, friendly, and very helpful. The room was charming and oh so comfortable. Floors 7 and up are a little nicer, ask for those. The restaurant was excellent (so was Pizano's down the street) The had a nice little wine reception every night. Very close to Millennium Park and the &quot;bean&quot;. Couple blocks form the river and the start of the Magnificent mile. Easy walk to Sears tower. What else can I say!	
Sep 7 2006 	Stylish great location excellent staff--highly recommend	Loved this hotel--will totally stay here again. The staff was excellent. When we checked in, we got a room on the 2nd floor that smelled like smoke, and I noticed a giant construction site right across the street. Asked to change rooms and the front desk happily obliged--no questions asked, no attitude! They were friendly, polite, and helpful throughout. Some of the best service I've had. New room on 8th floor had a great view of the city, was above the construction noise, and had an awesome hallway. They kept the original doors from the office building prior to conversion--frosted glass with metal work--really cool. Rooms are small, but they are very nicely appointed and comfortable. These pictures are kind of dark but hopefully you get the idea. Location is excellent--right in the heart of downtown, a block from Millenium park, el stops abound, fantastic shopping, major museums nearby. I highly recommend this place, but I'd ask for a room on a higher floor to avoid construction noise.	
Sep 7 2006 	Slice of heaven	Where do I start. It all began with the bellmen at the door. Smiling faces and very friendly. Check-in was fast, and before I knew it, I was in a slightly small, but tastefully decorated room. The view was beautiful except for the construction site. Chicago's Jazz Fest was in full swing labor day weekend and the proximatey to the park only required a brief and enjoyable walk. Burnhams's location to the trains couldn't be better. The redline train station was just outside the door, and the blueline was right around the corner. Staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to satisfy. For the price I paid through an online booking site, I fully got my dollars worth. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.	
Sep 6 2006 	Great Hotel-Great Location	This older hotel has been thoughtfully renovated keeping the look of the office hallways on floors 8 through 12. Extremely clean, well maintained with a staff that provides great customer service with a smile. Our room had a bay window. Never mind the construction that is taking place across the street, its a city, and construction is to be expected. Its close to Millinium Park and the Art Institute and reasonably priced for a big city smaller almost boutique style hotel. The downstairs bar is known for its white sangria and the little restaurant is upbeat and very interestingly designed. I recommend this hotel highly. Instead of paying $35.00 a day though to park your car at any of the Chicago hotels, I believe you can leave your car overnight at the Millinium Park Garage for $13.00 a day.	
Aug 29 2006	perfect in every way	I stayed at the Hotel Burnham for three nights last week and though the hotel was completely booked, I never had to wait for anything. Room service was nearly instant, elevators speedy, concierge questions were addressed immediately. The twice daily housekeeping was never intrusive, the rooms were silent and the beds heavenly. Upon returning from a run or from shopping, the doorman offered a cold bottle of water - what a treat! The food at the hotel's Atwood Cafe was so outstanding and well-priced, I ate every meal there (save for one mistake at the Ritz Carlton). I liked the Loop location better than the Mag Mile because it is a little quieter.	
Aug 28 2006	Perfect Location Great for Dogs	This hotel was excellent. The rooms were funky and cool - although a bit on the smaller side but this is a big city. Everyone at the hotel was so nice and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. We also brought our puppy who loved it. They gave him lots of treats, his own bed, some bowls and dog food and a welcome pack. He was treated like royalty. Also, location is perfect, just 2 blocks from Millennium park and art institute and a short walk to the boat for the architecture tour. Parking was 38 dollars a night - a bit much - but again, this is Chicago. Overall, loved it and would stay again if in chicago.	
Aug 26 2006 	A gem in the heart of Chicago	We found this hotel to be very charming. Even my 9-year old daughter loved it. The staff were very friendly and attentive, the location was great (across from Marshall Fields and close to Millenium Park and Michigan Avenue), and the rooms were beautifully restored and comfortable. Although there were only 2 elevators, we never had to wait very long. We will definitely stay here again.	
Aug 20 2006	Lots of character	Was booked into this hotel as others were full and was pleasantly surprised. Have been told this was an old speakeasy and retains some of its charm, though it is hidden away behind an unassuming front. Antique elevators add some character to the hotel. Staff was attentive and generally very good. Room was very small for the price, but perhaps expected for Chicago. Location also great in bustlng area -- across from Marshall Fields, and a few blocks from tourist area on Michigan Avenue.A bit pricey, but met expectations for a hotel of this price range.	
Aug 18 2006 	Great hotel great locatin	My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Burnham over the Aug. 12 weekend. Great hotel that's in easy walking distance to many attractions. PROs: Beautiful building with well-appointed rooms. Very comfortable beds. Amenities include iron/board, safe, daily paper, complementary wine in the afternoon, L'Occutane shampoo/gel/conditioner, radio/CD player, lush velvet bedding. Had an Executive Suite (two rooms with king bed in one room and a small parlor in the next, French door dividers). Within walking distance of Ford's Oriental Theater (currently running Wicked -- The Musical which was very good), the Chicago theater, Millenium Park, Art Institute, shopping, restaurants, and if you're in reasonably decent shape, you can even walk to the Field Museum and the Chicago River (for Wendella Boat tours - highly recommend). Had an excellent dinner at the Atwood Cafe at the hotel. Pricey but good portions.CONS: Parking is $35/day and you have to pull up to the hotel's front (in the midst of traffic) and let the valet take it from there (valets were very professional however). Bathrooms are small (it is a historical building) and elevators are slow but it's really nothing that takes away from an all-around great hotel.No coffee makers in room - but they do have Starbucks coffee in the lobby every morning. However, I really believe the other guests would NOT want to see me pre-coffee. Even Holiday Inn Expresses have coffee in the room now, so should Hotel Burnham.Huge construction project across street (50-story office/shopping/hotel building) -- will kill views. Construction runs Monday through Saturday. Higher the floor, less noise you'll hear.Was only disappointed slightly with two incidences (and they would NOT keep me from coming back). Number One -- Had some problems with check-in. We arrived early and was told our room wasn't ready which we fully expected - we were then told that they would give us a call about our room by the usual check-in time of 3:00. Stayed in lobby in direct sight of front desk and waited an hour. Meanwhile bellmen were falling over each other trying to please a group of single women who were also waiting for their rooms (can I get you a drink, would you like a paper) but we were pretty much ignored. At 3:20, no phone call received, and we had watched several people who arrived after us get their rooms. So I had to go back to front desk to find out the situation. It was only then that they told me that the previous occupants were still in our room and had late checkout. To the hotel's credit they immediately upgraded us to an Executive Suite but this wasn't that big of a deal because we had already reserved a Deluxe Suite (no french doors, queen size bed). I understand snafus can happen, but I think they should have known when we got there that our room wasn't going to be ready at the check-in time of 3:00, and change the rooms then - why make us wait for a call that didn't come or ignore us in the lobby for almost an hour and a half. Number Two -- concierge staff was a little underwhelming. I had already set up all the tickets for everything we wanted to do (Wicked, Wendella Boats, King Tut exhibition, and Blue Man Group - all fantastic). All we needed were recommendations to a restaurant in a certain area but he had no clue whatsoever. The concierge couldn't have been nicer, but all he could do is google the info and print us out a map (well heck I could have done that myself). For a hotel of this caliber, the concierge should know the city backwards/forwards, know all the logistics for the main attractions, and be ready with suggestions for dining/entertainment (or at least know someone who does). I guess these very minor things just seemed really glaring to me because the hotel is ranked so high (and for the most part it's deservedly so) and the reviews have been so glowing. I really wish I could give it 4.9 stars. Just a little touchup in check-in procedures and concierge services, and it's easily 5-star.We'll definitely be back, but will probably get a standard room. We were able to peek in a few and they look just as nice as the suites (if smaller) and are much less expensive (gotta save that money for parking!!)	
Aug 15 2006	Hotel Burnham...alway a treat	My wife and I spent four nights at the Hotel Burnham in early August. It was our second stay in the past year. The hotel is a small boutique facility in the renovated 1890's Reliance Building, designed by Daniel Burnham.The hotel is located in the heart of Chicago's Loop, across from what used to be Marshall Field's, and two blocks from the Millenium Park.While small, the rooms are comfortable and well decorated. We stayed on the 14th floor, high above any traffic noise. The hotel uses much of the century-old wrought iron decorations, as well as some of the tile work.The service here is wonderful. From the doorman to the concierge the staff are both pleasant and helpful. Each afternoon at five the hotel hosts a complimentary wine tasting. The wines were good and the small lobby encourages conversing with the interesting people who stay there..Also of note is the hotel's Atwood Restaurant. Named after the lead architect of the orginal building, the restaurant serves excellent food at a fair price.Our trips to Chicago and stay at the Hotel Burnham are becoming annual events. We highly recommend it. We booked out room four months in advance and the hotel was full when we were there.	
Aug 15 2006 	Awesome!	Stay:July 19th to 22nd, 2006Rooms:Our Queen Bedroom was gorgeous with fantastic furnishings, a bit on the small side but it was more than enough space for my wife and me. The bed was really comfortable topped with incredible pillows.. Aveda bath products. Free Internet access if you bring your laptop with ethernet cables provided in the room. The room also featured tall ceiling and huge windows with great views of the city. The curtains are fantastic blocking out almost all light if you need to sleep in Also supplied with the rooms are a terrific selection of bath amenities, two plush bath robes and a thoughtful dimmer switch for the bathroom lights.Location:This location exceeded my expectations. We took the blue transit line from O'Hare and arrived virtually a block away from the Hotel. I think it is located in one of Chicago's finest corners, right down the block from Millennium Park, the Art Institute, Marshall Fields. It is very great in terms of transit, as it is at or near a collection of stations and bus stops. Very convenient and safe, even late at night.(please note that theres a building under construction on the block across from the hotel. It did not bother us but we did notice activity starting at 8:00am weekday. I think this will last for at least another year however it is not the Hotels fault and shouldnt be held against them)Building:Turn of the century art deco architectural masterpiece restored to its original beauty with an abundance of modern touches. The building is beautiful, especially the main floor and elevator lobby area with lots of wrought iron and marble. We did not encounter slow elevators, in fact most times on the main floor lobby a cab with open doors was waiting for us.Service:We arrived early and there was no problem to have our room early. The concierge was extremely helpful with recommendations and locations for attraction, restaurants and transportation. All in all the staff were knowledgeable, courteous, and above all sincerely happy to help. In fact as were heading out on a rainy morning they offered us an umbrella to use for the day. Observant and caring. Doorman always greeted us and welcomed us back.Each night they give you a robe and have a turn down service with chocolates on the pillow. The stereo was on with soft music playing as we came back each night as a nice welcoming touch.Overall:The Hotel Burnham is nothing but class, it is a wonderful alternative to the huge convention hotels. Burnham is more than the hotel, it is about caring about the people staying there because they truly and personally want to make your stay memorable.They have restored the art of customer service.	
Aug 9 2006 	stunning	Stayed two nights 8/1 and 8/2 Pros- 1. Cannot beat the location for seeing Wicked- the hotel is one block away and you could see the theater from our room-805. 2. Also convenient for Cubs games, just take the red line to Addison. 3. Check-in was a breeze, the room was gorgeous, comfy bed and linens, bathrooms provided. 4. One surprise I feel in love with was the shampoo and conditioner by L'Occitane-it tamed my unruly hair and I promptly bought two bottles, expensive though at $165. wine reception from 5-6 was good, but only offered one white and one red, but hey its free. They do a trivia game and give away a bottle of wine to the winners. 6. The concierge was always extremely helpful with recommendations and locations. 7. Hotel is convenient to a lot of shopping (old navy, H &amp; M, forever 21, etc). Close walk to Millennium Park, Michigan Ave, and the Mag Mile. 8. Also, I left my video Ipod in the safe and did not remember until I got home. I have to say kudos to the hotel for having honest maids b/c it was returned to lost and found.Cons- 1.they are doing construction across the street and it does start at 6 AM. I'm a sound sleeper so I wasnt worried when other reviews mentioned this, but be forewarned- it is loud! I would be extremely upset if I had paid full price, but I got the room on hotwire for $100/night. 2. no places to eat in the area after 10, except one pizza place. However, it was great! It begins with a &quot;P&quot; and is the only place in the area open late- take a right on Wabash and walk under the L, it's on the left. The garlic bread with cheese is to die for. The concierge recommend it so they will know the name.Other reviewers had problems with the elevators- we did not. I also like the free internet access and did not mind that it was at the front desk.	
Aug 7 2006 	Nice night at the Burnham	We recently spent one night at the Hotel Burnham and were very impressed. We got a deal at $100/nt on Priceline. It had a great location (cheaper shopping such as Old Navy etc. rather than the high-end shops on the Magnificent Mile). We loved the room and the staff was great. Our view out of the room was over a construction site, but it was still OK. They offered wine in the evening and the restaurant onsite was great for breakfast. There was lots of traffic noise from our room, but that was to be expected from the location. We are not overly picky people ourselves, but I think anyone who chooses this hotel will be happy.	
Aug 3 2006 	Location Service Style	Hotel Burnham sits in Chicago's finest location, right down the block from Millenium Park, the Art Institute, Marshall Fields, The Financial District and all that is the famed Loop. The building is beutiful and the service impecable. I would recommend the Hotel Burnham over the Four Seasons and others.	
Aug 1 2006 	Rocking the winds in the windy city	The Hotel Burnham is nothing but class. As a young married man who doesn't care for big corporate hotels because they don't care about their guests needs. I have found an ally in the Hotel Burnham. This location immediately exceeded my expectations. My concern of the other entries relative to construction were moot because I stayed over the weekend. No pile drivers woke me up! They did start at 8:00 Monday morning, but I was up and it was kind of loud, but only out on the street not in the room.The look and feel of this Hotel is worth the money (esp. if you are able to make a deal with an internet travel company). I did and spent around $110/night. Do not believe the other entries. The Hotel Burnham may be inaddequate for people that want their feet kissed or butt wiped for them, but for somebody who just doesn't think most hotels care about the people staying in their hotel and want to stay in a memorable enviornment with people that care (sincerely) for their guests. This is the hotel for you. Case and point my wife loved it. I looked like a stud.Also the location is very good, block to millenium park, on the same block as the red and blue line. We took the blue line from O'Hare which is 45 minutes. All in all the staff were knowledgeable, courteous, and above all sincerely happy to help.There may be a legitamate criticism of waiting for slow elevators, but I think that whoever designed the lobby paid off the elevator engineer to make them slower so people could just enjoy the lobby. It is immaculate.	
Jul 22 2006 	Top Notch Nothing But Class! -however--	there were a couple of negatives.The hotel was gorgeous, great staff, luxuriously appointed and very well located. The rooms were smallish but boy were they classy! The bed and bedding were to die for. There are only two elevators, but we never had to wait more than about 2 minutes for one &amp; hotel was full (only ten rooms per floor). Eighty percent of rooms face north and great views of State Street, Chicago and Oriental theaters and parts of the lower mag mile are afforded through the largest windows I've ever had in a hotel room. The windows are great , but they do let in more ambient street noise than normal.I had breakfast at the very cool and inviting Atwood Cafe (just off the small lobby), Eggs Benedict and Starbucks coffee: $14.50 service and food were very good. Dinner menu appears to be priced about 25% lower than other premium restaurants in the area. I wish we'd had time to try them for dinner.The negatives are paradoxically related to some of the positives. The entire city block just to the north is vacant (this is what allows the great views), and a HUGE construction project has just begun. This looks like it going to be a very lenghy project and the noise begins about 7AM--the pile drivers started about 7:30. However, once the project is done it should muffle some of the aforementioned street noise, but the great views will be no longer.If you are a light sleeper or hope to catch a snooze during the day- I couldn't recommend this hotel until the project next door is complete. If that doesn't bother you, this place is truly great!	
Jul 14 2006	Caveat Emptor	I just returned from an underwhelming experience at the Burnham, considering the glowing reviews it usually gets.Pros: Clean, comfortable bed, water was hot enough, L'Occitane en Provence soaps and shampoos, air conditioning worked well and was quiet, most of the furniture in fairly decent shape. Centrally located in the Loop across the street from Marshall Fields/Macy's, the forty bazillionth Old Navy store franchise, and surrounded by the Nordstom Rack and Walgreen's. Washington Red Line Station right outside, easy walk to Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc.. Building has an interesting history of restoration which is nicely documented on the first floor public area.Cons: I got the room via Priceline, which requests a non-smoking room but does not guarantee one - good thing, because I was stuck in a second floor smoking room (202). The air conditioner running full blast cleaned the air, but it sure stank when I first entered the room; otherwise, the hotel was sold out, so no change was possible. If you nudged the desk/table between the beds, the whole thing shook back and forth, I thought it was going to fall apart, the phone wasn't plugged in correctly, and the lamp wasn't plugged in at all. The ambient noise from the streets below might bother some people. The &quot;complimentary Internet service&quot; in the lobby is at the check-in desk - you stand next to the incoming clientele - no chair, not sure if it was attached to a printer. Not that this mattered, because the server only worked on the evening I arrived and not for the rest of my stay; they told me a serviceman was coming to fix it on the day I was leaving; it was obviously not a priority. Thanks to Tonya, one of the concierges, who allowed me to use her desk's computer to print out boarding passes for the trip home. And be forewarned, hotel guests have no priority at the attached Atwood Cafe - if you don't make dinner reservations you're toast. I did have breakfast the first morning I was there - greasy eggs and sausage, coffee and OJ for $19.50. The elevators in this building made the ones at the Ambassador East seem jet-propelled. Here being on the second floor was an advantage and the stairs worked fine.I wouldn't ever pay their advertised rates to stay here, and if I got the place via Priceline again, I'd sure be more proactive in ensuring satisfaction, instead of expecting the hotel to provide it outright. This place has a serious case of unwarranted smugness. Boutique shmoutique!	
Jul 4 2006	Disappointing	Very clean, beautiful hotel. However, because they preserved the historic nature of the building, the doors were so heavy that they slammed shut when anyone would go in or out of their room. It also was very noisy. Guest talking in the hall by the elevators sounded as though they were in your room. The bathroom had very little shelf space for all the women's essential needs :).But what I hated the most about the hotel was findng that my new pair of white slacks had been stolen out of my luggage. The weather had been so cold that we mostly stayed in our jeans so never even unpacked the lighter clothing. And it wasn't noticed until I unpacked at home. We reported it to the hotel but nothing was done about it.	
Jun 20 2006	Believe the Hype!	This was an amazing hotel. Wonderful location and wonderful staff. You feel like you stepped into a turn of the century art deco architectural masterpiece. Truly remarkable. The rooms are bit on the small side but it is more than made up for with the fantastic furnishings and decoration. When in Chicago I'll only stay here!	
Jun 18 2006 	Very nice hotel in Chicago	The Burnham offers a great location in Chicago, just a half block from the Blue Line that easily gets you to and from O'Hare for $3, and a quick walk from the river, Mag Mile, Millennium Park, art museums, theater district. This is a boutique hotel offering reasonable rates, a gorgeously designed environment and very friendly staff.The Burnham is in a glorious old office building that's been restored for hotel use. In my three stays, I have had rooms of various size and shape which is part of the charm, and have enjoyed very comfortable sheets and beds, reasonably well-configured baths.My only complaint (as with most hotel rooms) is that the bathroom lighting isn't exactly conducive to expert makeup application, but you live with it.Staff are pleasant and helpful. The doormen were unfailingly polite and helpful, particularly one whose name I didn't catch but who exemplified the idea of Joy At Work -- always smiling and enthusiastically greeting you in the morning or evening.The in-lobby restaurant has great tall windows and an ambitious breakfast-lunch-dinner menu as well as a creative wine list. I'd recommend the Burnham to business or leisure travelers who enjoy a special place that outshines the more pedestrian big-chain hotels.	
Jun 15 2006	A Pleasant Surprise	We're here now at the Hotel Burnham using our FREE internet access in our room. The rooms are adorable; small yet well appointed. The chocolates were on our bed, as was my sons PJs all folded up nicely, right alongside the new Build-A-Bear bears he bought today for his sister. We usually stay in either Four Seasons or Holiday Inn Express, because so often that place in the middle is so lacking, dirty, and ordinary that it's just not worth it. The Hotel Burnham is worth it. Aveda bath products, incredibly comfortable beds and pillows, and a perfect location. Get this: our first night we went to the Cubs game (they lost, what's new?), and we simply walked out the door and on to the Red line and up to Wrigely Field. Last night we went to see Wicked (amazing), and during intermission we ran across the street to our room to use our own bathroom! Also yesterday we went to the Museum of Science and Industry and we walked to the corner and took the number 10 bus, just a matter of feet from our door. This is a truly wonderful hotel where someone is in charge and telling his/her people: let's bring back the art of customer service.	
Jun 5 2006 	You should stay here.	I stay in hotels all the time for work, and often rely on my friends at TripAdvisor. They were right-on with the Hotel Burnham. Firstly--I arrived with four significant bags. When the bellman brought them up to my room, he was just so friendly and nice. Willing and able to answer any questions whatsoever. Secondly, I loved the decor of the hotel. Lots of wrought iron and marble. No generic cream and teal hallways here. The Burnham must have been an old office building because each hotel room door has that 1940s style look to it--as if there's a bookkeeper or accountant behind the door. And they give you a real key--not one of those credit card things. I must admit to being a big fan of the real key. (Hopefully they get them back from everyone upon checkout.) Thirdly--the wine in the lobby from 5 to 6 is really great. A friend of mine was meeting me at the hotel at 5:30 and she was late, so I was quite blissfully enjoying my shiraz in the lobby when she finally did arrive at 5:45.What else--the beds are really comfortable and don't have those horrible dips in them as if you're the 20 millionth person to sleep there. The stereo in each room is a really nice touch. The curtains are FANTASTIC! They block out all the light and you'd think it was the dead of night at 2 in the afternoon. (This was great with my jetlag.) Also, they give you a robe and have a turn down service with chocolates on the pillow. Aveda bath products. Free Internet access if you bring your laptop--ethernet cables are provided in the room. I was impressed that I checked in around 10 a.m. on Friday morning and when I came back to the hotel around 5 p.m. that night, the doorman remembered me and welcomed me back. On the downside--valet parking costs $37 a day.	
Jun 3 2006	Great location overpriced	My husband and I are locals, but live on the North side. We stayed here for two nights as a birthday gift.The good ...The location really cannot be beat. Across the street from Marshall Fields -- soon to be Macy's grrrr :( , walking distance to theaters, Millenium Park, the Art Institute and more.The building is a Chicago landmark named after Daniel Burnham, the architect who designed most of the city. And care has been taken to re-create the lobby to match what it would have looked like hundreds of years ago. Great for tourists who are interested in architecture and Chicago history.The bad ...We felt the hotel was overpriced for what you get. Other hotels in the Chicago seem to give you more for your buck.The rooms have been all redone so they are very modern instead of vintage. They are extremely nice, clean, etc., but we were expecting something more historic, like the Drake.The ugly ...Across the street from our room, construction has begun on an empty lot, which used to be the city's ice skating rank. The hotel can do nothing about this, it is not their fault, but construction begins very early in the morning ... 7am Monday-Friday ... and wakes you up. Other guests were complaining about it as well.(See my pictures of the hole and the location.)My advice, if you're a light sleeper, wait until construction is done before staying here. If you have the $$ and want the location, don't worry about it.	
May 30 2006	Surprisingly Good!	I must say I was very surprised how good this hotel is. Located in the heart of Chicago's Loop, right across the street from Marshall Field's flagship store (soon to be Macy's), one block from the theater district and two blocks to Millennium Park.Service was unbelievable. The room was immaculate (but on the small size) and was decorated in a late '90's plush whimsical style. There is a Sony CD player in the room along with an honor bar (not those obnoxious electronic mini-bars in big hotels that charge you just for looking). The rooms also feature tall ceilings and huge windows with great views of the city. Also supplied with the rooms are a terrific selection of bath amenities, two plush bath robes and the thing that impressed me the most...a dimmer switch for the bathroom lights. Genius!Complimentary wine is served in the lobby in the evening and Starbucks coffee and teas are set up in the mornings.I didnt get a chance to check out the hotel restaurant, but I have heard that the food is outstanding.This is a boutique hotel that is a wonderful alternative to the huge convention hotels that populate the Loop and Michigan Avenue areas. I would highly recommend the Hotel Burnham.	
May 11 2006	Honeymoon Heaven	After an awful, stressful drive in a people carrier that was falling apart, our Hotel Burnham Experience started as it went on. Our driver stopped a good way from the Hotel Entrance, but the doorman saw us, started walking towards us, saw all the luggage and returned with a luggage trolley. We were soon whisked into the hotel and the wonderful James appeared -Bell Captain ? - and waited while we checked in. We were several hours early, but no problem, we were told we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Suite and there would be a wine reception in the foyer at 5:00. James took us up, regailed us with amusing stories and got us settled in to our 15th floor room. We had great views along State Street and Washington, with the Millenium Park and the Lake in the not far distance.We went off to explore a little and came back to find a note congratulating us and a bottle of champagne and some chocolates. We never heard our fellow guests, or the elevator, though we were away from it. The Concierge service was excellent and as we were determined to sample as many different restaurants as we could, their knowledge was great. Our beds were turned down each evening and chocolates placed on the bed, the Sound System set to play soothing music, and the Ice Bucket filled at some point, but we only noticed this on the last day.Everyone on the staff we met made a point of talking to us, a rare thing in most hotels. When we were too tired to eat out, a call to the Cafe in the Foyer always met the same response. Well we are fully booked with Pre-Theatre customers until 7:30, but when asked if they could call us if a table became vacant early, we were sitting at a table within 15 minutes on both occasions. The food was great, the service superb and my only criticism was that some of the tables have small sofas for seats, and for my diminutive bride, this meant she felt like a child at the dining table. The curtains in the rooms are dark, thick and almost light proof. You can sleep in without knowning it's morning. The air conditioning is excellent, not an after thought and my main worry from the photographs on their web site is unfounded. It looks as if the original marble floors were uncovered from the photos, but in fact they are covered with a carpet that mimics the style of marble, so don't worry about footsteps from the other guests.As a British Citizen, I find the taxi cabs in America Strange. They are usually huge great Fords, which have no more room inside than a European or Japanese mid range car, yet there is a partition which makes the passengers feel like sardines in a can. When we asked James to arrange for a taxi to get us and all our luggage to O'Hare, he had to pass the task to one of the other guys, Graham I think, but what an effort he made to ensure we didn't get a taxi with a partition.	
May 8 2006	great fun choice for chicago	Went for a long &quot;girls weekend&quot; and loved this hotel. It's a great botique hotel and sister hotel to the Hotel Monaco. Kimpton really seems to get the botique thing--great hip decor, comfortable beds, really nice linens and room accesorries. Loved the 5-6pm free wine. (nice wines too . . .)The building is very historic and it's architecture is amazing, much has been preserved. The other great reviews of the staff are true, everyone was very helpful and friendly. H &amp; M is around the corner, as is Marshall Fields (great food court in basement) and right next door is a Walgreens so don't use the mini bar!	
May 5 2006 	Nice but not as great as expected	The reservation was easy to make and asked a lot of questions regarding preferences. We asked for a quiet room, king sized bed, far from elevator. We got there to discover ALL king rooms are next to the elevator and the housekeeping closet! Not even close to being quiet. After explaining and re-explaining the request and the confirmation of the request prior to our arrival, the front desk clerk found a solution that was agreeable to all. However, if I had NOT been persistant, we would have had two nights of sleeplessness due to noise.The rooms are adorable, very hip and chic. But, if you are used to The Mandarin Oriental (wish they had one in Chicago) or the Ritz Carlton, this is not the place for you. The staff was courteous and pleasant and the room service food outstanding. We are planning on returning, but now we know what NOT to ask for!	
May 2 2006	Outstanding stay...	We had an outstanding stay at the Burnham. First off, the location is great. Lots of shopping in the immediate area, live theater, and the train is within a short block walk. The front desk staff was excellent. We arrived around 5pm and immediately we're offered to take a glass of wine with us to our room since the wine reception in the lobby was underway. And what a great lobby. This hotel has tons of history, personality and character. We ordered a snack from the hotel restaurant and it was priced decently and was very delicious.The room was gorgeous. Excellent details and design. The room was small but not at all cramped or uncomfortable. And the view from the 6th floor was fantastic! The bed linens where high quality with feather pillows and the bathroom stocked with Aveda products.Above all, the bell captain was fantastic. As we made our way to our room he asked our reason for being in Chicago. We told him we we're there for the memorial/burial of my father. He offered his condolences and within 30 minutes was back to our room with a complimentary bottle of wine on behalf of the hotel. He also went out of his way to get a Sprite for our 3 year old. Outstanding services I must say. So...great hotel and excellent rate for the outstanding quality. We paid in the mid $200s per night for the room.	
Apr 25 2006 	Excellent	I was fortunate to have stayed at the Hotel Burnham while I attended a conference in Chicago. I was treated as if I were the owner of the hotel. Staff was friendly and welcoming. The is the best hotel experience I have ever had. The room was on the small side but a great view and extremely comfortable. The bed...oh the bed was simply the best I have ever slept on. What a great experience!	
Apr 15 2006	oh so perfect	Hotel Burnham was oh so perfect in many ways, a real unexpected treat!Don't bother with a taxi, the Chicago transit authority ride from O'hare was just as easy, and only cost $2.00. It was truly no problem, except getting up the last flight of stairs from the underground to the street. However, some very nice man saw me and hauled the luggage up with a smile. (What a great way to start a trip!)The guy at the airport said it was quicker to take the train because the roads are so congested. I believe him. James, from the hotel, helped me with the luggage when I left, in fact he actually put it on the train!Everyone in Chicago was great, from the people in the airport that directed me to the metro to the wonderful hotel employees. They treated me like a princess, and being that I'm forty, and the mother of two, I felt spoiled rotten. And I loved it! The decor of the hotel is awesome. Kind of whimsical and fun, the whole thing is light and airy and beautiful. The beds were soft and comfortable and everything was clean and the service was superb. Everyone seemed happy, willing, and able. They went out of their way to make sure I was happy. From finding me a historic Babtist church to attend Palm Sunday services, to getting me the blintzes I love.I felt like it was home, and everyone knew me. Smiling and waving as I went out in the morning and welcoming me home at night. The location was perfect. Fifty feet from the subway, across the street from Marshall Fields, across the block from the theater. About three blocks from the Art museum. I could see the Walnut room, (a delicious, fun, reasonably priced place to eat in Marshall Fields) from my window, and the theater where Wicked is playing. A new network (don't remember which one) studio just opened a block away and it was fun to watch them do a live newscast from the huge glass front window. One night when I was so tired I couldn't possibly go out, I just sat on the bed with the curtains opened and enjoyed the magnificient view of the city from my 11th floor vantage.I love hot tea and they had a wonderful selection in the lobby and served Argo tea in the restaurant. The Argo shop is a block away and was also fun to visit. Everything is close. Perfect location. The only bad spot was the homeless. I didn't expect them and they always break my heart.One glorious spring day, when my conference at the Lakeside Conference center was over, I wandered out the door instead of boarding a bus. Low and behold I was transported to a seaside path, in one direction the view of Chicago was incredible, the other felt as if I was walking in the middle of nowhere. Both were absolutely beautiful, and it was hard to believe I was in the middle of the third largest city in the US. It was the Lakeside running/biking/walking path I had discovered. It was a great vacation and if I'm in Chicago again I will most certainly stay at the Hotel Burnham.	
Apr 14 2006 	Best hotel stay EVER!	I don't know even where to begin my rave of the Hotel Burnham. The staff was beyond nice. Wayne and Allan, who work at the front desk, really helped me when there was a confusion with my reservation. They were so incredibly helpful and friendly. And the hotel's concierge service was very knowledgable. My stay there was so enjoyable, I will always look to Kimpton first before staying at any other hotel chain.	
Mar 27 2006	i'm coming back	Just want to say thanks...i spend alot of time downtown for a VARIETY ofreasons. My wife just surprised me with a night at the BURNHAM and i wasso very impressed. The service was EXCEPTIONAL in every way. I trulyadmire how easy you all made it for my wife to arrange all theaccomidations. I don't know excatly who all to thank but it will meanmultple returns to Kimpton and especially Burnham.. SINCERELY JOHNATHOS..wife Taylor Tomaska-Athos	
Mar 17 2006	Burnham is Fantastic!!	Hotel Burnham is fantastic! Honestly, all Kimpton Hotels are great, so it is no surprise that Burnham would be anything but fantastic! My boyfriend had planned this weekend trip for me as part of a Christmas gift...and what a gift it was. We stayed in the best suite in the hotel, but I am positive all the other rooms are great too. We had a view of Ford theather (where we went to see Wicked...FANTASTIC!!) We had a view of Millennium Park, which is just amazing. The historic building itself is just a sight to see, with all the marble and iron work. Great location, we walked to everything, but it is very close to the train station. Shopping of all kinds right across the street and a couple blocks from the Mile. If you go, please meet Tracy, the Concierge, she is FANTASTIC! Let her make your reservations...you will not be disappointed. We took her suggestions for every meal, breakfast thru dinner, and she was right on the money every time. The restaurant at the hotel is supposed to be very good, we never had a chance to get in (make your reservations early, theater goers pack it in) we did have room service one night of dessert...and it was great. Next time, we will have dinner. If you are going to Chicago, pick Burnham...all the romance of a Kimpton...along with the service and standards you come to expect from them. Very safe area, very safe hotel, very clean, great staff.	
Jan 27 2006	Thanksgiving Paradise	We stayed over Thanksgiving and had a wonderful time. We arrived the night before the big parade and had requested a room facing State Street. Boy, what a great decision! The temperature hovered in the teens and the wind was whipping right down State Street. We stayed warm and cozy with a bird's eye view of the parade from our big picture window across from Marshall Fields' while breakfasting on the free coffee, hot chocolate, and pastries the hotel provided that morning. Everyone was great at the hotel, even though it was a holiday, and the hotel is unique with a great location.  I highly recommend the Thanksgiving dinner we had at the Park Grill in Millennium Park, and we even went ice skating there! To top off a great weekend, we rolled out of bed onto State Street for the first holiday shopping sales, attended the tree-lighting ceremony in Daly Plaza 1 block away, and followed that by going to see &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Ford Center 1 block away. Best location for the money. ($119/night with their Hot Dates/Great Rates)	
Jan 10 2006	Nice location nice style	Nice hotel in a good location, esspecially if you're looking to go to the theatre or go shopping. My wife and I stayed here for a couple days with our two young children. The rooms are small, but they were fine for our needs. Front desk staff was a little distracted when we checked in.GREAT coffeshop on the block. Good reseteraunt in the hotel. Following the trip, the hotel's assistant manage sent a personal note responding to the areas of improvement I mentioned in the online survey form I filled out. It was nice to get a response that wasn't a form letter.	
Dec 5 2005	My first Excellent rating!	My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Burnham on December third for only a night while in Chicago this past Saturday but I wish it could have been longer!We were in the area for business but decided to go into the city after we were finished and do a little shopping. We love Michigan Avenue but the &quot;Loop&quot; is so much fun too so decided to do that for this trip and since Marshall Field's won't be much longer, we thought we'd see the windows dressed in their theme decor one last time. This year the theme for their windows was Cinderella!From the minute we stepped in the door, until we left the next morning, everyone was very attentive to our needs and very pleasant which can be difficult in these busy times of Christmas. I think we talked with a girl named, Terry at the front desk and our room wasn't ready but she stored our bags and we took off for lunch at the Walnut Room in Marshall Fields which was way TOO crowded and the line must have been a few hundred people so we ended up at The Big Downtown at the Palmer House. As we walked in, we were handed a complimentary glass of our choice of red or white wine and waited about 15 minutes for a table (they said it would be 30). The Cobb salad was GREAT. We shopped around a bit and when we arrived back at the Burnham, Terry said our room was almost ready and we waited in a small lounge area which was glowing with Christmas finery. Someone had just finished having tea at a small table nearby and I understand that the restaurant at the Burnham is noted for it's afternoon tea with scones and the works. I think they have a wine reception every evening too but we didn't make it downstairs around that time in the early evening. Our room was ready shortly and we were on the top floor (15) and Terry gave us a wonderful room overlooking State Street and Marshall Fields as well as the German Christmas Mart not far away! I loved our room. There was a radio/CD stereo playing a soft jazz station as we walked in and the room was just delightfully decorated and spotless as well.They provided a CD also but I'd brought a Christmas CD which we played most of the time. It is a boutique hotel so the rooms will run a little smaller than the larger hotels but I love that it's not the same hotel room that you would find in 100 other hotels! The hotel is built in what looks as though it were an office building at one time. It has so much character and it's just enchanting! The lobby where you catch the elevators is marble and elaborate ironwork with mosaic tile floor. I wanted to take a photo of this but my camera's battery failed in the middle of our stay and I didn't get a lot of photos I wanted to take.Saturday night we had reservations at Petterino's. It's just about 3 blocks away and an enjoyable walk as it had just started snowing. We strolled by the German Christmas Market on our way. Our experience at Petterino's was wonderful. My husband said he hadn't had that kind of perfect dining experience in a long time! Our server even treated us to a small taste of a deep dark chocolate cake as we had our coffee after our meal! The pear salad with goat cheese was to die for and the scallops with garlic sauce was equally delicious. My husband raved about his steak as well. It was like a &quot;winter wonderland&quot; when we stepped out and walked back to the hotel.Some other quick pluses for the Burnham. Towels are fluffy and thick! Coffee in the room but also complimentary Starbucks in the morning in the lobby as we were waiting to catch our taxi.To add one more way that the Burnham went beyond what most hotels will do, I was in a hurry as we were packing to leave and as I put my retainers in their box in my bag, the bottom one fell out and must have caught in the carpet between the wall and carpet. I didn't know where it was when I got home and called and talked with Paul who directed me to Audrey in housekeeping. She had already found it and wanted to know how I'd like her to send it to me. I told her and she did the rest. The whole experience was a delight! They've trained their staff to treat the customer with respect and courtesy and we were given quality for our money.	
Nov 30 2005	Charming Cozy Hotel With Mediocre Service	My wife and I checked into Hotel Burnham on Thanksgiving Day. We actually had a wonderful view from our 8th floor room of the parade on State Street. First impressions were that the building was beautifully restored and a true landmark. Beds were clean. Great view and great location (across the street from the main Marshall Field's and a block from Millenium Park). The room was quite small, but we didn't seem to mind. The desk would be a joke if I had had to use it so I'm not sure I'd recommend this hotel for the business traveller. The hotel emits charm and grace with simple touches like real keys and a mini-bar filled with fun, creative alternatives to standard fare. As for service, it was sufficient but lackluster. The bed had two lousy pillows and I requested two more. Housekeeping left them on the floor outside my door. I'm a bit of a clean freak so that didn't fly with me, but it is to be expected (what do you think they do when you're not looking anyway?) The concierge made reservations at the Park Grill over in Millenium Park, a nice stroll away from the hotel. The restaurant was a bit of a disappointment, good enough but in that strictly generic, cheesecake factory sort of way. Breakfast at Atwood Cafe was worthwhile. I'll write off any lack of service to the holiday. The hotel was an incredible value for Chicago and its location, its charm, and its clean, comfortable rooms made for a memorable stay.	
Nov 11 2005 	Super little hotel	Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, excellent food and great position in the loop. Another great Kimpton Hotel.	
Oct 16 2005	Outstanding in the Loop	What is most impressive about this hotel is its quality in virtually all areas for a restored, historic building in the heart of downtown. Note - if you want to be very handy to the Mag Mile (N. Michigan Ave) or the Convention Center, this is not the place. But it's good to see a vibrant downtown all around you, with transportation readily available. For transportation, the subway (Red line) is across the street, the El is a block or two away, and taxis and buses can handle the rest. Leave your car (parking is expensive, but this is downtown, and any major cities have comparable high prices downtown), unless you need to drive a distance - parking in the city in any desired destination is usually difficult.Yes - it's pricey, but it offers excellent furnishings and very good service. The concierge desk was helpful. The only glitch in service was maid service one day, when some things in the room were missed. It was reported, and didn't happen again. Lobby staff (front desk, doormen, bellmen) were excellent.The in-house restaurant (Atwood Cafe) receives very good reviews. Room service is from there. We ate there one lunch - it was good, but crowded (tables too close), service only fair, and not worth the money. There are very good restaurants in the Loop, even in walking distance. (Trattoria #10 around the corner, the Berghoff, the Russian Tea Time, for example) Other restaurants (we like Greek restaurants in Greektown and mideastern on the north side) are a taxi ride away. A tip - the Corner Bakery is a chain all over town - ask for directions to the nearest one(s). They have good pastries, sandwiches, at reasonable prices. A bottled juice from the Walgreens next door, a pastry, and coffee made in the room was a fine breakfast.Contrary to what was on the Kimpton website, this is not on the Mag Mile (that's a mile away), and Millenium Park is not across the street (it's 2 blocks to the east). There's some interesting shopping on State Street (not as glitzy and huge as Mag Mile). The views from the room (we had a corner, with views up State Street, and over to the lake) are fantastic. If you like being in the heart of a bustling city, this is a good choice. It's small enough to feel personalized, and always felt safe. (Admittedly, we were not out real late at night.)We were there as tourists (had lived near Chicago many years ago). The Culture Center (with a good bookstore and noon concerts) is a block away. Took an easy busride to Museum Campus (Field Museum - the best). Recommended - the boat tour on the river, guided by the Chicago Architecture Foundation.	
Oct 15 2005	A historic gem	My husband and I spent a lovely two nights at the Hotel Burnham in Chicago. Formerly the Reliance Insurance Building, this hotel is an architectural landmark (one of so very many in Chicago) that should not be missed. Some of the guest rooms have the original doors to the old insurance offices, while others have newer doors. Great care has been taken to maintain the consistency of the original architectural style...as a result, the rooms are a bit smaller than a chain hotel would offer, but SO much more filled with character. Everything from the down pillows to the beautiful window treatments to the marble in the bathroom was unique and felt completely luxurious. And the location!!!! The view from our 12th floor room was of historic State St. Marshall Field's department store as well as the Chicago and Oriental Theatres (where we saw and thoroughly loved Wicked)! This location is so central to all forms of public transportation (buses and El trains within 1/2 block), we will recommend this hotel to anyone who asks. The room service was a bit slow, but we were otherwise thrilled with our experience at the Hotel Burnham.	
Sep 20 2005	Terrific hotel and location	All in all a really nice hotel. It is beautiful and architectually important. Plus, you cannot beat the location - across from Marshall Field's and minutes to Millenium Park. We loved it! The only issue was that service to the room - cleaning, making the room up - could have been a little better.	
Sep 9 2005	Wickedly good...	Well. I've stayed in the Burnham twice this year, and I'd have no hesitationin staying there again for a theatre-break vacation in Chicago. The Oriental Theatre where I saw &quot;Wicked&quot; (which was a real treat!) is just a block away, and the hotel restaurant (Atwood Cafe) caters for theatre goers with a special early dinner (I had mine at 5:00 p.m.) whcih allows you to return after the performance to finish your sweet. A nice touch. Architecture lovers will adore this hotel too, for the Art Nouveau internal decorations as much as the historic features. My room wasn't huge but it was nicely furnished. The staff were all friendly too and tried there best to look after you. The only thing I'd mark it down was that there were no dining facilities open on Labor Day - though with the Walnut Room in Marshall Fields just across the road open, that was hardly any hardship. For the money (I got a discount via Expedia) I would stay here again.	
Sep 4 2005 	Great Location Great Value	I stayed at Burnham twice during August and both experiences were fantastic. The two rooms I stayed both had very high ceiling giving me a very pleasant, bright, airy feeling. Bed was very comfy. Turn-down service was on the spot every night. Bathroom amenities were also 5 star. I especially liked the day bed next to the window as I could simply watch the people outside on the street. The food at the restaurant downstairs were also great and priced reasonably.The only drawback was the relatively weak shower pressure on the upper floors. Also, certain low level rooms facing the street could be quite noisy, but certainly acceptable.	
Aug 24 2005	Fancy but not functional	We stayed one night at the Burnham in August 2005. Our room was lavishly decorated, the front desk people are friendly and competent, the location is convenient to all of downtown Chicago, and our room was very quiet. But the basic layout of the room was not traveller-friendly. One small oval table was the only usable flat surface, and it was already largely taken up with a purely decorative lamp and a lot of advertising flyers. The only dresser drawers were in the armoire, and keeping the large flap doors open while trying to open the drawers was a nuisance. And after all that maneuvering, both the drawers were already full, with 2 Chicago phone books, a large picture book of local advertising, the Gideon Bible and the Thoughts of Buddha. No room for shirts, sox, underwear, and all those non-decorative things travellers like to put in hotel room drawers.The bathroom was charming and clean, but again no thought was apparently given to what people need in a hotel bathroom. There was a lovely oval sink but no counterspace at all for even a small toiletries bag. The building is a fascinating restoration of an old office building. There is a front entrance on Washington St, with an attended lobby desk and doormen. However, the elevator lobby also has its own direct entrance to State St., very handy if you are going that direction. But not very effective from a security standpoint - anyone can come in off the street and go right up to the guest floors without passing any lobby personnel or doormen. It's your choice, then, as to whether charm and decor make up for lack of functionality and security. But it does seem a shame that this hotel could not have been designed to provide both.	
Aug 9 2005 	Could be the best hotel experience I've had.....	I'll start out by saying that I've never been a big service buff, but now I've turned into one knowing what a difference good service can make to your stay. The Burnham is very conveniently located. We took the train there from the airport, at $1.75 per person it was quite a bargain and only a block or so away from the station. I pretty much walked everywhere from the hotel including most of Michigan Avenue, the Navy Pier, Milleneum Park, and the general lake/river area. I love to walk though and some of these distances might be too far for some, so a cab or train might be in order.Check in was the fastest process I've ever seen. It literally took two minutes and we were off and running. We had booked a suite at the AAA rate of $206 per night. I can't speak to the size of the regular rooms, but the suite was perfect. There was a sitting area with sofa, TV, chair, and table, along with a bedroom with a king bed, desk and TV. The bathroom was adequately sized. The room was spotless and very nicely decorated. Maid service was always prompt and they did a good job.After stepping out for a few hours, we received a note, a bottle of water and a small box of chocolates welcoming us, which was a very nice touch. I had ocassion to use the Concierge a number of times throughout the trip and she was EXCELLENT. She helped me get play tickets and restaurant reservations at an excellent restaurant near the theater, the same day we were wanting to go. At the restaurant, we received a complimentary appitizer from the conceirge and at our room soda and choclates for our anniversary. I've never stayed anywhere that has gone the extra mile like that, and all though the concierge was especially helpful, all the staff was super nice and friendly.I ate at the restaurant on the premises twice. Once for breakfast and once using room service and both times it was very good, albeit predictably over priced. I can unequivoclly say that this was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had (and I've had a few) and I'll definitely return to the Burnham on my next trip to Chicago!	
Aug 9 2005	Excellent Weekend Experience	We stayed at the Burnham this past weekend and were really very pleased. The lobby area is quite lovely, as was our room. I must say the room was really very small, but it was very well appointed and the entire East wall was one huge window. We didn't feel cramped at all, but I could see how someone would.Although there is no mistaking us more multi-millionaires, we received particularly good service from all of the staff, from the doormen to the concierge. We found a rate of $170/night on the hotel's own website, and at this rate we feel we received a very good value.Chicago is a fantastic city and I would definitely recommend considering this hotel.	
Aug 1 2005	Beautiful but lacking in good service	Trip: 7-26-05 to 7-29-05The best thing about this hotel is the main lobby floor and the cafe/bar. It's beautifully decorated and high windowed ceilings make for a nice place to have breakfast. The location is good but we spent more time in Wicker Park and the Gold Coast so I would probably stay in the GC next time to save on cab fair. The doormen at the hotel with the exception of one grumpy old guy were the best service people in the hotel. They were quick to open your door or hail you a cab - even in the pouring rain. However, the front desk people were unresponsive and didn't do what they said they would do. Really young people running the show who didn't seem to care about the service they provided. The bar closes really early which is unfortunate since like I said it's the best part of the hotel. The rooms are terribly tiny even though we had a nice view the bed was so close to the entertainment center which had faulty doors. Not what you would expect from a $250/night room.But Chicago is great and the people are super friendly!	
Jul 20 2005	Good not excellent	Ideally located across the street from Marshall Field's, the Burnham is a pleasant if not somewhat overpriced hotel. For $350USD/night I was expecting something a little more luxurious. The room was absurdly small. It was not comfortable for two people. The bathroom was unremarkable. The staff were OK. The &quot;above and beyond&quot; attitude that Kimpton Hotels' staff purport to possess was simply not there. I would look elsewhere on my next trip to Chicago and were I to stay here again, would never pay this absurdly high rate for such an absurdly small room.	
Jul 12 2005	Exquisite Experience	The Hotel Burnham was a most pleasant experience: historic surroundings, helpful and professional staff from the front desk to housekeeping, and comfortable to come &quot;home&quot; to after a day of sightseeing. This hotel is highly recommended and will our family's hotel of choice in Chicago. (We were guests at this hotel from July 3-July 10, 2005.)	
Jun 30 2005	Lives Up to the Reviews	A most charming hotel but quite expensive. Over $300 per night with taxesand w/o breakfast. Lobby small. Room is decent size. Bathroom good. Located one block west of Michigan Avenue and several blocks below Wacker. It's across from Marshall Field's flagship store. Good spot for the Art Institute and some theatres. Inconvenient for N. Michigan shopping.	
Jun 4 2005	Fantastic Hotel!!!	My wife and I and another couple stayed at this wondeful hotel in late May 2005. This is a beautiful building that has been fully restored. The rooms are amazing. The staff couldn't be nicer. They are constantly smiling and offering to help with every detail. The location is also great. I highly recommend this Hotel to anyone.	
Jun 2 2005	Heaven!!!	We stayed May 22 for 3 days. Ariella, the concierge, was incredible. She knew everything about Chicago and her surrounding area. For three days she tried to help me get tickets to &quot;Wicked&quot; the play. When we finally got one, my husband couldn't be found, and she lent me the money to pay for the ticket. The whole staff was incredable, including Allen the manager,and James .the guest service person. They all knew my name and used it whenever they saw me. The hotel is absolutly beautiful. The rooms are wonderful and so clean. The restaurant is surperb. It's in the old State Street area, close to all the Theaters. Being a play lover, it suits me fine. If you want to be treated like a Star, you must stay at the Burnham!	
Jun 1 2005	Beautiful Hotel Great Service	We stayed at the Hotel Burnham in May, 2005 and found it a very nice experience. The hotel itself is really beautiful -- the mosaic tile in the elevator lobby is gorgeous, the Lobby very attractive, and the Atwood Cafe practically a work of art. The hotel rooms are quite small (I agree with other reviewers stating this) but are uniquely done. The room seemed immaculate (and I'm pretty particular) and the bathroom was simply spotless. The Aveda products supplied were a nice treat from the ordinary. We had a great view from the 9th floor right up State Street, which was cool (we never seem to get view rooms when we stay in hotels, but this time we did). Nice chaise lounge to relax on and enjoy the view, too! The staff was very friendly and warmly welcomed our dog to the hotel. Check in was easy (I had booked via an online service and was a little nervous if it all would work out -- but it turned out fine). Now the negatives -- relatively slight and some out of the Burnham's control: we had booked a King Bed room and I maintain that if this was a king-sized bed it was the smallest I've ever seen. I think it was actually a queen but we didn't challenge them on it. The carpet in the room looked warn and was a bit stained. It was a fairly light color, which seems a mistake in a hotel room -- and had seen better days. This should be replaced. Same goes for the bed skirt -- could use replacement.As mentioned, we had our dog with us on the trip. The hotel itself was wonderfully accommodating to her -- greeting her by name, petting her on the way in, etc. She's a great dog and an experienced traveler so it was nice to see her welcomed in the manner she deserves! However, pet owners should be advised that there is nowhere close by the hotel to take animals to relieve themselves. Millennium Park is about three blocks to the east, but dogs are NOT allowed there (not even along the edges, from what we could tell). We are very responsible pet owners who never fail to pick up after our dog (and we even rinse the grass after she wets) but just the same we were rudely moved along every single time we went near that park. They are apparently trying to keep it pristine but are simply rude. The park also seems grossly overstaffed in terms of security personnel -- they are on their little scooters at 7 a.m. apparently waiting for dogs to chase away! Believe me, some kids and adults stand to do a lot more damage than any dog! Grant Park is a bit more forgiving but that's a quite a long distance for a polite Midwestern dog who prefers a blade of grass to go potty on. . .	
May 30 2005	England football trip	Eschewing a budget option for the recent England football trip to Chicago a choice was made based on the tripadvisor reviews. Not cheap but centrally located on the edge of the Loop. If you want shopping fall out of bed and you are in Marshall Fields , a little walk and you are on Michigan Avenue or on the river doing a sightseeing trip. Big tip- the blue line CTA from O Hare airport stops yards from the hotel, great if you have loads of luggage but only want to spend $1.75 on transport!I read that the rooms were cramped. I wasnt in a suite yet the space was fine and the view unbelievable. When we were there we had a prime view of the Memorial Day parade down State Street from our room.The room surroundings and fittings were reminiscent of a golden area, based on Art Deco. The toiletries are Aveda and, its true, there is a turndown service with chocolates left on the bed on your return (except on the last night!!).And.......you also get free Starbucks from 6-9am in the lobby so you can take a cup back to your room. When I went down the night shift concierge was very friendly and helpful. There is also a free wine reception in the evening. The Attwood Cafe is rated but we didnt try it. Instead we tried deep dish pizzas at Guardinos chain (you will have a job to finish one!), Pot Belly sandwiches and had breakfast in Johnny Rockets, just like a 50's diner.So... its not too small, great views from the room, great location, free Starbucks and turndown service. It doesnt get much better.Only gripe generally was that there is a free trolley service to most central places but it wasn't advertised anywhere in the city that I could see. Most stop near the hotel.	
May 22 2005	Another good Kimpton	A lovely hotel with all the Kimpton comforts but we were not told that scaffolding was going up outside our room during our stay (late at night) even though we had booked months before, Surely they knew and could have given us an option of changing hotel. Didn't even tell us when we were checking in the day before. When we complained about 11.30 p.m. we were offered ear plugs!Anyway, would still say this hotel is a good choice (unless your there when the scaffolding is coming down) as it's virtually on the loop and a reasonably close walk to 'Mag Mile' Got a free fitness room which we didn't use.	
May 15 2005	Life will never be the same...	When planning a trip to an unfamiliar city, it is always a challenge to decide on the right hotel. Thanks to TripAdvisor reviews, we decided to &quot;take a chance&quot; on the Hotel Burnham for our visit to Chicago, May 3-9, 2005. From the moment we walked through the doors held open by a uniformed doorman, we knew we were in a special place. Check in was instantaneous and we were on our way through the restored elevator lobby. As we entered our suite, I knew that life will never be the same when it comes to hotel accommodations. From this time forward, the standard by which all other hotels will be measured is that set by the Hotel Burnham. Our suite was tastefully decorated and exceptionally comfortable. While most hotels are perfectly fine and provide an adequate place to stay, our stay at the Burnham became part of the overall Chicago experience. The smaller size of the hotel gives it more personality than those of the big lodging chains. Our rooms were inviting, comfortable and hard to leave. The amenities were well thought out, down to the telephone in the bathroom. The view from the large Chicago-style windows was of Marshall Field's, the theatre district and down Washington Street past the El to Millennium Park and a glimpse of Lake Michigan beyond. To say that expectations were exceeded is an understatement.At the corner of State and Washington streets, we found ourselves in the literal heart of Chicago, within walking distance to the Art Institute, Symphony Hall, the theatre district, financial district and even boat tours on the Chicago River. Taxis, buses and the subway are right at the doorstep when you don't want to walk; the El is a block away. I didn't fully appreciate the historic status of the building that houses the Hotel Burnham until after we arrived. The turn of the century Reliance Building is an important part of the architectural history of Chicago and its design is part of the cultural heritage of the city. My only disappointment was that we were unaware that on the first (and third) Wednesdays of each month, a special 45 minute tour of the hotel building is given by the Chicago Architecture Foundation, so we missed that. The hotel's staff is very friendly and we were always greeted by at least three of them, whether coming or going: &quot;Welcome back,&quot; &quot;Nice to see you again,&quot; words we don't hear often enough. As a person who travels frequently--30 or more nights a year--I found this a most memorable stay. This was our first experience with a Kimpton Hotel and this will encourage us to consider their hotels in other cities. But, as far as Chicago goes, we will always return to the Hotel Burnham.	
May 12 2005	Stunning Boutique Hotel in a Great Location	We stayed at the Hotel Burnham this past weekend in May. The hotel, located at the corner of State and Washington Streets in the Loop, is a stunningly beautiful hotel. The restoration of the hotel has included such intricate details as wrought-iron railings on inner stairwells and elevators. The decor in the lobby is very stylish and modern (a la W Hotels). Each afternoon, the hotel has free wine in the lobby for its guests.Our room faced State Street, and overlooked the old-line Marshall Field's department store, and a small portion of the Frank Gehry-designed bandshell in Millenium Park. The room, albeit small, was furnished with a very large king bed, wonderful linens, and Aveda bath products. The service at the hotel was outstanding. Every bellman, front desk attendant, waiter/waitress and maid we encountered were very friendly and made every effort to assist and make things easier. We were especially impressed with the concierge, Tracy. She gave thoughtful and considered recommendations for restaurants and entertainment (e.g., local blues clubs). Once we had decided on a restaurant (e.g., Gino's East for great deep-dish pizza), she even had discount/special privilege coupons which allowed us to jump ahead in line (a supposed 45-minute wait turned into a 10-minute wait), or provided other special benefits. (She even managed to get us tickets for a nearly sold-out exhibition at the Museum of Science and Industry). Tracy was excellent!The hotel is located right off the Red and Blue lines of the &quot;L&quot; (a block or two from the other L lines), is conveniently located about 2 blocks from Millenium Park (stunning), is within the Theatre District, and has great shopping all nearby. The hotel also has the Atwood Cafe in its lobby as well. This is a wonderful restaurant, serving Continental cuisine, tinged with Asian flavors. (Make sure to try the duck breast with Asian-seasoned noodles). Prices are not cheap, but the food is well worth it.All in all, the Hotel Burnham is a terrific hotel, with outstanding service, and a nearly-can't-be-beat location. We'll be sure to stay here again when we come to Chicago.	
May 11 2005	Delightful!	We spent a night at the Burnham in our dauntless search for downtown lodging for our September wedding guests. It's a tough job. We were both delighted and felt well taken care of, from the doorman to the turndown service. Of course, I added a few personal touches to our room to enhance my fiance's enjoyment (roses, chocolates, a love note). I was impressed that they figured out that I had left to pick her up, and re-cleaned and reset the room before we returned about 45 minutes later!I like its proximity to the shops and theater district, and they have Real Metal Room Keys, not those plastic things. The rooms are plush and have all the electronics a guy ever needs. The robes were a bit frayed, but we weren't using them very long...	
May 9 2005	Great service great location great time at the Burnham	My wife and I spent a belated anniversary at the Burnham this past weekend. From the check in, to the stay, wine hour from 5-6pm each evening, to checkout was a wonderful experience. The check in was extremely smooth with the valet Al and Reggie taking care of things from the car to the room. The room was very clean, bed was very comfortable, and the turn down service at bed time with chocolate was very much appreciated after a long concert on Friday and busy Saturday of shopping and eating.The resturant (Atwood Cafe) was excellent. We spent two enjoyable mornings their and found the breakfest extremely filling. The Raspberry Pancake was amazing.The conciege (Tracy) was very helpful. She created a warm enjoyable Saturday evening for us from the Chicago style Pizza joint to the Jazz club when we had no plans. Also her help with getting tickets to Bodyworks at the MSI was something we are grateful for. (BTW, the bodyworks exhibit was great.)In closing, checkout was smooth and easy. I give this hotel 5 out of 5, not because it was a 5 star property (like the Ritz), its just that as a guest, you are treated like one by the staff. Rooms are clean, location is great, has an amazing staff, what more can a guest ask for...	
May 1 2005	Great architecture. Great hotel	The historic Reliance Building of 1890 has been transformed into a first class hotel that matches a great building with excellent service. My room was well appointed and spacious given the age of the building (rooms were huge compared to the Drake). My view looking west began with the Daley Plaza and its famous Picasso, the Goodman Theater, the Oriental Theater, the Chicago Theater, Marshall Fields and a view of the Gehry music pavillion at Millenium Park down Washington St. After going out to dinner I stayed up til midnight just looking out at the lights and views of State St. The Sutton Place Hotel has been my base of operations for some time in Chicago - ever since it was the old Le Meridien. The Hotel Burnham is better in every way. It's where I'll stay from now on.If I have any complaint its with the Atwood Cafe attached to the hotel. The bar is tiny and the staff was impersonal. The food is good though but at their prices there are a number of competetive alternatives in the area.Regardless, the hotel is wonderful.	
May 1 2005 	My first boutique hotel expereince was a great one.	I booked the Burnham when traveling to Chi-town for a conference. It was highly ranked by Travel and Leisure Mag. and a good value plus it included high speed internet. Immediately upon arrival, I could tell the difference from the typical corporate hotels just from the demeanor of the front desk staff and bellman. they made you feel more like a guest in their home than a customer. Everyone seemed genuinely glad to work their and very familar with the other Kimpton hotels.We had a great suite. Not huge but well decorated and equipped. The Aveda (sp) bath products (facial cleanser and shower gel not typical at Hiltons) plus Starbucks in the morning and wine in the afternoon were great touches. My wife loved the location across the street from the HUGE Marshall Fields (she visited it like it was an amusement park); the second largest dept. store in US. I had two burgers at the Atwood Cafe (midwest beef is irresistable to this southern boy) and they were great. Saw some of the other dishes and they looked very good, but more &quot;froo-froo&quot; than I was in the mood for. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will only stay there when visiting Chicago...unless I come across a great deal at the Peninsula.	
Apr 13 2005	cute romantic but kinda away from the action	Stayed at the Burnham last Sept for a romantic getaway....really love the Kimpton Group hotels, and it was up to their standards of chic boutique. The Burnham is a romantic setting, great view from our room, with a sexy chaise lounge by the picture window. It's one of the refurbished Euro-style hotels, and if you're not into that, stay at a Marriott. The room was small, but cute enuf that you didn't mind hanging out there. The restaurant on the ground floor was first rate. My only complaint was that the hotel lobby is kinda crowded (small issue) and that, if you're going to Chicago to go out on the town, the Burnham is kinda far away from the chic nightclub scene, and you ought to add money to your budget for the cab rides. It would be great for business trips however, as it is smack downtown. The area is sparsely populated on weekends. The value for the stay was ok. I've stayed at better Kimptons - the Rouge in DC!	
Apr 13 2005	Absolutely fantastic!!	We stayed at the Hotel Burnham from 31st March - 4th April, and we had an amazing stay. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown Chicago, and is in the best location to get anywhere. Washington 'El' stop is just 200 metres away, and the Blue Line from O'Hare runs straight there - much better than getting a cab.The room in the hotel was fantastic - we were on the 14th floor, with amazing views of the John Hancock Centre to the north. In the room, which is a great size, had Elemis toiletries in the bathroom, and a very comfy bed.The hotel has a great atmosphere, with the very busy Atwood Cafe in the lobby. It has a 20's/30's theme througout, and has kept a lot of the original features that it had when it was the Reliance Buildling - like the AMAZING mosaic floor in the lobby. In the evening between 5 and 6 there is a wine reception every night for guests, and free Starbucks's coffee and tea in the mornings between 6.30 and 9am. What more could you ask for!We would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a city break in Chicago - you won't be disappointed!	
Apr 11 2005 	Don't disturb the wait staff with simple requests.	Great service from the front desk, beautiful rooms, and a very friendly doorman. My only issue was, I went to the hotel bar/restaurant at 10:00 PM, to get a glass of wine. The male staff members were standing around discussing their plans for the evening and looked annoyed that I walked in, despite the fact that they didn't close for another hour. I ordered $13 dollar glass, but the waiter made me sit in the lobby with it because &quot;I needed to to order some food if I wanted to be seated at the bar&quot; I came back a few minutes later and told them I didn't want to sitting in the breezy lobby in the middle of Feburary with my wine. They rolled their eyes and found me a table close to the door. I realized that they were more interested in closing the place early so they could go out on the town for evening. The attitude was disgusting, and I'd stay at the Palmer House next time.	
Apr 2 2005	A destination in itself	We stayed in the Burnham last summer for only one night. Made reservations based on reader reviews on tripadvisor. Got a great deal through the hotel web-site. It was exquisite! Beautiful interior and exterior, wonderful service, quintessential view of the Chicago Theater sign, and beyond, from our room, intriguing hotel history and convenient location. Couldn't have asked for more. We actually didn't get out a much as we planned because we were so comfortable at the hotel. I would definitely go back to Chicago just to stay at the Burnham!	
Mar 31 2005	Yes it really is That good!	My wife and I recently spent 10 days (9 nights) in this beautiful hotel.  Let me first of all allay anyone's fears about it being a &quot;pet- friendly&quot; hotel. I myself was a little concerned about the possibility of tripping over small animals in the lobby each morning- but my fears proved groundless. In our whole stay here, we saw no pets at all in the hotel. I'm not suggesting that you can't take your pet, or that there weren't any there at the time we were: but if there were any they were never allowed to interfere with any guest's enjoyment. We literally saw neither hide nor hair of any pets! I suppose it is just an example of how well- run and staffed the hotel is. And let me emphasise that the staff are SUPERB. They cannot do enough for you. Every time we stepped back through the main door (having been out shopping or whatever), EVERY member of staff on duty would greet us and say &quot;welcome back&quot;. Only a little thing, I know, but it really did make us feel good. And when the batteries died in our TV remote, an engineer arrived within A MINUTE of my informing the front desk, with a replacement remote. The evening turndown service, including chocolates on the pillows is also a nice touch. The rooms themselves are lovely. The bay windows really help. Not only are they attractive to look at/through, but they give that extra bit of space in the room too. They even include a complimentary CD for you to listen to on the excellent stereo and then take home! The building is, of course, gorgeous. And they proudly display the history and restoration of the Reliance Building in the lobby. The restaurant is good, too. It is ALWAYS crowded though, so either eat early or book a table to be sure of enjoying the food. The location of the hotel is pretty good. All of the theatres are right on the doorstep, Marshall Fields store is opposite and the fantastic Art Institute is just round the corner. We found ourselves going north quite a lot though. The Loop is pretty quiet at night, and most of the good bars etc seem to be norht of the river. As did most of the best shops- North Michigan Avenue really seems to be the liveliest area of the city. The location is the only (slight) downside to an otherwise wonderful hotel.	
Mar 28 2005	We will be at the Burnham next time we're in Chicago!	My husband and I just spent a wonderful long Easter weekend at the Burnham. We were greeted by a friendly doorman who hustled us out of the rain and into the wonderful warm lobby before arranging to have our car valet parked. The desk staff was very accommodating and helpful. These good first impressions all before we even were personally escorted to our room and given a tour of all of its amenities. Our corner room overlooking State and Washington even though on the smallish side was a delight  super comfortable queen bed, extra pillows, two butter soft bath robes, Aveda bath products, well stocked honor bar and snack tray. And it was quiet! There are very few rooms on each floor. The well insulated windows and heavy draperies muffled what could have been very loud street noises. We loved the unique old architecture and history of the building  something the cookie cutter big chains so sorely lack. Our only complaint, if you can even call it that, was the concierge that was on duty for the weekend. She couldnt tell us what hours a particular museum was open. Even after pecking at her computer for several minutes she came up with the wrong times. This after complaining that she couldnt remember the open and close times of museums after being off for a few days. Later that day we felt as if we were bothering her when we asked for reservations at a popular local restaurant. We would have been better off had we brought one of our laptops and looked up the information ourselves. The rooms have high speed access  including wireless. Weve stayed at a number of boutique style hotels in downtown Chicago and this is by far our favorite. We will definitely be staying at the Burnham when we visit Chicago again.	
Mar 17 2005	loved the location	Stayed at this hotel Feb 26 for one night. Had read all the favorable reviews about this hotel and was excited about the stay. The building is beautifully restored, lots of dark wood and marble on the floors,walls and ceilings, but I certainly would not rate it as the number 2 in Chicago. It was the smallest room I have ever had in Chicago, the size was not much larger than a Microtel. Bathroom very ordinary. The television reception was not good. The beds and pillows were hard. The evening wine service is from 5-6, we arrived on the tail end of that and were lucky that the server took pity on us and brought out two glasses for us to take to our room. The lobby is very small, much too small to have a wine service in . Hardly any seating area, no snacks to go with the wine, and only two varieties of wine. one red, one white. The walls were so thin we could easily hear the very &quot;romantic&quot;couple in the adjoining room. They do serve coffee in the lobby in the mornings. The good things were the LOCATION, right across the street from Marshall Fields, and we did feel very secure inside the hotel.	
Mar 8 2005 	Perfection!	From the minute that we entered the lobby we knew that we had selected the perfect hotel! Everyone that is with the hotel seems so proud of the place and you get the feeling that they are there to make you feel welcome!Location.. is perfect!	
Mar 3 2005	good but not great	We stayed at the Burnham in February, purely on the glowing recommendations of Tripadvisor reviewers. The building itself is impressive, and the conversion to a hotel has been done with great sympathy. It made a refreshing change from corporate blandness. Our junior suite was rather small, and cluttered with fussy furnishings, but the huge windows offered great views of State Street. The screaming brat who was next door for the duration of our visit was not a bonus - but there's not much the hotel could have done about that.Location is tremendous; convenient for practically everything - El, shops, restaurants. etc. Check-in was courteous and quick ,and the staff consistently made a genuine effort to engage with guests. The concierge, though, gave us incorrect information about a firework show (&quot;that's all finished&quot; - it hadn't, and we saw it anyway, trusting the city's website). The evening wine tasting, while a nice touch, takes place in the tiny lobby area - there were rarely seats available. People waiting for tables in the small (and noisy, due to acoustics, not people) restaurant add to the claustrophobic effect. An enjoyable stay, but this hotel, like all hotels, has its flaws.	
Feb 27 2005	Beautiful and Unique	The Burnham is an excellent adaptive reuse of the historic Reliance Building (built in 1895) in the Chicago Loop. While the rooms are a bit small (as noted by other reviewers), they have huge windows, which give them a more open feel. My executive suite was on the northeast corner of the building, giving me a view of the elaborate new band shell in Millennium Park, a few blocks away. It was very beautifully decorated, with French doors separating the bedroom from a small parlor. There were a few touches, like the curtains and the lights, that some people might find excessively precious. The hotel is located in the Loop, directly across the street from the original Marshall Field department store. The neighborhood is very busy during the day, but there is limited night activity in the area, unless there is something on stage at the nearby theaters. If you are looking for a more lively neighborhood for nighttime activity, you may prefer the area north of the Chicago River. The staff was very helpful and friendly throughout my stay. The evening wine reception (from 5 to 6) was a great treat. The small restaurant (Atwoods) is quite good, and deservedly popular.	
Feb 2 2005	Wonderful Hotel	We stayed at the Hotel Burnham one night in Mid-January. We had tickets for 'Spam-a-lot' in the afternoon and 'All Shook Up' in the evening. We showed up before checkin and our room was not available yet, but we were able to leave our bags there and come back later. The restaurant was full for lunch but the concergie was able to recommend a couple of places to eat (try the Walnut Room at Marshall Fields right across the street). The rooms are luxurious and comfortable. The tempurature went below zero outside, but we never felt any kind of draft from the windows and the room was always warm. Make sure that you call before you check-in if you want a chance to eat in the hotel's restaurant. We were able to get a table for dinner only because we were willing to eat when they opened and could be finished in an hour, they were fully booked for dinner from 6 pm until after 9 pm. The hotel is less than 2 blocks from the Loop and plenty of shopping in the area. Also most of the theatres are within walking distance ( and the area seemed fairly safe to walk at night). We would recommend this hotel, especially for a romantic weekend.	
Jan 24 2005	Excellent Hotel	I just got back from a 3 night stay at Hotel Burnham. As a travel agent, I have stayed at many hotels, and this is a nice one!The desk staff is very courteous, as is the ENTIRE hotel staff. The location is a half block from the nearest subway stop, and is right on State Street. If you want a beautiful hotel for a great value, I would highly recommend Hotel Burnham.	
Jan 24 2005	Just beautiful	What else is there to say? Yes, the rooms are small. We didn't care.The location is excellent. Lobby, rooms, cafe, everything looks nice and tasteful. The service is friendly and helpful. The complimentary wine hour is fun.If ever we come back to Chicago (which we do hope) this is where we will stay.	
Jan 20 2005	A gem!!!	Beautful accomodations and friendly, helpful staff. I only spent one night but look foward to returning to Chicago just to stay at this delightful hotel.	
Jan 17 2005	Love the Burnham	Hotel Burnham is a jewel. We stayed two nights the weekend before Christmas. We found the location to be excellent ( across the street from State street Marshall Fields). The staff is helpful and courteous. My only gripe is the room size (which is normal for old renovated boutique hotels) my suggestion is to upgrade to a suite which we will definitely do next visit. The restaurant serves a great breakfast but the bar is way to small.	
Jan 17 2005	Excellent hotel and staff!!!	We just recently stayed at the Hotel Burnham in Chicago and absolutely loved everything about it ... the excellent staff, the lovely room, the excellent food at the Atwood Cafe and location of the hotel! I would not hesitate to stay here or any of the other Kimpton hotels again and again. The concierge, Tracy, was so personable and helpful!!! Can't wait to visit this hotel again!	
Jan 10 2005	Loved it!	Had a mother/daughter weekend and stayed one night at this lovely hotel based on the numerous excellent reviews found on this website. This hotel has the elegance and quaintness of many smaller, older European hotels. The staff was courteous and helpful; the rate ($139/night) was very reasonable; and the room itself was a good size and tastefully decorated. Wrought-iron gates surrounded each floor of elevators...very art deco! The only tiny drawbacks are the $31 parking fee for guests and the expensive (for what you get) menu at the Atwood Cafe. All in all, this was a wonderful experience and I will definitely go there again.	
Jan 7 2005	The Burnham deserves its high rating	Recently stayed at the Burnham and cannot say enough about its wonderful staff. All staff(wish I had gotten all their names, thank you to each and every one) were friendly, helpful, and professional. Front desk staff and the concierge were all that one would expect from a five star hotel. The housekeeping and maintenance staff were helpful and professional as well. The hotel's location is superb for State Street shopping and North Michigan Avenue shopping if one does not mind a walk. Historical renovatin details are intriguing to see in such a comfortable hotel. Can't say enough how enjoyable the stay was at the Burnham. Will recommend to all friends and family for future Chicago visits.	
Jan 3 2005	Great hotel	I traveled to Chicago with a group of girlfriends in early November for a weekend of shopping and siteseeing. The Hotel Burnham was a great place to stay as it's within walking distance to a lot of great shops(Marshall Fields, Nordstrom Rack, Filene's Basement) and is a short cab ride to the magnificent mile. The hotel staff was helpful and courteous and the rooms were very tastefully decorated. Would definitely stay at this hotel again upon returning to Chicago!	
Jan 2 2005	Wonderful hotel!	Just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel Burnham and am already trying to plan my next visit. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Impeccable service, beautifully appointed rooms, and the restaurant is excellent. I will choose Hotel Burnham every time I visit Chicago from now on!	
Dec 30 2004	outstanding	excellent service. Great room and fine location.Highly recommend this establishment. We will be back	
Dec 28 2004	A perfect stay	Because of my interest in the history and architecture of the city, I've wanted to stay in the Burnham. What a great choice! From the minute we arrived, the staff made us feel as if we were special people. Even the cleaning staff was friendly, greeting us in the hallway and elevator. We ate in the hotel's restaurant (Atwood Cafe) that evening and had a delicious dinner. The meal was pricey but worth it. We did, however, eat somewhere else for breakfast, not wanting to have two expensive meals. The rooms are small but elegant and clean, with a great view of Marshall Fields and State Street. When we came back that evening from walking around the city, our beds had been turned down, with chocolates by the pillows, and the stereo turned on softly - a service not included even in most &quot;luxury&quot; hotels. The only downside to the visit was the cost of parking, but that's the price you pay when you stay downtown. It's worth the money to have your car taken care of by competent staff and not have to worry about it during your stay. Chicago is completely walkable, and using your feet allows you to see the real city. My husband and I have stayed in many hotels - this is our favorite, and we'll definitely be back. Book on the internet to get the best price, but whatever you pay, it's worth it!	
Dec 16 2004	Well Worth It!	Beautiful, smaller hotel in a great location, caddy corner to Marshall Field's and two blocks from Millenium park. Had a beautiful corner suite ($289 plus tax etc.) with huge windows looking up State Street. Room decor and amenities both excellent. Art deco design, but not South Beach psuedo art deco. Lobby areas beautifully designed - walk through it even if you don't stay there. Wine tasting from 5-6pm is a very nice feature and a nice way to end a day or begin an evening. Hotel will match any internet rate and you always benefit booking direct. If you need to stay in the Loop versus on the Magnificent Mile, this is a great choice.Only disappointment was the continental breakfast - should have just walked down to Starbucks for the same muffin and coffee.	
Dec 8 2004	LocationLocationLocation	After reading several reviews on the Trip Advisor site we booked a room at the Burnham. We got the last room in the hotel for the night of Dec. 2,2004 and thus there were no specials or packages offered. Nevertheless, we felt that we got our money's worth. We enjoyed a corner king suite on the seventh floor with a view of Marshall Field's and the German Christmas market at Daley Plaza. If you visit the Burnham during the Christmas Holiday season and wish to eat at the Walnut Room at Marshall Field's, be certain to ask the concierge for a &quot;next in line&quot; card. This enabled us to bypass the long lines and be seated immediately. We will definitely saty at the Burnham again.	
Nov 12 2004	Don't stay anywhere else	I've just returned from my first visit to Chicago and booked the Burnham after reading reviews on Tripadvisor - an excellent hotel, with superb staff. The room was immaculate - a great touch was the evening turn-down service, chocolates on your pillow and music on the CD player. The hotel is located on the corner of State Street, across the road from Marshall Fields, and is a 5/10 minute walk from the Magnificent Mile.Although we didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, there looked to be a great atmosphere and it was extremely popular with residents &amp; locals. There's a good selection of restaurants nearby - we loved the Italian Village.A fantastic hotel - if you're staying in Chicago, the Burnham is a must.	
Nov 5 2004	Service! Service! Service!	My wife and I stayed at the Burnham for two nights in October, 2004. The service was exceptional, which made me overlook a few middling shortcomings in the layout and structure of the place. (These folks make the best of a smallish, big-city hotel!)Shortly after arriving, we mentioned that we'd need an extension cord for a CPAP sleeping device. One materialized withing minutes. That was the first of many gestures during our stay. The uniformly friendly, helpful attitudes of the staff at this hotel was quite refreshing.Also had a wonderful dinner at the Atwood on our first night. This will definitely be my hotel on my next trip to Chicago!	
Nov 5 2004	Downtown Chicago	Hotel Burnham is a wonderful place to stay while in Chicago. The location is perfect. The hotel is beautiful and in wonderful condition. Our room was beautifully appointed, clean and the views were great. I highly recommend it.	
Nov 3 2004	Wonderful Hotel	Stayed at the Burnham this past weekend and could not have been happier with my choice. Although the room was on the small side it did not feel cramped and was neat and clean. The bathroom was large and clean. Nice touches were: evening wine hour and daily newspaper and starbucks coffee each morning in the lobby; lots of towels and pillows and terry bathrobes and aveeda products and an iron and ironing board; and nightly turn down service complete with a bucket full of ice. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful and the location across from Marshall Fields is perfect for access to the subway, busses and trolley. Chicago has a free trolley system to all of the major attractions (runs only on weekends beginning in October) which was great and I also contacted Chicago Greeter for a tour of the city which was very informative.Would definitely stay at the Burnham again.	
Oct 27 2004	Perfection!!	Based on the great reviews here on Trip Advisor, I booked a 2 night stay at this hotel.We've never been to Chicgo before, so a good hotel was really necessary. From the moment the doorman opened our taxi door, we were made to feel really special. The staff couldn't have been nicer. We arrived early and we had to wait about a minute for our room to be ready! We stayed in an executive suite on the fifth floor with great views over the city. The room was outstanding.On our first night, we wanted to eat at the Signature room atop the John Hancock centre. At about 6pm, I asked the concierge if he thought we could get a table for 7:30pm. He worked his magic and within minutes we had a reservation at a great table next to a window!We used room service the next morning and evening and couldn't fault the food or the service.This hotel is superb, we will definitley stay there again when go back to Chicago.	
Oct 26 2004	Wonderful Hotel!!	I first stayed a few years ago and I try to switch hotels when I stay in Chicago every time,and I visit Chicago every month and this is one of my top 2 favorites by far!The concierge is attentive,great location,intimate.....on and on and on!	
Oct 15 2004	Loved it!	I am the type of person who researches things to death and wants the best for my money, so when my husband and I took a mini vacation to Chicago in mid-September I did tons of research for the best place to stay. We decided on the Hotel Burnham and we weren't disappointed! We are accustomed to staying in nice hotels and this ranks right up there! We had a suite on floor 14 (actually 13, they skip from 12 to 14 as most old buildings do!) on the NE corner with a beautiful view of Lake Michigan and the theaters. Absoluely gorgeous! The Atwood Cafe was great and the service at the desk was fantastic. The bed was comfy and the Aveda products a nice touch. The only drawback was the suite was a little small, but nicely decorated so I didn't care. There was hardly any street noise and the red line is literally around the corner. We packed so much into 2 days, it was a relief to come &quot;home&quot; to the Hotel Burnham, put our feet up with a bottle of wine. Stay here, you'll never regret it!	
Oct 14 2004	Good but not as great as all the gushing reviews	Based upon Tripadvisor reviews, we selected the Hotel Burnham for a 2-night stay, October 6th &amp; 7th, 2004.The location is excellent, and the building charming. The staff was a real mix of very enthusiastic and helpful young people, and other young people who were neutral at best. A little experienced adult supervision would be good.The rooms are extremely small, and decorated to minimize the limited space. Our high-speed internet connection did not work, and no one knew how to fix it. The selection of channels on TV was very limited, as if they had chosen the basic basic basic cable tier, along with a 24-hour yoga channel, for some reason.As there is no service elevator, you will share your ride with towels, linen, and your neighbor's uneaten room service food. Not classy.The first night, there was loud construction noise in front, outside our room, and the staff seemed uninformed about this, and unable to move us to a satisfactory alternative room. (Satisfactory does not equal a smaller, smoking broom closet.)We ate dinner at the in-house restaurant, and found the food to be very good, but again, the service was marginal, with slow clearing of items, missed menu choices, and late arrival of some of the food.Overall, we can see why this hotel has such potential, but they must be resting on their laurels, or had a couple of bad days.We would only stay there again, if we had a suite (i.e. a normal sized room), and read Tripadvisor reviews indicating that they had addressed our other concerns.NB: To their credit, Hotel Burnham sent us an on-line customer satisfaction survey, and we provided the same feedback as in this review.	
Oct 11 2004	Great Place	This is a great place to stay. The staff was friendly and the room was really nice. Best of all, it was really quiet. It would be a wonderful place to stay during the holiday season to see all of the lights on State Street.	
Oct 4 2004	friendly but uneven service	We stayed at the Hotel Burnham for three nights in September. The pluses: friendly staff, good location, beautiful elevator lobby, Aveda bath products. The minuses: very small room, not very good food in the surprisingly busy restaurant and a bellman who never arrived to help us with our luggage, despite two requests.	
Sep 27 2004	A highlight of our trip!	I booked a weekend stay at the Hotel Burnham after reading the great reviews here on Trip Advisor. My husband and I were not disappointed. What a wonderful hotel: fabulous friendly and helpful staff; beautiful hotel and rooms; lovely restaurant; great location; very reasonable rates. You really cannot go wrong with this hotel!	
Sep 24 2004	the best	My wife and I have stayed in many hotels in downtown Chicago during weekend getaways. This one is by far the best. We'll be going back again.	
Sep 22 2004	We loved the Burnham!	My sister and I stayed at the Burnham in late September on vacation. We chose the hotel because of all the great reviews we had read and hoped we wouldn't be disappointed when we arrived. We weren't. The room was very comfortable, not too small at all; the staff was incredibly accomodating; and the location was ideal, right near Millenium Park, the Art Institute and plenty of shopping. We were very happy with our choice and would definitely choose the Hotel Burnham again!	
Sep 8 2004	The Burnham - my Chicago home away from Home	I stayed at the Hotel Burnham during the second week of Aug. '04 and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The entire staff was totally accommodating to anything I asked for. The concierge, Brent, went out of his way to help me. I love the Burnham!	
Sep 7 2004	Intimate  great location	The Burnham Hotel is in a renovated, 19th c. building with a bit of character. Im not sure of its history, but it has the appearance of having been an office building because the top halves of the doors to the rooms have frosted glass panels. (The glass-paneled doors raise security and fire-safety concerns.) It isnt grand, but it has the feel of an old hotel, sort of eclectic, or maybe it could be called &quot;western commercial Victorian&quot; in style. Its smallish and cozy. Décor in the public spaces is kind of heavy and dark in spite of all the windows in the lobby and adjoining restaurant; the guest rooms are lighter, more stylish, and very attractive. Upholstery, drapery, and bedspread fabrics are of high quality and quite pretty. Reproduction iron work surrounds the elevators, and in the elevator hall there is a striking mosaic floor, restored. Upstairs, some of the hallway walls, ceilings, and stairs are covered in thick slabs of white Carrara marble. There are rug runners throughout, probably covering damaged mosaic tile; wall &amp; rug colors are deep gold, accented with dark red and royal or navy blue.I had made the reservation by telephone because I couldnt work out on-line a way that a family of four (two young teens) could sleep comfortably. A King Suite for $189 was recommended: the children could use the &quot;sofa bed&quot; and a cot in the sitting room. When we arrived, however, the staff was unaware that the reservation promised beds for four, and they did not appear to have thought about how to accommodate us, although we were obviously four people. But when we requested a cot, they brought it. When it turned out that the loveseat/sofa was not a sofa-bed after all, we had to request an additional cot. This was somewhat vexing, but once all of this was settled, we were fine. In the King Suite, the door from the outside hall opens to a short hallway with bathroom and closet on either side leading to a stylish sitting room. It has a high back and high armed loveseat upholstered in gold damask, large TV cabinet with stereo and minibar, end and coffee tables, and a desk &amp; chair. Wood furniture is dark, formal style. The bathroom is not luxurious (except for the many Aveda products), but it is adequate and attractive. There is an iron and a good hairdryer. The very comfortable kingsize bed in our suite came with an elaborate half-canopy crown in blue and gold fabric. The bed is in a small room (8x8?) separated from the sitting room by glass-paned French doors--some but not as much privacy as expected; plus, access to the bath is through the sitting room. There was 2 to 3 feet of walking space on the sides of the bed, maybe 3-1/2 feet at the foot. This was a corner room with two walls of large windows &amp; great views; sheer roman shades and heavy blue and gold draperies that could be open or drawn. A TV is also in this room. We had a wonderful view of the Frank Gehry sculpture in Millennium Park, and of Marshall Fields across the street (fantastic dept. store). The Art Institute is within walking distance.The hotel staff were responsive and very nice, although the valet and bellman were somewhat overly familiar. The only other minor complaint might be that the rug in our suite was a bit soiled and had a wet spot in the middle of the sitting room.A plus: Guests are served wine in the lobby at 5pm--good wine, we thought. This was a very nice touch. We complimented the wine selection and were given a bottle, gratis. The hotel has an intimate feeling, and we liked the atmosphere. It was very relaxed and friendly. We had no time to eat in the restaurant, but the menu was interesting, although rather expensive; prices $18-28 for dinner entrees and at breakfast, $20 for bacon &amp; eggs. The restaurant enjoys a very good reputation in Chicago. Overall a very nice hotel experience.	
Sep 4 2004	What a great hotel	After seeing this hotel on the travel channels show &quot;Great Hotels&quot; I knew this was a hotel I would like to stay at. The hotel was very nice. The rooms were very well done and the beds were great. The hotel is in a great location. The concierge was a great help and welcomed me by by name when i entered the hotel. It was great to stay in this Chicago architectural landmark.	
Sep 4 2004	What a wonderful experience	What a wonderful experience. My first stay at this hotel started after midnight on 8/31/04. I had worked over 15 hours and just needed to sleep before returning to work early on 9/1/04. What a pleasant surprise to find that the prior reviews were all on the mark. I was made to feel as a guest, not any easy chore for the hotel based on my mood. To be so well treated made the stress of the day disolve. There are many reasons this hotel is so highly rated. You owe it to yourself to stay here.	
Aug 25 2004	Great place to stay	My wife, 7 yr old son and our cat stayed here for a long weekend in mid-August. Wow. We stayed in a deluxe queeen which came with a chaise lounge and had plenty of room. The room was spotless and the staff was not only attentive to us but to our cat. Great atmosphere - great people - great location - great food- great view. You're directly accross from the historic Marshall Field's. At the same location is access to the free shuttle trolleys that take you to Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, etc. The city is always great but the hotel really defined the vacation. Paid $159 a night through Expedia and it was worth it. The $31/night valet parking is a little steep but its par for the course in the city. If you're staying in the city, you really don't need a car but they did have in/out priviledges which makes access to the car easy if you need it.The concierge was especially helpful and helped guide us to kid friendly restraunts, attractions, etc.This hotel exceeded our expectations and we both agree that this was the best hotel experience we've ever had in any city, on any vacation.Stay here.	
Aug 21 2004	What Wonderful Service	This hotel was absolutely wonderful. The service was top notch. When my husband and I arrived we were instantly escorted up to our room with our bags. We were then given a tour of our room and told where absolutely everything was. The staff seemed to actually care if we were enjoying our stay. Tracy at the front desk is great. She is the famous worker who got someone tickets to the Oprah show. She recommended a wonderful pizza place that had absolutely no wait. Two thumbs up to Hotel Burnham. Wonderful Service!!	
Aug 17 2004	Stylish hotel	The Burnham met or beat our expectations for the most part. They owners did a beautiful job restoring this building. The deco design inside really fits with Chicago's stellar architecture. The service and courtesy of the staff we encountered could not have been better. The host gladly moved us from a smoking room to a non-smoking room once one became available. The hotel did suffer from a little style over substance. We did not find many ammenities. The fitness room had a couple of treadmills, two stairsteppers, some dumbells, and a TV in rather cramped room. Overall, we had a very nice stay at the Burnham.	
Aug 7 2004 	Can't Go Wrong	I've stayed at my share of Chicago hotels. You just can't go wrong at the Burnham. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff is ultra-friendly. I even have a requested room on my profile so that every time I book there, I usually get the same room. It's just a queen room, but I like it, and the Burnham staff takes care of me.	
Aug 1 2004	Beautiful Hotel!	We spent the night at the Hotel Burnham for our anniversary. It was a beautiful hotel with top notch service. We used the hotel's valet parking, $31 with in/out privileges. We never used our car! The location is close to wonderful shopping, theatre, restaurants, and the new Millenium Park. We walked to dinner and to the lake for fireworks and then the Millenium Park.Our room was very elegantly decorated and comfortable with a great view of the city. We went down for the hotel's wine hour for a pre-dinner cocktail. They also had coffee and tea available in the lobby in the morning. We ate breakfast at the attached restaurant, Atwood's. It was very pleasant with good food and attentive service. I'd definitely stay here again! Be sure to look at the wall across from the elevators to see how the Reliant Building has changed over the years...they've done a beautiful job restoring it!	
Jul 29 2004	The Burnham is absolutely wonderful!!	My husband and I have been staying at downtown Chicago hotel once a month since March. The Burnham was really wonderful. We had a great corner suite with a fabulous view, the staff was very friendly. We had planned to eat dinner out of the hotel, but were too tired by evening (too much playing tourist, what fun!!), so we ate in The Atwood Cafe, food and service were both very good. It will be hard to top this stay!	
Jul 14 2004	Perfect spot for an anniversary or special occasion	My husband and I stayed at the Burnham in late June. It was our first trip to Chicago as well as our 20th anniversary, and we could not have picked a more wonderful hotel. The architecture/history is amazing, and its location (right across from a park and Marshall Fields) is also a plus. We upgraded to a spacious corner suite midway through our stay and loved the extra room and the amazing views. The entire staff was professional, helpful, and gracious, and the morning Starbucks coffee and evening wine hour were welcome treats. We can't imagine staying anywhere else on our next trip, which we hope will be soon. Hotel Burnham was by far the best experience we have had in any hotel anywhere.	
Jul 9 2004	A 40th birthday trip to remember	I surprised my husband for his 40th birthday with a trip to Chicago. We brought along our 2 yr old daughter. When we arrived at Hotel Burnham, I forgot we were celebrating my husband's birthday because I was in awe when I saw our beautiful room on the 10th floor. Open the curtains and their was a gorgeous view which included the Chicago Theater, The Ford Performance Center, Walgreens, and Marshall Fields to name a few. The chocolates in the evening and the jazz music was definitely impressive. The Atwood Cafe inside the hotel was awesome. The wine reception from 5-6pm included chardonnay and zinfadel which both were really good. The history of the hotel is a must read. The hotel is beautiful, clean and decorated for kings and queens. When going back to Chicago, I would not stay anywhere else, but Hotel Burnham. The location of the hotel puts you in short driving or walking distance to almost any attraction or desired spot. While staying at Hotel Burnham, do not leave without visiting Navy Pier, Magnificant Mile, the thousands of museums and art galleries, Oprah Winfrey studio and of course the Sears Tower. These are all near Hotel Burham. Enjoy your stay. We loved it.	
Jul 8 2004	one of the best!	I stayed at this hotel for a week July26th,2004. I will now use this hotel solely for my regular visits to Chicago. It is lovely! The location is perfect for shopping, touring, theatre, Grant Park and the Lake. The free city trolley stops on the corner. The ambiance is wonderful but it is the help that truly make this an outstanding choice. They have hired the best available for every position!	
Jul 6 2004	Highlight of the trip!	Hotel Burnham was wonderful and definitely the highlight of the trip! It was so very charming and the room was beautiful. I took my boyfriend for his 30th bday and we both loved it. They honored every request I made (upper floor, NEast corner=best view). The turn down service and chocolates were such a nice touch. They even turn on classical music (stereo in the room) and dimmed the lights! The complimentary wine hour was also a treat. You definitely get SO MUCH for your money at this hotel. I will definitely stay at this hotel again!!	
Jun 30 2004	Hotel Burnham was terrific!	We had a terrific stay at the Hotel Burnham in Chicago. I emailed ahead of time that I was bringing my daughter to Chicago for her 12th birthday, and asked if they could do anything special. They did!Jenny booked us a room overlooking the park. Tracy acknowledged my daughter, and promised there would be something special for her in the room that evening. We came back to popcorn, pop, and cookies that evening. My daughter thought the turn-down services (with chocolates) was awesome. Of all the attractions (American Girl Place, Field Museum, Navy Pier, Shedd Aquarium), Hotel Burnham was the highlight of her trip. Our room wasn't big, but it was decorated just like the one in the web site. It was quiet and I felt safe there. We slept very sound.	
Jun 2 2004	Best Hotel in Chicago	The staff are top-notch. I arrived early and was allowed to check-in immediatley. The room was great. Nice view up State St. Quiet, did not hear any other guests. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The hotel is beautiful and restored tastefully. A little hotel with a BIG heart!	
May 11 2004	One of the best!	The Hotel Burham was a welcome refuge from the bustling big city of Chicago. With it's smaller size, beautiful renovations, comfortable rooms, excellent location and exceptionally pleasant, professional and helpful staff I would stay at the Hotel Burham again and recommend it to other travelers with no hesitation. This is Ritz Carlton treatment at prices the 'average joe' can afford. Two thumbs up for the Hotel Burham!!	
Apr 28 2004	Wonderful stay!	My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Burnham on April 24, 2004. The hotel is located in a perfect location for theater-goers. We had tickets to see Phantom of the Opera at Cadillac Palace Theater, which was a short walk or cab ride away (as are Chicago, Noble, and Oriental Theaters). The hotel is also located next to great shopping, and the red line El stop is practically at the hotel's front door. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They seemed eager to please. Our package included a bottle of sparkling wine, chocolates, free valet parking for the night (which is a great bonus in an area where parking is a nightmare), and continental breakfast for two the next morning. We had dinner at Atwood Cafe, which is the restaurant located in the lobby of the hotel. The restaurant is a bit cramped and noisy, but the food was fairly good. I would recommend the graham cracker calamari. We stayed in a King room on one of the top floors. The room was beautifully decorated...elegant is the word that comes to mind. Every amenity was readily available, and the staff came in while we were at the theater to perform turn down service complete with chocolates and jazz music playing on the stereo (the stereo had a five disc CD changer, which was nice). The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quiet. We did not hear any other guests at any time during our stay. The hotel has a lot of charm and character. It is a historical landmark and at one time housed offices. The elevator lobby is breathtaking. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to Chicago.	
Apr 25 2004	Just got back from Hotel Burnham	Just returned from wedding in Chicago and the Hotel Burnham. What a great hotel...unique and beautiful. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are elegant. We took a king room which was much smaller than had we tried the double room. Hotel has complementary Starbucks coffee available each AM at 6:30 with newspapers, and evening turndown service (with chocolate!). Took CTA train from O'Hare to Washington stop one block from hotel for $1.75 each way...can't beat that!!! How convenient! Shopping and restaurants right there. Highly recommended.	
Apr 23 2004	What superb service!	The service at this hotel is unparalleled in our experience. Every question was answered quickly and promptly; every special need addressed almost immediately. The only place where the service falls short is in the restaurant/hotel (where dinners are far better than breakfasts, by the way). The rooms are small, but well appointed and pleasing to the eye. We asked in advance for a bright room with a view, and got it.One note: The hotel is a bit of a hike to the Magnificent Mile in Chicago. On the other hand, it's within walking distance of the Art Institute, and it's across the street for Marshall Fields, for shopping lovers.	
Apr 18 2004	Great Location	Wonderful staff. The Red Line is right outside the door. The park is three short blocks away if you need to walk your dog.Kimpton properties are wonderful about pets. I never heard a sound while I was there (for the International Kennel Club Dog Show). Still, it's a shame there are irresponsible pet owners bringing unhappy, barking dogs to such a nice hotel. If you're not sure your dog will be quiet and comfortable in the room-leave it at home or in more suitable surroundings. It's not fair to the other guests, especially those of us who have taken great pains to properly socialize our pets.	
Apr 17 2004	Wonderful Place!	My wife and I just returned from a great weekend in Chicago. The Burnham Hotel made our anniversary stay a most memorable one. From the upgraded suite, to the champagne prepared in our room for our arrival, everything was taken care perfectly. The hotel is conveniently located on the red line, and just a walk away from the blue line to O'Hare. If your planning on seeing a show in the theatre or shopping at Marshall Field's flagship store, its really the best location! The room is elegant and preserves its heritage while maintaining a modern touch.	
Mar 31 2004	Wonderful place to stay	My wife and I stayed here for the weekend celebrating and anniversary and absolutely loved it. The service was impeccable, particularly the concierges who found us outstanding dining. Complimentary shoeshines and robes, as well as the evening turn-down service were great touches. The rooms were small, but the bathroom was plenty large. The decor was really cool...the Reliance Building used to be an office building and the doors on our floor looked like 1920s office doors - the wrought iron trim added to the look.For the most part the front desk staff were kind, but didn't seem knowledgable about where to go if the concierge wasn't available. Also, there was no concierge on this particular Saturday night (oddly enough), so it's good to have some backup possibilities, or to ask as soon as you arrive.This hotel has been ranked highly on this list, &quot;most romantic hotels&quot; list, etc. and deserves every bit of approbation it has received.	
Mar 24 2004	Had A Top Floor Room	I stayed at the Hotel Burnham March 13, 2004 and had a wonderful experience. I signed up for the Kimpton Frequent Guest program before my trip and booked my room on the Burnham Hotel website using my membership number. To my surprise and delight I was given a top floor corner room upon check-in (The hotel has 15 floors). The room had a northern exposure and I could see up State Street to the Chicago River (a small glimpse of green). The lights from the Chicago Theater weren't working (it's under renovation) but I was provided with a great view of dazzling light displays from other nearby theaters. The room was on the small side, but it was clean and well appointed. The internet connection was blazing fast! We were welcomed to our room with a note from the concierge and chocolate chip cookies. The hotel's lobby and common areas are clean and beautifully restored...keeping with the building's original wrought iron stair railings, wood trim/wall paneling and tile floors. I was amused to get off the elevator to see a quaint common area set off by rooms with old fashioned &quot;office style&quot; windows in their hallway doors. Each room looked like you could walk into a private office set in the 1920s. Although I didn't dine at the hotel restaurant, there was generally a good dining crowd in the afternoon and evening. The &quot;loop&quot; location is excellent and right next door to Marshall Field's &quot;grande dame&quot; flagship store. I stayed at a large Michigan Avenue hotel later in the week, but wish I had made additional reservations at the Burnham Hotel. I would definitely stay at the Burnham again when I visit Chicago.	
Feb 22 2004	Another great Kimpton hotel	I have never been disappointed at a Kimpton hotel, and this one was no exception. (I don't work for them or own stock in them.) My partner and I spent a 4-day Valentine's weekend here and loved the VERY comfortable bed, soft linens, and little extras - turndown service included filling the ice bucket and turning on the sound system (radio/CD player) to a jazz station for our return to the room. The staff was always friendly and terrific, even asking at checkout whether we needed change for the subway out to the airport! We got a standard room, which tends to be a little small at Kimpton hotels, but we knew that going in - if you plan to spend lots of time in your room, splurge for the larger suites. Hotel accepts pets - we had a terrier yapping away in the room next door, but it was quiet at night. We had breakfast and brunch at Atwood cafe - somewhat pricey, esp. if you're a light morning eater because the portions are enormous - but very tasty. Red line subway located steps from the door, other lines 2 blocks away. Tons of shopping within 2 block-radius, plus the theater district. Location couldn't be better. We'll be back.	
Feb 15 2004	dan burnham would be proud	my wife an i stayed at the burnham for a valentines date,( although one day early on the 13th).The room we stayed in was a little small, but nicely appointed and clean. there are larger rooms available. we ate at the hotel's atwood cafe for dinner and loved it. reasonably priced for downtown and great comfort food with style. i booked the hotel because i love dan burnham's buildings and was so pleased when they rehabbed one of his best works, the Equitable building,. as a hotel. dan would be proud of the use of his great name. the location of the hotel is great. everything is accessable. easy walk to the Art institute and most other highlights of the city. for a lover of great architecture, this hotel puts you right in the middle of chicago's greatest hits.	
Nov 26 2003	Just feels LUXE and FABULOUS	We travel to Chicago 15-20 times per year for weekend trips and stay at many hotels in town. The Burnham is hands dow our favorite and we look forward to each return. First, for architecture buffs, this is a gem...the restoration of the hall by the elevator bank is astounding, and the overal re-design is excellent in the many ways they have incorporated historic details. The rooms are on the small side (this isn't a place to bring the kids, even the staff is all too friendly), but are decorated in an boutique-y opulent style reminiscent of many much more expensive boutique hotels (e.g. W)...this place delivers an incredible value. The location can't be beat for shoppers, theatre, symphony, opera, museums and the amazing lakefront (and soon Millenium Park) ALL IN WALKING DISTANCE. What really distinguishes the Burnham, however, is the excellent staff. They are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful...with personalities! For return guests, the rooms are often prepared with the radio set to your favorite type of music and a little treat upon arrival. The wine gathering each afternoon is just plain fun. And the valet parking (with in-an-out service) is reasonably priced. We LOVE this hotel, and could not recommend it too highly: exceptional value with a personalble professional staff in a gorgeously renovated historic landmark building.	
Aug 19 2003	Fabulous Burnham!	We had the weekend planned for four months and selected the Hotel Burnham based on the reviews. What a wonderful experience!!! We left Detroit during the blackout and couldn't have been happier with every aspect of our trip! The hotel is small, which is nice in the big city, and was just beautiful! What made it even more special was the staff, especially Tracy!! She is the famous concierge that was able to finally get tickets for a guest (after 9 years of trying!) to the Oprah Winfrey show. She took such good care of us! Every resturant recommendation was superb and she had us hopping everywhere with cards and discounts! We even saw the Chicago air and boat show from the top of the John Hancock building, in the air conditioning - it couldn't have been better (it was a very hot/humid day with thousands of people everywhere)! Thanks to Tracy and all of the staff at the Burnham - the ladies at the desk and the guys at the door never missed a beat! We had a most memoriable trip and now won't stay anywhere else - we're still hoping for those Oprah tickets some day!!!! Go Tracy!	
Aug 18 2003	What a find!	We were originally supposed to stay at the Hotel Allegro, but once I read the reviews here, I switched our reservation to the Hotel Burnham -- what a good idea! The hotel was in a great location, very nicely decorated, and the staff was incredibly helpful. The room was a little small, but luxurious enough that it didn't matter! The complimentary wine, coffee and newspapers were a nice touch. I would absolutely stay there again.
