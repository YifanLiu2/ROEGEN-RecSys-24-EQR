	Trendy modern  not for all tastes	This hotel is best for a romantic getaway type of deal. I'd give this 4 stars were it not for the loud cracking noise from the heating system. The regular rate is $200+ for a petite, which is overpriced unless you can get an upgrade to a queen or larger. If you are into sleek, dark, masculine, and more modern/trendy style it's for you. If you're into classic, warmth, coziness, than you should try something else. It has an excellent location. I got a special deal through hotels.com at the last minute. They upgraded me to a queen room with a terrace, which was awesome, and probably worth the money (~$160). They also let me check in 2 hours early. The look is very dark, masculine, and romantic. Television behind the mirror, nice entertainment system. Nice bath products, and a sexy bathroom set up (dark walls, mirrored walls, etc.) It would not suit all people's tastes, it's very modern and &quot;cold&quot;. The staff is very helpful, but not that friendly. There were loud cracking/drilling noises that I was told was due to the heating generator. I had to turn off the heat to get rid of the noise. I ordered room service for breakfast and it was neither generous nor that tasty. They give you cookies, which is nice. Overall, I'd say good for the younger, trendy set that's looking for a weekend away together. I liked the bathroom. Would not pay more than $200 to stay here - for that price, you could find something nicer.	
Nov 24 2009 	Great location and price... room had some flaws	This is a boutique hotel just a stone's throw from Time's Square. It is on a lovely, somewhat quiet street next to some beautiful historic properties..The Algonquin, The Iroqouis are next door. There is a large Brooks Brothers store a few doors down. If you are looking for an inexpensive place to drop after a night of Time's square or taking in some theater, this could be for you. We got it for 175 a night on Hotwire...the other hotels I mentioned start their room rates at 399 a night. Sofitel is also on the street (600 a night) So..this place is a &quot;bargain&quot;That said..there were some real problems with our room. It was so dark..the lighting in there made it impossible to shave or do make-up...I had to go into the hallway. The bedroom was SOOO tiny that I tripped on the baseboards every time I went to the bathroom. The bathroom is lovely (almost the same size as the bedroom) but again...poor lighting made it impossible to do anything in there.There were some &quot;bells and whistles&quot; which were nice...Frette linen and an ipod docking station. It was VERY clean. Wonderful cookies on our pillow at bedtime.But I don't know if I would stay again. Maybe I would...and just upgrade (another 150) to a bigger room.	
Nov 22 2009 	the staff could not have been less helpful	we forgot our wallet back home in toronto but had plenty of cash and no credit cards on us. When we arrived to the hotel the manager at the front desk told us that we need a credit card and that he could not bend the rules for us. After pleading with him for ten minutes he said he will see what he can do and went to the back to make a call. When he left the other girl working at the front desk said that this happens all the time and she does not think that it will be a problem. Shortly after the manager comes out and says that he could not do anything for us. By than it was getting very late and we were very tired. to make a long story short our family back home had to come to our rescue and the staff were not accomodating at all. I would never stay there again and deff not recommend it to anyone	
Nov 10 2009 	Lovely Hotel great staff and fantastic location	Travelled for a long awaited weekend break to NY with my husband. We flew into Newark Airport and got the express but to Bryant Square which was only very short walk to the Hotel. Staff were very friendly on arrival and stored our bags until we could check in.Room was lovely, very clean and the bed was exceptionally comfy. The wardrobe/mini bar/safe/dvd player were in a small closet in the wall but provided us with ample space for our stuff. We had a lovely sofa/table and some chairs and drawers either side of the bed too. TV hidden behind a picture, plenty of wall lights with handy dimmer and the bathroom had sliding door, lovely large shower, plenty of toiletries/ towels. Huge basin, plenty of mirrors, towels and dressing gowns. Morning newspaper on door before we were up and room cleaned to really high standards once we were out.Staff couldn't do enough to help, free internet passes on request, prompt and efficient room service on the one night we used it. We didn't go to the DB restaurant whilst we were there but it looked lovely.Check in and check out were fast and efficient, all staff members we encountered were very pleasant without being overbearing. The location of the hotel was fabulous for my husbands first time to Manhattan - very short walk to Times Square and Grand Central either way and just off 5th Avenue. We had usual street noise from out 6th floor room but nothing too noisey.We've recommended this hotel to two people already and would definately stay there again if we wanted to be right in midtown.	
Oct 29 2009 	City Gem with 1 drawback	The City Club hotel offers an eclectic style for such an old City. All the buildings have a history about them. Not that the City Club doesn't. They have taken an old holel and given it a different feel. We loved the staff they were GREAT!. I spran my ankle while visiting and they were quick to respond with ice. Our room safe needed a new battery and they quickly fixed that as well. The beds and linens are also top of the line. I have never slept that well out of town. Great location - very close to Times Square, shopping and Theaters.I enjoy smaller hotels as they seem more personable and City Club fits that model. With only 65 rooms it is fairly quiet for the city and not difficult to find your way around.Here the drawback. The rooms are small. We did have a balcony witha decent view which made up for the size. I realize it is NY and a lot of the rooms are small in size. If you are staying for an extended period and have a lot of clothes you will be hard pressed to find someplace to put them. Closet space is shared with your refrigerator and you have a small night stand with 3 small drawers. If I was to make a recommendatation to the hotel, if they could just find some way to create a bit more storage for your belongings they would be top notch.	
Oct 25 2009 	Why stay here - there are so many other 3 star hotels in NYC	This is a 3 star service and sized hotel trying to maintain a 4 star image - it just doesn't hang together. The Frontdesk check-in staff were amazing - but then it slowing but consistantly fell apart from there. There were issues with the plumbing in the room as confirmed by the engineer the first night - but apparently the day manager new more about hot and cold water than I. I was to stay 4 nights - but left after 2 (would have stayed only 1 but was too tired to move on the late evening of the 2nd day)Day Manager (who also seemed to double as the doorman) was rude - and ultimately why I left the hotel. Capitalism is great - and judging by the recent reviews I would say City Club now has a real problem on their hands. I have stayed at Jeff Klein's (the owner) hotel in West Hollywood, the Sunset Tower - it's amazing - but skip City Club, it just not worth it.	
Oct 23 2009 	An awful room in a good location	The hotel advertises a &quot;deluxe king&quot; room. Says its open, airy etc. But ours was tiny with barely enough space to get around the bed. The pocket door to the bathroom was very difficult to open and close. Lighting in both the room and the antiquated elevators is almost impossible to use for reading or getting the correct floor. Don't worry about the air and light, because all the windows faced a brick wall. Otherwise, the location is very good and the employees are helpful but the price and value are the worst we've experienced all over the world. We've had much better values in most cities of Europe and Asia, not to mention the rest of the U.S.	
Oct 23 2009 	Great Location	Very nice hotel, with great location. Good value for money	
Oct 15 2009 	Teeny Tiny Room!	We got placed in this hotel after a priceline search for a four star hotel in midtown/theater district. I know that rooms in NYC are small - I have stayed there before - but this was ridiculous! The room would BARELY hold our double (not queen) bed. There was literally about 3 feet on each side of the bed for suitcases, etc. The bathroom was nice, if a bit outdated with a bidet and black marble. The hotel itself is definitely trying a bit too hard to be &quot;trendy/boutique&quot;. The hallways were all PITCH black with weird accent lighting. The elevators as well. The hotel itself is just very very tiny - the lobby is basically just one room with a tiny desk.Our service was pretty non-existent so can't really comment on that. Basically in the end I would not call this a 4 star hotel. More like 3.	
Oct 5 2009 	After the shocka pleasant stay!	When booking this hotel through a booking agent,we expected two beds in our room. The exceptionally small room contained one double bed,no chairs,no table ... very small... Those were the negatives. The bed was so very comfortable,the room very clean and the shower was amazing ... especially appreciated after a long day of sightseeing and theater-going in NY! The staff was friendly and,clearly do their best to accommodate their customers. The location is perfect and the hotel is so very quiet!We would stay there again!	
Sep 17 2009 	Great price good location excellent hotel	I stayed at the City Club for 2 nights while on a business trip. I initially picked it only because of the location (right across the street from where I needed to go), but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was for the price I was paying (~$180 a night with our corporate rate).ROOM:Decoration of the room is very modern. Have a super-comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and nice shower. The room itself is a little small - you open the door and the bed is pretty much right there; and you stepped out of the bed, you are pretty much in the bathroom. But even though it's petite, it contains all the essentials and comfort you need (unless you want a desk to do work on - in which case, there really isn't one).LOCATION:The location is very central. Being on 44th Street, it's only a few blocks from Times Square on one side, and a few blocks from Grand Central on the other. There are a few subway stops within walking distanceMISCELLANEOUS:The reception has a booklet that you can pick out free DVDs from, but I was too tired from work to borrow anything, but it is a nice-to-have. Since there is a DVD player in the room, I guess you can bring your own DVDs to watch too.Every night I come back, there is a plate of two cookies awaiting me - I thought that was a nice gesture. And when I first arrived (I arrive really early) and they allowed me to check right in, so that was nice too. They don't have a gym, but I think you can pay for a pass to use the NY Sports Club nearby. Although I don't think they open very late.	
Sep 9 2009 	What's not to like?	I stayed at City Club in August with some colleagues for a two day meeting. Honestly, I travel alot for work. I'm in hotels more than I am at home. So natrually, I'm not easily impressed. I have to admit I was very impressed with City Club. The staff was great- helpful, upbeat, nice and honest about where to go. The room was a nice size- I was in the front (not where I usually like to stay because of noise). The room was bright and the bed was really comfortable. It wasn't noisy as expected... Great shower.. Housekeeping did a great job, and turndown was a treat- freshly baked chocolate chip cookies! I got free passes to the gym which isn't in the hotel but on the same block. The internet was fast. the location was good, but I prefer to be further downtown. Room service was prompt. Will stay again if my meetings bring me to midtown.	
Sep 2 2009 	Disappointing 	Location - central.Reception - lots of attitude from most of the staff, like we are a BOUTIQUE hotel! Said and did the right things with our issues and concerns, but with just enough willingness to pass for acceptable.Room - well appointed. Dark colors and poor lighting - my wife had difficulty putting on her makeup. The bed was no good. We changed rooms on night 2, but this was no better. We ended up sleeping on the couch!Fitness Center - you have to pay $20 per day to utilize it ...not sure that the site disclosed this at booking time? I was not about to pay for the fitness club after it was listed as an amenity. Another let down!	
Aug 28 2009 	Dark and poky. There are better "boutique" hotels in NY	Good location, but hotel is dark and poky and not worth the money. Air conditioning in rooms too loud and becomes very annoying. More like a glorified youth hostel.	
Aug 12 2009 	Good Location great service and style	I travel to NY frequently for business. I saw City Club at a good rate online so I booked it as I needed a hotel that was centrally located and had a restaurant onsite for meetings. I was really pleased witht the service. My room was very comfortable- it had a queen sized bed, great bath amenities, fast wireless internet access. The restaurant was very good. The beds were really comfortable and the fresh cookies that greeted me when i got back to my room at night could not be beat. The service was very good- the staff always greeted me when i came in and out and the bellstaff was always there to open the door for me. Will stay here again and have recommended it to my colleagues.	
Jun 16 2009 	Well located good service from young staff	I'm very positive about this hotel mainly because I got a very good deal from Expedia, and then an upgrade when I checked in. So for about $200, I got a spacious (by NYC standards) room in a cool hotel that's perfectly located for sightseeing. You can't beat that!The hotel's location on West 44th St. is great -- near all the action in Times Square but not as hectic. The staff at the front desk looked like they hadn't yet graduated from college but were among the most efficient and professional I've encountered. DB Moderne, one of NY's best mid-priced restaurants, can be reached through the hotel lobby, and you can even put your restaurant tab on your hotel bill (although the two businesses are separate),One amusing thing about the room decor is that it tries to camouflage things. If the front desk neglect to tell you that the TV is behind the painting (or wherever), you'd never find it. I thought at first there was no closet, then realized it had been cleverly hidden with the wallpaper.There were a few things I didn't care for. My room on the second floor faced the street and wasn't soundproof. The shower curtain didn't keep the water from splashing all over the floor.But those are the only negatives I can think of. If you can snag a deal on this hotel, by all means, stay here!	
Jun 12 2009 	very small rooms	We should have read the earlier reviews because like 'Loveslife' (review may 13) we also booked our room through hotwire and expected a nice 4 star hotel room --and yes we also got a deal --but then again when we arrived we learned that the only room we could have was a petite room with a double bed. The room was fine in its furnishings etc but given its size and having only a window to a brick wall it was claustraphobic. Unfortunately unlike 'Loveslife', we were with two persons! So there was no room to move and no space to put our suitcases (in the end we put them on the floor in the shower). Furthermore the room didn't have a fridge or safe. It is indeed likely that the larger rooms are very nice and the location is great. Just know what you are booking and if the price is right and you don't mind being in a closet --even if it is a nice closet -it is worth it . (with many thanks to 'Loveslife')	
May 25 2009 	Just a little more forethought	City Club at 55 West 44th street was a great location, a good deal cost wise, small but sufficient room, exceptionally clean room and building, friendly and knowledgeable front desk teams, confortable bed (as I was lead to expect from other reviews) BUT we ordered breakfast through room service for two the catch being there was only one chair in the room. So someone had to picnic on the bed. In addition we ordered two different kinds of tea but one the insulated carafes had been used for coffee so frequently it was still 'stained' with coffee residue. When we opended that one we thought the order had been misread and then sent one coffee and one tea. It even gave that pot of tea a bit of coffee flavor. These are really picky things I have to admit and they will not discourage me from stayting at City Club again. Over all it was ideal for a night's rest after the theater.	
May 13 2009 	be careful what size room you book	I booked my room through hotwire and expected a nice 4 star hotel room --and yes I got a deal --but then again when i arrived I learned that the only room I could have was a petite room with a double bed. The room was fine in its furnishings etc but given its size and having only a window to a brick wall it was claustraphobic. It was a least good that I was alone. My guess is that the larger rooms are very nice and the location is great . Just know what you are booking and if the price is right and you don't mind being in a closet --even if it is a nice closet -it is worth it .	
Apr 28 2009 	Fantastic Hotel in a Perfect Location!	One of the few places a family of five can stay. It was so clean &amp; the room was large for NYC! The service was great! Everyone was friendly &amp; so helpful! I would highly recommend staying here (I actually already have to some family:)&gt;	
Apr 5 2009 	A little gem in the heart of the city	This was an exceptional place to stay from when we first disembarked our cab upon arrival till they held the door open for us to depart. The service by every member of the staff was so fantastic that in our short stay we ended up on a first name basis with a number of them. Any request was met with politeness and efficiency.Room was a decent size for NYC (esp for the price) and the location could not have been more ideal in terms of its proximity to the subway and numerous sites of interest.Loved that the TV was tucked away and the bed and day sitting area was super comfortable. The bathroom was stocked with fine toiletries and everything was very clean and well appointed.My husband and I had breakfast in the restaurant downstairs and everything was very tasty. Room felt very quiet for the city as it is on a 2 lane street -- some traffic noise but nothing that was prevented a pleasant stay.Would definitely stay here again not only because the room was comfortable and nice but mostly because the service was so outstanding.	
Mar 9 2009 	Exceptional Service	This is an amazing hotel situated in the center of Manhattan. From the moment we stepped into the lobby to the time we checked out, the service and staff were incredible. We stayed in the King Luxe room which was incredibly spacious and very smartly appointed. Our room had a day bed over looking 44th street and a TV behind our full length mirror! Such a creative use of space. My favorite part about our room were the oversized chocolate marble bathrooms. Our rate included complimentary wifi, passes to the New York Sports Club and discounted parking across at the parking garage across the street. And I can not leave out that the hotel's restaurant is one of Daniel Boulud's! We were able to order a fantastic French continental breakfast in the morning followed by our pre-theatre dinner later that night.Over all I had a fantastic experience at City Club! My only regret is that I was unable to stay longer!!	
Mar 8 2009 	Great location and environment	I'm still laughing about the comment below regarding lack of TV in the room. The TV is behind a glass wall - when it's off, it's as if it weren't there. Anyhow, I have stayed numerous times in this hotel since it first opened, and if you're a theatre-goer, this is one of the most amazing locations. The Red Flame diner a few doors down is a gem, plus DB Moderne is one of the best restaurants in NYC. I love staying at this hotel.	
Mar 4 2009 	Beautiful stylish design has best restaurant in Times Square area.	We loved this boutique hotel on one of the best blocks near Times Square. We could easily go to the theater or walk Fifth Avenue to Rockefeller center and shopping. The design was amazing - oversized marble bathrooms and the televisions were ingeniously hidden behind two-way mirrors which were controlled by pointing the remote at the full length mirror. The room service by the Daniel Boulud DB Bistro Restaurant was the perfect french breakfast and we enjoyed their famous (although expensive -$30) foie gras and truffle hamburger.Service was extremely helpful and friendly - Emanuel at the front desk arranged theater tickets for us and dinner reservations at some difficult to get into restaurants. Overall we had a great stay and recommend this hotel!	
Feb 18 2009 	horrible experience we won't be back	This hotel was absolutely terrible!!! We were there for a one night stay over Valentine's day. I had never been to NYC, so I was very excited for our stay. When we got to our queen luxe room I was extremely disappointed. My fiancé opened the window shades and we had a huge brick wall for a view. Then we noticed that there wasn't even a TV in the room even though they say that there are &quot;premium channels in all guest rooms including HBO&quot; and they offer a DVD library to choose from. However, there was a DVD player in our closet (I don't know what we were supposed to watch it on). Anyway, the lack of TV didn't really matter that much to us since we were only there one night and weren't in the room much.It was very hard to sleep that night. You could hear every noise in the hall and other people's rooms and the cover to the heating unit kept falling off of the wall.Then to top off the experience I notice that my credit card had an extra charge of $30.00 on it. I called to the hotel and they told me it was for a bag of potato chips, a small bottle of spirits, and a half a bottle of red wine. I explained to Emanuel that we had never even touched the mini bar. I guess he thought that we ate chips and drank while watching a nonexistent TV and staring at the brick wall. So overall the experience was awful and they tried to rip us off too!!!	
Jan 21 2009 	Perfect Getaway	The City Club provided the perfect setting for our recent romantic getaway to New York.  We were allowed to check in 3 hours early...the staff and service was excellent...there is discounted garage parking across the street...the room was larger than expected for such a boutique hotel...room and bathroom were clean...trendy, modern decor throughout...there is free internet access and a free computer to use on the second floor lounge. the restaurant next door is supposed to be amazing...however we didnt eat there, b/c we wanted to explore other parts of the city.while some might be turned off from the &quot;dark&quot; feel throughout the hotel (dim lighting, dark-earth tones in the bathrooms, etc...) we thought it only added to the experience. the biggest drawback was the view of the brick wall and the bathroom was small but ample. however, we weren't in the room much (its New York after all) so it didn't really bother us at all.by far, the hotel's greatest asset is its location. nestled right between 6th and 5th avenue, and just blocks away from Times Square, Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building, the only time we had to hop in a cab was to explore greenwhich village and the financial district.we would stay at the City Club again in a heartbeat...	
Dec 5 2008 	What a great experience	I booked this place mainly based on location.Its off the beaten path of Times Square, but still walking distance.Wanted a nice place to help celebrate a dear friends birthday.I arrived early and was checked in, dropped my stuff off. Room wasn't ready. So we went and brunched and were called as soon as a room was available.Upon getting into the room, the room was small. But it was so well laid out, it didn't seem small in the least. What a most effiicient use of space.The upscale bathroom amenties had my friend and I &quot;fighting&quot; over them. But since its his birthday, he got them.Between shows, we were greeted by some amazing tasty cookies waiting for us in the room.After the 2nd Broadway show we saw, went back to the room to freshenup and hit the clubs. But the combination of walking around and the comfy comfy bed, we called it a night.Shame but next time I come back, I am definfately staying a longer time!	
Nov 14 2008 	Nice hotel	We found this hotel thanks to a New York city guide of a Belgian Newspaper. The review on this hotel was really good so we decided to try it out and were not disappointed. All the staff were helpful and very friendly.The room was very nice and big enough and the bathroom large but as already said in previous reviews the closet could be bigger and the AC less noisy(really too noisy to be able to sleep). The location is also perfect. We did all our visiting trips by foot and we were able to find good restaurants at night within walking distance. For this we used the Zagat restaurant guide we found in the room. However the best dinner we had was at the DB Bistro. Service and food were perfect. If we have one negative remark about the hotel it is the absence of a comfortable bar where you can enjoy a drink before or after dinner and relax in a comfortable atmosphere after a long day out. The first night we went to the DB bistro (as suggested on the website )but as from 5pm the place is full of people having dinner. We went elsewhere the other nights.Anyway if you are looking for a comfortable, small hotel with great service, this is the place to be.	
Oct 26 2008 	Great Beds	We booked this hotel through Quickbook at the last minute. We often do quick NYC get-a-ways when we can get reasonable last minute rates. We have stayed at many NYC boutique hotels including 6 Columbus, The Benjamin, Hotel Giraffe, The Muse etc...We will definitely add The City Club to our list. We had booked a queen but because they had availability, they met our request for a quiet room and upgraded us to a king at no additional cost. They also met our request for a later check out at 1. There are many great restaurants near by and we had dinner at Triumph next door at the Iroquois Hotel which was very nice. I'm sure the hotel restaurant is very nice too but quite pricey. The fabulous location enabled us to walk to Central Park one day and we walked home from Soho the night before. Very pleasurable all round experience, can't complain about a thing!	
Jul 14 2008 	Love love love this hotel	This is a wonderful, fantastic place to stay in NYC! It is so friendly, yet professional and the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy. The room was fabulous, super comfortable, luxurious and well, just perfect. It's small and intimate and beats the choices in the 50's &amp; Broadway by a mile. All the grace, luxury and class of the chain luxury hotels, with none of the pretense. The location is perfect. Just steps away from the theatres and several amazing bistro/restaurants that feel like neighborhood places, just outside the door. Now I won't stay anywhere else when in the city.	
May 30 2008 	A for effort	City Club is a small boutique hotel in a great central location in midtown Manhattan. Staff was very helpful and accommodating. Rooms are a little on the small side with no view (not surprising in Manhattan). The fabric wallpaper is showing a lilttle wear and tear, but the room was clean. Bathroom was great with good quality soap and shampoo; water pressure in the shower that would blow you down the block! Hotel was quiet and rooms have black-out shades for great sleeping.Turn down service came with killer chocolate chip cookies. Staff recommended the restaurant next door, DB Bistro Moderne, for lunch - which was terrific.There is a large fitness club a few doors down to which guests have complimentary access.Only real complaint about the hotel was that despite the property being a non-smoking hotel, our room reeked of smoke. Suspect that because of fabric wallpaper, the smell is difficult to get out, but it was off-putting.Room rate was competitive with other hotels of it's class. Did get a much better rate off Expedia than I was offered when I called the hotel directly. Overall, would definitely stay there again.	
May 28 2008 	Hip Quiet and Relaxing. Perfect for business.	I travel frequently for business and have stayed in many hotels in NYC. I find myself coming back time and time again. The rooms are quite large by NYC standards, very well appointed, and quiet. The bathrooms are among the best of any hotel I have stayed at. The room service from db Bistro is likely the best you will find at any hotel (albeit a bit pricy). The cleaning staff has never once knocked or intruded while I am there - they seem to have a 6th sense about when to come and clean. One tip is to request a room at the front of the hotel. This will give you better daylight, and a nice view of W. 44th, but it can be at the expense of some traffic noise.	
May 20 2008 	Perfect spot	I booked this hotel as a surprise trip to New York for my boyfriend's 40th birthday. I chose it because of the location and because he's into technology and it looked right up his street, plus the beds looked huge and sumptuous.A nice touch having the tv hidden behind the mirror and a CD player to create some abience.The only downside was the view... there wasn't one. But seeing as we didn't spend too much time in there anyway, we weren't complaining.Great spot to get around Manhatten as it's literally around the corner from Times Square. There's also a great little diner a few doors down which the staff recommended. Can't remember the name but we ate breakfast there each morning - delicious!We had one minor issue whilst staying there, and this was the 24 hour room service. We tried to order food at 2:00 and there were no staff to fulfill it so we went to bed hungry. Plus the juice in the mini fridge was well past it's sell by date. However, when I told them they went out and bought us back a big carton of Tropicana, so we were happy with that.	
May 3 2008	Pleasant botique	Pros: great location for most tourists, parking garage across the street, well-appointed but simple room with big nice bed, moody lighting, black marble bathroom with nice toiletries, turndown service with cookies (a nice touch), complimentary DVDs to borrow, surprisingly good-sized room (by New York standards).Cons: most rooms have a poor view, closet is small (but really not THAT much different from any other hotel), poor writing desk, television not at a great angle (I'm really stretching for negatives here).Would definitely stay again. Very nice gay-friendly hotel.	
Apr 26 2008 	In the middle of a battle-field!	After my terrible stay at this hotel, I wanted to check out the reviews about this hotel written by other users, and I was really surprised about how others had good experiences. How could that be possible???I was in NYC for two days for business and had rather busy schedule. I stayed at City Club for two nights. Not being able to sleep all night on either night ruined my trip.At first, I was impressed by the design of the hotel. My room (#305) was stylish and clean. The real story started after mid-night when the huge AC noise from the next building woke me up. At 2 AM, I thought if I got really tired, I should be able to go to sleep despite the noise. However, I wasn't able to go to sleep by 4 AM. So I called the front desk to ask him to check if the windows were open because the AC noise was huge. He stopped by to check the windows. They were all closed. So he switched me to another room on the 6th floor (# 602). It was a very warm room. There was also the similar kind of AC noise although not as loud as in the previous room. I figured I must turn on the room AC to cool down the air which would create more noise.Therefore, I stopped by the front desk to ask them to switch me to another room. They switched me to room #202 that faced the front street at 4:30 AM. I was able to go to sleep despite the growing traffic noise because it was not nearly as bad as the AC noise.Then I expected the second night to be relatively peaceful. However, I was completely wrong!At 1:30 AM, a working truck stopped in front of the building with engines running and people talking for at least half an hour. It felt like a construction project going on. After the crew left, I felt relieved because I wouldn't have expected another construction project coming back on one night! At 3:30 AM, another working truck stopped in front of the building with engines running and people talking.I called the front desk and asked why there were so many construction projects going on in the middle of the night. The front desk told me they were garbage trucks collecting garbage. The one that showed up at 1:30 AM was to collect trash from the hotel right across the street. The one that showed up at 3:30 AM was to collect trash from this hotel.Reason for my not knowing this the night before was that I moved to this room at 4:30 AM after struggling all night the night before!In summary, if you are able to sleep in a battle field ( for instance, if you were a soldier in Iraq and get used to sleeping during the wars), this hotel is for you. However, if you are as sensitive a human being as myself, you'd better off stay away from this hotel!	
Mar 25 2008 	True definition of a hip boutique hotel wonderful location	If price is not on your mind, this hotel is spectacular! Lots of hotels spend thousands on a snazzy lobby but shabby rooms, but City Club Hotel did something out of the ordinary. It's a very simple and small lobby to check-in, just adjacent to an excellent restaurant, but the rooms are elegant and dramatic! Ipod alarm clocks, marble bathrooms, Hermes bath amenities, extremely comfortable beds and a free business computer on the 2nd floor made my stay very enjoyable!The lobby is light and airy; in contrast, the rooms are quite dark and masculine, but still comfy. I would not recommend to stay here on business, just because they focused on mood lighting, and not desk work stations. If you want your own quiet corner of NYC just steps away from Times Sq, you need to stay here. The staff were accomodating and helpful.	
Feb 2 2008 	Truly lovely small hotel	After hours and hours of searching for a nice, quiet hotelduring the holiday season in NYC, we found the gem inCity Club Hotel. The rooms were perfect, the bathroomsso up-to-date and hip, and the staff was among the bestwe've encountered. The assistant g.m. is so attentive andgenerous with her time, the front desk people are delightful,and the doormen can make your day. The smallest thingscan make a trip worthwhile. They found out that I was acoffee &quot;addict&quot; and made sure I had a new coffeemaker in myroom with supplies. The restaurant attached to the hotel isbeautiful, although we only ate there once during our five days.Order the bagel and lox from the 24hr menu late one night!P.S. Wonderful beds and linens.	
Dec 6 2007 	Great location! otherwise mediocre	Plusses:- excellent location - walk to everything in Midtown- in the same block as the Algonquin Hotel, the Iriquois, the Harvard Club, and the New York Yacht Club- near Times Square if that's what you want- easy to walk to Rockefeller Center- friendly staff calls you by name all the time- superb beds- 2 so-so cookies on your pillow at night- you can open your window if you get a room overlooking 44th street -- to listen to all the Times Square noise- yes, they are wireless -- and they have ONE public computer on the second floorNegatives:- typically they run late when you want to check in. You may have to wait an hour or so on the second floor.- very noisey - jack hammers start nearby at 7am &amp; go all day- clothes closet for bedroom is 2 feet by 2 feet, very small- no coffee maker in room but there's a &quot;diner like&quot; restuarant in the same block, and a McDonalds two blocks away- no ventilation fan in the bathroom. Mirrors steam up.- lighting is tricky. You have to find the dimmer switch. The reading light(s) over the beds are useless.- TV speakers blare in the bedroom AND the bathroom.- Bathroom is a black marble, very masculine.Again, a GREAT LOCATION, within walking distance to everything in Midtown, but otherwise very mediocre.	
Dec 3 2007 	Good and bad points overall could be better..	Just returned after a two night stay at this hotel. We had the Duplex suite which was pretty cool and unique, with the HUGE ceiling to floor window covering two floors, the beautiful ceilings, and a great bathroom.What was strange (and annoying) about this room was the heating, The heater ventilator was very, very loud, and there was no way to turn it down- just off. That meant that the lower level of the Duplex was freezing, but the upper level was usually extremely warm.The entertainment systems in the room were perfectly functional, but worn and outdated.The service at the hotel was fairly good, staff very helpful &amp; willing.The bistro next door had a nice breakfast, worth checking out.Overall it was a fairly good stay, but the hotel could use some refurbishing and attention to detail.	
Nov 29 2007 	Great food not really an hotel	You arrive at a small desk to check in, there is no public area and no hotel atmosphere but the staff is nice and involved.The room was extremely small even for NY, not mint, dated with a view to a wall. You can hear the noise from the corridor only covered by the noise from the street in the morning. There is no reading light. The TV set can only be seen standing! Room service from the DB restaurent is efficient and excellent.The breakfast, its brioche and the whole menu is to die for.Nicely located on 44th street, but prefere the Sofitel next door, better value, better rooms, better atmosphere you can go to DB for breakfast next door.	
Nov 1 2007 	Shame on the City Club Hotel.	In all fairness, the City Club Hotel was, at one time, my favorite place to stay in the city. I was a frequent guest from the time it first opened in 2001 until a year ago.I recently returned for a 3 night business stay and booked a King Deluxe room online using the hotel's website.What a huge disappointment it was compared with my past experiences. Before this one I always enjoyed my stays largely due to the staff and their attention to service. From the onset, the Front Desk staff was aloof and indifferent. When the room type I had reserved was not available, I was put into a smaller room type without warning or explanation.The attitude and overall demeanor of the European woman who checked me in was just plain lousy. Her English was ridiculous and she spoke much too fast which made it even more difficult to understand. Generally, she acted as though she just wanted to get rid of me and did not try to hide it. Shame on her and on the City Club Hotel.The beds are still very comfortable but the rooms showed major signs of wear and tear. Frayed carpeting, overly worn towels, stained and threadbare robes, obsolete entertainment system, scuff marks on walls and doors, loose tiles on walls of bathroom.For the very high prices that the City Club Hotel is charging I could have stayed in a more trendy hotel in a neighborhood that doesn't close down as early as that one does.At least now my colleagues and I know not to return, we shall try one of the newer, better located hotels which charge the same rates.	
Oct 9 2007 	Lovely beds	The standard of this hotel is very high for being New york. Nice beds, great minibar, professional staff. Housekeeping does a great job and will never miss a thing. Turndown service is also a pleasant treat.	
Oct 9 2007 	Cannot beat it!!	Second time ive stayed at this property and it just gets better everytime. The staff are the most helpful and gracious i have ever ecountered in NY. The rooms are spacious and extremeley clean. Beds are out of this world. Great location to everything will always make this my home when in Mahattan Keep it up City Club	
Oct 7 2007	Fantastic	We arrived at the hotel after a long flight and were immediatley greated by friendly and professional reception staff. As we were staying at the hotel for 5 days they had given us a room on the top floor with a balcony. Which was fantastic to have a bit of extra space. Plus as it was very warm whilst we were there it was lovely to sit out at night and in the mornings. The staff at the hotel were fantastic booking restaurants and cars for us. In regards to the rooms I was surprised as we booked a queen room which should have been around 295sq feet. The room was definatley smaller than I expected although it did'nt turn out to be a problem and we did have the added bonus of a roof terrace. The bed was comfortable and the room was cean and airy, i loved the bathrooms and all the amenities. However, I must say that I was very surprised for the price of the hotel that there was not a coffee or tea maker in the room. This was a big dissapointment and would definatley make me consider staying here again. I know it is only a small detail however, it is nice to have the choice of a hot drink when you get up in the morning. We were very happy with the hotel in all and found the location prefect for a sightseeing and shopping holiday in the city. Being only a short walk from 5th avenue and minutes from Grand central station it was fantastic. And if you stay you have to try the DB Bistro for dinner or room service. The burgers are amazing!	
May 30 2007 	Hated it! Too masculine and dark!	If a 'men's club' feel is what you're after, then I guess you'd like this place. However, as a woman traveling alone on business, it was quite a depressing place. First of all, it is not easy to find. The 'main entrance' consists of a single glass door squeezed between their restaurant and another hotel. The doorman at the Soffitel next door didn't even know where it was when I asked for directions. A corridor masquerades for a 'lobby' that leads to a dark black/brown tiny reception desk (my kitchen at home is bigger than this lobby). Only saw two staffers on entry and exit in the lobby. One at the desk and the other at the door. The corridors leading to the guest rooms are narrow and dark, with low lighting and dark walls and doors. Once inside the rooms are no better. Small rooms, low lighting, dark decor, dark brown tile on the floor, stark in furnishings. Very much a man's retreat. The bath was all dark brown granite, no tub - just a large open concept shower. Even the Bigelow toiletries were in dark brown bottles. Having forgotten my shampoo, I used the hotel provided one (Hermes) and now smell like I'm wearing men's cologne. The room had two old fashioned wooden paned windows on either side of the bed neither of which opened. However, you wouldn't have wanted them to open anyway since the glass was dirty with soot and both faced out to other similar old buildings whose windows were only about 10 feet away. The window coverings were only pull down shades that were a dirty beige (one of which had a huge patch of a different color right in the middle.) Given the horrible condition of the windows and the non-existent view, I kept the shades down the entire time. This only added to the dark depressing feeling of the room.The bed also faced directly toward the entry door and the TV was hidden behind some artwork, built into the wall beside the bed. You couldn't see the TV from bed without getting a crick in your neck, but had a clear view of the brown entry door. I would not recommend this hotel.	
May 18 2007	Great Hotel	I just got back from NYC and 3 nights at the City Club. I read the reviews on here before booking it, but made the res in spite of some decidedly negative reviews. I am glad I did because I absolutely enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again. The staff was very good overall--though some definitely more helpful than others. The cookies at turn down were great as was the location of the hotel. I was on a media tour and we were smack in the middle of everywhere we needed to be. My standard room was actually much larger than i was anticipating, as was the bathroom. The towels, bed and amenities were great. I love modern/contemporary design and felt the hotel was designed in great taste.My only minor complaints had to do with a fixed AC temp of 70 degrees, which was a little chilly for me, and a low-level of light. If you really wanted to get a lot of work or reading done in the room, you'd be stuck sitting on the bed or camped in the bathroom. Luckily that wasnt the case for me. Also the bathroom outlet was hard to find--I saw that another reviewer said there wasnt one--maybe they just couldnt find it (which isnt a good thing).One more note--i think some people are put off by the lack of a lobby. On the same block, there are many fancy hotels to have a drink and loiter in, and I actually enjoyed the fact that ours wasnt going to turn into party central. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and stay there again.	
May 12 2007 	Nice hotel	I enjoyed my stay at the City Club. It's a small, intimate place with a lot of personality. Feels like a private club. The location is very central, close to Bryant Park, Grand Central and Times Square. The City Club is right next to the Algonquin, the Iroquois, the Sofitel and the Royalton. There is no ostentatious sign outside so it's easy to miss it. The lobby is very small and more like the entrance of an upscale residence. My room was on the 4th floor and the size was decent. It was very clean and perfectly decorated, with a very upscale, masculine feel. The bathroom was very classy both in size, design (black marble) and for the top quality amenities (Hermes and Bigelow). I especially loved the shower. The hotel was quiet with a limited number of rooms and guests. All in all, I can't complain about anything. The price - though relatively high - was quite acceptable by New York standards. Business hotel chains may offer large rooms, but they can hardly match the classy, intimate atmosphere of the City Club. Would definitely return to the City Club.	
May 6 2007 	Great Hotel but some problems	I really likied this hotel and would consider staying there again. However, although the staff is very cordial and efficient, they are not very sophisticated and could use to stay on top of the latest happenings in NYC. Also, my room did not have any bathroom outlets, or a desk and chair, something that is standard at any Days Inn. Other than that, the hotel was cozy, quiet and substantially upscale, more like a private club than a hotel.	
Apr 25 2007 	Chic Style No Substance	The &quot;chic boutique&quot; hotel category was at first a welcome and refreshing change from stale corporate mega hotels and down -in- the- dumps road warrior outposts. Many of the first entrants really transformed the usual hotel stay into a wonderful and exciting getaway, with non-boring rooms and decor, interesting public spaces and, above all, above-the-ordinary levels of personal service.As the category grew however, style began to trump substance. Name-brand owner personalities mattered more than professional hospitality. Over-indulged interior decorators exercised their 'creative vision' while actual comfort and service were after thoughts. The City Club, sadly, falls into this latter description.The front desk staff are obviously chosen for their looks rather than for any particular talent in professional hospitality, so don't ask for anything out of the ordinary or have a problem that they can't immediately solve. In our case, the sheets one night of our stay caused a horrendous rash on both of us (neither of us has a tendency towards sensitive skin, by the way), but trying to get any action from the front desk or housekeeping was a painfully drawn out affair.The rooms themselves, while visually interesting at first, are impractical, with relatively few useful light sources, places to sit or hang one's clothing. In our case, the windows could not be opened, and perhaps it was just as well as they were filthy with dirt and cobwebs. Apparently the lovely staff don't stoop to actually clean.We ate in the restaurant adjacent to the hotel, one of a series run by celebrity (for those who care about such things) chef Daniel Boulud. One of the bragging points of the place is that he sells 'the most expensive hamburger in the world&quot;. Apparently this is a place for the pretty people to see and be seen by each other - there was a lot of posing going on there -- but the food was quite enjoyable so we just considered it part of the floor show.The hotel's location is very close to Times Square so that is great if you want that, but be aware that there's virtually no lobby or public area to greet visitors or wait for friends, and the front door opens out to a busy street without a turn-in for your cab, so it can be tough checking in and out with luggage. Your stylish and good looking porters won't exactly hustle, but they do sport little ear pieces to be in touch with the front desk, or at least look kinda cool.A one-time only visit for us.	
Apr 17 2007 	Mixed feelings this time	I've loved this hotel since it opened. Stayed here 3-4 times for a night or two. This time, came for almost a week and persuaded friends from L.A. who were also coming to NYC to stay at the City Club. The location can't be beat. The staff are friendly and always helpful. Housekeeping is excellent and thorough.But.....the bloom is off the rose. There was the elevator that didn't work one day and no one seemed to know why not; then the bathroom door that was off its track and no one could figure out how to get it back, so it required brute force to open and close; then the toilet that needs a new flapper valve so that it closes each time; and room service who decided &quot;you must have an old menu&quot; but wouldn't bring a current one upstairs (!).I still like this place. I like it a lot. But after the latest visit, I will check out other new places before automatically coming back here. The NYC hotel scene is highly competitive - at current rates, you've got to stay on top of your game! I hope the City Club management can kick it up a notch.	
Mar 25 2007	Great Spot	small trendy hotel with a nice feel to it..very comfortable beds, nice marble bath, contemporary /warm, not to far over the top.perfect mid town location. We had a second floor room and had no problem sleeping. nice staff..perfect for our needs.	
Mar 25 2007 	thrilled with this find	Very lovely, quiet, cool decor, great location. Spent 3 nights there with my sister and mother in one of their suites. our New York friends thought it was a great find. we were thrilled.	
Mar 22 2007 	stop that infernal racket	My stay in Manhattan could have been a much nicer one had i known about the construction going on here.I arrived late at night for a 2 night business trip. The construction started at 7 in the morning and continued until 7 at night.I don't know what I would have done had I been with my wife for a relaxing stay. As mine was for business, I had to get up early anyway. It still bothered me though that I wasn't informed about this inconvenience when I booked the room.The manager refunded some money back to me but it was too little too late.I would have preferred to stay elsewhere.	
Mar 13 2007 	Nice Hotel	I stayed at the city club for the first time in March. The small hotel is very nice, quite and has a feel of quality - the reception staff was delightful. The room was a little dark for working but high on design....the bath room was the best.Overal this was a great find in a city where it is sometimes had to sleep	
Feb 3 2007 	very nice room	The rooms at this hotel are very nice. Large marble bathrooms. Service is okay. Overall this is a quiet, nice place to stay.	
Feb 3 2007	What a mistake!	I travel regularly for business and always stay at The Sunset Tower when I'm in LA. I am always pleased with the service so I decided to give the sister property in New York a try. What a mistake. The hotel is no where near the level of The Sunset Tower. The rooms were ok, but the service was terrible. Clearly the management of the hotel needs to be re-evaluated. The staff seemed clueless and no one was eager to please at all. When I'm travelling I am generally stressed and don't feel like dealing with incompetence. There was confusion at check in and I was downgraded to a room that supposedly had a queen sized bed, though I can't say I believe it was. Room service was a disaster. I kept being transferred between the restaurant and the front desk, with no one wanting to actually take my order. Like I said, I'm a frequent traveler so I understand that things can go wrong, but this hotel was just not up to my standards. I won't be staying there in the future, nor will I reccomend it to anyone else. I'm hoping that The Sunset Tower keeps it's standards a bit higher and doesn't follow suit and become a mess like the City Club!	
Jan 23 2007	Private Classy Intimate Great Service	My experience started with my reservation which I made via the phone; the reservationist allowed me to use a web rate which was accommodating. I arrived 3 hours before check-in to find out that my upgraded room was ready. (From a petite to a Queen Luxe.) Room size was fine, especially for nyc. The bathroom was a treat. Lots of mirrors, but not tacky. Only complaint was that the lighting could have been better for make-up application. Excellent bath amenities; Hermes shampoo &amp; conditioner and CO Bigelow soaps and lotion. Shower was fabulous. Bed was very comfortable. iPod docking station/clock didn't work, but that was remedied within 5 minutes. Cd/Dvd library is a nice feature, but not a great selection and almost everything I wanted was out of stock; it seemed like they did not have duplicates. The best part of my stay was the service. I was greeted by every staff member I passed. I work in a hotel in guest services, so I'm very picky about this aspect of my stay. Everything I needed or asked for was taken care of promptly. Entire feel of the hotel was intimate and cozy and a nice respite from the pace of Manhatten. Great Location too!	
Jan 18 2007 	Wonderful Christmas stay at the City Club!	My husband and I spent six days at the City Club celebrating our wedding anniversary. It was the week before Christmas and we were looking for an intimate, centrally-located hotel which would give us easy access to all the holiday sights of Manhattan. As it turned out, we were delighted with our choice and would definitely stay here again. For a start, we were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room (second floor facing the street) - we entertained six people for drinks with no difficulty whatsoever. Comfortable bed and furniture - great bathroom with excellent products and wonderful shower. (I missed having a bathtub, but apparently there are some rooms that do.) Maid service was thorough and reliable - they leave huge and delicious chocolate chip cookies as part of their &quot;turn-down&quot; routine - a mixed blessing if you've just had an enormous dinner!However, what really set this trip apart was the charming and helpful staff. It seemed as if nothing was too much trouble for any of them, and every request - tickets, a cab, a dinner reservation, directions, info. about skating, shopping etc. etc. - was handled efficiently with a smile. We never had to wait for help at the front desk, which can sometimes be a problem in larger hotels - and people like David and Juliette (?) started to feel almost like friends by the end of the week.As with any hotel, there were some minor negatives - the lobby is very small, and waiting there would be a problem as there's nowhere to sit. The room could definitely do with more storage ( and there's no point in having an &quot;invisible&quot; closet door that won't stay closed!) Some reviews mentioned the lack of lighting in the bathroom, but there is in fact a less-than-obvious dimmer switch - maybe a small discreetly-placed sign would help.All in all , we had a fabulous time. Thank you, City Club, for making our special trip one to remember- we'll be back!	
Jan 9 2007 	Nice room. Weak service.	We stayed at the City Club Hotel for a four night vacation over the long weekend. I am an experienced traveller, having been around the world for business and pleasure staying in a variety of accomodations (this was my 3rd stay in NYC). The purpose of our trip was a vacation, and for that the hotel's location was ideal, although 44th and 5/6th proved to be a mighty busy intersection. FYI - The street in front of the hotel is the marshalling area for parades on 5th ave.The check-in at the hotel was uneventful and efficient, as it should be. We were checked into the 2nd floor, 202, which was facing the street (more on that later). The stairs were inconveniently located and rather creepy, so we used the elevators (no problems there).The king room was large, clean, and just really nice in general, with a really huge plasma TV on the wall (no mirror-setup that other reviews have complained about). It really is a comfortable room. The king mattress was sub-par compared to similar class hotels that I have stayed at. Specifically, the mattress felt old, and the bedding had a distinct, albeit faint, odour of curry (nice on my dinner-plate, not so nice in my bed). The bathroom was perfect, except for a door that would not close. The scuffing on the floor was evidence that this was not a new problem, and indicative of a poor maintanence budget in the hotel (or simply a lack of caring)? The shower curtain was clear plastic, for those of you who like to view yourself in the wall-sized mirror while you shower. Some positive features - free wireless internet (speed was best I've seen for a hotel), and the housekeeping was excellent.Overall noise levels at night were indeed quite high. The street noise was beyond tolerable levels on Thursday night, as the windows/walls had very little soundproofing capability. I live in a busy city street myself, and am quite accostomed to sleeping with sirens, car honking, etc., but this was quite bad. Everything from the Friday morning garbage pick-up, to the taxi honking. A visitor from the midwest suburbs would probably remain sleepless. A city dweller would not care so much.The desk staff were useless (not to be confused with the very helpful doormen). Keep in mind that we have high expectations for a hotel on this level. Plain and simple the skillsets they displayed are not on par with either the room price, the claims put forth by the hotel, or the previous reviews on this website (fakes?). First test: I called the day before our arrival to make a simple request that flowers be in our room for our arrival and cost added to my bill. &quot;Jonathan&quot; assured me this was a piece of cake, and would be taken care of. Strike one - no flowers, no apologies, no nothing. Next, we attempted to procure some advice from the desk on nightlife options. Wow, they looked like we asked them for directions to Mars. They were lame, and unprepared for standard service requests throughout the stay. Strike two and three. Bottom line - this hotel desperately needs a concierge. Or retraining for exisiting staff.I think it's only pretending to be a full service hotel. They've made their money, and now it's not worth their effort to maintain, because people like me keep showing up and giving them money. At check-out, the staff did not even ask us if we had any comments, so it's clear that they are not interested in pleasing their customers. That said, the room was great and the location was terrific. So if you are willing to pay the money and get zero from the staff, or maybe you are a business traveller, then you might give this a 5 star rating.	
Jan 2 2007 	A New Years To Remember	My partner was eager to spend New Year's Eve in New York, and I (reluctantly) agreed. All I could picture were crowds, noise and tacky &quot;2007&quot; sunglasses. We made our reservation a few weeks prior and got a reasonable rate. The Hotel is close to Times Square, but we decided to brave it and drive in. Surprisingly enough I recieved a phone call from an employee at City Club two days prior to our arrival informing us of the street closures in and around Times Square. She was very pleasant, suggesting that if we were driving to leave early- not something I would expect from a NYC &quot;boutique&quot; hotel. She even offered directions from New Jersey by train if we decided against taking the car! I must admit, this was a nice gesture. We arrived at City Club and were greeted by the bellman at the curb. The check in was quick and the staff offered assistance with dinner reservations and some suggestions on what was going on around town. We had already had made reservations, so declined their assistance. before we knew it we were upstairs in our room- which was wonderfully appointed, clean, and comfortable in size. The water pressure in the shower was amazing- the beds very comfortable and the service impressive. I felt like I was part of the family right away! Though our dinner reservations were not the best choice for us (maybe we should've taken the offer for help at check-in) our stay at City Club was great! I've already recommended it to my friends and will stay again. And the best part was we didn't even feel like we were near Times Square!	
Dec 26 2006 	Remarakable Hotel	My (newly) fiancé and I just returned from our 3 night stay at City Club Hotel. We booked one of their Grand Duplex Suites, which in my opinion is an understatement. Our room was beyond words.The hotel is located on the north-side of 44th St. between 5th and 6th Ave. It is also sandwiched between the Algonquin and Iroquois Hotels, and across from the &quot;famous&quot; Royalton. The doorman Ray showed us up to the room and gave us a brief overview of how everything works in the room. We walked in to the perfectly dimmed room with smooth jazz Christmas carols playing all throughout the suite. The spiral staircase to the bedroom instantly grabs your eyes. Once you look beyond that you see the giant floor to ceiling windows with a door that leads to your own private terrace that overlooks 44th st. To the left is toward 5th ave, to the right is Times Square, which is literally 1.5 blocks or a 2-5 minute walk. Once we got done talking in the sights, sounds, and smells of the city we ran upstairs to check out the bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom is partitioned only by a glass railing that allows you to look outside as well as downstairs. The bed is extremely comfortable, especially after an exhausting day of walking all over the city. The bath has a lot of charm as well. I didn't think that I'd like the chocolate marble, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it in person. It really bring an elegant look to the bath. The shower isn't very wide, but could comfortably fit two.There is also an automated privacy shade that cover the entire length of the floor to ceiling windows.They offer a breakfast as room service or available for dine-in at the db Bistro Moderne for $13.95. We never got a chance to check it out but there is a great place a few doors down, toward 6th Ave and Times Square, called The Red Flame, which has great food, service and prices!If you are looking for a place to unwind and have a few drinks be sure to check out O'Lunney's. It's on 45th St. between 6th &amp; 7th Ave. Paul the bartender is funny and keeps you on your toes.One night we went over to the bar at the Royalton and it was about as expected, a hipster bar, with hipster prices. O'Lunney's is 2 for 1 for the money compared to the Royalton. Overall, my experience with the City Club was amazing. The entire staff was amazing and extremely helpful.My only complaint was that the downstairs TV didn't work initially. I called the front desk and they immediately sent someone to fix it. We then found that the remote didn't work and was missing a battery, however when the bellman came up with the battery, the remote still didn't work. The bellman must had left and came back 3-4 times trying to fix the remote before finally getting frustrated and giving up. Ultimately it never got fixed, but we were OK with that because we would rather enjoy listening to the soft jazz over the TV.	
Dec 20 2006	Best Kept Secret	To end our Honeymoon that took us to Grand Cayman Island and Miami, my wife and I checked into the City Club. To best describe the hotel, I'll describe it's neighbors. Across the street is The Royalton, an Ian Schreggar property that is consistent with the quazi-club feeling of the lobby, complete with ample seating, hip crowd, and drink service. A few doors down, The Sofitel guardian of the epi-european inspired lodging experience. If you are can't envision the feeling of the City Club, make note that this block also includes the Harvard Club, Yacht Club, New York Bar Association, and Princeton Club. OK....now you're getting it. The most priveledged little street in NY, with it's requisite understatement. The City Club has amazingly taken in all of these accounts as its' own. It's non-descript signage ( a visiting friend couldn't find it having walked past the entrance twice) and cozy loby with a front desk that should only accomodate one, but always seemed to hold three-ready to accomodate staffers, give the feeling of a very private place to be. Yet, don't think heavy wooden beams and shelving, and superflous cabinetry. Rather the design of City Club is neat, soft, and airy. It seems to have the cool feel of the Royalton, just not the space. It soon becomes evident that this is by design. I booked our room directly through the company site, and indicated that this was our honeymoon. We were given a wonderful room overlooking 44th St. which easily was the most lodging space I've ever experienced in Manhattan. The design while efficent is not actually modern, but more transitional. Cool guy features include Ipod Docking alarm clock, a television that shows through wall mirror, and the ultimate answer to in-room entertainment, a complimentary list of DVD's to be delivered from the front desk. A courtesy bottle of wine and cookies awaited us in our room. We quickly felt torn between exploring the city or soaking up this unique experience. We decided to go walk-about, which is the second reason to stay here. Cool things are steps ahead. We did take a drink at the Royalton which confirmed our suspcicions great place for cocktails, probably not a place to lay your head. We attempted to hang at the Sofitel, but the place seemed to be oover run with families, and fuddy duddies. Of course neither group is bad except if you're looking to kick it in NY to round out your honeymoon. OK back to the City Club....we decided to go in and reqroup. We saw our favorite bellman. A breif aside explains why. We drove up to NY from DC in our White Yukon Denali. Upon arriving at the Hotel, while my wife remained in the truck I got the attention of the bellman, and explained that we were checking in, needed help with baggage, and inquired about valet parking. However, each of my requests seemed to be a slight disconnect for him. After asking if all of the luggage needed to be collected, he informed me that I could park in front of the door. Which if you know NY is the craziest thing ever suggested. While he showed my now disembarking wife to the room, and managed the bags, another staffer said nothing about parking on the street, but directed me to a garage, and even held traffic so I could make the manuever. When I arrived to our room, my wife was laughing with tears in her eyes. Apparently, my odd interaction with the bellman was because he thought she was a celebrity and I was her driver. Apparently, Yukons are now the fleet of the chic, my all black outfit appeared more uniform then stylish, and her waiting in the truck with sunglasses and fur coat all communicated something different to someone who obviously has gotten used to a very different clientle. We got the biggest kick out of it, and shared laughs with the staff about our new found celebrity for the rest of our visit. If there is an achilles heel for this place it is only that room service appears to come from a diner a few doors down the street. In winter this almost gurantees that your food can not be piping hot. Although, since it i s adiner it seems almost any request can be satisfied. I know this isn't a traditional hotel review, about towels, and high speed internet, but that's because this is not a traditonal hotel. It's a place that serves as base of operations for hanging in the city, and returning to a quiet, comfortable, and upscale environment to recharge your batteries only to do it all over again. Cheers	
Dec 2 2006 	Great stay at the City Club	I was going for an overnight trip to New York and knew that I would not be spending much time in my room. So, I was looking for a nice, stylish hotel in a good location at a good price. I managed to snag a $200 rate from Quikbook for a &quot;petite&quot; room and it was perfect for my needs. The room was small - not much bigger than the double bed - but I expected that. It was beautifully appointed and stylishly decorated. TV, DVD player, mini-bar tucked away. The marble-clad bathroom was very nice with plenty of towels and Hermes products. There were even a couple of fresh chocolate chip cookies at the end of the day. And the NY Times at my door in the morning. The room might be tight for 2 people and it would be too small if I was staying for a few days. But there are larger rooms that are very nice - I looked in one as I went down the hallway. My only complaint is that the tile in the hallway echoes any footsteps that go by your door. It's not a big deal, but carpeting would deaden the noise. The reception and doormen were friendly and helpful. The lobby is small and connects to the well-rated DB Moderne restaurant, where meals can be taken. I'm a pretty tough critic of hotels, but I would stayat the City Club again.	
Nov 19 2006 	really disappointing hotel	We stayed for just three nights and was so glad it was only three! The place was dark and dingy - no hermes bath products or frette linens to be seen. We had to wait over an hour for our room on arrival and there is really nowhere comfortable to sit and we then found that there were no twin beds and they really did nothing to sort ouf this situation and we ended up in a tiny room, despite them saying they would do something the next day, nothing happened. On the last morning, the hot water went wrong and we had to wait over an hour for a shower. Absolutely terrible. The only good thing is the location.	
Nov 19 2006 	Booking problems and poor staff training at the City Club	Problems started early with our booking at the City Club. My wife tried to book online for our stay for two nights in a Queen Luxe. She called to book the rate available from the website, but was told that the rate is only available for booking via the Internet otherwise its was a hundred dollars more in total. At her request, I visited the website to make a reservation. However to my surprise, the website was not secured (read encrypted) so that my credit card number was going over the open internet. I called the hotel again and they told me that they didn't have encryption on their website (see the padlock in the bottom of the browser window). I asked the reservationist to take my booking over the telephone, but she refused to give me the lower rate.	
Oct 24 2006 	Loved it!!	Recently stayed at the City Club for four nights. Wonderful stay! We were upgraded to a King and found the rooms to be very clean and comfortable.Loved the dark colors, the privacy, the cookies on our pillows every night! The staff were curteous. Location in midtown perfect for theatre, proximity to Times Square, and easy access to the subway to other parts of town.Would absolutely stay here again anytime!	
Aug 21 2006	Problem with Booking Online	We booked a stay at the City Club for mid-July 2006. We booked the reservation on the hotel's website and thought we booked a queen-sized room. When we arrived, and despite the email confirmation I received and had with me, the hotel informed us that the only available room was a petite room, which was a full bed in a room that would have been better as a janitor's closet because it was so small. Although the bathroom was lovely, my husband and I barely fit in the room together. The TV was not a flat screen, but rather a 19 inch regular old TV. What a disappointment. We were told that the hotel's computerized booking system erred and resulted in us booking the wrong room. To his credit, the hotel manager tried to find us a room at another nearby hotel, but apparently they were sold out as well. The manager then discounted our rate, gave us a bottle of wine and free breakfast for the two mornings of our stay. The only reason I would stay here again is that the manager kept in email contact with me (I preferred email -- he offered to call instead) regarding our room and was quite helpful. The room, however, was so small and the bed so uncomfortable, that next time, rather than take the chance of this type of error happening again, I'd probably stay at the sort of big hotel I was trying to avoid in the first place.	
Jul 17 2006	Stylish Little Gem	If you're looking for a stylish small hotel, and are more of an Armani than Versace person, then look no further. My husband and I have had the good fortune to stay in some amazing hotels around the world - from country houses, to trendy boutiques, to spot on large hotels like The Mandarin Oriental and The Four Seasons. The style of City Club is low key and I say this as a compliment. Its a small, unassuming hotel, offering excellent service and a perfect place to rest your head in chic comfort. Location wise its on a fairly quiet street perfect for Midtown, 5th Avenue, Central Park and Times Square - for venturing further we never had more than a minute wait in hailing a cab. What makes the service stand apart from many other trendy hotels is that it did feel personal ....... returning after a long, hot day (and many a late evening!) of exploring this ever changing city, it felt unusual and uplifting to be recognised and acknowledged as guests of the hotel and for our day to be enquired of by the staff. The guys at City Club are just spot on ....happy for a start, welcoming, courteous, and extremely willing to offer suggestions and recommendations. The only downside of writing this review is that it means our holiday is now over and i'm back in Ol' Blightly .... I could have quite easily of taken up residence.	
Jul 4 2006	Nice Small Package	We enjoyed our stay at The City Club Hotel during our last visit. However, we found that the rooms were very small, the air condition was rather noisy and it could do with brighter lightings. Just a word of reminder for those who are planning to made reservations to ensure that you have a print out of their confirmation with the description of the room. We were promised a room with a day bed but upon arrival, we were assigned a room without the said day bed. Upon entering, I immediately noticed the noisy air con and the missing day bed. The receptionist was kind enough to reassign another room according to the description on my confirmation after I raised my concerns. The new room was obviously bigger (but still small) and the aircon is a little quiter (but still not the silent type that I would expect from a hotel of this grade).Aside from the Hermes amenities, the bath room was surprisingly spacious.	
Jun 20 2006	Highly Recommend City Club	My fiance and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the City Club Hotel. This is a unique alternative to the more mainstream name-brand hotels out there. Very quaint, modern decor, although some rooms were a bit small, it really provides all that is needed. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable place to lay your head at night, this is a great place. The bed was very comfortable. The 2nd floor provides a comfortable, quiet space to spread out...with internet access. The location is one of the best. Just a block or two from 5th Avenue and high end shopping, with a short cab ride to the south into Greenwich Village area. It really is a very central location, and is removed from the craziness of Times Square. It's actually a very quiet street. The staff were very friendly and accomadating and provided information on what to do and where to go. It's small enough that they actually recognize you after a day and greet you with a warm smile upon entering to retire for the night. That was really nice, something you don't get with a larger hotel group. Continental breakfast was provided every morning, which was also very sufficient. Would definitely return here again in the future.	
May 31 2006	Noisy Design; Lousy Front Desk Staff	I checked into the room and immediately questioned whether the room was the one I reserved (and was paying for). I had to show the bellman (all of whom were very nice) a printed reservation to convince him it was the wrong room. So I was put into another room only to have another guest try to enter the room a little while later as the front desk assigned him the same room.The toilet was not working when I arrived. I removed the top and reconnected it, which made it work, although the flusher was pretty much hanging from a thread the whole time. (I didn't tell the desk about this until I checked out since I had already been through the rigamarole at the beginning.) I was supposed to have 3 free breakfasts with my 3 room nights but I wasn't told anything about this upon check-in. I had to ask the front desk clerk about it later and after some checking, he realized I was correct. He said I would have to try to convince the restaurant host not to charge my room for the breakfasts because they weren't used to not charging the room. Despite my trying to convince the restaurant staff not to put the breakfasts on the bill, they did, and I had to work that out again with the front desk staff when I checked out. Oh, also, there wasn't even a breakfast available on the third morning as the kitchen was closed. I mentioned all of this to the front-desk staff upon checking out and they did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation aside from removing the two breakfasts from the bill. (There wasn't even any refunding for the lost breakfast.)Lastly, the hotel has some fundamental design problems in terms of noise mitigation. The hotel is dormitory-like in terms of the way sound carries. That is due to the fact that there are no carpets anywhere (or other sound-abatement tools), and also because the doors all slam very loudly. This may not apply to the suites as the rooms are probably set back from the hall, but for most of the (very small) rooms, the beds are not far from the loud hallway, so if you are anything but a very, very deep sleeper, you will hear late night folks in the hall and returning to their rooms.In short, the trendy design and friendly bellmen could not make up for an otherwise poor experience, and the front desk did not seem too concerned.	
May 27 2006 	Never again	Found of Boutique Hotels this one makes me wonder if I should not forget about BH in the future....For 305 USD you get a room the size of...your bed, staff look at you as if you were coming from a different planet when you complain about it, and have nothing to say. Tough luck you are in a Boutique Hotel where you cannot open your suitcase as there is no space, you cannot work as there is no desk.Does not help much in giving a good name to Boutique Hotels, there should be an industry standard so that not everybody can abuse this name. Next time any other Hotel will do but this one never again	
Apr 21 2006	Great one week stay at the hotel!	I spent 7 nights there last Easter with my family. We had a family suite which consists on a queen and king rooms at the end of the corridor connected by a door that closes allowing the rooms to gain a spacious foyer. Our stay there was excellent, both the staff at reception and at the door were young and very helpful and attentive.We found the rooms to be a decent size for a family of 5 adults, nicely appointed with some well thought details. We had a double bed in each room as well as a daybed (the one in the king bedroom was a bit tight so we used the one in the queen room); it was made everyday, as opposed to what someone said in a previous post. The location on 44th between 5th and 6th, right opposite the Royalton can' t be beat.I strongly recommend it and would definetly return if we can book a similar rate.	
Mar 14 2006	Sophisticated and Classy Little Hotel Tucked Away	Our stay in this boutique hotel was perfect from start to finish. Sleek, but cozy room. Spacious marble bathroom with oversized glass shower was beautifully appointed. Everything looked squeaky clean and fresh. Bed was comfy, and the staff was gracious and attentive. Though tucked away on a quiet street, it is only a short walk to the theatre district, and convenient for traveling about the city. The windows in the room even opened! Five star restaurant in-house was a surprise bonus.	
Mar 12 2006	Great place to stay in the middle of everything!	Five (40 something) adults stayed in the family suite for one night. There was a queen and daybed in one room and a king and daybed in the other room. Each room had a very nice shower or combo bath/shower. One bathroom had a very large shower and a bidet in the bathroom. Very nice decor. The beds were extremely comfortable with featherbed toppers. Guest robes were provided, full size hair dryer, Hermes toiletries and even a little jar of cotton balls and cotton swabs. The 2 rooms became a suite by opening room doors and closing a common door in the hallway. The rooms were very small. Just walking room around the beds, but you're not going to New York to hang out in the room all day. The staff was extremely attentive and responded immediately to requests. We got a great price, $399, through express-res. The rooms were very clean and in good shape. Nice sound system in the room with a dvd player and complementary movies. TV was kind of odd, as it was placed behind the mirror. There was some glare when the lights were on in the room but it was still pretty viewable. Overall we were very satisfied and would definitely stay again!	
Mar 4 2006 	Tiny lovely jewel with amazing service	I usually stay higher up in midtown but due to the crazy prices in NY these days, booked at the City Club Hotel for $255/night on quikbook. This price point is very good value for what you get considering other available rates at other hotels. The most remarkably good point was the service. The bell- and doormen were all young-ish men (not so much the groomed and plucked Calvin Klein ad types with attitude that you find at, say, the Mondrian in LA, but more Gap-ad types -- but with none of the immaturity) and I was floored and amazed at how professional and helpful they all were. How have they made people this young so professional?? I would really like to know. They grabbed a cab for me and pre-loaded my luggage in the cab without my having to ask for assistance. They were energetic and &quot;hop-to-it,&quot; an unusual quality in a city and profession where it's easy to present an exhausted or weary demeanor. The front desk is also run by a very professional gentleman. When I checked in the night staff presented me with an Internet password automatically.Of course, I started off with a good experience, because I was upgraded to a large king room from a queen deluxe. I would pay between $250 to $300 for a room of this type, but probably not above $300. The Hermes amenities are delectable and really set the City Club apart from other hotels. I was at first a little put off by the thick plastic sheet that serves as a shower curtain, but subsequently realized how functional it is -- it really serves to keep steam in the tub area and creates a lovely little sauna effect. I thought that was extremely well-considered and designed. The bathroom in the king room is quite large. Free internet is lovely. I thought the projection TV behind the 2 way mirror was also a thoughtfully designed space saving touch (although I couldn't get the thing to work after my gracious bellman Paul demo'd it for me). True that the fake cork stick-um tiles are a bit off putting and the closet is miniature, even in the king room. The elevator smelled positively rank/dank. But for $250-$300/night for this size of room, I had a lovely experience and would definitely return.	
Mar 3 2006 	Tiniest hotel room I've ever seen...seriously	This was the smallest hotel room I've ever seen in the U.S. Stayed there on business last fall and wasn't really impressed for the price.The only upside was the in-room snacks - Dean &amp; Deluca.	
Feb 9 2006	Mediorcre at best	Quality and room size should be better for the price.	
Feb 3 2006	pretty good!	we (3 people) stayed in one of their duplex suites. the suites were gorgeous....2 floors, with a living room and 1/2 bath downstairs, and a bedroom/loft with a great big full bathroom on the 2nd floor. the only problem: temperature control. on the lower level of the duplex, the temperature was fine, and that's where the thermostat was. upstairs, though, it was sweltering hot, like a sauna, even though the balcony window was open and the 40 degree outside air was blowing in. the upstairs doesn't have its own temperature control, so the bathroom and the bedroom was just unbearably hot. for $1000 a night (with tax, etc.), i'd like at least the temperature in the room to be bearable. the minibar was well stocked, and the toiletries were nice, but the temperature control wasn't. and, we were a bit loud, and had complaints from the neighboring rooms....but, we could hear them too and we didn't complain. the walls are a bit thin (or, at least, not thick enough...you'd think there'd be better sound proofing). the room service was adequate, though over-priced. staff was friendly and helpful. don't think i'd stay again. for the price, i'd rather get two big rooms across the street at the royalton.	
Jan 4 2006	NOT BAD...BUT A BIT OVERRATED	Just returned from three nights at the City Club. I find it difficult to believe that this hotel is ranked #74 on tripadvisor.com out of over 300 hotels in Manhattan. I guess there are City Club moles on this site voting for their hotel.The bathroom was a good size with wall to wall brown marble. Hermes bath products are a cheap grade found in most Marriott Courtyards. The shower was large enough for a small orgy but was the same level as the bathroom floor so there was water spillage outside the shower and into the room.There are touches throughout the hotel to evoke a boutique and trendy feel, however most of it was done on the cheap. Overall, it feels like an old building with a dimestore makeover. Laminated cork floors show wear after only four years, chipped paint, pealing wallpaper, dim lighting to hide the flaws. Mattresses feel old but are covered with a nice featherbed and decent linens.Staff was good at providing restaurant and nightlife recommendations and went out of their way to do so. Midtown Location is good on W. 44th street between 5th and 6th Aves. I'm not an expert on NYC hotels but $350+/night for this hotel outside of New Years is not a good value when you have the Regency and SOHO Grand available for $30-$50 more per night.	
Dec 30 2005	Terrible Service !!!	Just back from 4 days at the City Club. First off, I must admit that I am terribly fussy, so you may wish to consider that when reading this review. I traveled extensively and have been to New York several times. I love the feel of a smaller property and realize the amenities will not be as extensive as in a larger property i.e. swimming pool, spa, etc.Had a king room with a bath. Nice decor, the daybed is a really nice touch. The room was cozy, which is typical of New York. Not a great deal of room to maneuver, which I suppose is the product of the king size bed. Storage is at a minimum, which came into play with the winter clothing. Room is nicely equipped; dvd/cd player, IPOD audio system (at least in the room I was in), large bathroom. I'd give the &quot;Television cleverly hidden behind mirrors&quot; a miss if possible because the glare from the lamps makes viewing virtually impossible. Like noted in other reviews, the common areas and rooms are looking a little worn;cork flooring with big gouges from dropped items, tiles peeling off ceiling and elevator,wall paper peeling off the walls These are minor irritations at best, but they do diminish the overall look and feel of the property.However, the real problem was the service. Staff seemed to be far more interested in posing rather than being of any real service. Upon check in, there was no one to greet us, and no bellman to be found. Taxi driver helped with our luggage in the rain. Front desk really couldn't be bothered explaining the features of the property. Limited knowledge of restaurants in the city, always seemed the person I spoke to had to &quot;ask someone else&quot; for information.Best of all, on our final day when we were trying to flag a taxi down, which was extremely difficult because of the rain. Finally the doorman from the hotel next door grabbed an umbrella and helped us, while our bellman (no real doorman at the City Club) stood inside and watched the whole thing ! Guess he didn't feel the need to get his ultra cool City Club toque wet.Overall the hotel is okay; great location, and the restaurant, DB Bistro Moderne is excellent. Generally speaking what usually sets smaller properties apart is the personalized service, and it just wasn't there. This is made all too glaringly obvious because there are essentially 4 other hotels right next door. Next time, I'll give the Sofitel a try !	
Dec 19 2005	Great find	I stayed with my girlfriend Dec 15-18 in this excellent little hotel. I stumbled onto this hotel while reviewing my options with better hotels or so I thought. Apparently every hotel in New York has raised its nightly prices and I wasn't about to pay 500 plus a night at The Drake where I normally stay for in the 200 reigion. We go out often when we stay here and I wanted to stay closer to the meat packing district (MPD). I don't mind paying top dollar for a good hotel but in New York if you haven't been to the hotel your staying in odds are high pricing doesn't equal high quality. This hotel just happened to appear on my search for hotels in the West Village/MPD and I'm glad it did. It's located in the thearter district between Time square and Fifth Ave., but you don't get heavy pedestrian traffic from either. The prior reivews were on the money. The hotel is clean, staff friendly and rooms were comfortable. Luxe Queen was great for 295/night. Only inconvinience was the closet space but we worked around that. The restaurant down stairs DB is excellent for the pallet. I'll would stay here again but since we always eat and handout at the village/Tribeca/MPD area, I am more inclined to stay at a closer hotel like the Maritime. Over all good times, good times.	
Dec 19 2005	A Real Dump	This hotel bills itself as a timelessly elegant boutique hotel. In reality, it is a poorly-cared for badly maintained property.NEGATIVES:- The hotel has a very &quot;cheap&quot; feel to it.- Ridiculously small rooms, even by New York standards.- Dirty, stained carpeting.- Lumpy bed which felt 20 years old.- &quot;Cork&quot; walls and flooring, which are actually rubber stick-on &quot;tiles&quot; -- same as you buy at hime depot for $1.99. I saw these tiles peeling off in my room and elsewhere in the hotel.- View from room was basically an alley/brick wall.- No central a/c. Lousey, noisey window unit hanging out over dirty alley. - Halls dark and unfinished areas covered by black hanging cloth...Tries to evoke a tendy look, but actually looks more like what you would see in a high school gym for a Halloween carnival.- Price- $450+ per night. Just outrageous for this crappy little hotel, with small dank rooms.- Had to stand on bed to get into &quot;closet&quot;.POSITIVES: (Not many)- Decent bathroom with good Hermes toiletries.- Location- Free internet access.- Good on-site restaurant.	
Nov 21 2005	Early check in - late check out	Fantastic,Loved this hotel. More inclined to stay in Greenwich, Soho etc when in New York but needed to be midtown for a night last week.They were extremely helpful - allowing me to check in very early and allowing late checkout next day. Hotel was gorgeous, room spacious (we were upgraded from queen to king size). Beautiful large bath room with window. Very large, comfortable bed.Booked on lastminute for a reasonable enough price by New york standards.Front of house were extremely professional and helpful	
Nov 17 2005	Petite well-designed room	I reserved a &quot;Petite one full-bed room&quot; and so was prepared for a &quot;petite&quot; room with a brick wall view, which is what I got. There truly was just room for a double bed and one bed-side table. (Deep, built-in shelves gave you some storage space and also housed TV and CD player.) That being said, I loved the crisp modern design, and perversely, enjoyed the cosiness of the small but well-designed space. With the tans and beiges, as well as dark cork floors and dark brown marble in the bathroom, I felt like I was staying in a little chocolate box. The Italian sheets were THE most comfortable I have ever encountered in a hotel. The bathroom, too, was small, but had a nice marble shower (my partner admired a large fossilized shell) and Hermes toiletries. I think the lack of natural light would be a negative on a long stay, but for one night it was negligible. I did get a laugh out of seeing the New York Post outside my door in the morning. The lobby staff was friendly and unpretentious. I would have completely balked at the price last year, but that's what the prices are in NY right now. The block is nice and the location is very convenient to subways and most parts of the city.	
Nov 10 2005	Great Stay	Had a great experience here. We came in on the red-eye and couldn't check in right away but they stored our bags for us and when we came back at 11:00am, they had a king room for us (upgraded from queen room). It had a lovely full bath and the room was just right. The bed was completely comfortable with great pillows and the room was very nice and clean. Even had turn down service both nights. Would highly recommend this hotel!	
Nov 4 2005	Great Hotel	I was so impressed with the city club hotel, I plan on staying there everytime I return to NYC. The rooms are beautiful. The location is perfect and the staff is very accomadating. The new Ipod docking station/alarm clock was also a nice touch so I can listen to all my music through the high end speakers the hotel provides. I would highly reccomend the city club hotel to all NYC travelers	
Sep 14 2005	okay but some problems	We were not impressed with the hotel. Common areas needed to be refreshed. The entrance to the hotel and the hallways hold an unpleasant scent from the street where there is currently a good deal of construction which creates dirt, grime and odors.I would imagine this hotel was quite nice when Mr. Klein opened it in 2001.We wish we had visited when it was &quot;new&quot;.Our room on the second floor was tiny but clean. The decor is tailored and chic, however there is evidence of wear and tear which should be addressed. We would not go back.	
Aug 31 2005	Ok-not great	Location is good if you want midtown west but busy block &amp; construction across street. King rooms facing front are decent size but there are no dressers and very tiny closets. Linens ok but bed uncomfortable. Good shower &amp; toiletries but smallish bathroom, dark walls &amp; floor so lighting not great for women &amp; no tub. Hotel itself small &amp; quiet. No lobby to speak of so no where to sit or have guests sit if they arewaiting for you. Front desk personnel so-so. Tried to charge us more money for 3rd night of stay than contracted for  luckily we had our confirmation from booking service.Was initially put in room on floor 2  asked for room on higher floor  was told there were none. Room on 2nd floor had about 2 inches of hanging closet space &amp; it was front to back not side to side &amp; bar was over mini-fridge so no room to hang anything long. Also no drawers or dresser in room.Told front desk this was ridiculous  that we were 2 people in NYC for 4 days &amp; needed more space to unpack &amp; put away our clothes. We were going to go to another hotel as this was completely unacceptable.Miraculously a room on Floor 5 became available and it had a decent size closet with a built in dresser and some shelves which made it manageable.Allowed early check-in/late check-out which was nice. Usually stay at The Benjamin but wanted to be more &quot;West&quot; this trip. Will go back to The Benjamin next visit.	
Jun 1 2005	An amazing chic hotel.	Just returned from a 4 night stay at the City Club Hotel and I don't have a bad word to say about it .... in fact it was THE best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. The entire place is the ultimate in chic and trendy living from the gorgeous rooms to the discreat entrance &amp; lobby and last but not least the very helpful and pleasent staff. The location of the hotel is fab if you are looking for a central base in NYC. Times Square is only minutes away (if you like that sort of thing) but best of all, 5th Ave is even closer. The hotel staff were great and recommended fab bars/clubs in the trendy Meatpacking District and Soho .... just the kind of place me and my boyfriend were looking for. All the little extra's really make you feel like a star from the Hemes bath products, City Club umbrellas in your room to the daily weather forecasts and chocolates that are delivered to your room every evening. Not forgetting the cool TV behind the miror idea. The rooms were even better than I imagined. We booked a king size delux room and we certainly weren't disappointed. Plenty room for 2 people with a large closet and gorgeous sitting area. All done in the chic and trendy feel of the hotel. Surprisingly a chic and trendy room also meant comfortable .... uncommon in most modern hotels. The bath rooms where just incredible and huge with plenty of lighting and mirrors. Me and my boyfriend absolutly loved the City Club hotel and will certainly be returning on our next visit to NYC. Choose this hotel and you won't be disappointed.	
May 27 2005	An amazing trip at The City Club.	Recently a friend and I stayed at the City Club Hotel on our first trip to the Big Apple. We had a wonderful time. The staff was very knowlegable about shows,shopping and restaraunts. They were more then happy to make recommendations and make us reservations. It's in a great midtown location so we were right in the mix of everything going on in New York City. We loved the entire decor of the hotel and it's trendy chic vibe. The room had Hermes bath products, down feather bedding and had more then adequate space for us two girls with a lot of luggage and not to mention the gorgeous bathroom (loved the bathtub) :)The entire hotel staff went out of there way to make sure we always had what we needed and put in that extra effort to make our stay that much better. Loved the hotel, loved the staff and loved the whole trip. We will definetly be visiting NYC again soon and reserving a room at the City Club.	
May 9 2005	Not much to love at City Club	While the location of the hotel is great, you may want to stay outside your room the entire stay. While the staff is courteous and helpful they are also making up for what's lacking at this hotel - extremely small rooms (like the Hudson), stained bedspreads, loose tiles on the bathroom floor, and an air conditioner that ran full blast but had no effect despite an unusually cool May weekend.Many corners seem to have been cut in making this place sleek and chic but no corners were cut in the charge for rooms. If you're looking for a cool, funky hotel with a great lobby or lounge, this place isn't it. Try the W. But do try DB Moderne which is the restaurant connected to City Club. A great scene with great food although it too carries over the &quot;small&quot; theme.	
Apr 28 2005 	Smallest room for the money I have ever stayed in.	Small room, nice bathroom. It was a warm week in NY and the temperature in the room was never under 78 degrees with the air on full blast.I guess there are larger rooms based on the glowing reports in the other reviews, but for $275.00 a night I've done much better elsewhere -- and for much less. Nice view of an alley with a large fan that ran all night.Next time in New York I will go back to the W and get twice the room for less money.	
Apr 1 2005 	Good Location OverPriced Room	Great location. Uneven room. For the price, one would be better off staying elsewhere. Strange combination of luxury (frette bed linens and bathrobes, marble shower with Hermes products) and shabby (tiny standard room, old bed blanket, stains on carpet, broken A/C unit, broken shower handle, plywood painted table, creaky scary elevator.)	
Mar 17 2005 	Stylish but no comfort	This is a ridiculous hotel. Decorated with superficial style that is uncomfortable on almost every level. The hotel seems luxurious in photos, but for the same money, you can do better anywhere in the city. The deluxe room is a good size, but it has no dresser, no drawers, and a closet that is so small that clothes hang on the mini-bar and get crushed when the door is closed. Be prepared to live out of your suitcase. The hotel is an old, classic building with the original windows, which is a nice touch until the cold winds blow and the garbage trucks arrive in the middle of the night. There are no curtains and the painted plywood shutters do nothing for these problems, and also dont allow for any privacy during the day without losing all daylight. The room was kept clean, but the carpet and bedspread had many stains, which made the place feel dirty. Even the hotel staff -- friendly and eager to help -- admitted that they hear complaints constantly. I cant imagine that anyone stays at this hotel a second time.	
Jan 1 2005	You could do far better...	OK, the location a block or two from Times Square is excellent, but I think that this is all the hotel has going for it.On this trip, I was travelling with my son. The rooms are just not big enough for two people and as mentioned by a previous reviewer, the storage and closet space is minimal, so if you are staying for more than a weekend expect to be living out of your suitcase.Bring a flashlight - the rooms and corridors are dimly lit, an effort to be trendy I think.Don't expect soft drinks from the mini bar to be free as mentioned on their website - they are most certainly not.Don't bother with the DB Burger at the ajoining restaurant, its a waste of $30.Good points are location, free dvds and er, that's about it.	
Oct 25 2004	Unexciting 	I am normally stay at the Royalton (just across the street on W44th), but, despite some misgivings having read other reviews on this site - decided to try out the City Club on a one-night trip to New York. The room on ther 2nd floor was pleasant enough, except that it was very gloomy with the two windows facing a wall about 6ft away (an issue at the Royalton too, sometimes). Huge bed was very confortable and the TV hidden behind a large paiting was a nice touch. Bathrooms ok, but not a patch on the Royalton's bathrooms. As noted in other reviews, the wallpaper was marked &amp; very slightly peeling in a couple of areas.The hotel has a discreet entrance, but no lobby and no real bar - basically a couple of tables at the back of the db restaurant. I was meeting someone there at 5pm, got there a little early and waited at one of the tables listening to the chef brief the staff about the dishes of the day and what was left over from lunch that he wanted to shift! No drinks available until the clock had struck 5pm. As soon as it had though, the staff were very attentive and the place became packed very quickly. Clearly a popular meeting spot.In summary, if you like very small discrete boutique style hotels, then City Club would be fine if it were at least a third cheaper. I, however, will revert to the Royalton on my next visit to New York.	
Aug 31 2004	Worth it if you can manage a discount	The rooms are small, and there is little closet space and no drawers. But the bed is large and comfortable, there is a good sized couch, and the bath large and impressive with Hermes bath products. We got a good deal through work, but I don't think it would be worth it to stay there paying full price. The attached restuarant, Bistro Moderne, is worth a visit.	
Jul 29 2004	much ado about nothing	Tried 2 different rooms-both with peeling wallpaper,tiny closets and no storage space. Larger rooms at back looked on to a brick wall, small rooms in front had 1 tiny window and street noise.Stylish decor needed to hide the serious shortcomings in amenities,size,condition,attitude.I moved to the Muse: less money,larger rooms, better condition, decent storage....	
May 23 2004	On the whole a very good experience	I read a number of the reviews on the site before staying at the hotel for a week at the beginning of May 2004. As with all of these things I tried to read between the lines and make an evaluated judgement before booking my stay.This is the third hotel I have stayed in, in the city the other two being Ian Schrager hotel's, The Hudson and The Paramount. The first thing which struck me was the size of the room. I had a front facing King Room on the 2nd floor (room 203) which was very spacious. I would estimate at least twice to three times the size of the rooms I had stayed in before.The decor was minimalist without being too stark. The bed was enormous and exceptionally comfortable. I only found the tv behind the mirror a real problem if we had all of the lights on. The CD/DVD player was a nice touch and the free DVD/CD library available from the reception was a real bonus. I really liked the black marble bathroom, which had an excellent shower which was also very large. Some may find this a touch too masculine for their tastes, but i loved it. The finishing was also to a very high standard and I liked the Hermes toiletries. The Frette robes were so nice that I would have considered buying one if there had been any more space in my case.It was also useful having a well stocked mini bar with Dean and Deluca goodies, a mini ironing board/iron and a safe. I liked the soft furnishings, seats were comfortable, the books useful.I was also surprised by the quality of the Maid Service. To return to my room to find all of my spare change arranged in neat stacks, by denomination, showed someone who did a thorough job. It was also nice to find a card with the weather for the next day and chocolates on my pillow, something I have normally only got from hotels much higher up the price scale.The DB bistro was excellent, though on my visit they had sold out of the famous burger. I found the food on par with many of the top restaurants in the city which I visited on other evenings. The hotel does not serve hot breakfasts, but there is an excellent old fashioned diner, The Red Flame, just a few doors down which did an excellent breakfast and was always packed with New Yorkers on each morning we visited, this was also good value for money.I found the staff on the front desk both helpful and knowledgeable, they had neither the stuffyness you expect from some of the hotels at the highest end of the scale or the arrogance you can find at some boutique hotels. They were just genuinely helpful.The hotel was also in an excellent location just off 5th Ave, near to all the shops you want to visit, close to all the public transport if you wish to go up or down town. Very close to the theaters and Time Square without being right on top of it. It also shares the street with a number of nice institutions such as the Harvard and Penn clubs. My room also over looked the Royalton. There is also a very good dry cleaners across the street from the hotel which recently won the award as New Yorks Best in the New York Magazine.On the negative side the lighting was a little too dark if you wished to apply make-up in the bathroom. There were no drawers for putting clothes, altough we did have a couple of shelves next to the hanging space. We found the hanging space insufficient for two people staying for a week. However this was more than adequate for a business traveller on a short stay.Given that this hotel probably falls into the middle of the price bracket for New York, it was very good value for money. Sure you can find cheaper, but this was a cut above the rest in terms of the overall package, location and many of the small touches which made it an enjoyble stay.I did have a look at one of the Suites before checking out on my final day and although there were exceptionally nice, the king size room we booked was the better value. I would recommend booking this size of room.This is definately somewhere I would recommend to my friends and will be my first choice the next time I visit New York.	
May 15 2004	Not as good as expected	Have stayed in NY many times and these are the smallest rooms anywhere! Staff were not particularly helpful and had the usual 'trendy boutique attitude'. Rooms were stylish but not comfortable. Annoyed by things like not being able to switch on a reading light on one side of the bed but not the other - we both had to be awake or neither of us.
