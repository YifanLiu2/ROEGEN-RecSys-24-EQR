Nov 6 2009 	Great Location Tiny Room Clean Good Value.	What we liked best: Great location for broadway theatres and Times Square. What we liked least: Tiny Room. We arrived about noon, and they allowed us an early check-in without any fuss. The hotel location is great - broadway theatres just a block away - Times Square is just two blocks - subway stations two to five blocks distant. The room was clean, but awfully small (the queen bed was about a foot from two walls). The bed was comfortable. The bath was small but serviceable. everything was clean and in good repair. The continental breakfast was nothing special. The hotel website pictures show fruit on the breakfast bar, but we never saw any fruit. The high speed internet worked fine, except for an outage that lasted a few hours. If you want to use the internet, be sure to ask about it when you check in, since our experience was that they didn't volunteer that information. The staff were all friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.	
Oct 19 2009 	If you can call it that	We stayed at the Econolodge hotel NY if you call it that,we were tired a friendly face would have been nice ,no such luck, the staff at reception were unhelpful and useless.Got our key after about half hour went to the room we were given ,it was a double not a twin so off we go back into the lift i knew it was going to be fun when we got downstairs we explained it wasnt the room we had booked the receptionest said did you book in yesterday ,no half a hour ago through gritted teeth .We ended up paying another $139 .To be fare the young man at reception was very helpful.Starving hungry next day came down for breakfast which takes place in the reception area only one word inedible,the room was cold and very small but clean .The cleaners were brilliant i think they should get the reception job.!	
Oct 17 2009 	Agreed - clean good value great location	We banked on the reviews here and stayed 2 nights while seeing shows in NYC. The review were right. This is somewhat of a hidden gem. The value ($169.99) was very good. The locaiton is fantastic - within 1-2 blocks of most theaters, short walk to Times Square, and 1 &quot;long block&quot; to 9th Avenue where there are tons of restaurants (and more on 8th Avenue too). The room we had was exceptionally small -- really little more than a bed, desk and bathroom. There was literally one foot on one side of the bed and one foot space at the foot of the bed. Other than that, there was very little room to maneuver around. Yet the room was very clean and fresh. The place has clearly been renovated from top to bottom. There is a small chest/wardrobe, and I mean small. It has a safe in it and it's not much wider than the safe. The safe was nice to have but too small for my laptop. There is a small desk which is good but if the chair is used you can't walk past it. The bathroom is clean and small but usable. Essentially it's like being on a cruise ship where there is no a spare square foot around. But since we went sightseeing all day, came back to get changed, went to theater and then late dinner and did not get back until midnight, we basically only used it for the bathroom, changing and sleeping. A good find and good value in an otherwise expensive part of town.	
Oct 14 2009 	Small room but who sleeeps in New York!!!	I've read reviews on this hotel before I booked but when I stay in a hotel I only use it for sleeping in. So the size of the rooms does not matter.The location was great a few yards from Times Square so close enough but far enough to be away from the bustle. The lift did make a bit of a racket when we 1st arrived but it was soon fixed. The room was very small for example, there was a flat screen TV on the wall and I still had to lean back as I passed between it and the bed. But that's the only complaint I could make if I wanted to. We stayed 3 nights and found the bagels, muffins, fruit &amp; coffee enough for breakfast but at time did have to stand to have it as it was served in the foyer.	
Oct 13 2009 	Definitely just a place to sleep	If you were expecting a large room, you are quite mistaken. My girl firend and I went here over a year ago and I still remember the look of the place. The hotel is within a few blocks of time square, but the hotel itself is a bit dated. You receive a continental breakfast in the morning of whatever bagels or muffins they have. They do offer coffee and tea for those who are interested. Not a satisfactory full meal, but good enough to start your day. The hotel room we got was one with a queen bed. With two girls and two full sized luggages, it was a bit cramped. We had to maneuver our luggage so we had access to it. The bed took up most of the room. The bathroom was on the small side as well. The room itself was old. The room had a weird smell without the air conditioner on and you definitely needed air conditioning in August. The hotel did manage to squeeze in a table into the room. This room is great for if you are going with just one other person and you aren't planning to spend too much time in the room. It's definitely nothing fancy, but if you just need a place to stay it's a good price for NY.	
Oct 11 2009	You may think this is a bad review...but it's not! Keep Reading...	I found this hotel after doing tons of research. It was the best deal I could find (at least for a place that I felt comfortable staying in!). For $240.00 per night it was still pretty steep - but compared to the other hotels in the times square area for the dates I was traveling, this was was nice a bargain. When we got to the hotel, we had had TERRIBLE service from SuperShuttle, so I was not in a particularly good mood checking in. The desk clerk (who I am sure hear me yelling at the shuttle driver) was not super welcoming but she also wasn't unpleasant to deal with either. Then they told me I had to pay up-front; which is not the typical operation of a hotel. So my vacation did not get off to a good start. It was hot (our vacation happened to coincide with the 3 hottest days of the summer...over 100 every day!) and I was cranky and irratable after the flight and the horrible experience getting there. Then...we get to the room and holy smallville batman! there wasn't even room to walk around the bed - it was weged from wall to wall. But I had found in my travel research that hotel rooms in NYC were small. So okay - we will tolerate it. and Viola...finally a good vacation ensues! We headed downstairs to engulf ourselves in the wonders of NYC and find the nearest restraunt because we were starving. We stopped in the lobby to ask what they recommended nearby and the bellman was kind and most helpful. We were greeted when we returned by the nice bellman and a different desk clerk - and she was wearing a smile! Morning came and ...out we went into the great wide city. Passing thru the lobby we asked for extra towels for the rest of the week, and a wonderfully nice desk agent assured we would have them. We were also greeted by the kind bellman again, and there was a very nice continental breakfast to be had. Well...we got our extra towels. We got the extra blanket we asked for. There was fresh water bottles left for us every day, fresh soaps in the bathroom, and fresh linens. Every day we were joyfully greeted by the desk clerk and the bellman; and we had a splendid time! The service was good. The room was small but functional. The in-room safe didn't work and we were told the batteries needed to be changed; and I don't know if they changed them when we were out of the room; but we were never able to get it to work. It could have been the safe...it could have been us not being clever enough how to figure it out. All in all this was a good place; good price comparitively; and I would stay again in a New York minute!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great location reasonable accommodations for a great price	This is an Econo Lodge, not the Four Seasons, but it does have the backing of a national chain. It is located not even 2 blocks from Times Square, on the north end near Central Park. The rooms are small, but from my experience, most rooms are in Midtown Manhattan. But when you're in NYC, you're not spending much time in the room anyway. I've seen the reviews on similarly priced hotels, and if you even get a private bathroom, you may see rodents. But at the Econo Lodge, the rooms were fairly clean and you get your own decent-sized bathroom. I actually stay at this hotel every time I go to NYC, because working for a non-profit, you can't beat the price for a decent hotel in that location. During my last stay, I came back from a day out working and almost cried with joy when I saw how much care the maid service took with my belongings when cleaning the room. It was immaculate and organized. The accommodations are nothing fancy by any means, but you're not going to find a better location with nicer staff for under $150 a night in Midtown.	
Oct 8 2009 	Nice hotel for the price	We stayed in this hotel because it was close to Times Square and was about $120 a night. A good price for the area. We were not disappointed. The rooms are small, but they were clean and the location was great!	
Sep 25 2009 	Dont stay here!	This place is miserable! It took us two hrs just to get checked in after spending a 6 hr ride to get here. There was some internet issues... We went out for dinner hoping the issues would be resolved by then...they were not! We were not offered anything for our inconvenience, not even a water and just said &quot; there is nothing we can do&quot; even though their motto is &quot; where great customer service doesn't cost extra&quot;, but this place has no customer service at all. When we got back the elevator was broken and there was nobody in the lobby for any help at all. So what are you paying for...please spend the extra 200 bucks for a much better place, this place is an insult. The next night we tried to get back into our hotel room and had to go back down to the lobby with the most unfriendly employee ever because nieiher of our keys would let us into our room, it was then that she informed us that you had to get new keys every freaking day! Imagine that. No reason what so ever for another inconvience, not to mention they dont even have vending machines!	
Sep 25 2009 	Hot water should be a basic in North America... no contractors on the weekend???	We booked 2 rooms to stay at the Econo Lodge over the September long weekend. We were greated by a please lady that was working the front desk and we thought we were off to having a great stay. We could not have been so wrong...The next morning we go to have a shower and we find out there is no hot water... I phoned the front desk and they said the hot water was not working in the entire area. We did not get frustrated as maybe that was the case and that was out of the control of the hotel. We check later on that night and they say the hot water is now working but when we get back to our room we discover that it is not working yet again. We phone down to the front desk to discover they know it is still a problem and don't know when it will be fixed.The next morning we try to have a showever to our disappointment to find out the hot water is not working again which means that we are forced to have cold showers. This was clearly not fun since I have very long hair!When we talked to the front desk there was no manager to express our concerns to and our compensation for a bad stay was 10% off our room. We are in New York.... having hot water is a basic necessity not a luxury item... telling us you could not get someone to come an fix it until Tuesday after the long weekend is just unacceptable!There is one thing to have someone go wrong for a customer during their stay but the moment of truth for your organization is how you resolve the problem... this differentiates whether or not the client will ever come back! Econo Lodge you missed the boat and there were 4 ladies from 4 families in those 2 rooms and we live in difference Cities. Do the math to figuer out how many people we have told about our experience and how many people will NEVER visit your hotel since you did not compensate for this problem in an appropriate mannor! The lost business along from the four of us is much greater than it would have cost you to discount our rooms appropriately!	
Sep 17 2009 	Value Location Service everything FREE	I heard about this property through friends and it is a great find! I will def recommend to others who are looking for accomodations esp in times square - there should be more hotels like this one! we didnt pay for anything except our room charge. EVERYTHING was free! Breakfast, Coffee, Tea, Internet, Faxing - the savings added up - we would have easily spent an additional $30 anywhere else for all of this. The rates are the cheapest in the area. The folks at the front desk were great.	
Sep 9 2009 	Unacceptable	I stayed with a couple of friends at the Econo lodge for the labour day weekend and the hotel had no hot water for the weekend. The staff didn't apologize and the toilet in one of the rooms overflowed twice.	
Aug 22 2009 	Uneccptable disregard	The only good thing at the hotel is it's location. The rooms are tinny - you almost have to choose between you or your luggage - and the staff (exception made for Andrew) is very unfriendly. Even though they say there's free wi-fi connection in the room, I've been staying there for an entire week and couldn't get online!!!!!! And when I look to the front desk so they can get it fixed, they give a shi***** about it!!! NOT RECOMMENDED!!!	
Aug 15 2009 	Location Location Location	Stayed at the Econo Lodge for 3 nights whilst visiting New York.Never been to New York before, then this is a good place to stay!The rooms are very small i mean very small BUT it's clean and some where to sleep and freshen up, grab a coffee on your way out in the morning what more do you want for the price?Location is EXCELLENT you walk out the door turn right and just 1 block your on Times Square right in the centre of everything. I would highly recommend the Your buses for seeing New York, it's cheap and a great way to see New York and all it's Famous Land marks. You just hop and off as many times as you like throughout the day.I would stay at Econolodge again and recommend it to anyone if anything for it's Location, the staff were very friendly and helpful.	
Aug 8 2009 	small and noisy	We satyed in Econo lodge in April 2008. Having been to New york before I was looking forward to taking my children (teenagers) and mother. We has booked 3 rooms and requested a twin for the children. When we arrived there was no twin room and ended up paying an extra $400. The receptionis was rude and unhelpful. The hotel is small the rooms even smaller. There was little room for 2 people and if 1 person was getting ready the other had to stay in hte bathroom or sit on the bed. It was very noisy as you would expect near times square, however there is a Firestation nearby and sirens going all night. The only plus was the free breakfast of mainly bagels and coffee/tea the latter being available all day and night.Would I stay again ? no.	
Jul 23 2009 	Close to Everything	This was located near many restaurants, the Broadway district, and several other NYC attractions such as Radio City and Rockefeller Plaza. We arrived about an hour or so before check-in time, and although our room wasn't ready, they had a room that was, according to the clerk, &quot;larger&quot; than the room we had and that she was going to upgrade us to that. I can't imagine what the original room looked like---there was barely enough room to turn around in. The bathroom, however, was large, and the room was very clean, which is our primary concern. Lighting in the room was excellent. In so many hotels one can't read after dark because of the limited lighting, but that was not the case. The window air conditioner was plenty to cool the room down. The bed was comfortable. We did hit a snag, however. When we prepared to go downstairs for the continental breakfast, the elevator was out of service, so we had to walk down from the 6th floor. It wasn't terribly inconvenient for us because we are walkers and in good physical condition, although I must admit the hike back upstairs had us both pausing for a moment at the 4th floor. Our last hike down was with overnight bags, too. When we checked out, not a word of apology for the inconvenience was offered. Granted, I would prefer walking to riding an elevator that is unsafe, but some recognition of the added effort on the guests' part would have been appreciated. There are some who couldn't have done the stairs, and I wonder what accommodations were made for them. We actually did opt out of the continental breakfast--it was sparser than most, however by the time we did return from breakfast, more items had been added. Despite the situation with the elevator, I would stay in this hotel again because of its location and value.	
Jul 23 2009 	The review were right	After reading the review about how small the rooms were, I guess seeing is believing! My husband who is is 6'3 and I were in a room on the 4th floor. The bed was more a double than a queen size that we were expecting. The room is extremely small for two people. Getting out of bed was challenging as there was about a 1' space between the foot of the bed and the wall. It was either walk sideways or roll over my husband to get up, lol.Getting ready for our day was comical as only one person could fit in the bathroom and then to get dress was also a challenge too as there was a desk in the room so there wasn't much space between the desk, bed and the walls. At night we did hear a lot of noise but we had the window air conditioning running all the time so that muted out some of the sounds. The linen and the bathroom have seen better days and we actually had to ask for extra towels as they were down to the last threads. The breakfast was ok for what it was worth. Bagels are always good to start off the day with your coffee.Overall it is definitely your low-budget hotel. The location was excellent as it was close by to Times Square and if you want to the the Hop on Hop Off Bus Tours the pick up is across the street.	
Jul 21 2009 	Very compact rooms but excellent location	We stayed here for 3 nights in September 2007. The room we stayed in was very small, no room for a wardrobe just a small cupboard. The staff where very good and the room was fairly clean, location is excellent. Because of the excellent location it can be a bit noisy at night, but at the end of the day you're in New York there arent many quiet areas it really is a 24 hour city.	
Jul 6 2009	GOOD VALUE	My daughter and I stayed here june 17 checked in at 12:30pm our room was not ready at the time they offered us the penthouse suite(HA HA HA) on the 7th floor the only room on the 7th floor but larger free upgrade no extra charge. First thing I did was pull down the bed to check for bed bugs thank goodness no bugs the sheets were clean and no stains on them flat screen tv,safe in the room also a FREE small breakfast 7-10am it got us going in the morning. There was alot of traffic noise and fire station is around the conner but hey is New York you will here traffic any place you stay in NY near times square. I would stay here again in a NY minute it was CLEAN and close to almost everything.	
May 13 2009 	Not bad for the price	I am a frequent NYC traveler, so I know about how big apartments &amp; such in the city are. The EconoLodge is NOT in Times Square, more like 4-5 blocks away, but still a good location. It's not much to look at from the outside, but inside it is well maintained &amp; clean. Now, the rooms are SMALL, but any New Yorker will tell you that if you want space, you pay for it. The room fit one king size bed and a small bathroom, and you had to wait for each other to stay still to get around. But, everything was clean and the room came with shamppos &amp; soaps, etc. There was breakfast the next morning (donuts, coffee, bagels, etc.) If you want a luxury hotel, then you will pay for it, for the price we couldn't have asked for much more. I mean, in NYC, how much time do you really want to spend in the room anyway? This hotel is located fairly close to the subway and there is a nice breakfast/diner place near by for some good cheap eats.	
May 4 2009 	Tiny room but convenient!	I had to stay en extra day in New York last month, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I would not be there except to sleep.this hotel is quite fone for that, but would not be good if it was 2 people who had lots of stuff. Like most rooms in Manhattan, it is just a bed and a small bureau in lieu of a closet, and a rack that will fit one suitcase.But it is clean and convenient, and a block from Times Square, the Broadway theatres, 20 minutes walk to central park, close to subways, and the Port Authority bus Terminal.It is right off of restaurant row, so you need not look far for great little restaurants.Staff were friendly and nice. The room and bathroom were clean.The street below was a little noisy due to a window airconditioner being in the window permanently for the summertime, but all in all, I couldn't complain. And for what I needed, it was safe and fine.there is a little help-yourself breakfast in the morning down in the lobby - O.J., coffee/tea, bagels, donuts, croissants, cereal, etc.My room was ready when I checked in at noon, and they were able to let me have a late check out (by 2 hours) when I asked the next day.A great little place for a night or two!	
Apr 26 2009 	Cozy but nice	Cozy? I mean small, but the amenities were great. Desk folks were knowledgeable. Breakfasts were great. Centrally located. Near subway. Theater right next door. What more could you ask? Nice place.	
Apr 1 2009 	Perfection at 47th and 8th	I have stayed there multiple times for business, it is centrally located for everything I need. I am also planning on staying there for personal trips as well. The best price in Manhattan, very knowledgeable people. 5 minutes to Times Square by foot!	
Mar 17 2009 	Small but very clean 	We stayed there for a whole week and would stay there again. Yes, it's small, but who cares, you are hardly in as you are too busy checking the wonderful NYC. For us what mattered the most was its cleanliness and location. We walked everywhere till late as it was central and safe. The breakfast was average, but it fed us for the morning, so I can't complain! Many hotels don't provide breakfast. I have recommended this hotel to my friends who will visit NYC in 2010. Great value for money, stay there!!!	
Mar 16 2009 	nice place	Me &amp; my boyfriend have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Econo Lodge..here is my opinion... rooms are REALLY small there was barely enough room for us to put our clothes into the drawers as there were about 3 and even they were small, so i wouldnt reccommend this hotel for a group of people or if your staying for a long period of time and it got quite stuffy in there most of the time but there is a fan thats excellent it lets out alot of air. Very clean, rooms were cleaned everyday and towels changed everyday. Safe is in the wardrobe which is free, we used this all the time. It did suit us it was great value for money it's close by to everything, times square is right around the corner. There is a continental breakfast every morning which is just coffee and donuts/croissants etc..and you can take them back to your room. Staff seemed friendly enough but we never had much contact with them. Overall it's a nice place i just dont think there is enough rom for 2 people or more but great value for money. New York is an amazing place and i think we will definetly be returning, there is so much to do and see! we had an amazing time here.	
Mar 2 2009	Clean Comfortable Affordable Great Midtown Manhattan Location	This hotel suited my needs perfectly. I wanted to stay close to Times Square and this hotel is only about 5 blocks away. The room was quite small, but it was clean and comfortable. We didn't bring a lot of luggage so everything fit just fine. I always wanted to stay in Manhattan but was never able to afford it until I found this hotel. The free breakfast was an added plus, saving us time and money in the mornings. The only downside to this hotel was the noise in the wee hours of the morning of horns honking, sirens, and loud people, but that's what I expected staying so close to Times Square, there is a reason why they call it the &quot;city that never sleeps&quot;. Overall, this was a good hotel for the money and I definitely would stay again.	
Feb 27 2009 	Good value and central location	This location, only a few hundred metres away from Times Square is perfect, if you are up for some 24h action. There are lots of good cheap eats just around the corner in Hells Kitchen, specially the Five Napkins Burger on the corner of 45th and 9. ave are worth a visit if you are in for some juicy meat..The rooms are small, so if you are two persons planning to bring loads of luggage or do massive shopping, rent an ekstra room for the luggage :-).Being one person in the room was just perfect. I have lived in smaller and more expensive rooms in London, so value is great for the money. The room was real clean an tidy. Location are a bit noisy, so if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs!There was an in-room safe, but be aware that Laptops bigger than 13&quot; won´t fit in!Hotel is perfect for young travellers on a budget or if you are travelling alone. A small continental breakfest and 24h coffee are included in the room rate. There is no restaurant but you can bring the breakfest to your room.	
Dec 17 2008 	ideal for my needs	The clue here is in the title - if you want luxury then you'll have to pay for it! I stayed here for five nights and found it perfect for my needs - close enough to the action to be able to walk around, and clean/comfortable. Both these needs were met. My room was a bit 'wee', and if there had been two of me with cases (and shopping) the size of mine then it might have been a squash. However, if your only luggage is a weekend case then it's fine for two. My first room was spotless, but unfortunately the safe didn't work. I called down to reception, was seen to immediately, then was found another room as the safe had had it. (A blessing perhaps as the wireless connection was very slow on sixth floor - but better on fourth!)As mentioned in previous reviews, the proximity to Times Square is great - as a single white female I felt perfectly safe walking around in the evening after a show or meal. The Grey Line tour buses leave at the end of the street - I really enjoyed the tours I did - and just further up on 8th Ave is the fire station that lost the most firefighters on 9/11 - a sobering reminder of the tragedy to befall this great city. I would certainly stay here again - the staff (when I had cause to need them) were friendly and helpful, and being so central was perfect.	
Dec 14 2008 	Excellent Value Perfect Location!	Simply put this hotel is probably the best value for the location. It as clean, there was a safe in the room and although the room was tiny it didn't feel uncomfortable. If you have more than two people I'd suggest paying for a bigger room.Don't be put off by the fact that it's an Econo Lodge, it was well kept and felt fresh. There is a breakfast and the staff are all friendly. And of course there is the location.The only issue i had was checking in. I had to wait and there was no where to leave the luggage since the hotel had no extra room. The elevator was insanely slow as well.The area was clean and true to form, the world is at your feet once you step out of the hotel and into the City. I had a wonderful stay and this is where I'll stay the next time I'm in NYC!	
Dec 5 2008 	Great location 	After seeing some scary reviews of other cheap hotels in NY, (including pics of rats, bugs &amp; mold), I was apprehensive about booking a cheap hotel. All we needed was basically somewhere to sleep, so we didn't want to pay for anything fancy or big. But I did NOT want a dirty, run-down, rodent infested place either! This place was perfect for what we wanted. It was definitely small and simple, but it was CLEAN and well maintained (it doesn't seem to be an old building, or at least it's been redone inside). The best parts:-great location, just around the corner from Times Square (1block west &amp; a couple blocks north of it)-free wireless-room safe (set your own password)-clean bathroom, hot water, fresh soft towels, hair dryer-comfy bed, clean sheets-air conditioner-flat screen TV (some channels were fuzzy, but you don't come to NY to watch TV!)-free daily newspaper (during the week)-free coffee/tea all day in lobby-free 'breakfast' til 10am in lobby (fruit, cereal, tasty pastries, oatmeal, bagels) -free local calls-smoke-free hotel-price (paid $160+$30 tax CAN/night)Like most NY hotels it seems, the rooms are small and it can get noisy outside (you are downtown near TS after all!). But it wasn't that bad. After walking around all day we were tired enough to sleep through any noise. They'll hold your bags for $3 each after check-out (which is noon). Also, check in is 3pm, but we got there in the morning and got our room right away.	
Dec 1 2008 	Great value!	We had a great experience! The hotel was super clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful and we got the most bang for our buck. Are the rooms tiny? Heck yeah--but we didn't care. We wanted a safe, clean place to sleep at night as it was not our intention to spend a lot of time in the hotel when there was so much to do and see in the city. I will definitely go back if ever visiting NYC again.	
Nov 17 2008 	Great Value	I read many reviews about this hotel and it is the main reason I booked it. I wanted something close to Times Square and something that was somewhat affordable. We were warned about the small rooms... and everyone was right... wow... they are small. My hubbie and I managed though. We got in each others way a lot, but it was a clean hotel and perfect ammenities. We landed up reorganizing the furniture a bit so that we could get around a little better. The bathroom was a good size and the bed was comfortable and clean. We had free internet in the room and we used it a lot. We were also informed that they had free long distance phone calls. That came in very handy. I have never been to a hotel that had free long distance phone calls. The continental breakfast was also good. They had coffee all the time in the lobby. The people at the check in counter were always pleasant and friendly. I would definetly recommend this hotel and will probably use it again. We also got a 60 plus rate (my parents) which wasn't advertised.	
Nov 15 2008 	NO 1 Hotel for Location Staff and Cleanliness	I viewed all the reviews on this hotel before I booked. I stayed from 6th nov - 10th Nov. Yes the rooms are very small but also very clean. The shower pressure was great after spending hours walking around the city.The staff were always very helpful and pleasant. The hotel is only 1 block away from Times Square and just around the corner from where the NY Sightseeing bus tours leave from. There is also a 24 hr cafe just round the corner which serves great food. If I am lucky enough to go back to this fantastic city I will be using the Econo Lodge Hotel again. NY CITY Fan from Scotland UK	
Oct 19 2008 	Pleasantly surprised	WHile most NY hotel rooms are small (and this is no exception), the hotel was immaculately clean, location was first rate and the staff was friendly and helpful. I will have no problem staying here again.	
Oct 11 2008 	Everything we wanted	We wanted to be close to Times Square and the Theater district. This Econ Lodge was perfect. The room was small - about 2 feet around a queen bed, a small desk &amp; chair, a small wardrobe, tv, ironing board, and a bathroom. Free continental breakfast. Coffee was available all day. The hotel had been renovated in 2006, so it was clean and well-kept. The elevator was quick (unlike some previous reviews had stated) and the hotel was only about 5 floors high, so I'm not sure what the big deal was. I watched the rates and booked one night in advance to get a rate under $200 including taxes. You can leave your luggage in a secured room for $3/day after you check out. Less than 10 minute walk from the Port Authority.	
Sep 26 2008	SUPER small room but would go back	This hotel has a great location @ 47th &amp; 8th and is an easy walk to all the theatres and restaurants around Time Square. You can even walk to Central Park pretty easily. The room was clean, the staff were helpful and friendly, but the room is TEENY TINY. I mean, really, really small. I know hotel rooms in NYC are small normally, but I've been to NYC numerous times and this was the smallest room I've ever seen. The two of us had a hard time finding space to open 2 suitcases. Since we didn't spend much time in the room, the size really didn't bother me too much. I'd definitely go back. However, I wouldn't recommend it if you're claustrophobic, spend a lot of time in your room, or are a larger than average person.	
Sep 20 2008 	Great location great price!	We spent 11 nights here and were very pleased. Our room was clean and everything in it appeared to be new. We were on the top floor, so the street noise wasn't too bad, especially with the fan or air conditioner on. We didn't have any trouble with noise coming from inside the motel. We never heard our neighbors talking or their TV. There was also no problem with the slamming of doors in the hallway that is often a problem. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast consisted of wonderful bagels, crossiants, 2 kinds of pastry, 2 kinds of cold cereal, oatmeal, fruit, coffee, tea, and juice. It was important to us to have a room with it's own bathroom, not shared. This motel had the best rate of any I looked at in Manhattan. The room was small, but adequate for two people. We had four bags total and there was a space for everything. I was pleasantly surprised with how nice it was, considering our rate was $179 per night. You won't find a better location. Especially nice was the fact that if you go to 9th and 10th avenues, there are all kinds of restaurants, bakeries, delis and diners, in all price ranges. If you get tired of the free breakfast, give the Galaxy Diner on 9th avenue a try, they have a great breakfast. I highly recommend the Econo Lodge Times Square!	
Sep 11 2008 	Truly NY experience	Do you like staff being unbelievably rude 3 times out of five? Do you want your sheets to get changed every day? Do you like shabby ceilings and a falling off shower head? Do you prefer having your breakfast standing in the lobby? Do you like sharing your bed with BED BUGS? Do you appreciate staying in a hotel next to Times Sq. and pay $300/night? Then this place is for you	
Aug 11 2008	Rip Off..	This place a rip off compared to the money they charge. Rooms are tiny, Lift works at snail pace, Staff is highly unfriendly, reception and lobby is dirty, i can go on and on... Bottom line is that you can find a much better Lodge or a Hotel at Time square at the same price. I will never stay at this place ever again..	
Aug 6 2008 	Will not stay here again	The Only good thing about this hotel was the location. The rooms are incredibly small- so small in fact that the TV has to be mounted to the corner of a wall as there is no room for a tv stand. All that is in the room is a bed and a small cupboard for your clothes (couldn't fit much in it).When we arrived our door was open (sketchy) there was blood on the sheets and our phone cord had been cut out of the wall (these all should have been signs to LEAVE). The bathroom was disgusting. There was no vanity to put your toiletries so they all had to go on the floor- which was not clean and had a dirty towel on the floor. Breakfast was- donuts. I think there may have also been cereal and some fruit. The walls are VERY thin- we heard everything that was going on both inside and outside the hotel. When i travel- i want my hotel to be some place to come and unwind at the end of the day and this hotel did not provide that. I will not be staying here again.	
Aug 3 2008 	Great Price CLEAN ROOM Best location in NYC	This is a GEM! Yes, the room is small, BUT CLEAN!Best Location, Nice FREE Continental Breakfast, Friendly Staff,$30 a day to park your car 400 feet away, Excellent Freshbagels and danish, Good Coffee, Tropicana PremiumOrange Juice, FREE chips and bottled water in room, GreatLG flat screen TV ....Why would you stay anywhere else!	
Aug 1 2008 	Can a hotel room BE any smaller?	OK, OK, I knew what I was getting into: Earlier reviewers did mention the room was extremely small. But you can't really appreciate just how small it is until you've tried to squeeze between the edge of the bed and the wall and make your way to the other side of a room no bigger than a closet. Actually, it's pretty hilarious -- almost as funny as the water that leaked on our heads from the bathroom ceiling. To the hotel's credit, they switched our room immediately. It was just as small. On the plus side: the location is excellent, smack in the middle of the theater district. You get a real feel for New York as fire trucks, police cars and ambulances race past your window, sirens blaring. The hotel and room are very clean, the bed is comfortable, the front desk people smile and there's a complimentary continental breakfast -- although the bagels run out very quickly and the coffee is undrinkable. So, if you're not claustrophobic and want to save more than a few bucks, the Econo Lodge is the place for you.	
Jul 24 2008 	HATED THIS PLACE!! AWFUL!!!	So, my friends and I showed up, and I handed the lady my confirmation information, and, with the little English she could actually speak, said, &quot;Sorry, we don't have your reservation, and we're all booked tonight.&quot; They would NOT honor my reservation there!! I bitched and complained for TWO hours, then finally, they put me in another, NICER hotel, which was actually better. Then I bitched and moaned to get the room comped, when Econo Lodge should have just said &quot;Don't worry, we'll take care of it.&quot; New York City is my favorite place in the world, and of the 8 million times I've been there, this was the WORST experience ever. Some people just don't have customer service skills. My advice, try the St. James Hotel on 45th &amp; 6th. You'll enjoy it much much better. (and there are some SWEET ASS Irish Pubs right next door!)	
Jun 20 2008 	Super clean and excellent location	I just returned from my 2 night stay in NYC.Originally my husband was supposed to go but due to unexpected repair bill,he had to stay behind.At first,I was hesitant to stay in the city alone.I did have an event to attend so I went.I got to the hotel early (11:30)expecting to just store my bags till check in time.Imagine my surprise, when the front desk clerk called housekeeping and told them to clean my room next! I was all checked in and in my room by noon.The room was small(of course, its NY!),but very clean.Every single staff member I ran into was very pleasant.The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was squeaky clean.The location is ideal and close to most attractions and restaurants one wants to go to.Subways stops are also very close.Breakfast was super....fresh NY bagels,oatmeal,cereal,juices,pastries........all day long was coffee, tea and fresth fruit(apples and bananas).I felt very safe in this area and at the hotel.I look forward to returning someday soon.Thumbs up!!	
Jun 18 2008	Great place to sleep in the city that never sleeps!	I believe in Tripadvisor and almost without exception use it to plan any of my vacations abroad. So when the hotel we used on our previous vacation to NYC closed, we obviously turned to Tripadvisor to select a new place to stay. All the positive things said about this hotel are true - the water pressure and hot water are just fine and for the noise complaints - I can recommend a great place in Alaska (this is NYC after all). But let's start at the beginning. We arrived early at the hotel after a 23 hour flight (yeah no kidding) and could obviously not check in but they offered to keep our luggage at no cost. After roaming the streets in our &quot;not so fresh&quot; state we got our room just after 12:30. Now use your imagination and imagine the smallest a room can be in a hotel. Take half of that and you have the Econo Lodge! These rooms are TINY but they are clean and the bed is comfortable. What more do you need really? So unless you are a little bigger than the average size this hotel is more than adequate to have a good night's sleep and a place to clean up. You will not spend your days in the hotel with the streets of New York calling outside. The breakfasts consisted of a few pastries, bagels, a choice of two cereals, juice, fresh fruit and good enough coffee. No room really to sit downstairs to enjoy the breakfast so most use the tray in the room to carry it back to the room. The hotel staff was in general friendly enough by New York standards. We had a problem with our toilet and this was dealt with promptly. Most people rave about the location and we must also throw our penny's worth in. It is absolutely true that you'll be hard pressed to find a better location for the price. In the heart of the theatre district, one block from restaurant row and Times Square. Across the street is a Duane Reade pharmacy for convenience shopping 24 hours a day. Another little gem is the Food Emporium two blocks north at 49th and 8th. We can really recommend them for a late night snack. Will we stay there again? Absolutely!! And in my opinion this is the measure of how great a hotel really was.	
Jun 13 2008 	A Good Value for NY	This place is a great deal for NY. The location is great; a few blocks from Times Square, right in the heart of the Theater District. Even better, head one block over to 9th Ave and experience &quot;restaurant row&quot;, block after block of small moderately priced restaurants of every hue from burger joints to Turkish to Italian to Thai to whatever else you might want. Right across the street is a friendly, laid-back Irish pub where we had a cool glass of Guiness each evening. Walk around the neighborhood (Hell's Kitchen) and see real New York devoid of tourist traps where people live. The rooms are small by any standard; it was hard to fit around the side the of bed and the bathroom was claustrophobic for my 6' husband. We only were given two pillow and two towels despite their being two of us. The hotel is far from fancy and as for the &quot;free continental breakfast&quot; - well - we hit the Starbucks in the next block instead. That's it for negatives - the staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. Our room was spotlessly clean when we arrived and kept that way for the whole 6 days we stayed. All in all, a real deal. We'd stay again.	
Jun 5 2008 	Good value for the money	This hotel is totally adequate but not luxurious in any way. As noted in prior postings, the rooms are SMALL, even by European standards. We had to squeeze by each other just to get to the bed. My husband hit his head on the low TV. But, everything worked fine, the bed was comfortable, the breakfast was fine as long as you took it up to your room to eat...........no seating in the lobby. And the location makes up for any deficiencies. Funny little things there, like you have to recode your room keys every day, and the elevator is, as mentioned before, quite slow. But so what.......the room was clean and comfortable and what more do you need in New York City.We stayed four nights and would return.	
Jun 3 2008 	good value	We spent one night in NYC and the hotel was very good. The staff was friendly, the location is good, the room and hallways were clean (but very small) and the price was reasonable for NYC. We paid about $160 plus tax.	
Jun 3 2008 	Great Location	I stayed on a Saturday night with my teenage daughter and her girlfriend. The room was small but we actually had the room we needed to iron and store shopping bags. The room was clean, nice tv, bathroom was very small but very clean. We appreciated the bottled water and chips and also the coffee/fruit in the lobby and the breakfast in the a.m.My only complaint is that we were in a corner room over 8th ave and heard all of the noise. Sirens, horns, voices well into the night - I would highly recommend ear plugs then I think you would be all set. For the price, this was a great place to stay - I really don't think you could do better. I paid under 200.00 with tax for a weekend stay.	
May 23 2008 	Fantastic location - clean friendly and convenient	Yes the room was small, yes there was nowhere to sit for breakfast and yes the lift was slow - overall though, the price and location far outweighed those negatives.The room was always clean, the showers powerful and hot, and 24hr coffee too!You couldn't have asked for a better location either - slap bang in the middle of the Theatre district and within walking distance of MoMA, Central Park, Empire State, Rockefeller Centre and Times Square. Recommended.	
May 19 2008 	Customer Service Displeasure	The Hotel Personnel damaged my saxophone. I had to check the horn because I was being relocated to another room and that room was not available. I tip the counter person and the bellhop who physically took the horm from me. Alos, I explained the contents of the case and asked for special care. When I returned, the case was behind the counter on the floor where staff members were walking. The bell of the sax was bent. I reported this event to Choice Hotels Customer Service Department. The Hotel issued a statement to the Service Department that &quot;proper care&quot; was taken in handling the sax and that they were not responsible. Customer Service called me and stated that the hotels statement was final. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels with this saxophone and have not had this type of problem. This is irresponsible on the hotels part. Also, the hotel in independent of the Customer Service Department. Therefore, the department is useless in this matter.	
May 13 2008 	Tiny room but will return	Yes, this was the tiniest room that we have ever stayed in (couldn't fit pass the desk and chair to get to the bed unless we removed the chair and stored it beside the desk and even then it was a tight squeeze. There was an ironing board and iron but I don't know if there would have been room to set it up. Now to the positives....the room was very clean...gleaming bathroom with great water pressure and temperature (unlike what others have described). The air conditioner worked fine. The flat screen tv had good reception and ample channels (couldn't get HBO to work though). There was a complimentary bottle of spring water and two bags of chips. The free continental breakfast included cereal, danish, croissants, bagels, juice and coffee. It was fresh and plentiful. We asked for extra towels and pillows and they were immediately brought up to our room. The staff was helpful and very, very friendly and of course the location was perfect. We were within walking distance of Port Authority and right in the middle of the theater district. The price for our midweek stay was under $200 night and booked directly through the hotel. If you can handle the small size of the room then this is the place to stay.	
Apr 28 2008 	Cheap and cheerful (but loud!)	Stayed here for a week with my girlfriend in April.On the plus side:The location was fanastic - you're a 3 minute walk from Times Square, right by the Subway and generally right in the heart of the tourist zone. The place is completely safe and clean. Breakfast was really good. I was at first disappointed not to see a toaster for the bagels, but it turned out they were so good you could just eat them untoasted. Despite reading about complaints on here, the lift was perfectly ok (by British standards).On the down side was the NOISE. Oh-my-god was it loud. We arrived on a Saturday night and the sound from the street in our 3rd floor room (people shouting, car horns honking every 2 minutes, and then of course the fire department...) was pretty much unbearable for the first hour or so trying to get to sleep. Luckily we had some earplugs which we used from that moment on throughout our stay which meant we slept absolutely fine after that, but i wouldnt recommend this place to a light sleeper.Apart from that it was fine. The bed was comfy, and the pillows were fine, the shower was hot and the TV worked.Of course the room was laughably small as described by everyone else on here but we were ready for that so it didnt bother us at all.Overall for the price of the room (and some earplugs), given the amazing location it was a bargain and I'd probably stay again.	
Apr 21 2008	Too much for too little	If location is your only prerogative then yes, this hotel will meet your expectations, however if you are also interested in things like you know hot water, a chair to sit down on at breakfast, a quiet night's sleep - DO NOT book at Econo Lodge Times Square. During our short stay there we have heard so many people complaining about the water temperature (one guy was actually yelling at the concierge, that's how frustrated he was). The rooms are tiny, tiny - two people cannot pass by the beds when walking side by side. There were many front desk people that we've encountered during our stay there - some better than others. The good ones gave us tips on where to go to eat, brought more food when the continental breakfast area started emptying. In any case, if you have time to spare look around some more for other options before booking with this hotel.	
Apr 19 2008 	Great stay excellent value!	If you're not looking for anything fancy, this really is a great hotel at a great price. My 13-year old daughter and I stayed for 3 nights, and I'd highly recommend it. The location couldn't be better - close to everything. We always felt safe, even though it was just the two of us, even while walking back to the hotel at night from a nearby Broadway show one night and from Top of the Rock another. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was really good, and two of the three mornings we stayed, there was someone in the lobby standing by to make sure everything was stocked and that guests had everything they needed. Sure, the place is small, but so are most NYC hotels, and how much are you in the room other than when you're sleeping? The room was very clean, with ample space for the two of us and our luggage. A computer with internet access and printer was available in the lobby for a small fee, which was helpful since we were able to print our boarding passes for our return flight. The only negatives I can think of are that it's a bit noisy (lots of sirens since there's a nearby fire station), but hey, it's New York, right? Also, the elevator is old and not the fastest thing around, but was perfectly functional. Overall, a real value. We definitely would stay again	
Apr 18 2008 	Nice Price Would recommend to those who need a place to sleep	I booked this hotel because it was at such a great deal. I knew it would be small but I was OK with that because of the price. The room was just big enough to walk around the bed and became a bit cramped with two people. There wasn't really anywhere to store luggage and if you sat at the desk, your guest could not fit to walk by to the bathroom. I would recommend this room to someone who does not plan to stay in the room very much. The biggest problem that I had, is that I never got to take a warm shower. The boiler broke and they had sent people there every day to fix it. It would work at night but when you woke up, the shower would be ice cold. After 4 nights of dealing with the shower, I had to cancel the final 3 nights of the reservation. There were a couple of other issues that are notable. The TV only had about 20 channels and three of those were Bravo, some did not have sound and a couple of the channels like HBO were on the same freeze frame. Also, the room did not have a thermostat so you could not control the heat. There was a widow AC unit. Also, if you plan on sleeping in late, I would not recommend this hotel because the windows are not sound proofed. The traffic noise begins around 7 AM each day. On a positive note, the room was very clean and the staff was nice. The check in and checkout process was not very long. On this trip, I changed my reservation to Hilton Garden Inn, which is about a block and a half away and I would recommend this hotel instead of the Econo Lodge. The room is at least 2 1/2 times larger, the widows are sound proofed, the room has a fridge and microwave and there's more furniture and closets to store your clothes and luggage. There's an ice machine on each floor and they have several fast elevators unlike the Econo Lodge. The staff let us check in before 11 AM even though the reservation was at 3PM. I got this room cheaper than the Econo Lodge on CheapTickets only because we booked it the day of. When researching this trip, the Hilton was about $30 more expensive a night but worth it.	
Apr 18 2008 	Awesome!	My daughter and I just got back and will stay here when we go back to NYC! Inexpensive (got it for $159 on the hotel website), near everything, friendly staff, free breakfast, free USA Today at your door in the morning, room service response in 2 minutes, nice hard water pressure in shower, free chips and water in the room.........I could go on. The hotel is about 2 blocks off the bright lights and bustle of Times Square, but it was actually a quiet little residential area without a lot of outside noise. Breakfast was great : coffee, juice, tea, cocoa, oatmeal, croissants, bagels with cream cheese or jellies, danishes, muffins, cereals -- lots to pick from. No, there are not tables to eat at, we just brought the stuff back up to our room. They give you discount coupons for a great restaurant around the corner on Restaurant Row when you check in. The bed was comfortable. Yes, the room is tiny, but my daughter and I walked around in it just fine. What are you doing in your hotel room anyway, cartwheels?? Subway is a couple of blocks up and there are tons of restaurants all around. 24-hr Pharmacy right next door, just in case. The only thing negative that happened to us was no hot water one morning. We went out and about and did a few touristy things, came back 2 hours later and it was all fixed. Plus, there are many reviews that mention a slow elevator - we did not think so at all. Clean, comfy, good area (felt totally safe walking at night), good price. Thanks Econolodge!!	
Apr 14 2008 	Cozy Clean and Affordable!	My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights at the Econo Lodge and it was by far the most for our money - and in NYC, you will need the extra money! The room was SMALL (10x10!) but the bed was big and very comfortable, and they made good use of the space. There was a small desk where we were able to store snacks that we brought. The TV was mounted on the wall, but easily viewed from the bed. There was a small armoire (we stored our luggage on top of it) with a few hangers and 2 drawers, and the safe was digital and free to use. There was a shelf above the sink in the bathroom to store cosmetics, and the shower was average-sized. The hotel was VERY clean! Our bed was made and our bathroom was cleaned and restocked every day. The free breakfast was also great - bagels, pastries, coffee, juice, oatmeal, hot chocolate, and fruit. However, there was no microwave or toaster. The staff was extremely pleasant. When we arrived, we found out that they charge to hold luggage - $3 per bag. They told us our room would probably be ready in an hour - so we decided to wait in the lobby - and our room was ready in 20 minutes! The elevator was slow, but they were doing maintenance on it when we left! The location couldn't be better! The only semi-negative thing I can say is that there is an Irish Pub/Bar directly across from the hotel and you can hear people all night (as well as traffic and sirens from the busy street around the corner) -- but, that's all part of the true NYC experience! I felt very safe and will definitely stay here again - the value can't be beat (AND you get breakfast!). However, I would recommend that only 1-2 people share a room. Have fun!	
Apr 7 2008 	Fab location at a Fab price!	We booked this hotel based on the positive Trip Advisor contributions.Everyone says that the location is FAB - and it is. It's only 2 blocks from Times Square; across the road you book Gray Line tours; it's just uptown from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It's local to all theatres which was important to us as we were 2 women who wanted to see some shows and feel safe walking back to our hotel. It's in a safe area.Everyone says that the rooms are small - and they are. We took the advice of a previous contributor and booked a disabled room. I think it was a little larger but not by much.The hotel staff are helpful and friendly and the breakfast was always well supplied and topped up. We left one morning for a tour at 6am and breakfast was already available - although they did inform us the it opened at 7am.We were able to leave our luggage with them - $3 a bag - on the day of our departure as we had an evening flight.On the downside, we did find it to be in a noisy location. There were sirens all through the night; the pub opposite seemed to have a lot of very noisy patrons who always left in a loud manner; people came up the street with their stereo on full volume all night long. There was no way of blocking the sound as we were there when it was cold so putting on the noisy air con was not an option. I suggest ear plugs if you want a good nights sleep. By night 4, we were so tired that sleeping was easy even with the noise.We were very impressed with New Yorkers who we found to be approachable and helpful - not what we expected at all. The subways were very clean and we always felt safe. Unlike London subways which are hot and dirty all day long.I'd recommend this because it's a safe location for a reasonable price.	
Mar 26 2008 	Excellent Location	The staff were friendly and the location fab!Although the rooms are on the smaller side the bed was very comfortable and it was exceptionally clean and tidy. The maids came in every day.If you are looking for a budget place to stay in NYC then this is it....I mean why pay hundreds for your hotel room when there is so much to do in NY!Leone &amp; Ryan - London	
Mar 25 2008	Gem of a deal!!	First off we want to say that the reviews were wonderful and instrumental in our choosing these accommodations. As a result, there were no negative &quot;surprises&quot;. We were only in the city for one night and the accommodations were not our primary focus. We attended two Broadway shows and wanted a place that was convenient to the Theater district, the Port Authority (since we were coming in from the Poconos by bus) and reasonably priced.Hotels and Discounts also offered a special discount which was an added plus! We arrived in the city about 1pm-----------the check-in was for 3pm. Fully expecting to just check our bag before the show---we stopped by the Hotel. We were pleasantly surprised that the gracious staff allowed us to check-in early (avoiding the customary bag check fee)!! Had enough time to stash our things in the room and proceed to the show. The room was TINY, but we fully expected that (do not stay here if you are claustrophobic!). It was comfortable and clean-----loved the magnifying mirror in the bathroom!!!! Perfect for applying makeup.The following morning we had to be at a TV studio----left around 5:45am and were surprised to see that the continental breakfast was already available----------we thought for sure we'd miss it! We would recommend this hotel and would stay there again on a short term basis. Color us Happy Campers!!!	
Mar 23 2008 	Small but no other complaints	Just returned from a two night stay at Econo Lodge Times Square. Most of the reviews you read here are dead on. The hotel is really clean and the location is perfect for exploring NY. The hotel offers free bottled water and the continental breakfast has an above-average selection (bagels, muffins, danish, cereal, coffee, juice, etc.). The cons are a VERY small room and a VERY slow elevator. Hey, it is the ECONO lodge, what do you expect? For us, the hotel was well worth the $145 a night and the pros far outweighed the cons.	
Mar 20 2008 	Great but tiny	Econo Lodge is in a fantastic location for exploring New York. Just 2 blocks from Times Square and a short walk from Rockerfeller Centre with hundreds of great restaurants within easy reach - you couldn't ask for a better location.However, the rooms are very small - the double bed all but filled it - so not much room for luggage, etc. Nevertheless, the bed was comfortable, there was a small wardrobe and desk in each room and a compact but functional bathroom with a good shower. Despite the location, noise wasn't a problem for us. We just kept the window shut and turned on the air con unit when the room got too hot at night (being March, this was as a result of the heating from the hotel, rather than the weather!)The rooms and corridors are kept clean and tidy, and a range of bagels, croissants, fruit, etc are served as the complementary breakfast, although there's no breakfast room, as such - just a few chairs in the lobby area. Having said that, there was always somewhere to sit while we were there.The staff was helpful and friendly and available round the clock. There's also internet access available in the lobby and somewhere to store your luggage for a few dollars on the day you check out.The only problem was that the lift is very slow, and occasionally ground to a halt with more than 4 passengers. Not good for those prone to claustrophobia! All in all a good little hotel in a fabulous location...and, after all, you won't be spending much time in your hotel room, will you?For the price, you'll struggle to find better in such a prime location.	
Mar 18 2008 	Fantastic	We have spend a lovely holliday in the lodge. The people were very nice. The breakfast ok and we enjoyed the coffeemaker in the lounge. The room was small, But it was very clean and everything we needed was there.Thanks a lot for a very nice holliday.Greetings from the Netherlands.	
Mar 12 2008 	Great hotel with a great price	We just returned back to Scandinavia from this hotel. We stayed 5 nights in this adorable hotel. The hotels is average quality for Europeans and was a lot of better than I expected. The room is not that small as I expected, it is bigger than a cruise ship room. We had a room from the fourth floor. The hotel included free wireless internet (which worked pretty good), bag of snacks and local paper. The hotel has a great location, specially for tourists. The hotel was super clean.Only bad thing in this hotel was that sometimes in breakfeast table, there was nothing left anymore (eveh there should have been) and also the firestation across the street.(which can be pretty loud). We at least woke up at 5 am couple of times, because the firetrucks tend to use their loud horns instead of sirens, but hey, that is New York - bring your earplugs or headphones! Also that it got a bit cold sometimes in this hotel in March and they did not really have a &quot;real blanket&quot; so you have to sleep in a bit warmer clothes. Don't understand me wrong, those are only little things. When you want to visit New York and pay less for the hotel, you should book the hotel from Econo Lodge. Almost every hotel with 50-100 USD / fare / per day are around the same quality than this hotel. So don't bother to look better one :) I did that already for you.	
Mar 9 2008	Small but clean	We stayed for three days before leaving on a cruise. The room was small, but very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is great. We were able to walk or take a bus/subway to anywhere we wanted to go. The breakfast was good with enough of everything to get you started on your day.	
Feb 26 2008 	Fantastic Hotel!!! Definately stay again!!	ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS HOTEL!! If you are having any doubts about staying here, dont have. It is a really good hotel for the price, excellent staff and fantastic location. Only one block from times square, and your on the street right next to all the major broadway shows!! starbucks is just across the street, 24hr pharmacy beside where you can get anything you need. Cant beat the location. I had to check into this hotel because the accomodation i had previously booked wasnt suitable. Although this hotel was very popular and almost all full, the staff found me a room and even gave me a room on the top floor (floor 6) when i requested it. They were all incredibly helpful and friendly. The hotel is very clean and beautifully decorated. There is 24hr complimentary tea and coffee at reception, and a gorgeous continential breakfast in the morning. 24hr internet access also available. The only negative side would be that the rooms are very tight, but u get what u pay for, and they were very clean!! The bathrooms are the same. There is also a safe in your room and a T.V. which shows around 30 channels, and you get complimentary crisps and bottled water in your room when you arrive. Also, in your room information book you get a 10% discount voucher for the gift shop right next door, which is great as the prices are already very good! As a young, single traveller i felt very safe here, and would definately stay again.	
Feb 19 2008 	I knew what I was getting into	Yes I did. Or so I thought. Well I'm here to give you the stright up truth. No candy coating here.We arrived on a Friday night around midnight and had no trouble getting checked in to room 508. But, thre was one problem at check in. They couldn't give us our room key! The card reader was down and was supposed to be fixed the next day. OK, no problem. Got to our room. Yes, the elevator takes forever like everyone has stated. You could honestly walk up faster. The room is postage stamp size. Actually a similar size to a small cruise ship room. Barely enough room to go around the bed sideways. I'm not kidding. Oh well, knew that coming in too. Friend of mine in NY said that if your door doesn't hit your bed when you come in the room then you have a big room. LOL! But here's where I draw the line. So, it's around 1am and the wife &amp; I turn down the sheets only to find the most horrible stains ever! Disgusting. So we had to sleep on top of the bed sheets since we were really tired and already showered.Next AM, told front desk and they changed them right away for us and gave us a discount card to a restaurant (we never went). Still no keys available. Also, window unit sounded like it was powered by hamsters. Too loud, had to shut off.Saturday night keys became available! But when we came back to the room Sunday we were locked out. Oh yeah, they forgot to tell us that everyday you have to have the room card rekeyed. No big deal if not for the turtle of an elevator they have.And then Sunday night got into the elevator with 3 other couples and got stuck in there for 10 minutes. Won't go up and won't open. Had to use emergency button and then it opened. Funniest thing was girl at counter who said &quot;Oh you're all back down&quot;. LOL! No we never left! Hey for the $129 a night we paid I got what I expected. A bagel and coffee in the AM, a room I'd be livid with anywhere else but NYC, a great location, &amp; a friendly staff. So I give it mixed reviews.Don't come expecting the Ritz. But if you just need a place to lay your head, take a shower, etc. then it's great. By the way, don't plan on bringing a lot of luggage. You won't have room to put it anywhere. Dos - Try Brazil Brazil restaurant, Beer House, go to Top of the Rock at night, see Wicked Don'ts - eat at Roxy Deli - very overrated, $47 for meat loaf sandwich and small pizza only, worry about safety - cops everywhere all the time, worry if you left something at home - drug store on the cornerHave fun in NYC!	
Feb 17 2008 	A good deal	I stayed here for 5 nights while in NY with friends. I was the only one who chose to stay here and I think I made the wisest choice. We all stayed in the Times Square area and the EconoLodge was one of the least expensive hotels. I found it to be clean, adequate, well located, and a good deal. Although the room was very small it was very clean; the TV and wireless worked well. I liked that there was a safe in the room. The continental breakfast was mostly grocery store bought pastries but the coffee, tea and fruit were good for getting out and about in the morning. I found the staff to be friendly and informative. Cabs were easy to get. I saw some other hotels rooms priced about the same and although they were larger the amenities I wanted (wireless, safe, breakfast) were missing. There was something funky going on with the hallwasy while I was there- wires and pipes sticking out in odd places.	
Feb 13 2008	Small Value	Nothing new to add on the size - rooms are minuscule. Nothing in Times Square comes close to this value, however. Be aware it is not plush at all - it's the kind of place with worn wallpaper, where hallway door slams reach your room and you hear sirens and street noise all night long (get as high a floor as possible). That said, who goes to NYC to stay in their room, so we will stay again. Bring earplugs and enjoy the city while saving money.	
Jan 31 2008 	Great value for NY!	I spent 5 nights at the Econolodge during a busy Canada day/4th of July week, and was left with a good impression all-around for what the hotel was. Given that it's in New York and rooms are typically small and over-priced, this hotel was quite impressive and most certainly a good value. Small room?......yes, but passable. Definitely not over priced (I recall paying $171 plus tax). And very much clean and well-maintained.The staff were friendly and efficient during check-in/out, the hotel was in excellent repair and well presented.The elevator was slow....but given the age of the building and that it's in NY, it was passable.Aside from being small, the room was good...... clean, nice beds, plasma TV, good A/C, well-lit, etc.The continental breakfast consisted of muffins, cereal, toast, and juice (which was good, but in short supply....so I'd recommend going down to the lobby early).All in all, the hotel was an excellent value and had a great location. It's no Ritz Carleton or Crowne Plaza, but certainly above-average for the price and location. We are actually going to be staying there again for 5 or 6 nights this June, in fact.	
Dec 27 2007 	Tiny room great location	My sister and I took a spur of the moment trip to NYC in May and stayed here. The hotel is in an excellent location, close to transportation, Times Square and restaurants and shops. The staff was friendly and helpful, continental breakfast was great, the room was clean. The only downside was the tiny, tiny room. But, you can't beat the price.	
Dec 23 2007 	Best Deal for the price	The econolodge provides free wi-fi internet access, free continental breakfast. The room was very clean. The only downside was that the room was only about 8ft. by 8ft. so it mad it difficult with the luggage, however there was a luggage stand that made it more convenient. The shower worked perfectly and had very good pressure, i actually liked it better than my shower at home. The hotel is only a minute away from time square if you walk. There is a subway station only 5 minutes walk. I nice hotel especially for the price. Maybe the only hotel this cheap that offers continental breakfast and a clean private room with bathroom.	
Dec 13 2007	Loved this hotel	My sister and I visited New York last week to see all the Christmas Decorations. After much research we chose this hotel basically because of the price, but it turned out to be the best location and the friendliest staff. The room was a bit small but very clean. I would recommend this place to anyone.	
Dec 9 2007 	Enjoyed Our Stay	Room looked exactly as seen on this site, so don't be suprised by how TINY the room is, it is very, very small. It was myself and my mom, and we both could not walk in the room at the same time, despite the tiny space, the room and bathroom was immaculate, we even noticed our sheets were changed daily, you don't find that too often. The staff from the young lady that checked us in, to the housekeepers, to the young man that retrieved our bags on our last day, to the security man were all very pleasant, and all voiced their willingness to do what they could to make our stay special. The location is AWSOME! You are in walking distance to all of Times Square, 15 minute walk to Central Park, 10 minute walk to Rockerfellar Center, and 5th Ave, and subway station 5 minute walk. The only draw back was we visited with temps outside around 28 degrees, even colder with wind chill, and although we welcomed a warm room, being a small space, it became too hot and stuffy most nights, as we were unable to control our own heat. Would definitely stay again.	
Nov 8 2007 	Great Location	This was our first time in New York and I was quiet happy with the choice of Econo Lodge. We stayed in a handicap room so we had alittle more room but a double bed. Location, staff and cleaniness of the room was all great just as previous reviews. The elevator was alittle slow. Only problem was outside noise when trying to sleep but if want the location you will have to put up with it. Will stay again	
Nov 5 2007 	Will stay here again	We had a wonderful weekend in NYC and enjoyed our stay at Econo Lodge very much. We arrived earlier than expected and hoped they would just hold our bags for us, but they told us that if we could wait 15 minutes they would have our room ready and they did. The staff was very helpful with our many tourist questions and directions. The location was fine for walking to our Broadway Show (we saw The Color Purple and it was GREAT!) There are good places to eat and buy souveniers right next door. We really liked Carve (across the street on 8th) they have good pizza, sandwiches and desserts at really good prices. I'm not a big fan of continental breakfasts and Carve had a great breakfast sandwich for around $3. We knew about the small rooms from the reviews on this website, so we were prepared for that and it wasn't a big deal. We had 3 people in our room and it was tight, but we were only there to sleep and shower. We are very grateful to the staff for holding our luggage for us on our last day. We checked out on a Saturday morning to go to Connecticut to visit family and when we came back to the city the next day we had nowhere to store our bags. One quick call to the Econo Lodge and our problem was solved. They held the bags for us all day for $3 per bag. We will definitely be back!	
Oct 28 2007 	Great for the price	Very small room, but 1 block from Time Square. Very, very clean and the shower pressure was great. For a 1 or two night stay with no more then two people, I would do it again. Staff was very nice. Just a perfect location!	
Oct 14 2007	small but clean	I've read reviews of this hotel before and the overall comment was that they are small rooms....let me say they are VERY small rooms. But they are clean, and the water pressure is great. The elevators are slow though. The breakfast is adequate. The location is AWESOME! And the staff is super friendly. It's right near a drug store too! And not far from the subway - and across the street from Greyline. Honestly, although the rooms are VERY small (no closet - but a dresser where you can hang things, and an ironing board), the beds are comfy. Oh, there are window air conditioning units. And the street noises can be a bit loud at times. Here's the deal....if you are looking for a reasonable hotel rate in NYC and don't plan on hanging in your room, this is the place for you! (and I'm a picky hotel person!)	
Oct 6 2007 	Clean nice staff.. very small	Stayed there on Oct. 4th:Pros:Very Nice StaffLocation, location, location, locationNice PriceClean roomsGood continental breakfastCoffee 24 hours per daycomfortable bedsCons:Postage stamp size roomsvery slow elevator	
Sep 25 2007 	Happy Part-Time New Yorkers	Having stayed close to Times Square last year this was a perfect choice in terms of location, just 2 blocks from Times Square. I found the hotel to be modern, clean and comfortable. The room facilities were in good working order. Not denying the rooms are small - but your never in. Breakfast was a bonus with a good selection including cereals, pastries, bagels - cream cheese or jams, fruit juices. Coffee and tea was also available all day. The best thing about this hotel was the service received from the staff on reception. They were so friendly and helpful, nothing was a problem. They enquired various times on line to answer our queries and suggested various eateries, bars and ways to get around. I would and have recommended this hotel to many people. Value for money was superb compaired to alot in NYC also. Location location location.......Thanks for a superb stay - Lynda and Diane	
Sep 21 2007 	I Love NYC!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Econolodge Times Square last September for 3 nights. We loved the location ... it was less than a 5 minute walk to everything. (i.e Times Square, TKTS, broadway theatres, Restaurant row) .. the subway is a short walk away ... the hotel is located on 47th st. just north of 8th Ave ... times square is on 7th ave.. so the location is PERFECT. It isnt too loud at all ... the rooms are quite small .. very tight and no room to walk around, just enough for the bed, a small desk, and the washroom .. but it didnt matter .. cuz we werent there for the room ... its clean and upgraded so its great. The free continental breakfast was really good and really saved us some money ... which helped with the more expensive dinners and bar (Blue Fin in Times Square) we went to. We watched Hairspray and Beauty and the Beast ... both wonderful!). Shopping is great and subway pretty easy to use. I also went to NYC a few months earlier and stayed somewhere else (on 10th Ave.) and the room was alot bigger, but further away from the action. Anyway, we love it there and are going again this October for 2 nights and we staying at the Econolodge again. I will post photos on my next review. I can't wait. I love NYC!	
Sep 20 2007 	Unbelievably loud	Unbelievably loud because of bad window/AC design. The window is open to accommodate the AC unit, and cardboards are placed around the AC unit so wind doesn't blow into the room. Needless to say, cardboards do not filter noise, so the experience is as if you were literally on the street. This is pretty outrageous considering the hotel is located on Times Square, which is pretty noisy day in, day out. It is even more outrageous considering that there is a bar right across the street that plays jazz till 4AM. I called the hotel staff to complain, and they told me that it was normal, and that I should live with it. If I didn't have earplugs, I wouldn't have slept at all.Secondly, the bed sheets had big black stains on them, which I realized when I was about to go to sleep. When I complained about this to the hotel staff, they sent someone that handed me new sheets. The new sheets had the same stains, and that person told me that there was no housecleaning service at night and that I was supposed to replace the bedding myself. He left, and while replacing the bedding I realized that the new sheets he gave me were in fact small for my bed! I was too tired to complain again.In summary, I went there because of the good reviews, only to be very disappointed. I will not go there again.	
Sep 5 2007 	Good things come in small packages!	We'd seen the reviews which mentioned the small rooms, and small our room was. However we had everything we needed! and as somebody else said, we hadn't gone to New York to stay in our room. The room was clean and tidy and everything worked. Breakfast was better than we anticipated, held in the small lobby. Staff were very helpful and friendly, and the location of the hotel is excellent. We would happily stay there again, and the next time we visit New York we probably will. Good value for money!	
Aug 16 2007	Thanks to everyone for posting the prior information	Thanks to everyone for posting the prior information. Here is my information to help future guests:A 24-Hour Drug store is across the street (get a store card for extra savings). Try the fresh fruit cart stand on the corner. We enjoyed having fruit for snacks.We had two rooms for our family of four but I still had to go to the lobby to enjoy my laptop since the rooms are so small  Tiny Rooms! But, the staff was very helpful.We saw 2 plays (Color Purple &amp; Forbidden Broadway). The Theater that showed Forbidden Broadway was right next door to our hotel. I talked to a theater employee just before the show and got discount tickets. We decided not to pay $600 for the four of us to see the Lion King. Our only regret was that we did not eat at any of the restaurants at restaurant row on 46th Street (directly around the corner). We eat at the major restaurants with the higher NYC prices for same food that we could have had at home. Again, we should have tried something different since we were already paying higher prices for food in NYC.	
Aug 8 2007 	location location location	A great location! A very small hotel, with very small rooms, but you don't go to NYC to spend time in your room!	
Jun 15 2007	Great Value - Perfect location for tourists	We really enjoyed out stay at the Econo Lodge. It was the perfect location to do all of the tourist-y type things in NYC. Yes, the room was small - but it was cozy, clean, cool and comfortable. We were literally only there to sleep and we zonked out each night! Great water pressure in the shower, the breakfast was a great way to start off the day and the front desk service was fast, courteous and knowledgeable. Don't miss all of the great restaurants on 46th - known as Restaurant Row. Much better than the chains you find in Times Square. If I were going to do all of the tourist-y things again in NYC - I would stay here again in a HEARTBEAT. However, if you are looking for more of a true NYC living experience - spend more for a place in SoHo or Greenwich.	
Jun 11 2007 	As before great location/great staff	Yes, rooms are small but cozy for 2 people. Clean comfortable and updated. The 'white' noise of the air conditioner drowns out most of the street noise, so I didn't find that a problem. Temperature was easily controlled. And the best part, close to theatres. Easily within walking distances of many attractions and restaurants. Suffice to say, how nice is it to be able to walk back to your hotel room and rest for a bit before continuing the day. The staff friendly, and helpful. Breakfast was nice but with so many unique eateries close by, why bother? But it's nice to be able to grab a coffee/orange juice though. Coffee 24/7. Starbucks in right across the street. Free Wi-Fi is a nice touch also, daily charges for wifi add up quickly. There is 1 stand for a suitcase, so my suitcase had to stay on the floor. Really, there's not room for 2 suitcases. But I didn't mind, better the wife to be happy and for all you couples you know what I mean. Flat screen TV is nice, tucked above and out of the way. But if you travel to NYC, who watches TV anyway (oh wait, weather channel). Armoire is small, so make sure most of your clothes are folded as not to wrinkled. But there is an abbreviated ironing board and iron, nice touch. Overall, I would stay here again. Good price, great location, friendly staff. Easy to access subways, buses, bicycle taxis, taxis. Elevator, bring a book to read. Slow. I was on the 5th floor. But walking stairs is great exercise so not a problem. Bathroom is akin to an average house hallway full bath, not large but not overty tiny.	
Jun 10 2007 	Good things come in small packages	Yes, this room was small, but you are not in the room very much. We had an excellent stay here. The room and hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly. Just one block away from Time Square,which makes it very convenient. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and we would have no problem staying here again.	
Jun 8 2007 	Great location great staff tiny rooms	I quite liked my stay at the Econo Lodge Times Square, especially since affordable rooms were hard to find for the week I was in NYC. But I wouldn't stay here with someone else. The rooms are tiny -- perfect for a solo traveler who's not planning to spend oodles of time in the hotel, but it seems to me it would be unbearable with two people in the room.My room was spotless, the bed was comfy, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect for a tourist -- close to subways, a 24-hour Duane Reade, and of course, a Starbucks.  And blessedly, the air conditioning worked perfectly!I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, unless I was looking for a room for two.	
Jun 7 2007 	Good deal-Agree with the cruise ship analogy	Stayed here during this past Memorial Day Weekend. Hotel is well characterized in previous reviews. The staff is very friendly and courteous. Location is excellent, especially for the price. Well within walking distance of Times Square and subway stations. Did not see anything wrong with the particular block on which the hotel is located. Fire station adjacent to the property was a little noisy, but not terrible.Room was very small, but this was expected after reading previous reviews. Likewise, the elevator is painfully slow. Notwithstanding, the hotel appeared clean, as did our room. Staff responded quickly to requests i.e. for extra towels. Free breakfast was minimal, but decent enough to where it seemed a better option than going out and spending $20 at the nearby bakery on 8th Avenue.Liked the analogy of the room being a bit larger than that found on a cruise ship. However, like a cruise ship, when in New York you really spend minimal time in your hotel room anyway. Therefore, for the price, this hotel offers a great way for budget travelers to experience the sights and sounds of Uptown Manhattan.	
Jun 5 2007 	Enjoy tiny cruise ship rooms? You'll love this hotel!	If you look at a photo of a room online, remember: the camera always adds ten pounds! This room is literally the size of the bed plus a foot on each side and nine inches at the foot of the bed. There is no closet, only a cupboard barely large enough for children's clothes. No room for large luggage. You have to stand right by the door to get dressed because it's the only spot where you can actually turn around while standing. My husband and I had to take turns stepping away to let the other pass to move anywhere. Yes, it's clean. Yes, the staff is nice. Yes, it's a block from Times Square. But, unless you're 1) alone, 2) with no hanging clothes or sizeable luggage, and 3) VERY thin, this may not be the place for you!	
Jun 4 2007 	Great value wonderful staff	I have stayed at the Econo Lodge twice in the last couple of months.It offers clean, safe lodging, in a location central to the theatre district and many NYC sights. Several subway lines are within easy walking distance. The rooms indeed are very tiny, even by New York standards. However, the rooms I've had have been very clean, and the furnishings and TV were newer and in good repair. The front desk staff have been super friendly and helpful. Both times I was able to get an early check-in with only a short wait. Water and snacks (smallbags of chips) are provided in the rooms and I was offered free replacements upon request. The continental breakfast is served in a small area in the small lobby, but the selections covered all the basics and included some really good pastries. Wireless internet is free, generally available, but sometimes very low speed. All in all, a good choice for those wanting safe, clean, central accomodations at a reasonable price for New York.	
May 21 2007 	what you read here is true	I just returned from 2 nights at the Econolodge Times Square and read all of the comments about this hotel (good and bad). I must say they are all pretty accurate from the small rooms to slow elevator to friendly desk staff, etc. The comments about the scary bar across the street and bad area at night are not true. Both were perfectly fine.I stayed here for the price and that is what you'll need to keep in mind during your stay. The bed and the bathroom were clean (the carpet wasn't so nice), but they weren't luxurious by any means.This is truly a room you sleep and shower in and then leave (especially if there are two of you).And yes, Times Square and most of the theaters are only a block away. The hotel is at 47th and there are subway stops at 50th and 42nd.Lastly, we didn't know it till the last day of our stay, but 46th street one block down is called &quot;Restaurant Row&quot; (on the street sign). It's filled with the most amazing restaurants--if you like food you should go there. Go to --- to check it out!!I'd stay here again, but only for the price. If I could get something better for the same rate I take it.	
May 14 2007 	Fantastic Bargain Find!	This hotel is situated only 1 1/2 blocks from Times Square...what a perfect location. ...and close to the subways in two directions. Please note that all hotel rooms (sans the $500.00 ones) in New York City are small and this is no exception. Nevertheless, the room was spotlessly clean (only 2 years old we think), had a plasma TV, USA Today paper delivered daily, and included a free breakfast. The breakfast was a stepped up continental: cereal, local fresh made bagels and butter croissants (not the stale packaged ones), other pastry delights, hot cereal, and fruit. PLus, the fruit (nice afternoon snack), coffee, &amp; tea were there 24 hrs a day. What distinguished this property from other NYC hotels is that the hotel staff went overboard to assist: bottled water whenever we needed it at no charge, directions, etc. All in all, we enjoyed our stay due to the friendliness and price of this hotel. We recommend it without reservations after reading about other NYC hotels with rats, bedbugs, etc. We didn't even see one bug!	
May 13 2007 	Excellent Choice	I stayed at this hotel March 2nd-9th 2007. This hotel is a really great location to stay at if you are going to NYC to see Broadway shows and want to be close to the stores and action of Times Square. The area by this hotel is filled with convenient deli's, drugstores, gift shops and restaurants. True, there were a few peep show/adult video type stores in the area, but there were police always around and I never felt unsafe walking around at night alone. All in all, this area had a very &quot;tourist friendly&quot; feel to it, and there were always tons of people walking around. I saw several Broadway shows and enjoyed being able to easilly walk to each venue without needing a taxi. There was some construction work being done on a building across the street, but the noise was mostly during the day and was not obtrusive in any way. This hotel is located near to a fire station and the sirens, in a great &quot;short blips&quot; kind of siren way, were always a part of the sound ambience at all times. I slept great every night and the car and street noise was never a problem. The beds were very comfortable. About the rooms, true they are small. So, prepare yourself for a little laugh when you walk in, but you will see that these rooms are very well planned out, and they are very functional. The room I had was absolutely perfect for one, and would be a little tight for 2 people, but still very manageable. There is not much room for a lot of suitcases! There was one nice freestanding closet with a room safe in it. The bed took up most of the room but was very comfortable. The pillows were soo nice and very soft! The decor is upscale and the room was very, very clean. The flat screen tv, which is moveable and can be adjusted to be at just the right angle while flipping channels in bed, was a delight. There are many lamp options in the room too, so good lighting was a plus as well. The bathroom, although really small, had great water pressure and even the upscale amenity of a little vanity kit with cotton balls, q-tips and an emery board. The shampoo/conditioner and lotion were very nice Herbal Essence brand. The towels were very soft and smelled like fresh laundry. The only negative note I have about the bathroom was that if you like nice lathering or scented soap, bring your own! The bars they provide are wafer thin, not very scented, and so dry they break in half if you drop them. There was a nice adjustable and reversible magnifying and regular mirror. The snack bag of chips, two mints, and bottled water provided every day were perfect for a snack on the go. The breakfast is very nice and I recommend using the tray from your room to carry items back to your room to eat. The croissants were huge and the muffins delicious. This was a really nice bonus to have breakfast provided since everything is really pricey in NYC. Breakfast was available from 7am til 10am. It was a nice security feature that they re-keyed the door keys every day too. There was an atm in the (small) lobby and a computer for online access (for a fee). The Duane-Reade drugstore right across the street has everything you could ever want in case you forget anything. The was a bit of a downside not having a mini fridge in the room, that would have been convenient. Anyway, this hotel was the perfect location for seeing Broadway plays and for roaming very reasonable walking distances to Times Square and Midtown Manhattan. It feels safe, is in a good area surrounded by gift shops, bars, restaurants and cafes. I would definately stay here again.	
May 7 2007 	Great Bargain Hotel!	After reading other reviews, I braced myself for the small room and it was as I expected it! However, the two of us quickly got over that and enjoyed our stay here. The room was very clean and was laid out well. The staff was efficient and friendly. One of the front desk staff even offered to walk over to 8th avenue to hail us a taxi after we told her of the problems we had getting one. During our 4 day &amp; 3 night stay we never had a problem with the elevator as it came promptly. The complimentary breakfast was awesome with nice and ample choices of bagels, pound cake, fruit, juices, coffee &amp; tea. I highly recommend this hotel for up to 2 people per room who will be doing a bunch of out-of-room activities! You won't be disappointed.	
May 2 2007 	Loved it!	this place was great. Whether you're a tourist looking to see the whole city or just there for a night in manhattan, it's a great hotel to stay at. the rooms are really small, but very tidy. The location is amazing, centrally located and right next to times square! the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. i would definitely stay there again.	
Mar 30 2007 	Loved this place!	This place was wonderful! The staff went out of the way to help us. My Father is in a wheelchair and its hard for him to get around, but the staff was so considerate and helpful for us. Anything we needed they did. We stayed 4 nights, and not one night do I have anything negative to say!I've been all over the United States and have never felt so pleased. Yes, the rooms were small, but what are you looking for?? your home?? not going to happen. It's located near everything you could ever want to see or need. Thank You to the staff!!	
Mar 25 2007	Great hotel	This hotel was wonderful.... great location great location and clean clean clean.. the staff were more than helpful with directions etc. I would highly recommend this hotel, price is great and the hotel is very clean.. I don't think you'll find a better bargain in this city... I will be back.. only drawback the rooms are very small as stated..not much room to move, however, we spent all out time on the streets, it was perfect for us..	
Mar 9 2007 	Wow! I am recommending this hotel to all of my friends.	Great location, fantastic staff, tons of amenities....I hope it stays like this at the same great rate! If so, we will definitely stay at this hotel whenever we go to Manhattan. The room was small and cozy, there was always a Free bottled water and bag of chips waiting in our room, Free wi-fi (although the connection is a bit weak, but it costs nothing so what can you say). We arrived on a Saturday and stayed until Monday. We saw different staff and they were all extremely friendly and helpful. The FREE continental breakfast was fresh and very tasty...which is rare for most continental breakfasts. The room was very neat and clean, maids were nice....the hotel has been completely renovated and is in wonderful condition.	
Mar 7 2007 	Nightmare on West 47th Street	I used to read the stories about other peoples nightmarish travel experiences with a certain amount of indifference, but after my recent stay at the Econo Lodge at Time Square in NYC, Ive definitely developed a lot more compassion for those individuals.Through all of my travels and stays at hotels, I have never experienced such a complete disregard for customers and their needs, and the worse part it was that although Id tried to reach the manager of the hotel, Ronica, throughout my stay, each time, I was given a response that she hadnt arrived at work (this being 10:00am on Friday morning) or that shed already left (at 4:30pm on the same day), and when Id asked whether she would be in during the weekend, the receptionist only responded by telling me that She doesnt really have a fixed schedule.	
Mar 5 2007 	Depends on what you are looking for	Stayed for 2 nights in queen room on 2nd floor. Very tiny but tolerable. Half the size of a cruise ship cabin and then add a bathroom. Location is awesome, price was great ($115 per night). Property is super clean. Breakfast is grab and go but fresh and free. Downside- the room was like a sauna. We had the window open and the air conditioner on. Asked front desk to turn down heat (you cannot control it from your room) never seemed to happen. You would think in March &quot;too hot&quot; wouldn't be an issue. Friends had corner room with 2 doubles, a bit more room and cooler due to three windows. Not recommended for menopausal women!!!! Everyone else should do ok.	
Feb 20 2007	Great Value Great Location Modest Accommodations	This is one of the best values in New York for the budget conscious. You can't beat the location, and the staff is unusually friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean, but the rooms are laughably small. The queen size bed took up my entire room. The staff seems to be quite security conscious, which is a good thing in NYC. I regularly travel to New York to see theater, and this is my new favorite hotel.	
Feb 15 2007	Great Value	This is a great place for someone visiting New York and just looking for a bed and shower (because that is basically all it is). As many reviews pointed out the rooms are VERY small. My husband and I wanted to stretch after a jog and had to take turns due to lack of space. However, we paid $116 per night with AAA discount and were very happy with what we got. The room was clean (including the bathroom), looked recently updated, and functional. There was a free continental breakfast which was sparse, but we were able to save time by grabbing some oatmeal in the lobby in the morning. Very quick walk to Times Square, Broadway theaters, and loads of restaurants. Highly recommended for New York travelers on a budget.	
Jan 11 2007	Fantastic Location and Hotel!	This hotel was recently gutted and re-done from top to bottom, including granite check-in desk. Every piece of furniture, etc. is brand new. Our room was tiny but beautifully appointed. It is located one block from Times Square with a theater right next door (not connected, construction wise). They serve a fresh continental breakfast and coffee daily (7 days). When your room is cleaned, etc., they leave you bottled water and a little snack. The employees were very nice and couldn't do enough for us. We will definitely return to this hotel!	
Dec 27 2006	Good location	This hotel is excellent value for money with a continental buffet style breakfast included in the price - great for starting out in the morning. Tea, fresh coffee and hot drinks are provided in reception 24 hours a day.Reception staff at the hotel were excellent, extremely friendly and helpful. As pointed out in other reviews the hotel rooms really are TINY! This isn't too much of a problem on a short stay as we spent very little time in our room. We stayed four nights and as we acquired goodies from various shopping trips space became a bit tight , but we managed.The bathroom is again small, if you are of large stature you will struggle! Nevertheless it was very clean with fresh towels and toiletries provided daily. The shower was powerful with plenty of hot water available. The location of the hotel is fantastic and we found we could walk to most places of interest , Times Square, Rockerfeller Centre, Theatre District, Maceys, Empire State, Madison Square Gardens, Central Park. As others have mentioned this location comes at a price! It is very noisy at night with sirens and car horns being sounded well into the small hours so bring your earplugs or make sure you have a large night cap! There are a few negatives with this hotel however it is all about compromise. Yes it is noisy at night, yes the rooms are very small, however, the staff are friendly and helpful, the location is fantastic, for a hotel in the centre of everything the rates are very good! If you don't mind a bit of noise, can cope with a small room, want to be in the centre of everything but not pay a fortune this is the place for you. We had a great time and would stay here again.	
Nov 10 2006 	Small but cheap by NY standards	My friend and I stayed here in October for two nights. Pros:- Cheap, by NYC standards- Location is good- Continental breakfast in the lobby is great for grabbing and running- Front desk staff were very nice- No bad experiences to report- Small armoire to hang clothes and small shelf in the bathroom for toiletries- Flat screen TV on wall works well to save space- A/C worked wellCons:- Room is the size of a shoebox. It's so tiny you just have to laugh- No room to walk around in room. Had to climb over the bed- Elevators slow and small- Had to pay to store bags for the afternoon upon checkoutI suppose I'd stay here again if it was just for the weekend.	
Oct 30 2006	Good Value	Good budget hotel, compact &amp; clean room with reasonable bathroom. Continental breakfast was included in the price.Location on corner of 8th Avenue and 47th Street is excellent for restaurants (can recommend Da Rosina - Italian, in 46th Street) and close to Broadway/Times Square etc.Just one thing - take your ear plugs, as rooms are noisy due to the traffic on 8th and New Yorkers love of their car horns.	
Oct 27 2006 	Great Hotel	Great Hotel! great location, rooms were clean, location was great, and the price was good taking into account the location.	
Oct 10 2006 	Should have paid a little more	I pride myself on finding values and i thought these reviews really showed that I can have a great stay on a budget. But unfortunately, the reality is that these reviews are okay but not the greatest, my experience was that although the space was fairly new, the place was SMALL, even for NYC hotels based on some other rooms I saw (I actually went to other area hotels, like the holiday inn and asked to see the rooms) I am not a big person, average at best, but it was like alice in wonderland, the beds must have been shortened or something, it was like they were a cross between twin and full size, also, there is no closet, no place to hang your stuff, the elevator could not fit my bags in one trip! The bathroom was okay, but no place to put my stuff. the maid service was okay although rushed and they dont do anything to floors, but l actually needed to walk over the bed to get to the other side since there was no room between the bed and the wall. The air conditioner was like spitting in the wind it was so small. location is okay, a little scary at night though, weird bar across the street and people always hounding you as you walk to the hotel entrance.	
Oct 7 2006 	This place is a scam!	Okay, so i finally figured it - this place is a scam - I called the hotel up directly to book a weekend for my wife and I - we are huge econo lodge fans for staying in expensive places like the big apple - but this one needs to be checked out by the franchise - when i called to book the room they said they had a room for the weekend and quoted me a price - when i said i would check on-line - the price immediately dropped - so i checked while still on the phone and sure enough they had a room for about $85 less per night - when I kept on hounding the desk clerk - she said it was the same room but the owners told her to keep rooms a side so that they dont have to pay any franchise tax to the franchise - she offered to book me at the lower rate and told me that when i got their to even ask for a lower price if I paid cash - WHAT KINDA PLACE DOES THAT?	
Sep 30 2006 	Convenient but Cramped	For our three-day vacation, my friend and I chose the Econo Lodge for its location near theaters. It was also convenient to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, one of the drop-off spots used by the Airport Shuttle from JFK (which I would highly recommend if you want to save $ by not getting a cab.) Pros of this hotel include:-A fair price for the theater area. We paid ~180 for a room with two doubles. This included a continental breakfast.-Location near theaters, the overrated restaurant row, and a block from a subway line-Pleasant, helpful desk staff- Clean accommodations with sufficient air conditioning-Breakfast with big NYC bagels, juices, coffee, pastries, and fruit that we took along in our daybags.Cons include:-A small room. I've seen worse, though. For two women, the bathroom storage was inconvenient. Hard to find a place to hang our towels.-A charge for baggage storage. I know this is common, but it would be a nice touch if it were included. When we arrived early afternoon - some rooms were ready, and some weren't. Because our double wasn't, we had to pay for bag storage, and we had to pay for it again on check out day, adding $12 to our bill. More inconvenient than the cost is the lack of a changing space or restroom for waiting guests. We felt a little uncomfortable unzipping our suitcases in the small lobby to get our necessities for sightseeing.-8th Avenue Atmosphere. I you haven't been to the Times Square vicinity before, know that 8th Avenue isn't as polished as Broadway. 8th is full of trinket shops and newsstands and lacks charm. We felt safe, and even went to a few bars near the hotel, but I would be a bit uncomfortable walking the area at night if I were traveling solo.-The Elevator! We took the stairs. Thankfully, we were on the 2nd floor.Consensus: Might be worth it if &quot;Times Square on a budget&quot; is your agenda. But also check into the Holiday Inn Express, Comfort Inn, Super 8, Hotel Edison, and Radio City Apartments. Next time, I I'll try staying in a upper or lower Manhattan and taking the train to see the shows.	
Sep 13 2006 	Great location tiny rooms a little overpriced	We recently stayed at the Econo Lodge Times Square during the US Open. This is a bare bones kind of place, but nonetheless rooms were clean, staff was helpful and the hotel is just around the corner from a lot of good restaurants on 46th Street and also on 9th Ave. Also very closeby to the subway. Only drawback was the room was VERY tiny (the bathtub was about 3/4 the size of your standard tub), but you come to expect this with the budget hotels in Times Square. Fortunately, we didn't spend a lot of time in the room, so this wasn't a problem for us.	
Sep 8 2006	World's biggest cockroach!	We booked at this hotel because of the good reviews, but...when we arrived at 10:00 pm, we found the world's biggest cockroach (about 3&quot;) walking around the bathroom. The front desk sent someone up to remove it but there were no other rooms and it was too late to find another hotel so we spent the night but obviously didn't sleep. The hotel didn't offer a discount or even an apology. Also, the internet cables were too short to allow us to use the computer at the desk and the bed wasn't very comfortable. All this for $225/night. We moved to the Hilton Times Squarefor the rest of our vacation for only $50 more and couldn't be happier.	
Sep 6 2006	Great location friendly staff tiny rooms...probably worth $125.	This hotel has a great central location, right near the heart of midtown Manhattan/Theater District. Many of the most significant tourist sites in NYC are within a 10-20 minute walk. Given the location, it would be very difficult to find anything less expensive with such accessability to so many places. I paid $125 per night (AAA rate), and that seems like a good deal, especially considering the other big-name hotels nearby charge 2 to 4 times more per night. The staff was friendly and helpful; they even let me use their computer to print out my airplane boarding pass. The continental breakfast was modest but tolerable (large muffins, 2 kinds of cereal, packets of instant oatmeal, bananas, apples, bagles, and juice). The room was tiny. I estimate that the room was not much larger than 100 square feet. The king-sized bed took up nearly all of the floor space. Even by NYC standards, this is quite small; however, I suppose that most people who stay here aren't coming to NY to spend a lot of time in a hotel room, so I will gladly sacrifice a little floor space for extra cash to spend out on the town. There was a nice LG flatscreen TV mounted to the wall; however, the lack of remote control made it inconvenient (had to climb across the bed and reach up to change the channel or volume). I did not notice the slowness of the elevator that others have complained about in other postings here; I even counted. From the time I pushed the button for my floor (2nd floor) to the time it reached the floor and opened the door was 9 seconds; perhaps it takes longer for the upper floors, but it wasn't bad at all for the 2nd floor. There was a little noise at night, but it's like that all through the city. Since this hotel is not right on 8th Ave, but rather 100 feet away from the 8th Ave intersection, much of the loud 8th Ave noise didn't reach the hotel. All in all, I would probably stay here again if I were traveling alone (or with spouse), and if I wanted an inexpensive place close to all the sites.	
Aug 31 2006	Central and safe	Booked this hotel for my 18 year daughter and friend. They stayed for 7 nights starting 22/.8/06. Room was small but very clean, and the hotel was only 3 minutes walk from Times Square. Location was excellent. They were both very happy with the hotel, staff were very helpful and friendly and they felt safe.	
Aug 25 2006	way too small but clean	The good:This Hotel is conveniently located on 8th avenue, a block from times square. Its been recently renovated, and therefore everything in the room is new, including a flat screen TV. The Bad:Even for NY standards, the rooms are way too small, especially the double rooms. We had a family of four and if someone needed to go to the bathroom or wanted to leave the room, everyone else had to get completely on the bed to make room. Our room also happened to be facing 8th avenue and it got really loud till past 2am. The continental breakfast consists of cereal, bad bagels (no cream cheese) and Entemens pastries. However, theres no place to eat any of these items as the lobby only contains a front desk and no place to sit. The Ugly:The hotel elevator is so slow, that you really think its stuck at times. We ended up just taking the stairs, (a stuffy hot stairwell) rather than using the elevator.Summary:I think that theyre really trying to make this a nice place to stay, but when they were remodeling should have tried to make the rooms a bit larger. They just try to cram too much into a small room. If its just two of you traveling, and you only plan on sleeping in the room and not spending any time in it otherwise, then this hotel is okay. We were able to cancel the rest of our reservation and found rooms at the Super 8 hotel on 46st street for $30 less a night. A much nicer hotel with larger rooms and better breakfast.	
Aug 23 2006 	Fantasticslap bang in the middle of NY.	Stayed for a week in August. The room took four of us, two adults plus two teenage kids. The rooms are small and there is not a lot of wardrobe or storage space.This is the only downside to this hotel. the rooms are spotless with an ensuite, cleaned every day. Staff at the reception are superb, nothing is too much trouble and they do their very best to help you. The hotel is two blocks from Times Square, and four blocks from the Metro. Location is 100%. You get a continental breakfast which you collect from the lobby and take it to your room. This is a good hotel and I would definitely use it again	
Aug 22 2006	Wonderful!	It was our first time in New York and we stayed at the Econo Loge Times Square for 4 nights in the beginning of August 06. After reading reviews of all the hotels in New York I wasn't expecting much, especially for the price we paid! The hotel was in a great location and it was very clean! Of coarse the rooms were tiny and yes the elevator was slow. But we were barely in our hotel and we took the stariwell up to the second floor. The air conditioner worked great, the water was hot, and the room was spotless. They even have those little extras you don't expect for the price you pay, continental breakfast with your standard items, free newspaper at your door in the am, fresh toiletries in the bathroom, in room safe, ironing board, etc. I would definitely recommend this hotel to the budget minded traveler who is looking for an affordable clean place to stay.	
Jul 27 2006 	This Hotel is a Diamond in the Ruff!	I am a person who likes to stay at new hotels. In New York; I quickly found out &quot;new&quot; means gutted out...but I was very impressed with how quaint the lobby was. The rooms were really clean...the only thing is it was quite small for 2 adults. I didn't mind it at all because when you go to New York; your not there necessarily to stay inside. The room was barely bigger than a storage closest. This location was right in the heart of everything going on in Times Square and if you are there for theatre performances; it's a great location! The only thing is; if you get there before check in; they do not have a bathroom or a place where you can change your clothes. For example, we paid to check our baggage in because we came straight from the airport dressed in first class business attire. So I ended up going through my bags, pulling out shorts and headed to Toy's R S' bathroom for a quick Clark Kent wardrobe change. Although this is besides the point....I would definitely go back to this hotel. One other thing: I did not like the way Travelocity over charged my card. After checkout, the hotel printed me out my 2 day stay with taxes included for about $215. Travelocity charged an additional $61 dollars. After I called them, they at first acted like my state taxes and other charges were not reflective in what the hotel gave me in the $215. When I told them, Econo Lodge gave me a print out of the state taxes and other charges; they agreed to refund my card the extra 61 dollars. Just beware of booking through 3rd parites or watch your statements closely. Other than that...this Hotel was the bomb!	
Jul 23 2006 	It Was Perfect!	I sometimes rely very heavily on internet reviews, if you do as wellread on. We stayed at the Econo Lodge the 3rd week of July and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. The price was very reasonable. I would almost call it cheap. The room was incredibly small.but VERY clean! I was impressed because I am very picky about cleanliness!! The bed was very comfortable. The A/C worked fine, thank goodness because when were there the temperature reached 100 degrees. It was quiet and the people at the front desk were very helpful. The complimentary breakfast was ok. There was always a choice, keep in mind we always made it earlynot sure what it would look like later on in the morning. The only negative thing I can say about this hotel that other people might find to be a nuisance was that the elevator was ridiculously slow. We took the stairs to our 3rd floor room every time. We had a great time and we would stay there again.	
Jul 20 2006	Great Place	I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. I spent hours searching for a decent hotel at a decent rate. This fit both of my needs. The location was great, and the service was excellent. My room was spotless all 4 days I spent there. Also the contential breakfast was very nice. I enjoyed my view of the activities of the area. The hotel also gives discounts to area restuarants. I really enjoyed my stay.	
Jul 5 2006 	Hairy experience	I read really good reviews of this hotel, so I was pretty confident of my choice when visiting NYC. The location is good. The breakfast is convenient, free, and had a great selection. . I should state that even by NYC standards the room was incredibly small. The small window air conditioner made funny noises and kept us up all night, and unfortunately the room never cooled enough. But my biggest complaint, however, was the cleanliness. The room was filthy. Upon entering I saw a large black hair clinging to the lampshade. There was a nichel in between the sheets and the blanket. The sheets has yellowish perspiration stains on them, and few dark curly hairs, and the blanket had a few of those same hairs too. There was NO WAY the sheets had been changed. I couldn't believe it. When I called down to the front desk to ask for more bedding a half and hour later I was still waiting for sheets. I called again and explained that it was after midnight, I was tired and wanted to go to bed and was still waiting for bedding. Bedding arrived 5 minutes later, with a &quot;here you go&quot;. No offer to change the bedding (we did it ourselves) and no apologies. In the bathroom we found more hair clinging to the wall, as if someone wiped down the wall with a hairly cloth. It was just gross. I am actually not that picky, but I was completely creeped out by how dirtly it was. I suggest if you stay here you keep in mind that you had better be prepared to change the sheets before you sleep on the bed, because clearly they aren't doing it for you on a regular basis. NEVER AGAIN.	
Jun 27 2006	Good value	Just returned from a 4-night stay at the Econo Lodge.Pros:- Location. We were within 3 blocks of 3 subway lines and a block from Times Square, 5 blocks from the Port Authority.- Price. For Midtown Manhattan near Times Square, the price was very good.- Free breakfast. This was a nice touch that was very much appreciated. Trays are provided in the rooms so you can take your breakfast up to your room and eat it there.- Air conditioner. Very useful in humid weather (and to cover the noise from the street at night!)- Cleanliness. The rooms were cleaned daily and they were spotless. A very small bottle of water was left in the room every day.Cons:- Room size. It really is small. The queen bed takes up almost the entire width of the room (save for 5 inches). For a short stay and small suitcases, it's bearable.- Elevator. The slowest elevator we've ever been in. From the time it dinged for our floor (5th) to the time the door opened, we counted 18 seconds!Despite the room size, it really is worth the price simply for location and cleanliness. We would recommend this hotel.	
Jun 26 2006	So much better then expected	At first, staying at an Econo Lodge did not appeal to me at all. After reading some reviews on this site and looking at the location I decided to give the hotel a shot as the PRICE ($180 all in) and location could not be beat. The only picture of the hotel I could find was a picture of the exterior, which made me hesitant to book, as it looks like a corner store rather then a hotel. I decided to look past this and booked regardless. A CAB RIDE from LaGuardia costs about $28-32 each way. When we arrived the HOTEL STAFF were friendly and quick as there was no lines, and we arrived right at check-in time. The ROOM was extremely small but I expected that as all the reviews pointed that out. The room was however, CLEAN and efficient in its use of space with AIR CONDITIONING you controlled. An added bonus was a bag of chips and bottle water left on the desk for free. The LOCATION was excellent.... walking distant to Times Square and most theaters, and near a subway station. We walked everywhere from the hotel on our stay only using the Subway once to get to the south end of the city. My only regret is that I didnt discover the great restaurants on 9th Street until my last night. The BREAKFAST was basic but good...muffins, cafe, croissants, cereal, fruit and of course coffee and orange juice. The free breakfast must of saved me at least $10 from not having to buy breakfast elsewhere which was a plus. The front desk staff even allowed us on several occasions to use the INTERNET for free. The only NEGATIVES I can think of are the noise level at night from outside, which is quit loud and the elevator was a little slow, but theres the option of the stairs. We were comfortable with the size of the room but if you have a lot of bags you may find it almost impossible to move.  I was considering staying at a large hotel with more characterIm glad I looked past the Econo Lodges exterior because I truly had a great stay. If I ever return to New York I would stay at this hotel again. The BONUSES also help in decreasing the costs for a budget traveler with the free breakfast, free Internet, and being able to rely on walking as a form of transportation.	
Jun 22 2006	Not Too Shabby!	We stayed one night in this charming, exceptionally clean hotel. Everything you've read about the small rooms is true. However there was plenty of room given the short time we were in the hotel. We had four people in our party including our children aged 16 and 19.We were on the fifth floor overlooking 8th avenue and yes it can be a bit loud, but we were so exhausted we slept fine. Next time we'll request a room overlooking 47th street to see if it's any quieter. Noise from other rooms was non-existent.The property was very clean. The hotel staff was superb. The continental breakfast was perfect. The elevator was painfully slow. We always took the stairs when coming downstairs.Our rate was $179.00 plus tax. It was an exceptional value for mid-town Manhattan.As I said, although it's a little on the loud side, but it's perfect for a few days in New York.	
Jun 12 2006	Not worth it	This might be a bargain at $100/night, but for $206 you can do much better. The rooms are miniscule and very uncomfortable for 2 persons. The staff were very friendly but not very competent or efficient. They didn't seem very good at anything they did. The elevator was excrucitatingly slow. All the rooms face the street and are very noisy. There are no services beyond the most basic: get your own cab, pay extra to check luggage. The location is great, but that's the only positive.	
Jun 8 2006	Great stay!	We just spend 5 nights at this hotel and we're very pleased with it. As the other reviewers mentioned, the rooms were small but clean. Hotel staff is very friendly and efficient. Location is great. We paid an avarage rate of $ 165 plus tax (fri -wed)I've got just two more things to add to what has already been said about this hotel:1. There now is luggage storage available for $ 3.00 a bag and they will store it for a maximum of 24 hours2. Bring your earplugs! There is a lot of street noise because of the location.We can highly recommend this hotel!	
Jun 3 2006	Perfect Place to Stay in New York City!!!	My young adult daughter and I went to NYC for a few days to see some TV shows. We had never been to NYC before and had no idea where to stay. I found this hotel on trip advisor and read the reviews. All the other reviews express my opinions exactly. You have to love this hotel. Very clean, convenient to everything, helpful staff, free breakfast, as well as coffee, tea and hot chocolate all day long -- all for $116.99 per night!!! The rooms are indeed very small -- about one foot wider and longer than the queen size bed. Cozy and it really does not need to be any bigger -- it makes those cruise ship rooms look gigantic!! I have already told other people about the hotel -- but don't tell too many others -- remember that it only has 50 rooms -- maybe we should keep this treasure all to ourselves!!!!??	
Jun 3 2006	Tiny but Charming and Close to Everything!!	We stayed at the Econo Lodge Times Square for one night over the Memorial Day Weekend. It was quite a bargain at $206 considering all of the other hotels were high priced for the weekend. We had read the reviews prior to going and knew that there was no luggage storage so we timed our arrival perfectly and got there shortly after check in. at 3:30p.m after ditching the car in a garage nearby. We walked to everything. This hotel is small but very charming and I found the front desk staff to be friendly and nice. We were able to drop our luggage and find a great place to eat on 9th avenue which is close. I highly recommend Vinyl for a great meal especially if you are a vegetarian. Meat eaters will fare well there too. The hotel is central to not only Times Square and mid town but to Central Park as well. We enjoyed eating breakfast outside at the Applejack Diner on Broadway across from PDiddy's Bad Boy Productions. That is a great place to eat and near the park. We rented bikes and rolled the entire perimeter of Central Park. We caught a great show, &quot;Hot Feet&quot; nearby. By the way, Starbucks is right on the corner and in view of the hotel. Sure the rooms at the Econo Lodge are a bit small. You will literally have to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room. The room is only big enough for two people. I would never take a family there without reserving more rooms. The bathtub is really a square shower. My home clothes closet is bigger than the room which we laughed about. I must say that the room had an iron and ironing board. It had a hair dryer and toiletries in the bathroom. The alarm clock had been set by a previous guest and woke me up at 6AM. I hope they got a kick out of that. The room even had water and snacks. A digitally programmed safe will keep your valuables from harm. They had a flat panel TV mounted on the wall. There was no where else to put it in that shoebox of a room. The air conditioner in the window was small but worked perfectly. We spent very little time in there anyway. The elevator can be busy and slow so I recommend the second floor. You can take the stairs easily. The place is completely new and very clean. I didn't try the morning breakfast but it was available and very continental. It was the perfect NYC getaway on a shoestring. We would defintely stay there again.
