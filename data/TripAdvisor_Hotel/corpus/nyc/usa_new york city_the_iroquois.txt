Nov 23 2009 	Oasis away from Times Square	I came in for business in the Theater District but was reluctant to stay near Times Square as the tourist scene there makes me nuts. But my travel agent recommended The Iroquois and I'm delighted that she did. It's a classy, calm, good-looking hotel with terrific service -- not too stuffy, not too hip, just right. The room was lovely -- delicious bed linens and a Rothko print on the wall. The location is terrific if you need to be mid-town -- it's just far enough east of Times Square to be out of the madness but close enough for an easy walk.	
Nov 18 2009 	My idea of a real New York hotel experience.	We decided to go to NYC at the last minute and did my research via Internet. The Iroquois was in our price range, right location and looked good. It turned out even better. Small intimate lobby with excellent free coffee in the mornings. The room was beautiful and spacious by NY standards and a fabulous marble bathroom. We were at the back overlooking an alley but hey it's NY and it was really quiet. Would definitely go back.	
Nov 17 2009 	Couldn't be better	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Iroquois for Labor Day weekend, which was also my birthday. The hotel has charm and character. When we arrived, the clerk informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite! It was gorgeous and bigger than most new york apartments. The staff could not be nicer and constantly anticipated our needs. The concierge's meal recommendations were spot on and the hotel's location was ideal. I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to go back!	
Nov 13 2009 	GREAT STAY	It was a pleasure to stay at the Iroquois Hotel this week. I usually stay at a nearby hotel but was booked at the Iroquois Hotel by my travel agant due to availibility. Your staff was great, nice rooms, and easy access. I look forward to staying with you whenever possible. Thanks so much, Rick.	
Nov 11 2009 	elegant and friendly perfect location fabulous service	I found this boutique hotel on Expedia. It was beautifully decorated and elegant. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The lobby and library were cozy. The room was romantic and the bed comfortable. Not a great view out the window, but location central to lots of sightseeing and shows as well as the subway. Quiet.	
Nov 8 2009 	Really disappointing.	After reading a number of glowing reviews we looked forward to our stay at The Iroquois. However from the moment we checked in we were disappointed. The welcome we received from the Reception staff was dire. Our first room was very run down and literally vibrated from the air conditioning. We were moved into a standard room for the night. This was again noisy and dated.We were eventually moved to a larger quieter room which was more what you would expect for the price you pay. Throughout our stay we found the hotel staff to be uninterested and offish. They seemed to forget the reason why they were there! Claudia was the only member of staff who was helpful and provided good service.We wouldn't stay here again, there must be better hotels than this in New York!	
Nov 4 2009 	Perfectly adequate but nothing special	Having read such glowing reviews on here, I was curious to see how good this hotel was, and stayed here for a week during a business trip from the UK. The quick summary is that while there was nothing wrong with the hotel, it was nothing I'd get excited about. On the upside, the location is very good, there is little outside / street noise in the rooms (a blessing in this busy part of Manhattan), the rooms are clean, the beds comfortable, and the bathrooms good - and the free shoe shine service is a nice touch. However, the service was distinctly indifferent from check-in to check-out, the lifts slow slow slow, the decor of the rooms a bit old-fashioned and tired, the breakfast (in-room) very disappointing and a rip-off of at $15 which turns into $28 once you throw in tip, room delivery and tax, and details were off (such as the iron in my room which was rusty and which stained a shirt). All in, I'm sure there are much better hotels at the same price range - I've stayed at the Giraffe and think that's better, and next time will probably try the Sofitel next door. Both are slightly more expensive, but only a little, and I believe significantly better.	
Nov 3 2009 	Who needs the St. Regis	I stay in this hotel quite often, it has one of the finest staffs of any hotel I have been to in my life....They remember your name and always want you to be happy, I tell them it is my in passing birthday and they send a bottle of wine to the room....As far as accomastions go the toilettries and bedding is superb....I recoommnee this place to a friend whose boss works for a big ceo...and they too became hooked on this charming home away from home in a great location,	
Nov 1 2009 	Can't wait to go back.	We enjoyed our stay at the Iroquois. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel doesn't have a parking garage but there is one right across the street. We didn't need to use the car during our stay, we walked everywhere. It was our first time to New York City and were very surprised. The city is much cleaner than we expected. We are looking forward to going back. We had a great meal at the restaurant in the hotel.	
Oct 30 2009 	Will definitely be back!	My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for 2 nights over the weekend of October 23-25. We have definitely found our &quot;home away from home&quot; while in New York City. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the beds are to die for. The mattresses and Frette linens are unbelievable and as another reviewer said &quot;it felt like sleeping on a cloud&quot;. Amazing. The location is absolutely perfect for nearly everything you want to do. We only took a cab to the Guggenheim but then walked back, stopping along the way. We also took a cab when the torrential rains came but otherwise would have just walked everywhere. We didn't try the restaurant, opting to eat at the Red Flame just down the block for breakfast and our usual favorites for dinner. However, we will try Triomphe the next time we're in town due to the fabulous reviews it gets here. You will enjoy your stay here if you like location, location, location and a truly lovely boutique hotel with the best beds ever!	
Oct 29 2009 	Amazing staff - best restaurant!	A friend of myself and I stayed in the Iroquois last weekend. We loved the location of this hotel - if you are in town to see a play you wont be dissapointed. There is even a nice restaurant called Triomphe inside the hotel, best food we ever had. We booked a deluxe room, which was facing the 44th street. Our room had a very nice bathroom,and let me tell you, the beds are like clouds! They offer complimentary coffee in the morning and iced tea during the day which is a very nice treat. Late at night we had some issues with getting our arline tickets printed out so we contacted the front desk. We were so amazed by the receptionist Andy, who provided us with the information we needed. But all staff members were very respectful and helpful to us at any time. Overall the Iroquois is the place to be if you are looking for a perfect located Hotel, nice staff, a good restaurant and good sized rooms.We can't wait to stay in the Iroquois again.	
Oct 29 2009 	Almost perfect getaway	Came to the city for one night to celebrate my &quot;not 50th&quot; birthday. Upon checking in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite for the occasion. The suite was lovely and included a living room, large bedroom, dining room, kitchen, walk in closet and bathroom. As mentioned before, the bathroom was tiny but included a stall shower and a jetted tub. The suite was so nice that we decided to skip our shopping trip (it was also pouring down rain) and stay in the room to read and watch college football. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant, Triomphe, which was fabulous. The service there was great and we walked to the theater in plenty of time. Two small complaints--the wood (?) floors in the suite were very slick even in rubber soled shoes and a morning newspaper would have been a nice touch. We will return to The Iroquois.	
Oct 27 2009 	Nice but why didn't anyone review the bathroom	This hotel was nice but i would not stay here again...the rooms are very small even compared to NYC standards but the most surprising thing is that there is NO vanity or anywhere to place cosmetics and hair dryer, curling iron while getting ready which I think is quite important. The concierge was very nice and so was most of the front desk staff. Sharing the small elevator with the days trash, was not exceptionally &quot;fun&quot;. Personally for the same price I would stay next door at the Sofitel. Bed were very comfortable and hotel was clean	
Oct 23 2009 	Mixed Experience from Seasoned World Traveler	Here's what I experienced this past week after staying 6 nights with a friend from abroad:the good ...great central location for tourists and business; beds extremely comfortable - both mattress &amp; linens; charming small intimate old style hotel; friendly &amp; helpful staff; free wi-fi throughout and/or use of (2) computers in library near front door; elegant restaurant on premises for breakfast, lunch, or dinner; free 24 hr gym with newer cardio equipment, dry sauna, &amp; whirlpool bathtub; free NYTimes at each guest rm; automatic turndown service with milk chocolates; molton brown toiletries; in room safe; large flat screen TV; Frette bathrobes &amp; linens.the bad ... only 1 small elevator working for this 12+ floors &amp; took a week for the other broken elevator to be fixed and back in use, so had to share with maintanence, housekeeping, rug/renovation repairmen, guests, suitcases, room service, management; very expensive ($400) for 1 queen bed in small room and no discount or special amenity offered to compensate for broken elevator; no slippers provided automatically - had to ask for pair - perhaps this is less wasteful? One employee had breath that smelled like alcohol in morning - not a good impression / professional. Toiletry item 'disappeared' from outer pocket of my backpack that I stored with concierge on day of checkout-departure. Wi-fi reception inconsistent in room. Rooms dark visually due to heavy large dark furniture and furnishings in room including dark window blinds and lamp shades (not opaque) directing light downward ...no ceiling light ... so even during the day the room was a bit dark for reading/computer work. Gym small &amp; limited, but better than most hotels of similar size.	
Oct 22 2009 	Simply one of the best hotels in New York	My wife and I stayed at the Iroquois for our wedding anniversary recently and it is simply one of the best hotels we have stayed at. The hotel has an excellent location on 44th Street, between 5th &amp; 6th Avenues and is convenient for all the major sights in the city. We had a deleux room fronting 44th which had all the mod-cons you would come to expect and was larger than we expected, having read that most hotel rooms in the city are on the small side (circa 200 sqft). The service was frindly, courteous and excellent throughout our stay. The conceige were both knowledgable and helpfully, helping us to secure bookings at 2 top restaurants. We didn't use the fitness centre or sauna, but both looked good. However, when it comes to finding a good restaurant, look no further than the Triomphe, which is part of the hotel. We dined here on our last night, opting for the 6 course tasting menu which was great value for money, and is without doubt, the best restauant we have ever eat in - and I say that having eaten in some top class restaurants. If you are looking for a modern, trendy hotel with swimming pool etc, then the Iroquois is not for you. But , if like us, you were looking for a boutique style elegant hotel with all the amenities you could want, then The Iroquois NY is the one for you. We will definately stay there again next time we visit New York.	
Oct 21 2009 	Perfect Hotel In Ideal Location	Have just returned from a weeks stay (previously stayed last year) everything was as we remembered, all the staff are friendly and helpful, rooms are comfortable and are large enough, contrary to what others say, they are well appointed , the bathroom was large, clean and lots of fluffy towels and Molton Brown showers gels etc. The hotel is in a perfect location and whilst I agree the views are not excellent we did not go to sit and look out of the windows all day, if that is what you want pay double and have a room in a hotel overlooking Central Park. Go to this hotel if you want to have the personal touch and actually feel welcomed.	
Oct 13 2009 	You can find better	travel to NYC quite a bit, usually stay ay The Alex. Decided to try the Iroquois b/c I had a corporate rate. the location is very good and the trip advisor reviews were generally good. I was told at time of booking the corporate rate was Run of House and that &quot;we would receive the best room available&quot;. this translated into what must have been the worst room in the hotel (room 307). It was TINY (about 2 feet larger around than the bed) and at the back, the windows faced right into the fire escape, with the next building very close. It was really horrible. We phoned to the front desk and they said they would move us, we moved to a much nicer room (rm. 1100), still fairly small, but it had a bay window and a beautiful view of the Chrystler building. So if they told me on the phone I was entitled to the best room available, why did they give me the worst room?They make a big deal of their turn-down service with chocolates. We got this the first night. Teh second night it wasnt done. Immediately we checked to see if our &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign was on - it wasn't. It had been in the afternoon, but we tuned it off about 5:30 or 6pm. So either they just didnt do it or they tried to turn down our room before 6pm.I was very surprised the room had no coffee/tea making facilities. I drink tea and my partner drinks coffee. They had a coffee urn in the lobby in the mornings, no tea at any time, so we had to visit the coffee shop down the street.The last morning we had breakfast in the hotel. We chose the self-serve buffet choice. They added a compulsory 18% tip to the bill and still added a line to the bill for us to add a tip. 18% tip for self-serve and they were looking for more? I found that a bit offensive.As we left the bellhop asked how we were getting to the airport, we told him we were taking the skytrain to Newark. He tried to talk us out of it and to let him call us a car service, giving us all sorts of incorrect reasons not to take the skytrain (including that it took over an hour, that we would be hampered by subway repairs, etc - actually it is the fastest, lest expensive way to Newark and dosent have anything to do with the subway.) We were left with the opinion he either didnt know what he was talking about or got a healthy kick-back for referrals.Next time I am in NYC I will definately head back to the Alex, its a wonderful little boutique hotel with big beautiful rooms and full kitchens!	
Oct 13 2009 	Elegance in the heart of mid-town	The Iroquois is elegant, beautifully-appointed and friendly. The rooms, while &quot;small&quot; anywhere outside Manhattan, were quite comfortable and of the size typical of mid-town hotels, and the beds were heavenly. You won't find a quieter hotel room in mid-town. No sound room-to-room, and no outside sounds. The desk clerks and concierge were like having your own personal staff -- never too busy; always cheerful and helpful. The location -- 44th at 6th Ave., next to the Algonquin, is a 5-minute walk to Times Sq. and the theaters, as well as Rockefeller Center and Grand Central Terminal. The Empire State Bldg is just 10 blocks -- about 15 minutes' walk -- from the hotel, and there are a number of good, less-expensive restaurants within 5-minutes from 44th to 46th between 6th and 7th. Hailing a taxi on 44th or 6th Ave. was a breeze. We had a thoroughly enjoyable experience with our 10-yr.-old grandaughter at The Iroquois.	
Oct 11 2009 	Nice boutique hotel	We just returned from a four night stay at the Iroquois in NYC. We booked an executive king room and we were pleased overall with the hotel. The front desk reception staff were always extremely friendly. It was a little strange to have a bellman help bring up our two small bags (which we repeatedly said we could do ourselves) and then show us the room. For being an executive king room, it was extremely small. It worked out fine for just two of us, but I would never think of staying here with our children. The bathroom was nice and spacious, however there was cheap plastic film covering the bathroom windows. Turndown service was nice with chocolates and a weather card left on our bed each evening. The beds were EXTREMELY comfortable..probably the most comfy bed we had ever slept on. My only other complaint was the iron. It was a cheap iron that gave out practically no heat whatsoever and it took forever to iron our clothes in the morning. The location is excellent...we usually stay on this street (in the Sofitel previously) as we love the proximity to Times Square, 5th Ave., Grand Central Station, and the Theater District. We also enjoy the Red Flame Diner which is just a few steps away from the hotel...a great, quick breakfast for a very reasonable price. We will be back!	
Oct 9 2009 	Little bit of luxury in the midst of Manhattan	We stayed at the Iroquois in March of 2009. It was the perfect location for us, being close to Times Square but tucked away from the crowd. Our little window &quot;view&quot; was of the brick back side and the next building behind it but it was very quiet. The staff was accommodating and kind. Though we never did have &quot;bathrobes and slippers&quot; as was advertised. However, it was hardly necessary since we were out and about most of the day, not lounging around the room. The complimentary computer with internet (down in the library) came in handy for checking email and booking some last minute tickets for the Statue. The furnishings were very nice - love those sheets - and my bedtime chocolate left with the turn-down bed service. The room was small but the bathroom was good sized and nicely appointed. In the standard room that we had there is only the bed for a sitting area with the exception of a desk chair. But since we spent very little time in the room and had done a lot of walking, the bed was a welcome lounge chair! Flat screen tv was nice, NYTimes in the morning at your door...the little fridge would have been nicer had there been room to store a few of our own things vs. just the drinks you had to pay (a lot) for. We drank the &quot;free&quot; sparkling water left for us and bought drinks and snacks down at the local drugstore in Times Square to bring back to the hotel. My only disappointment was the cost of the breakfast for what I got. My husband fared better with his choice (the French Toast I think - but still a small amount for what you paid for). If you are going to eat at their restaurant for breakfast, the food is good, but go for the &quot;breakfast bar&quot;. Don't go for the crepes. Far too drenched in syrup and nothing else with it - I think the berries had been frozen - I was not impressed. Not much to go on for the day. The coffee was good. A great little diner just down the street (on the way to Times Square) was very &quot;New York&quot; and had great All American food at a very reasonable price. Sorry I can't remember the name of it. One thing is for sure, there is plenty of food in NY - sure glad I was able to walk all over the city to burn off the calories!Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this fine hotel. We probably would not have been able to afford staying there without the good rate we had through our Entertainment Book. It was a bit of luxury that we do not often get to treat ourselves to.	
Oct 8 2009 	Boutique at its best	My 3rd trip to the Iroquois - and it's always a pleasure. The lobby was recently redone and is sophisticated without being pretentious. The room was a good size and nicely appointed. And the staff couldn't do enough to please us. All in all, recommended - particularly for those who appreciate a small European type hotel and ambiance.	
Oct 8 2009 	Mediocre hotel at best	We recently stayed here for part of our honeymoon. We found the rooms to be typical of any NYC hotel...cramped. Previous posts had suggested a recent renovation but the property appeared dated and worn. Worse, was the smell of the smoke that permated our room. An initial complaint resulted in the staff offering to spray our room to cover up the scent. We insisted on a room change that occurred promptly but still had a musty odor. Turndown service happened even though we had a &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; on. In the end, I was happy to leave.	
Oct 5 2009 	This is a "can't go wrong choice".	I chose this hotel for my first weekend in Manhatten for my wife's birthday. I had read theprevious reviews, especially from those who go back for additional visits. Count me now as one of those.The location is perfect in midtown Manhatten, just two blocks from Times Square, and within six blocks of most theatres, many fine restaurants, including its own Triomphe, and shopping.It is a small boutique type property, with all the amenities one needs for a quiet, restfulstay. Excellent service, and small, but very comfortble, well appointed rooms.The Triomphe restaurant was an unexpected surprise, and we had a delicious six-course tasting menu served at our table in the bar, where the atmosphere was more casual.	
Oct 5 2009 	Over rated and WAY over priced	...perhaps this is what you get in the way of luxury for NYC, but I suggest spending your money elsewhere...	
Oct 4 2009 	Concierge Nick is fabulous!!	My husband and I enjoyed a long overdue weekend away in NYC in early fall 2009. We found the Iroquois to be a romantic, elegant, convenient hotel with excellent service and a fabulous concierge. The Iroquois' concierge, Nick, was knowledgeable and resourceful with impeccable taste, without seeming pretentious. When we found ourselves without dinner reservations for Saturday night, Nick asked a few questions about our tastes (we're foodies) and the type of night we were looking to have (romantic) and quickly recommended Oceana on 49th &amp; 6th. Nick confirmed a reservation for us on the spot and had a reminder card with restaurant details sent to our room. Oceana was the perfect choice for us (separate review under Restaurants to come). With Nick's help, we had a wonderful dining experience. I would highly recommend the Iroquois for a weekend getaway, and may you be fortunate to find Nick at the helm during your visit.	
Oct 2 2009 	Great location	Stayed overnight. Room was small but well appointed. Bed was extremely comfortable. Small hotel with all amenities you need. i.e. fitness center, restaurant. Located on great street in NYC. and within walking distance of many sights yet far enough away from the crowds and noise.	
Sep 26 2009 	Excellent Boutique Hotel in Great Location	We spent six nights at the Iroquois and would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone.As arranged a car was there to meet us at Newark Airport even although our flight was delayed. All members of staff we encountered during our stay were professional and helpful. Our (superior) room was well appointed and most comfortable. We enjoyed dining in Triomphe - a high standard of cuisine and a high level of service.To top it all, the location is ideal for visitors to New York.	
Sep 24 2009 	Great location comfortable inviting - a real gem	The staff was terrific very helpfull, great location, comfortable clean room and inviting lobby. A real gem!!	
Sep 19 2009 	Beautiful hotel perfect location and attentive polite staff	My boyfriend and I came to New York in September from Maui (the mecca for lavish holidays) and looked and looked for a decently priced place to stay. While this was at the top of our range, it was so worth it. The hotel is upscale, classy and decorated with classic furnishings. The staff was incredibly attentive from the beginning, from the doorway to the rooms. Our second night we had an unexpected visitor from out of town and we asked for a roll-away bed in our room. Instead, they upgraded us to the James Dean Suite and promptly had our luggage delivered. Bill, the bellman, was very sweet and helpful, offering wonderful local knowledge about restaurants, hot spots and personal memories of growing up in New York. Caroline, one of the front desk attendants, promptly helped us with our many needs in a polite and efficient manner. I called downstairs to get band-aids (because I had to wear my pretty shoes - I was in NYC!) and they were at the door before we could even wonder when they were coming. In a nutshell, this is a wonderful hotel, very worth the price. The rooms are very clean, very comfortable (most of the rooms have been retro-fitted to be noise-proof to help with NYC street noise), and the staff was just wonderful. We would highly recommend this hotel to any dear friends and family. Its a perfect location for hitting all the tourist spots in midtown. Cheers to the Iroquois!With much aloha!, Sarah and Timothy	
Sep 19 2009 	Premier location and a great boutique hotel.	The location is just perfect. As is typical of NYC hotels, some rooms are a little small but all are very clean and well maintained with great amenities. Ask for a room with new windows (noise reducing windows!). There is a a great gym too. Staff were friendly and helpful at all times. Coming back to the Iroquois after a day of sightseeing in NYC was like coming home: Comfy, cozy and very welcoming. We will definately stay here again and have already recommended it to a friend visiting NYC later this year. You won't be disappointed.	
Sep 9 2009 	Location Location Location	All the reviews say it, but just to reiterate the location of this hotel is fantastic. Nestled between 5th and 6th Avenue, all the city has to offer is a short step away but without the hustle and bustle of Times Square. Room was surprisingly spacious, zero outside noise, (the view of the fire escape was uninspiring but you don't go to NY to look out of a window) , chocolates on the pillow were a nice touch. Bed's were like sleeping on clouds and power shower wakes you up in the morning. Would definitely stay again with family or friends and have already recommended it.	
Sep 7 2009	Great Hotel Great location	I stayed here for 2 nights and had a great experience. It is about a block from Time Square, about 5-7 walk to the subway, 2 minute walk to the convenience store and just overall centrally located. The beds were so comfortable and the bathrooms were very nice. The staff was so nice and always eager to help. There is also a restaurant attached to the hotel, Triomphe, which I've read received great reviews but we didn't get a chance to eat there. There is also a little diner a few hundred feet away. They also offered room service, which we got one night because we were so tired to walk around anymore. Of course, room service was expected to be high. We paid a total of $21 for a sandwich, chips and a salad. Another added extra was that someone came to turn down the beds each night if you wanted. The one and only problem I had was that the internet was a little slow. I would definitely return here.	
Sep 5 2009 	Central location good standards but don't let them put you in a small room	We had high expectations of this hotel and were disappointed with our first room, which was very small, and was clearly not designed for a queen bed (which it though had - we had booked the queen sized room). We raised this the following morning and were moved without argument at all. Our second room was a much better size - although still not huge, but I get the impression mid-town NYC hotel rooms are generally smaller. Our second room was a decent sized room and good standard. It's a nice, smaller hotel. It's got the right &quot;feel&quot; for a four star place, although it being a city hotel, you're probably not going to be amazed - unless you spring for a suite. The gym was of a reasonable size, and location is fine - really close to everywhere, but that's also a negative for some ... keep in mind it's close to Times Square - which is more than a little touristy (it's not too close though - a few blocks). Final bit of advice: don't drive here ...	
Aug 26 2009 	Great Place Great Location	I stayed there for three nights and each night was perfect. The hotel is very classy and everyone there was more than helpful. No matter what we asked for they were pleased to help. Great location. My room was in the rear so we didn't have a biew but next time I go to NYC I plan to stay here and get a room with a view.	
Aug 26 2009 	Lovely hotel poor Lost 	Beautiful small boutique hotel right smack in the heart of NYC tourist attractions. I'll get to the point:Rooms - we stayed in a Classic with 2 double beds. Beds were comfy with lots of feather pillows. I prefer foam, but it was late &amp; didn't bother to ask if they had that. Bed &amp; bath linens were soft, comfy &amp; plush. 2 spa slippers &amp; 1 bath robe provided (nope, it stays with the hotel). Room &amp; bathroom were very clean &amp; with upgraded furniture, fixtures &amp; tile. There was a good size safe in the closet. Flat screen TV, robobar (touch 1 item &amp; it automatically charges, whether or not you took it out, so don't attempt to use this as a fridge). Pack &amp; play was *free* for my toddler. We were told small fridge was also free, but it was not available for the 2 nights we were there. Turndown service with chocolates left on your pillow (they were good too). Our room was towards the back corner of the bldg, window had the fire escape stairs &amp; faced the side windows of the bldg next door. At first, we were disappointed with no view, but upon coming back at 1 pm, found out we were fortunate as the garbage trucks came loudly in the wee hours of the morning, &amp; the honking of the morning buslte was not something we'd like to wake up to so very early in the morning during vacation.Kids - we have 2 boys, 8 &amp; 2 y.o.; hotel has a kids amenities package that is again *free*. Just request it. Kids got a small cookie &amp; fruit plate, a bathrobe &amp; slippers (though it was adult size), a full size bottle of bubble bath (they got Disney Cars), &amp; a pamphlet for NYC attractions for kids.Internet - worked well for us, but then again we used it after midnight so may not be a lot of folks online.Parking - across the street from the hotel (Hippodrome). We were told it was $34.00 for 24 hours (don't know if tax incl) as long as you have it stamped by the hotel, but no in-out priviledge (we didn't use this). Parking garage had an overnight special of $10.00 if you come in after a certain time &amp; it's good for 12 hours. My hubby still wanted his parking tkt stamped &amp; we paid $9.00 (this is a steal in NYC!), still a $1 discount which went to the parking valet guy. By the way, we have a Honda minivan &amp; parking garages typically charge extra for taller/longer vehicles, so the parking price was definitely a steal! At lunch time, we discovered that the parking meters &amp; places I used to park at years ago are long gone, so we paid $20.00 for 1 hour at a parking garage near Madison &amp; Grand Central, but still cheaper than getting your car towed.Lost &amp; found - not so good part. We thought we left someone important for our toddler &amp; called 4 times Monday, the housekeeper took my info &amp; asked me to call back in 15 minutes. Got stuck at work &amp; couldn't call for another hour, another housekeeper told me to call back again, called again left a voicemail with details &amp; call back info. Tuesday, houseman took my item &amp; contact info &amp; said he will have supv call as lost &amp; found items are locked in the office, didn't hear from anyone. Wednesday, called &amp; asked to speak to the hskp supv to whom I explained my several attempts of getting in touch with Lost &amp; Found, &amp; who again took my info, said she'll check &amp; call me back. After 3 hours, I called again &amp; spoke to the same hskp supv who said they didn't find anything. I asked why she didn't call me back &amp; she said she was busy, no apologies. I replied that I wished she had called me back, that would just be good customer service after all my attempts to call for the past 3 days. I believe that customer service should be extended to the guest even after they've checked out. For this, I took 1 star off.Other than that, we liked this hotel &amp; would stay again. Only next time, I would triple/quadruple check my stuff before leaving, :0).	
Aug 25 2009 	The Iroquois exceeds expectations again	We love it here. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in NYC. Well appointed (though small) rooms. Lot's of extra touches, turndown service, New York times daily, chocolates at night, fresh iced herbal tea in the looby, quaint library with internet service and printer. You can walk to everything! and the beds are to die for.Tip: The Red Flame diner near by is a great standard.	
Aug 22 2009 	Excellent location lovely small hotel but needs attention to detail.	This lovely hotel is perfectly situated for broadway plays, sight-seeing and shopping. My granddaughter and I could walk to all attractions. The staff was courteous and the doorman was attentive, but our room did need some basic maintenance. Two lights were burned out; the bathroom sink drain didn't work, the door lock was difficult. However, the staff courteously dealt with each matter.Housekeeping failed to come one day, but did a fine job the rest of the time.I had expected a 5 star hotel and so I was a little disappointed, but I'd still recommend it because you can't beat the location and it was comfortable.	
Aug 20 2009 	Nice charming quiet	I've stayed here a few times and it's a very low key yet classic hotel. Pros:*small and low key*great location/convenient*friendly staff*beds are comfortable*room has nice charm*QUIET at night (stayed on my last visit at the Muse Hotel -which was very hip, trendy, large well decorated room, nice glass on wine at 5pm, BUT, I could not sleep ALL night even with earplugs, due to street noise). So, the Iroquois has a nice peaceful location going for it.Cons:*can't control temperature. Not really a huge deal but on my last trip in summer I would have liked to have had my room a wee bit cooler than it was.*can't join/log your stays in their Frequent stay/member club unless you book directl through their website (and unfortunately my company makes me use their company expedia account).*rooms are very cozy (if you need a large room)	
Aug 18 2009 	A great hotel in the center of everything	We stayed at this hotel on our New England trip this year. We reserved a suite for us (4 adults and 2 kids). And I must say that after staying in many hotels in New York already - this is one of the better places and for sure i will return. It was in the center of town near 5th avenue and all major sights are in walking distance. It was surprisingly quiet and we enjoyed it a lot. The rooms were nice and big and much better than expected, because when you walk into the lobby your first impression is that this could be another trap. But wait and see the rooms first and you will be happy considering that New York is really the worst place to get a decent hotel for an ok price.All in all i recommend this place	
Aug 17 2009 	great deal!	We loved the Iroquois Hotel for its charm and quaintness and wonderful location between 5th and 6th Avenue on West 44th Street. The front desk staff was very welcoming and attentive. We had a room upgrade without even asking for one which was a nice gesture as well. the room was well appointed with a beautiful marble bathroom and Molton Brown soaps. The Frette sheets and towels were the topping on the cake! my husband was able to keep up with e-mails using the complimentary Wi-Fi in the room. We also took advantage of the concierge keeping our luggage after we checked out at no charge-we will visit again!!	
Aug 10 2009 	Classy New York	General Manager Scott and his professional staff uphold the type of New York Class you expect in this great city. nothing is left out. this is the type of old new york charm you love this city for. you want sheeky and cheesy go to Miami. you want classy and comfortable go to the Iroquois!! one block from Times Square, but you wouldnt know it, the street is very quiet and is tree lined. this location is an obviously great jumping point to whatever NYC excursion or attraction you choose to do. the concierge will take care of it all, but the best part about this hotel is the general manager himself takes an interest in seeing that your stay is perfect. he doesnt just hide behind the curtain until you have a problem like other hotels. the price is very competitive. Definately recomend for business or leisure.	
Jul 30 2009 	Nifty NY hotel decent value for money but wireless Internet unreliable	The Iroquois has an intimate feeling to it; a small staff works hard and multitasks but they seem pretty dedicated and I noticed several familiar faces - including senior managers - since my last visit a couple of years ago, and continuity usually augers well. The small bar and nifty restaurant are a more enjoyable setting for a quiet drink with colleagues or friends than the pricy pretention across the street at the Euro-optimized Royalton or the noisy and touristy Algonquin nearby. Still, when I arrived at the Iroquois, the doorman looked the other way when I said hello, and when I asked if there was a payphone I could use, he had no idea. My room was quite comfortable - clean, well appointed...neither new nor worn - and the electronics were modern and functioned well, but for me - on a business trip - it was one massive hassle to have to suffer through three days during which the wireless Internet didn't work for hours on end. The hotel staff forwarded me to their Internet provider who during an hour on the phone tried to solve the problem, but the outage remained and the result was hours of wasted time - call after call to fix the problem - when I had wanted to work in my room. To their credit, I was not charged for incidentals to compensate for the inconvenience. Still, perhaps this hotel is better suited to New York weekend trip visitors and tourists because I think the business services infrastucture is lacking (e.g. a fax was sent to me marked urgent, but it never arrived in my room). I might return here, but not on a business trip.	
Jul 29 2009 	Fair Choice	We stayed at the Iroquois late July 2009. The hotel rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Most front-desk staff were very friendly and helpful. However, the room temperature was very warm. Over 4 phone calls had to be placed for help with the air conditioning. You can not change the temp. in your room to suit your needs. Another issue that popped up was that the pre-ordered surprise (cheese and fruit tray) did not come out anything like the picture or description listed by the hotel. That was disappointing as it was a surprise for one of the guests we traveled wih. The hotel told us they were out of cheese and crackers. Disappointing when you are paying over $24 for this service. I would probably try a different hotel before coming back to this one.	
Jul 28 2009 	Wonderful stay even with glitches	We had two nights booked at the Iroquois for July 26-27. We arrived on Saturday night to check in and were told that some pipes had burst in the hotel and they could not accomodate us for the first night of our stay. They had secured a room across the street at the Royalton. The manager explained that we would stay there, then come back in the morning, have a free breakfast and they would upgrade us to a nicer room for the second night of our stay. While this was an inconvenience, I couldn't argue with the reason. The manager explained that he had spent the day scrambling to find available rooms in other hotels. We checked into the Royalton across the street and had a nice evening there. The room was fine, if a little dark. the decor there is more industrial chic than the Iroquois. The next morning, we walked our luggage across the street and checked into the Iroquois. They gave us the James Dean Suite: a huge living room with hardwood floors and lovely furniture. The attached bedroom was very nice. We had a free continental breakfast in their dining room. Throughout our stay, the assistant manager, Antonio, kept asking us how our room was and apologizing for the night before. We felt like royalty! The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We will definitely make it a point to stay at the Iroquois again. They handled a potential disaster with the poise that you would expect for this caliber hotel. Even if they had not upgraded our room, I'm sure I'd be saying the same thing.	
Jul 26 2009 	Perfect hotel perfect location	The Iroquois lived up to its excellent reputation. The hotel is quite luxurious. Rooms are really well appointed with fantastic showers, very comfortable beds and enough space. Staff are friendly and helpful. It's situated in the heart of Manhattan with everything you would want just a stroll away. In particular you can, within minutes, be at Times Square for shows, dining, picking up a ride on a tour bus. Fifth Avenue shopping starts just round the corner and the Rockefeller Centre, Empire State, Grand Central, St Pat's Cathedral, etc are just a few blocks away. Local buses are good for Central Park and Bryant Park (2 blocks distance) is a great place to have coffee and relax. You can also pick up a Newark Liberty airport bus at corner of Bryant Park and Fifth Avenue.	
Jul 18 2009 	Wonderful room	We stayed July 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. We had an executive King on the 11th floor. The staff was wonderful and polite. The location cannot be beat for walking midtown. We even walked to Central Park twice from the hotel. The bed and room amenities are as good as we have seen anywhere. The free internet was a plus. Many hotels in NY charge 10+ dollars a day for wifi. A lot of people have said the rooms are small....that may be as compared to other regions outside of Manhattan, but it was plenty big enough for us. The diner down the street is a good place to eat. We would definitely stay here again. Parking is in the garage on the right just before you get to the Iroquois, and is about $30 a night if you stay at the hotel. It's about $50 without the hotel validating it. We got a great rate on the room, under 175 a night on Thu, Fri, Sat nights during the 4th.	
Jul 18 2009 	Fantastic Location	Stayed there with my husband and 9 year old daughter. We got married while we were out there. Couldn't fault the location and would only stay there again based on that. Rooms were clean but felt the service was below standard. The bell boys and cleaners were really friendly but the reception staff sometimes weren't very much so. Got quite excited hearing about peoples free upgrades and complimentary bottles of wine for birthday etc, but we got nothing, not even a smile whilst waiting for our limo to take us to our wedding ceremony. Rest of the wedding party had to wait two hours when they checked in as their rooms weren't ready and had to wait an hour for some ice, and that only arrived after two more calls down to reception. The room manual said that children get a bubble bath of their choice and a tote bag with colouring things in but we never got either, even though we asked reception twice. As I said, we'd only stayed there again because of the location and if a good deal came up. You don't spend a lot of time in your room to be honest. On a positive - it was nice and quiet, we got some cookies in our room for 2 days in a row and the choccies were nice.	
Jul 15 2009 	Great boutique hotel	We stayed at the Iroquois a couple of years ago and were very pleased with our stay. Wereturned over this Fourth of July weekend, and once again, we had a wonderful experience. The rooms are lovely, the staff is friendly. They have a nice little gym anda terrific little low-key bar in the restaurant. We booked two rooms on their websiteat a ridiculously low rate. It was all good.	
Jul 14 2009 	Awesome	Awesome and delightful stay at this hotel!!! Good room - clean and comfortable. Close to many activities. Very relaxing - due to staff and accomadations - felt like we were going home each night. Good breakfast in their resturant with friendly and attentive staff. TV/DVD player great with movies to check out at the front desk for free. Normal pay for view movies were also available. This was a family trip (we came with older teenagers) but I would rate this hotel very high whether I was coming to NYC for business or leisure. If you have a question - ask the staff, they will help. Excellent fitness room for a smaller hotel.	
Jul 12 2009 	Exceptional Experience	Stayed here for one night July 5th. The Iroquois is a lovely small hotel, gorgeous atmosphere, with the most attentive staff I have ever experienced in any hotel. I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in the Midtown area, as the hotel is literally within sight of Times Square and a short walk to Rockefeller Center.	
Jul 9 2009 	A nice place to stay in NYC	The iroquois is a very nice place to stay - we enjoyed this place. It is very close to Times Square and all the activitites - though still pretty quiet in the room. We slept soundly every night in a king size bed. The bathroom was nicely decorated and functional. The room was smallish with no real view to speak of. The service for ice always was brought quickly - we asked for a small bar fridge and used that to cool fruit and water. Trivial quibblings - two slower elevators - though we rarely waited long and a small closet. Great coffee and iced tea free in the lobby. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. We did not eat in the hotel. The first day here we bought a hop on, hop off 48 hour bus pass which worked well for us - we used the downtown and up town tours to get around on the longer routes. The busses come often - we never seemed to be waiting. We are avid walkers and walked most everywhere from the hotel, from Macy's to Sak's to Sardi's, to our play and around Times Square in the evening hunting for a place to eat. I walked out of a well known chain restaurant in Times Square because food and drink prices were not provided in the menu - we noticed this a couple of times - though smaller places seem to be more sensible. Central Park was a bit far to walk - we took the hop on/off and rented bikes for the park - this was a nice 1/2 day outing.	
Jul 8 2009 	Exceptional staff great restaurant and location	I stay at this hotel often, perhaps five or six times a year. I had tried maybe six or seven other hotels in mid-town before I found this one. I travel a lot with work and this hotel has a very pleasant, friendly atmosphere and the rooms are very comfortable. The wireless internet has improved to the point where it is now seamless and the restaurant is exceptional. The manager Zoraida and the staff are what makes this place special.	
Jul 2 2009 	A very pleasant surprise.	We visit New York at least once a year and sometimes twice. We have stayed at a different property every time. We have always been from a little to a lot disappointed. Not this time. From the moment of our arrival to the time of departure we could not ask for more. Pleasant helpful staff that really made you feelat home. Well appointed room and bath Top notch onsite restaurant and fitness center. We did not see a refrigerator in the room and mentioned it to the Bellman. In minutes one was delivered to our room at no charge. Great central location. Nice street with hotels and private clubs. We parked the car and walked everywhere we wanted to go. We were at the cozy bar on our last night and I guess Nina summed it up by saying,&quot;I think we found our spot in New York&quot;; A little Gem in The Big Apple!	
Jul 1 2009 	Beautiful Hotel wonderful helpful staff	If you want to stay in a hotel that offers customer service, a clean, beautiful atmosphere, this would be the place for you. The staff could not have been more attentive and happy. Yes, happy! The location is within walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and great shopping. The complimentary coffee in the lobbey is delicious and the Library is a nice added touch. Warning-The diner next door called The Red Flame is horrible.	
Jul 1 2009 	Outstanding	Service was extra-ordinary at this hotel and we would highly recommend it. We stayed in a street view room with a king bed that was very clean and pleasant. Although there were some signs of &quot;tiredness&quot; in the furniture, it was still lovely.Tip:If you wish to use the sauna - extra reminders are necessary.	
Jun 30 2009 	Simple and good	Booked a room with two double beds for four nights from June 26-30, 2009.The Bad: It's a small hotel but it's a great place nonetheless. Rooms were clean but the hotel and room shows its age. Rough spots in the arm chair and corners of walls. Hotel elevator is terribly slow and there are only two. Bathroom and bedroom was small but that's expected in most New York hotels. I had a rough experience with the check in staff. The lady who checked me in was clearly foreign so I had trouble understanding her. After a long trip to New York I wasn't very patient. Rooms are dimly lit--only lamps no ceiling lights. There aren't enough outlets here especially when you have electronics like a laptop, cellphone, ipod etc.The Good: The price is reasonable for New York. Maid service was good in cleaning and provided fresh towels every day. For kids, the hotel has a bunch of DVDs for rent that you can use in the DVD player they provide. Free wireless internet was wonderful and fast. There was a computer and printer in the small hotel library which was good for printing out boarding passes. The bell hop and desk staff were generally friendly except the lady mentioned above. The beds were very comfortable as were the sheets. I had a 6:30 pm flight but there is a luggage storage room that the hotel provides which was very helpful because they have a 12pm check out time. The halls are nice and quiet at night and during the day making it a perfect place to relax after a long day in the city. The location is very good. Close to Times Square, 5th Avenue, Bryant Park and the New York Public Library and Rockefeller Center. The B,D,F,V train is close by at 42nd street and 6th Avenue. If you want a cab, it's reasonable going from 44th street to anywhere. I went to the Upper East Side at 96th street for under $10 and the same when I went to Greenwich Village. I did not try the hotel's restaurant, Triomphe, or room service. From my walks around the area I didn't find a lot of restaurants. There isn't as many as in Greenwich Village or the Upper West Side, so count on leaving the area for lunch or dinner. I would come back to the Iroquois for my next trip. Reasonable price. Clean and comfortable room. What more could you ask for in a New York hotel? It's good for families.	
Jun 29 2009 	Fantastic Boutique Hotel close to everything.	The service was good, not outstanding, but the doorman was usually available and the staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was small (typical for NY) but well appointed. The bed was comfortable, Frette linens and towels, Molton Brown tolietries, serious water pressure, tiny closet (again, typical for NY). The location was perfect, close to subways, walking distance to Times Square, Central Park, Broadway, even Lincoln Center if you are up for a stretch of the legs. Turn down service was nice, housekeeping was pretty thorough, and room service was good. No real view, typical for the area but the hotel was wonderfully air conditioned, quiet, and felt luxurious. We would definitely consider staying at the Iroquois again.	
Jun 28 2009 	Very Nice Not Amazing	I stayed here with my 2 children for 4 nights. We booked it for the great price and the location. The hotel is very small. It has a small lobby, sitting area and small restaurant. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. When we checked in they gave us an option of 2 rooms the first one was the one I booked and it was extremely small!! The second one was the room we upgraded. It was an additional $100 per night. It was a one bedroom suite and far superior. Since this was originally an old hotel the bathrooms are very small. My major complaint was that they turned off the a/c overnight. Even though there was a thermostat in the room it wasn't working and it was controlled by the front desk. We like to sleep in a cool room so each night I had to call the front desk to remind them to turn on the a/c. They were very nice and had no qualms but we could not adjust it according to our liking. The had Molton Brown bath products, Frette robes and linens and complimentary water. They had turn down service each night and did a nice job cleaning the room. Other then that the hotel was very nice. Great price and nice employees.	
Jun 25 2009 	My home away from home in New York	Once again, the Iroquois has gone far beyond even the most outrageous expectations one can imagine. I was staying for two days and nights, on business, with an extremely tight schedule. Though my flight was delayed in arriving at JFK, the driver that the hotel sent made up for it in getting me to Midtown. In addition, as I was now behind time for my meetings, the hotel insisted that I use the driver and limo to get around, as it would save me time and hopefully make up the lost time due to the late plane. I only had to drop my bags off with &quot;Rocky&quot; the doorman, whom I knew would look after getting things to my room. My check-in was pretty much a formality, as I only had to say &quot;hello&quot; to the front desk clerk, and grab a room key before being whisked off to my meetings.Being spoiled as I was could become habit forming!!! The meetings went smoothly, and just having to go outside to a waiting car before going on to the next meeting was a convenient luxury (now I know why Donald Trump has a driver!) that I will consider for my next trip to NYC.Upon returning to the Iroquois, I bid Hector and his Towncar goodbye, and was immediately greetid by a glass of Champagne in the lobby bar. Dinner at the restaurant Triomphe was slated for 8 pm, after the pre-theatre rush, but instead of heading to my room, I ended up having a few hord d'ouvres in the bar. Food was great, and plentiful, and when I eventually went in for dinner I was afforded enough privacy to read up for the next days' meetings, while at the same time being given excellent service.I stuck to the seasonal menu for dinner, enjoying the mixed greens and pine nuts salad, with a small fillet for the main. Excellent value.When I finally got to my room, I found that my suit had been un-packed and hung up in the closet, with a note stating that if necessary, I could have the Valet press the garment before the morning. This was much appreciated, as I had been travelling quite a bit before arriving in New York, and there were a few wrinkles.I called the Valet, who whisked my suit off, assuring me it would be returned before 7 am. He even took my shoes for a shine!The next day, my suit and shoes were returned along with a pot of coffee, making a glorious start to the days' meetings.After a hectic day of business meetings, and knowing I had dinner and a show to go to that night, I was looking forward to a short respite between 4 and 6, and my room and the luxurious bed made it happen. Very comfortable, and quiet!Overall, the staff are ewxceptional, from their drivers (thanks again, Hector), Rocky the doorman, Marga the concierge (how DID you get those tickets?) right on up to the chambermaids who freshened up my room each afternoon.I have stayed at the Iroquois many times, and though there are less expensive places to stay in mid-town Manhattan, I always seem to retun there, for the service and the feeling of appreciation that is given off by the staff. It truly is my home away from home in New York City.	
Jun 22 2009 	Nice Hotel	The staff were very friendly at the hotel. Our room was small but very comfortable and super quiet. We had no street noise at all. This is a great location for site seeing and getting around the city. Don't pack a lot of stuff because the closet is ridiculously small. We didn't eat at the hotel but maybe next time.	
Jun 9 2009 	Nice hotel but avoid the less expensive miniscule rooms	Nice hotel with a friendly staff. We grabbed a last minute package to nyc. The rate was great, but now I know why. They put my wife and I (I'm 6'2&quot;) in the smallest room I've ever stayed in. It could only fit a double bed, which was way too small for me. It was about 225 sq. ft.. This room may suffice for a small single traveller, but not 2 people. They should never have given us a room like this. If we had a nicer/larger room, we might have like the hotel a lot more.	
Jun 4 2009 	Lovely hotel and perfect location	We went to New York in February for a week and after much research we decided on the Iroquois mainly due to the reviews on here and also the great rate on hotels.com.LOCATIONPerfect. Couldn't have asked for anything better, 1.5 blocks from Times Square, literally a 5 minute walk. A lovely street just far enough away from the hustle and bustle.The Red Flame diner is a few doors down and like many have said in reviews it really is the best diner for breakfast. We went there most mornings before we set off for our day.HOTELFree internet access in the reception which we never had to que for. Recepetion were helpful and helped with any requests we had. Always said good morning etc.Our room was small but we were expecting this as everyone says it, small really is small!There was no view, unless you love walls! on our first morning we walked past an open room that was being cleaned and looked much bigger and brighter so we asked the maid if we could move! Recpetion said it was no problem and would be a little extra for the week, we were happy to pay this, we moved everything over and were much happier.The size of the room really isn't important as you are up and out so early and back late it really is just somewhere to sleep. The toiletries were lovely, molton brown and were replenished daily as were towels.We had no complaints.Getting around.New York is so easy to get around, we were so surprised. We had booked a tour with Real New York Tours thinking we'd never find anything but this tour wasn't until our 3rd day. To our surprise in our first couple of days we'd done miles and found it so easy we were worried we'd wasted money on a tour.ToursFor people thinking of booking Real New Tours or one similar my advice is to book this at the beginning of your stay ie day 1 or 2. Any later and i don't think it's worth the money. Ours was a half day and yes it was really interesting and the guide was lovely but we could have done it on our own in hindsight. She did take us to Harlem which we wouldn't have done on our own and took me to Carrie's house :0 ) which again, i wouldn't have found on my own! Just book it for your first days there.Things to do.1.WTC Museum WorkshopGo. Worth every penny. Extremely moving. Would highly recommend. 12/102.Ellis islandReally enjoyed, more than we thought actually. Don't do the statue of liberty as a seperate trip unless you really want to get off and climb it, the boat to Ellis stops to let people off at Liberty Island so you get a really good look and plenty of photo opps. The boat goes right round too so in my opinion not worth the extra ££3.Empire StateWorth doing, wanted to do it to say we'd done it, view was well worth the que!4.Chelsea MarketReally liked it hear, smaller than i thought it was. Stop for chinese, lovely.5.Grenwich VillageLoved walking about here. Friends building, SATC Carrie's house and of course Magnolia bakery-stop for a cupcake or 2, there lovely.Had an amazing time and will definatley be back! xBroadwayWe went to see Mary Poppins and it was out of this world. Go and see it you'll love it! We're in our 30's and sat grinning like cheshire cats on the 1st row! Brilliant.i booked tickets through www.broadwaybox.com and good a good price and got front seats even though it was only 2 weeks before the show.EatingRed Flame for breakfastsJohn's for pizza.......best pizza ever!Serendipidy's....we went twice, my b/f loved it! Advice is to book a table as there's always que's outside the door for up to 1hr, we went booked and then went to Macy's did a bit of shopping and went back.	
Jun 3 2009 	I really liked this hotel.	I've just got back from my stay at The Iroquois and felt compelled to give it a review.I really liked this hotel. I thought the staff were great (unlike the previous reviewer). I get fed up of that fake &quot;have a nice day&quot; stuff that (some of) our North American friends like so much and I thought the staff here had the balance just right... Not too overfriendly and very helpful when required (I would particularly like to mention the barman Casey).While the rooms were a little on the small size and my room didn't have much of a view, the bed was fantastic and the bathroom clean. There's free WIFI in every room, an iPod dock, big TV, as well as all the usual stuff (iron/ mini bar/ umbrella/ safe). What else do you want from a hotel room?The location is great for all the usual sightseeing stuff, (I'm not a huge fan of Midtown) and my step mother, who was visiting NYC for the first time, was equally impressed with The Iroquois.My only negative point was that the bar shut rather early (around 11pm) on the Saturday night and is closed all day Sunday.My step mother's (and my) holiday was enhanced by my choosing this hotel. That is recommendation enough for me.	
Jun 1 2009 	Great location but uncaring staff and cramped rooms	The hotel is located in Midtown Manhattan on 44th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. It is only about two blocks from the small, but beautiful Bryant Park. The taxi ride from JFK is a flat $45 plus $5 toll and tip. It is a relatively small hotel sharing a narrow street with the Sofitel and another hotels as well as a diner and a few restaurants, including the Triomphe which is the hotel's restaurant and where room service comes from. I cannot comment on the food because I did not eat any of it. However, the Triomphe was rated high by Zagat (average of about 23 or so). The Internet worked intermittently, but no different from anywhere else in the USA. The staff were uncaring and barely helpful. Also, when the doorman opened the door for us I overheard him saying to another staff member, &quot;You know Jose only made $20 in tips?&quot; That is just not classy. At night, there was no staff at the desk or no doorman, so security is a bit of a concern. There was a video camera installed in the elevator, but I think people can use the staircase from the first floor. The guy who was there at night was not very friendly or even really tried to be helpful. The concierge was only seen a few times during the day.The deluxe room was very nice with an old New York feel to it. However, it was a bit cramped New York-style, too. When you go use the toilet and leave the door open, for example, you have to pee sideways because the door blocks your way. Also, the shower/bathtub is an older type in which you need to pull all the way to get proper water pressure and then push a metal stick to have the water come out of the showerhead. The bathroom amenities were alright though. Our rooms faced the courtyard which had a noisy airconditioning system or some kind of machine that hummed loudly all day. The lobby is like a mix between a classic New York pub and someone's living room (there is a den with computer).The price of the hotel jumped up to double when we tried to add extra nights. So I think we got a very good deal. The manager was helpful and negotiated a lower rate for us which was nice of her. SUMMARY: This is a four star hotel in quality of the rooms, but I think the service could be much better. It was really lacking when we were there and so I want to give this hotel three and a half stars overall. I would stay somewhere else before choosing the Iroquois Hotel again.	
May 22 2009 	Excellent location!	First time to New York--would definitely recommend the Iroquois--outstanding location near Times Square but far enough from the noise--room was quite small, which is typical for NYC from what we've heard--comfy beds--wonderful shower--pleasant staff--all made for an outstanding trip and anniversary celebration! Would highly recommend O'Lunney's Pub, Cranberries, Cafe Europa, and Kellaria Taverna. Would not recommend the double decker bus tour.All in all, an amazing trip! Can't wait to return!	
May 20 2009 	Great Staff ~ Great Comfort ~ Great Location!	I would and have recommended this hotel to a few people. I have stayed here twice and have now made it my destination for NYC visits. Location is perfect, within a 3-5 minute walk of Broadway, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City and Fifth Avenue. Tons of great restaurants around the area - but make sure to take in dinner and drinks at Triomphe. Ask for Robin--she is the best! The hotel staff was fabulous, concierge even knew where the best coffee was (The Red Flame)--and she was right. Room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom spotless! You won't be sorry.	
May 17 2009 	Wonderful midtown location	Our stay at the Iroquois got off to a rough start because--after wandering around NYC for a couple of hours, waiting for a room to be ready--we erroneously were put in a smoking room. Though staff at the front desk acknowledged the mistake, they were unable to put us in a non-smoking room that was the size we had reserved (four months earlier). So, we spent our first night at the hotel in a very small non-smoking room, then had to repack in order to be moved for the balance of our stay to the type of room we had reserved. The move did go smoothly; we left our bags in our first room and when we returned later in the day, they had been transferred to the &quot;right&quot; room.That said, we have visited New York on numerous occasions, never finding--until now--a reasonably-priced (by NYC standards) hotel where we cared to stay a second time. We will stay at the Iroquois again. It has been nicely rehabilitated, the rooms are attractive and comfortable (though some are quite small), the staff was friendly, and the location couldn't be better for visitors. The theater district is just a block or two to the west, Fifth Avenue shopping is a block east, and Grand Central Station is just a bit farther east. And, the legendary Algonquin Hotel--with its lobby bar and resident cat--is two doors away.Besides initially being put in a smoking room, the only problems we noticed were that there rarely was a concierge on duty (though staff at the front desk could provide assistance) and the promised nightly turn-down service didn't actually occur nightly--and when it did occur, it was strangely early (5:30 p.m.). Housekeeping staff also left tip envelopes in the room, a practice we've not previously seen.All in all, though, we were very happy at the Iroquois.	
May 12 2009 	Very comfortable hotel in perfect locations	We where staying to do some sightseeing and shopping and catch a show.The location means 5 min from Broadway, 10 min from Central Park and close to metro.We travelled all over the city but always experienced the location as easy to get to and did a lot on food.The room was clean with good appointed bathroom and important clean and comfortable beds (rooms are smaller but size was not a problem). Staff was very pleasant. Present to help but never pushy and provided some real advice.Pick up or delivery to airport was arranged well at reasonable price.Wireless internet could be improved but it did work. We will most certainly return to this hotel. Highly recommended	
May 12 2009 	5th time's a charm!	This was our 5th stay in the last 2 years. One would think you would know exactly what to expect when you arrive. Yet, we were completely amazed when we checked in! We arrived at 2PM, which was 1 hour prior to check in time. They were so apologetic that our room was not available that they gave us free drinks at the bar while we waited. We didn't expect our room to be ready, yet they really went above and beyond to make sure we weren't upset. When our room was finally ready, they informed us that we had been upgraded to their presidential suite. When we arrived, we found a HUGE room, by not only NYC standards, but by all standards! There was a livingroom, dining room, full kitchen, beautiful bedroom with a king sized bed and wonderful marbled bathroom with separate shower and jetted bathtub. It was simply amazing! As with all of our past stays, the hotel is impeccably clean, wonderul Molten Brown ammenities, Frette linens/robes, wonderful bed linens and very classic decor. We had visited some of our friends that were also in the city for a wedding with us and looked at their hotel rooms and it seems the trend is to look very &quot;trendy&quot; &quot;ikea-ish&quot; and this is definitely not the look the Iroquois is going for. This is a classic, upscale hote and I will say I am VERY picky with hotels. My husband will tell anyone that I am a hotel snob and I will ONLY EVER stay at the Iroquois while in Manhattan.The location is centrally located in Midtown Manhattan, 3 blocks from Rockefeller, Times Square and a short walk to The Empire State Building and Central Park.The staff warmly welcome you everytime you enter the hotel and their attention to detail is apparent!I would recommend this hotel to anyone that asks and will definitely return!Jodi Apple Valley, MN	
May 11 2009 	A gem in a great setting...solid platinum!	My daughter and I were in New york for business, but it was also Mother's day weekend. We stayed at the Iroquois for the first time, but not the last .The staff was great, especially Rocky andJ.J. ..they made us feel special and at home. The restaurant was fabulous. We had the chefs sampler menu..try it. Breakfast in bed the next morning yielded wonders, croissants and fresh fruit..great coffee . Our room was quiet and I wanted to take the bed home. Actually I wanted to take the hotel home. Kristen Walter Dukes	
May 11 2009 	A quaint little hotel	A quaint little hotel in the mist of all the hustle of New York. The staff was very pleasant and welcoming. Our room was very clean and the bed very comfortable, the only flaw (and it's minor) is that our room was very tiny. We stayed in an Executive King, small but very clean. Hotel is in a good location and would feel very comfortable recommending this hotel. We enjoyed our stay.	
May 10 2009 	Hidden Gem	Just returned from 3 night stay at the Iroquois. This is our 3rd stay at this property over a 4 year period. Great location, great staff. Walking distance to 5th Avenue, Madison Avenue, Grand Central Station, Times Square, Rockefellar Center, etc. Rooms size wise are what you expect in NYC. Rooms are nicely appointed, great Flat Screen TV and bathroom. Very nice fitness room on 3rd floor. Will definitely stay again.	
May 5 2009 	Our home in New York	This wonderful hotel would be a true gem in any city, but couple that with their location (only 1.5 blocks from Times Square) and this is a fantastic place to stay. We have always been impressed with the service here, and for almost ten years have made it our only destination when we travel to New York.Small touches that really matter include a complimentary DVD library, an umbrella in the room for those unexpected rain showers, and luxurious linens and towels. We look forward to every trip.	
May 3 2009	Home away from home	My mother and I stayed at the Iroquois April 26th through May 2nd. It was very nice, close to all the big attractions. I say this is a true home away from home because when my mother and I got tired and wanted to rest we would say let's go home instead of let's go back to the hotel. The staff were extremely nice and pleasant and helped us find some really great places to eat. I would stay at the Iroquois again if I go back to NYC.	
May 1 2009 	Wonderful and relaxed place to stay	Just returned from our stay at The Iroquois and can't recommend this hotel highly enough. Our king size room was kept very clean and the bed was so big and comfortable. The staff are courteous but not in your face, sometimes someone is on the door but not all the time but personally I don't need anyone to open the door for me each time. The location is perfect, walking distance to Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller, Empire State, Macy's and Central Park. There is a a diner just a few yards down the road which does a good breakfast if you want more than just continental. All in all a great place to stay and I would definitely book there again.	
Apr 29 2009 	Excellent location great room and service	We had a 5 night stay at the Iroquois and had initially booked a Queen room. However, upon arrival I (perhaps cheekily!) asked if we could be upgraded and we got a King room for an extra $30 a night (which was well worth it). The staff at the hotel were all excellent, from the front desk to the concierge to the bell man to the door man, all very polite and helpful (which is NOT the norm for New York!!). The room itself was nice and spacious, good sized flat screen TV, very comfortable king sized bed, good sized bathroom, all very clean. The view not so great but was still quite light. Two things made me realise this hotel was brilliant. The first was when room service delivered a free bottle of wine to our room as it was my girlfriend's birthday (which I had mentioned on check in). The second was one night when my other half and I came back and we'd stopped at a little place to get a cup of tea to take back. When we got back there was no tea bag in the cup, just hot water and milk!! So I went down to reception and the lady there was all too apologetic even though it wasn't from the hotel! She then went and got us a couple of tea bags for no charge, bless her!Overall this was a very, very pleasant stay. The location is fantastic, literally 1 and a half blocks from Times Square and half a block from 5th Avenue. We didn't have any food there (it was a tad pricey) but it all looked pretty good. There was also free wireless internet there too.Definitely recommend this hotel!	
Apr 26 2009 	Overall excellent	Great location. Fair price from Hotels.com. Staff all very pleasant and room was great. My only complaint was that the wireless in the room was very inconsistent, going from not connected at all, to connecting at highly variable speeds. If I was a business traveler relying on wireless it would have been a problem.	
Apr 25 2009 	Great Hotel !!!!	First of all,,Great Location. Hotel was Super...Hotel Staff Extremely Friendly.Beds Extremely Comfortable Niceeeee linens. Large Plasma TV with DVD Player.The Shower was Great !! Incredibly Powerful...sweetttttt.This is a Very Relaxing Hotel....Nice and Quiet....Will Stay here again and again.Free Internet........Hedge	
Apr 24 2009 	great place great spot	The Iroquois hotel is a small but very pleasant hotel to stay. It is situated in w 44th street between 5th and 6th Avenue and at walking distance of all the sights to see.The staff is excellent and the rooms are clean and well equiped.In the surrounding of the hotel there are more than enough restaurants to take your pick.We stayed for 5 nights and that's even for European standards long enough to see te sights in upper, middle and lower Manhattan. The limousine service to the airport is great (USD 95) and efficient. Everything you ask for can be arranged by the staff of the hotel. The room we had (604) is at w 44th street side but is very quiet. The room are spacious enough for a city hotel.	
Apr 23 2009	Would highly recommend the Iroquois	Location was great - convenient to everywhere, beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were very quiet and clean, staff was very pleasant, and nice diner two doors down to get a quick bite to eat. Only thing that I would have changed would be to have ice machines on each floor, rather than having to call room service for ice. But I will definitely stay hear again.	
Apr 23 2009	a great hotel while on business	recently stayed at this hotel in March 2009, rate was great and while the room was small ( what isn't in NYC) the bathroom was fab, great amenities and a perfect location.this is my second time and i still think its a great value for the dollar	
Apr 23 2009 	A delight!	Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Disappointed that the Bar wasn't open full time! A lovely, quiet, and relaxing place to stay!	
Apr 21 2009 	lovely hotel in a busy city	We stayed at the Iroquois for 5 nights. We had a wonderful stay - hotel is close to 5th Ave, Time Square, &amp; the subway. On our second night - it was raining heavily - in our room - there was an umbrella and we were able to borrow another one to use while we went out to dinner - numerous restaurants surrounding the hotel. The location is really quiet - as I am a light sleeper - there was hardly any outside noise and the bed is extremely comfortable. We were going to stay at Affinia Manhattan - I am glad we decided to stay at the Iroqouis. When I go back to NY again - I would definitely come back.	
Apr 19 2009 	Great service	I booked this hotel on the internet and did'nt have any references but the pictures and description. I have been in New York before and got disappointed, when I arrived at the hotel. But The Iroquois was perfect in many ways. Not very expensive but cozy, clean and so service minded. The front desk employees were so kind and helpfull, and every day we got a free paper, chocolate, sparkling water and the weather forecast on our room. So I will recommend this place.to everybody.	
Apr 18 2009 	Great Place to stay	We spent three days and nights at the Iroquois Hotel. Every night, our bed was turned down. If we had a request, it was met immediately. Service cannot be beat. Examples: Our sink stopper was not working properly, and maintenance came immediately to fix it. We did not have washcloths, and housekeeping came instantly to bring as many as we wanted. Really, it was a wonderful stay.	
Apr 18 2009 	Superb Hotel	I stayed her in January 09 for 4 nights with my fiancee as i was looking for a special hotel to get engaged in and this was ideal. Fantastic location and great price we found through the hotel website.Arrived to a luxurious entrance and allocated a gorgeous 8th floor room which was perfect for our stay. Not a huge room but in New York, you don't get a huge room unless you pay a premium and how long do u stay in the room for!!!Didn't use any of the hotel facilities but the bed was turned down every night with a choclate left and weather update on the pillows which was a lovely touch,This hotel is a must for anyone who is visiting New York, the best hotel i have found yet	
Apr 17 2009 	A great New York hotel	I would definitely stay in the Iroquois again. The location is great, the rooms are spacious for NYC and the beds are extremely comfortable. The hotel is very nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. Stayed for 4 nights over the busy Easter weekend but the hotel was quiet, calm and relaxing. The staff were all very helpful and whilst we didn't have time to try the hotel restaurant the menu was very good.	
Apr 16 2009 	Our new Favorite Hotel	My husband and I were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, and our children gifted us a stay at the Iroquois. We loved the Hotel. I don't know what we liked better - the beautiful suite we were in, with the jacuzzi tub and the sitting room, or the fact that we could walk everywhere.It was Easter weekend, and the staff was very cordial and helpful; the room was beautifully decorated, with the highest quality linens and accesories, and the intimacy of a finer boutique hotel.The location was a plus, making it our new Favorite hotel, since we could walk to the theatre, our favorite restaurants, and even the train station. We will definitely stay there the next time we are in the city, and will send all of our friends there, too.	
Apr 11 2009 	ideal tween adventure	My 11 yr old daughter and I stayed at the Iroquois for 2 nights and loved it. The staff are warm and helpful. It is next door to the Algonquin where we visited their famous cat Mathilda. Walking distance to all Broadway shows. 1 block from 6th Ave subway lines. Our room looked out on a lovely outdoor patio seating area next door and was very quiet for NYC because we were in the back of the hotel. The small library off of the lobby had a computer available for guests so my daughter could keep in touch with her friends via g mail. There were lots of restaurants on 44th and 45th streets--from fancy french to Chipoltle and of course the Red Flame Coffee Shop.	
Apr 10 2009 	Great Place	I join the many who love this place. Roomy, tasteful, great service, fantastic location.	
Apr 8 2009 	The Iroquois is as nearly perfect an experience as you can get.	We spent three nights at the Iroquois in April--myself, our teenage daughter and my husband. We chose a suite, and in effect found it was two rooms for the price of one. Our daughter could shut the door and have her own space, and a very comfortable bed.The hotel is brilliantly located--an easy walk to the theatre district, Times Square, Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue, and of course good shopping. At the same time, when you walk inside, it feels like an oasis. The door is opened for you with a smile, and it's quiet and comfortable inside. The desk staff greet you with a steaming cup of cider--very refreshing.The room was spacious, immaculately clean, and nicely furnished. Each evening your bed is turned down, and chocolates and a weather report left on your pillow. If I could change one thing, I'd have windows that can open--but that would allow noise, so it might not suit some--the double glazing meant it was very quiet. There was also one waitress who disappointed with her cool attitude.However, the rest of the staff were terrific--and that's what really makes the place. Absolutely everyone else--from cleaners, doormen and most of all the desk staff-- were ready and willing to help, and generously sorted out any problem. For example, we were offered umbrellas on rainy days, and were allowed to shower and warm up after a drenching on the last day of our stay, long after we should have checked out of the room--and for a very reasonable extra fee. Really, the staff make the place what it is--a perfect spot for wonderful holiday!	
Apr 7 2009 	The ONLY hotel I stay at in New York.	As a business traveler who has been to New York City over 100 times in the last twenty years, I have stayed at somewhere between 15-20 different hotels. During that time, I developed a personal set of preferences for a satisfying NY hotel trip, listed in order of importance to me: 1 - Very clean and comfortable bed/pillows 2 - Bath with a strong shower and good bath amenities; 3 - Pleasant and helpful staff 4 - Centralized location to wherever I need to go, whether by foot or cab 5 - Free access to internet 6 - Exercise facilities, accessible at any time at no chargeGiven these criteria, I am proud to say that I have not stayed at another hotel other than the Iroquois for several years now! Looking back, I am quite amazed that not one hotel that I visited prior to the Iroquois was able to match each of my preferences (in some cases, not even half of them!). Given the sprawling, crowded environment of many of the larger NYC hotels that I previously endured, I have become especially fond of the Iroquois' cozy, intimate setting that allows the staff the opportunity to assist on a more personal basis with their guests. That the hotel staff always remembers me by name whenever I return (and I have also seen this with many other visitors) and goes out of their way to make me feel welcome without being intrusive is an absolute luxury - especially when i am over 2,000 miles away from home!	
Apr 3 2009 	Only Perfect	To put it simply, this is an extraordinary hotel, but not merely because of the standard concerns of location and amenities. It has those in abundance, but it has something else that truly sets it above and apart from even what most would otherwise consider the best. The Management and Staff of the Iroquois New York genuinely care about the pleasure you take from your stay with them. No, it is not overt or even subtly obsequious treatment that lacks sincerity and substances. It is exclusively about how you, the guest, perceives the physical characteristics of the hotel, the merits of its collective efforts, and the overall attitude and manner the entire package is delivered. They could not do it better. Moreover, no hotel my wife and I have ever stayed in forty-two plus years of traveling in Asia, Europe, Canada, The Caribbean, and the United States has come even close.	
Apr 2 2009 	Great hotel great location.	Very plush traditional hotel. Very clean with polite staff. 3 minutes walk to Times Square. Lovely rooms, although ours was pretty small with a view onto a brick wall! Mini bar, large plasma telly with DVD player, really good bathroom. No tea making facils in the room which was a bit of a shame, but they did have them in reception. Overall a great hotel that I would recommend to anyone.	
Mar 31 2009	Great little hotel maybe a little overpriced	Great hotel in perfect location, not one of those huge anonymous institutions. A bit on the old side, but thats the side effect of having a history and atmosphere. We stayed in a suite which was great, the beds are really wonderful, but paying list price for it seems a bit overpriced. Staff was friendly and helpful.	
Mar 30 2009 	Very disappointed with the iroquois	My wife and i stayed at the Iroquois over the weekend as we did dinner and a broadway show and made a great weekend of it. She wanted a larger hotel like the W but i was interested in the Iroquois because of the history behind it and being a smaller boutique hotel i had higher expectations. I was very disappointed. The only high points were the bed and pillows which were large and comfortable. That was pretty much it. The room was tiny, and holding a king size bed it seemed even smaller. The bathroom was also quite small and my wife and i had to shift around each other to both get ready to go out. On top of that, the bar closed very early for a Friday night. We came back to the hotel around 12:30am expecting to have a few drinks and were let down as it was already closed for the evening. To sum things up, the front desk was a bit snooty and annoyed when we had questions. Being a native New Yorker, it took all my energy not to lose my temper as i didnt appreciate being treated badly and i now know why New Yorkers get such a bad reputation as being so rude as they were quite nasty.	
Mar 29 2009 	I won't stay anywhere else!	If stayed in numerous hotels in the city and have finally found my home away from home. Hotel is on 44th which is great location. Close to museums and shopping on 5th. Bryant Park and the New York City Public Library are a block away. Times Square is a couple of blocks west.If you dine at Triomphe, be sure and order the Scallop appetizer and the Rack of Lamb. Wine list is also impressive.Staff was great. Concierge was helpful. Bell hop walked me to a shoe repair shop upt the block when my heel broke. Shoe shine service was good. They even let me check in early at noon. Cleaning and turdown service was very good and attentive to detail. I also enjoyed having the Times delivered to my door daily. They also work with a great executive shuttle service to and from airports. Ask for Martin,The Hotel has a boutique charm. The rooms are somewhat small, but the amenities were great! Molton Brown toiletries and down pillows and comforters. The beds were super-comfy and the linens were very nice. The rooms were also extremely quiet. I stayed right across the hall from the elevator and only heard people a couple of times. Mini bar is nicely stocked and wine key came in handy for the bottle I purchased at the market on 42nd. Oh yeah they also put chocolates on your pillow every night! The free wi-fi had a strong signal.You get a great value for your money along with friendly staff and good location. I won't stay anywhere else.	
Mar 28 2009 	Couldn't Have Been Better	This was our second stay at the Iroquois, and we could not have been more pleased. Our suite was spacious, comfortable, and clean. The staff were gracious and friendly, and the location is perfect -- close enough to Times Square (but not too close), Fifth Avenue, and bus and metro stops. We will be back.	
Mar 26 2009 	A Wonderful Hotel in the Centre of Manhattan	I can't begin to tell you how much we enjoyed our stay, you have a wonderful bunch of people therefrom the moment we walked through the door we were treated like royalty, the girls on reception were fantastic ( but i only caught the lovely Claudia's name as she was there all weekend) but they were all a joy to come back to, the guys on the door who made us feel like they'd known us all our lives, Marguetta (our maid) who had to clear our room (mess) with a smile and just the staff we met in the lifts and the lobby were so friendly and helpfulthe meal at the Triomphe was incredible, i followed the m'aitre d's recommendation (he must have known what i liked) and I was so so impressed by the quality of the food and service.The whole NY trip was something neither my son or me will ever forget and please pass on my thanks to the staff for making it soi really hope to come back again and see you all	
Mar 24 2009 	WOW	Wife and I stayed here from 3/13-3/17/09. What a GREAT place!! Everyone was very friendly and felt more like family atmosphere. Rooms were just right in size with ample closet space. Everything was very clean. I booked on quickbook and got a great rate. Being on 44th St between 5th and 6th avenue was awesome. Subway had 2 easily accessible subway stops to take you to all of Manhattan. Regina and her manager really shined. We hope to come back again as soon as possible.	
Mar 20 2009	Mother/Daughter Stay was absolutely amazing!	My daughter, age 23, and I visited New York for the first time and chose to stay at the Iroquois. I am so thankful we did. The hotel and staff are amazing! Courteous, kind, informative and very caring. The hotel is a beautifully updated boutique hotel. The rooms were a little small but from what I understand they are large by New York standards. The beds were ultra plush with European linens. The hotel offers a complimentary turn-down service each evening...plus chocolates! During our stay, my daughter became extremely ill and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The staff at the Iroquois was extremely caring and helpful. We felt safe and well cared for the entire time we were at the Iroquois. The location is amazing! 2 blocks to the center of Time Square and 2 blocks to Grand Central Station. I recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a convenient, clean, luxurious and reasonably priced hotel in New York City.	
Mar 13 2009 	Wonderful pampering lovely experience.	Beautiful hotel, clean rooms, great shower. Friendly staff, great sauna and fitness room. Centrally located. Would stay again in a heartbeat.	
Mar 12 2009 	Five Star Service and Convenient Location!	I would be delighted to stay in this hotel again.First, the service was impeccable. Everyone from the doorman to the front desk person was friendly and accommodating. I extended my stay for one night and asked to be moved from a room with two double beds to a room with a single bed (due to a change in occupancy) and they did so with no problems and even upgraded me. And, I got late check out all three days of my stay with no problems.Additionally, when they weren't able to service my room due to an accidentally-left &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign, they left a note and were happy to come up and service the room at 9:30 pm!Secondly, the location is a quick 5 minute walk to shopping and Central Park.But, in the end, it was the beds that sold me - so comfortable!	
Mar 12 2009 	Great bed perfect location attentive service - deserves all 4 stars!	Let's start with the fact that I am something of a hotel snob...The high points - very comfortable bed (lots of pillows, high thread count sheets), very clean, excellent and polite service (doorman to front desk to room attendant), legitimate fitness facility (dumbbells, weight machines, sauna, cardio choices), superb intimate bar and restaurantThe nominal knocks - small lobby which was bit cluttered, small bathroom (but very clean, good pressure, excellent products, plenty of great towels and two fluffy robes), slow elevators (but zero noise at night!), smallish roomI'm joining their Gold Guest Advantage program and coming back soon - I stay in the City often (25 nights plus/year) and this hotel is my new favorite. Stayed two nights, and it felt like home immediately.	
Mar 11 2009 	Overall a great hotel!	We had a nearly perfect stay overall--the staff and the room were absolutely great. The room was very clean and attractive, and the shower was incredibly powerfulI could have stayed in there all day!! The beds were very comfortable with nice linens, the bathroom was nicely appointed with luxurious towels and toiletries, and our room was quiet. The location is outstandingvery close to Times Square, the Theater District, etc.The only issue we had was when we went to check out, the woman at the desk said that we had two charges from the minibar (water and a Coke) and one charge for a toll-free call from the room. I said that we did not consume anything from the minibar and that the call was one that she offered to place for me for tech support for the WIfi in the room when she called up to our room to see if it was working again (we had reported the problem that arose at the end of our stay, and one of the staff came up to see about it--since it was still unresolved, the front desk offered to place a call to the toll-free number for the ISP, and I accepted the offer). At checkout, I told the staff member that I never would have used the hotel phone for this if I thought I would have to pay for the call (furthermore, why should a guest pay for a call to tech support when the hotels internet service is down?), and she nicely said, &quot;OK,&quot; and deleted both charges though I wasn't convinced that she felt OK about this--it did not leave me with a very good feeling. Only after checking out did we realize that the hotel had intended to charge us for beverages that we had purchased elsewhere and left on the table with the minibar items. Those that we bought were different sizes than those provided in the room, and the water was a different brand entirely. It seems that they should inventory their own offerings to see if any had been consumed rather than seeing partially empty bottles and deducing that the guests should be charged. These two minor details ended an otherwise wonderful stay on a less than perfect note, but otherwise, we loved the hotel and had no other complaints. We suggest that you keep your food/drinks purchased elsewhere in another place in the room (or ask the hotel staff to remove the minibar offerings entirely) to avoid the appearance of having consumed some of these highly priced items!	
Mar 9 2009 	Awesome location attentive staff and comfy rooms. Will definitely be back!	Took my daughter to NYC for her 16th bday and I couldn't have been happier with this hotel. It is a small hotel but it is beautifully decorated, spotless, comfortable and they have the softest beds ever. The staff was wonderful, they were all very polite and accomodating. There is a diner right next door so you can get afforable breakfast/lunch and a drug store right around the corner. As if all that wasn't enough, the location of this hotel just can't be beat. Within easy walking distance of Bryant Park, Public Library, Rockerfeller Center, Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue. I'll be recommending this hotel to all my friends and will stay here again on my next visit to NYC.	
Mar 5 2009 	Perfect for a romantic trip in NYC	My girlfriend and I stayed at The Iroquois for our first trip to New York and found it absolutely the wonderful. All the staff were extremely friendly, and it was the small things that really made the difference like the expensive sheets on the bed. When we return we would definitely stay here again	
Mar 5 2009 	Do not stay here	Do NOT STAY Here! This is the biggest rip off in NYC!!!!!!! Reservation was cancelled, but they didn't record it. They were happy to charge me anyway and refused to waive fee. With all of the hotels in NYC you can find one that treats clients with common courtesy.	
Mar 4 2009 	Romantic Getaway in the Heart of Manhattan	My husband surprised me with a trip to New York as a birthday treat so I didn't having any input into choosing the hotel -but he did an amazing job in choosing The Iriquois! From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like welcome guests. Every member of staff from the doorman to the housekeeper was more than pleasant. We had a executive king room which was very spacious and had all the amenities you could want, including the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We were also given a direct dial number for the telephone which was really useful for keeping in contact with home. We did not have breakfast in the hotel but used the Red Flame Diner a few doors down where we got ample supplies of pancakes, syrup and coffee!For us, the hotel could not be in a better location (between Fifth and Sixth Avenue). It is only a few minutes from Rockerfeller Centre, Radio City and St. Patrick's Cathedral. We were able to stroll along Fifth Avenue right up to Central Park (by the way would highly recommend the Boat House restaurant in the Park). We flew into Newark and the USA Coach Express left us at Bryant Park, just two streets from the hotel.The hotel has a computer just off the lobby with internet access. This was really useful for us to check on our flight times, location of shops, etc.In summary I would highly recommend The Iroquois as a small luxury hotel and look forward to returning some day. We has the perfect romantic break!	
Mar 4 2009 	They don't make hotels like this anymore--but they should.	It's my pleasure to recommend to you the Iroquois Hotel in NYC. From the moment you arrive, the staff of this small wonder of a hotel goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. The treatment my wife and I received is easily tops among hotels--there is a personal service element and approachability to it that exceeds your best expectations. Our room (a deluxe) was roomy by NY standards, perhaps smallish if you are elsewhere, but for us, it was cozy and romantic. The Iroquois is a great deal given the exceptional location (midtown, a block and a half from Times Square, but on a quiet, reserved block given to the subtle and elegant). Great bathroom with excellent shower, robes, etc. The hotel will shine your shoes, too, without fee, and do a great job of it. You get a comfortable bed with plush linens--it's little things like that which make this place special. The on-site restaurant is fine and recommended for both breakfast and meals later in the day, not to mention drinks if you are waiting on a flight. The staff always goes out of their way to make your stay perfect--why leave your hotel to chance when so much else about traveling is subject to change?It's been said by others on this site that the Iroquois is like a home away from home. I concur. If you are like us you will miss this tranquil oasis when you leave, but you'll take fond memories of your stay. We just came back from our 2nd visit and look forward to visiting again.	
Mar 3 2009 	Excellent boutique hotel	Stayed Feb 27-Mar 2. Iroquois met and exceeded our expectations. We wanted a nice boutique hotel within walking distance from Time Square and we got it. We stayed in room 808, a classic 2-double bed room. It was a comfortable size albeit smaller than the chain hotels. We had no problems with it. The room had every amenity we needed. Service was excellent from the friendly doormen, the front desk and the concierge. They even have DVDs to borrow and play in the room. My teenager loved that and the ipod dock for her music. Our room was in the back, we heard no traffic noise or any from other guests. Beds were amazingly comfortable. Nice 24-hour fitness room with a sauna. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, had breakfast at the Red Flame down the street and ate at the Tratorria dopo Teatro in the next block.	
Feb 27 2009 	The only place I will stay in NYC!	This hotel was so beautiful and quaint. I prefer the luxury of a big hotel in a small intimate setting. There was not 1 detail overlooked in this place! Everything from the beautiful lobby to the ultimate comfortable bed, to the central location, we were in heaven. I recommend this be the only place you stay in NYC!!!	
Feb 24 2009 	I Love This Hotel	I LOVE THIS HOTEL. Room size for Manhattan was generous, staff were very helpful and accomodating, the hot cider at the front desk was very welcome after a walk in the blowing snow, and the restaurant/bar were a welcome retreat. Absolutely perfectly located within walking distance to all the Broadway theatres, 5th ave. shopping, NYC library, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, Times Square. I specifically wanted to visit the Algonquin (two doors down and over my price range) to drink a martini in the lobby bar to Dorothy Parker, eat a couple of great meals, see two Broadway productions, and wander 5th and 9th avenues for shopping/deli food respectively, and it was perfectly located. Fly to Newark, take the Liberty shuttle (every 15-30 minutes) to midtown, walk 2.5 blocks to the hotel....perfect. This is the only place I will consider staying again in midtown.	
Feb 21 2009 	My second home...	If you are looking for a place you can call &quot;home&quot; then you have to go to this hotel. Excellent location, nice rooms and decoration, friendly people and a very confortable and familiar atmospher. The perfect place for business or just relax... I live in Paris and I can say that this hotel is my second home everytime I travel to New York.	
Feb 20 2009 	Home away from home...luxury value location	The Iroquois embodies the ultimate in comfort, personal service, location, privacy, and luxury at an amazingly affordable price. The staff is warm and responsive (which is not always the norm in NYC!), the rooms are well furnished and above average size for NYC. The relatively small size, compared to other properties, assures personal service and discretion.Proximity to the Theater District and Times Square is great for those looking to see the sights, yet the location is off the beaten path by a couple of blocks and quiet for the business traveler.The Concierge (Marga) made theater and dinner arrangements for my anniversary. The seats were great (even though I had to suffer Legally Blonde with my wife) and Nobu was the perfect spot for our dinner.Highly recommended for business and leisure.	
Feb 19 2009 	Way Beyond Expectation	Having travelled extensively throughout Nth America we have stayed in many hotels. As it was our 30th wedding anniversary we were looking for somewhere special to stay.The Iroquois performed way beyond our expectations. The Location is perfect. Within walking distance to many of the things to love about New York and with easy access to the Subway &amp; Taxi services. The staff are both friendly and professional. I had a hiccup with our booking and was &quot;Listened&quot; to in a courteous and friendly manner. The situation was resolved quickly which says volumes for the Hotel and staff. The Room was very clean and comfortable and YES the BEDS are wonderful and much appreciated after a day out and about. There are some great restaurants within walking distance (if you like Indian try the one on the next block towards times sq).From the time of the &quot;Concierge arranged&quot; town car picking us up at the airport to the time it deposited it us back to leave, our stay at the Iroquois was a high point in our visit to New York City.We will definitely return to the Iroquis next time we are in New York and are telling all our friends in Australia about it.Try it for a truly pleasant experience.	
Feb 18 2009 	5 star hotel in a 4 star size	To me, the Iroquois seems like a 5 star hotel in a 4 star size. The service is friendly but very professional. It is true that I have stayed in larger rooms elsewhere, but nowhere were they furnished more sumptuously. The location is perfect, and the food in Triomphe, the restaurant off the lobby, is to die for. One reason I'll look forward to coming back to NY is to return to the Iroquois.	
Feb 18 2009 	The beds are to die for.....	I stayed here overnight with a bunch of girlfriends and we all enjoyed it very much. The rooms were beautifully decorated and the beds were VERY comfortable. The service was excellent, the drinks at the bar were awesome and breakfast at Triomphe restaurant is delish!	
Feb 18 2009 	The beds!	Where to begin, The place is beautiful.. When we walked in there were honey covered blueberries and they were fabulous. The beds are the most comfortable beds, I ever slept in..The service were very friendly and not stuck up, as I thought manhattan would be..overall the people went out of there way to make us feel at home..	
Feb 16 2009 	Loved the Iroquois	&quot;A Little Bit of Heaven in New York City&quot;We spent a weekend in hectic New York City around the Christmas holidays and had a wonderful experience I would like to share with everyone. We started out expecting to run into some problems, my husband and I and my daughter and her husband - from the time I booked the Iroquois everything went very smooth and very professional. When we got there I asked if perhaps we could get an upgrade and GUESS WHAT! they had a suite open and offered it to us at a minimal cost and we took it -WHAT A JOY!Beautiful, clean and everthing we needed at our fingertips - the staff was very professional, offering us our privacy but taking care of all our needs. I loved it. The lounge and the restaurant are superb. I can't tell you the feeling of being in a hectic, busy city and feeling like you are at a bed and breakfast in the country. Quiet and cozy. The beds are especially comfy. I highly recommend the suite for comfort and room. I can't wait to go to the Iroquois again.	
Feb 13 2009	A Luxury Oasis near Times Square	We live in NYC and still chose to get out of our own apartment to the Iroquois hotel for a weekend. A getaway in our own city!Greeted by by the lovely, spic-n-span lobby, on an unexpectedly posh block just outside Times Square - I was surprised by the feeling of being in a little auberge with superior service.The linens, bath products, attention to detail, spotless rooms and anything-but-generic decor made me feel like I was in a high-end London boutique hotel - and yet it is steps from the most exciting tourist spot in the world.Great. Ask for the lovely suites.	
Feb 9 2009 	No room service on Sundays!	The hotel room was very clean. A little small since I expected a bigger room since I reserved an Executive King. I guess I'm comparing to the room that I had at another hotel on West 51st between 6th/7th Aves that I stayed at 2 weeks before. I don't think the thermostat in my room was working. I had to turn it down so I will not suffocate or have a heat stroke! It's too hot! It's strange to have the alarm clock situated across the bed next to the flat panel TV. Totally weird! When I called the Front Desk to have it moved next to my bed, she offered to give me a wake-up call instead which is unacceptable because I like snoozing my alarm. So I insisted on having someone move it (wires were all tangled behind the cabinet). My flight arrived at around 8pm on a Sunday night. Checked-in &amp; called for room service to find out that they don't have room service on Sunday evenings. I could pay for a service but I decided to brave the cold, windy night &amp; walk to nearby DB Bistro Moderne to have a decent meal. All these are minor but after a long flight, these things become an irritant &amp; inconveniece. Things settled down the next 2 days. The Front Desk staff needs some improvement. Sometimes it feels like they just want to answer 1 question. The Front Desk staff at the West 51st St hotel knew my name on my 2nd day. Those are nice little touches. I must say that the bed was comfortable &amp; the bathroom amenities were excellent. I'm glad that I paid what is considered an average rate for NY standard when I booked this hotel. For the price that I paid, I can recommend this hotel to friends. But nothing more. Thanks hotel.com!	
Feb 8 2009	Loved It!!!	We just returned home from a 4 day getaway to New York. This was our first time in New York and we booked a room at the Iroquois hotel not knowing anything about the location or the hotel. We arrived early and figured we would need to store our luggage until check in time, but we were very happy and surprised when we were told our room was available. Our room was clean, comfortable, especially the bed, and a fabulous location. I have to say that the concierge Marga was wonderfully helpful. I feel that i am a very particular traveler and the Iroquois Hotel satisfied all of my needs. We will definitely return.	
Feb 7 2009 	The complementary apple cider is to-die-for!	We have just returned from a short spell in New York, and I picked the Iroquois Hotel, 49 West 44th St, New York City because it's so central and convenient for mid-town Manhattan. This is a real gem of a hotel - it's small, personal and intimate and I could not rate the friendly service more highly. If you want a personal friendly service and the best breakfast in town (try the hot 'French toast' filled with fluffy cream cheese and served with syrup and fresh strawberries..... absolutely delectable!), then this is the hotel for you. The interior of the lobby is stylish and intimate, and our bedroom with its two deliciously soft and downy double beds and the Molton Brown goodies in the bathroom was comfort itself. A nice personal touch was the little cards left in our room every evening with details of what the weather would be like the next day: very useful if you want to avoid taking the Circle Line harbour tour in driving snow! And the complementary hot, cinnamon-scented 'apple cider' on tap in the lobby when you come in from the cold was a real treat too - we took full advantage of this and enjoyed a chat with the lobby staff over the counter at the same time. They couldn't have been more helpful - they booked our concert at the Carnegie for us, then and there, sorted out our Circle Line and theatre tickets (the '39 Steps' at the Helen Hayes is a joy!), explained the subway system to us, and always remembered to ask how we'd got on the night before with all our ventures. I'd give the Iroquois 10/10. We just loved it!	
Feb 5 2009 	Its All About The Details	Disappointing three-night stay at a historic, popular, and well-rated hotel I selected to get away from a bustling conference location a short walk uptown. The Iroquois is quite pretty and in an excellent location. The staff was pleasant. Yet, for me, its all about the details and no one seems to be setting best practices or minding that existing protocols are followed.Upon arrival, which unfortunately coincided with the beginning of Superbowl XLIII, I dragged my roller bag up the four steep steps as no doorman was in sight. Naturally, he turned up as I finished my check-in and offered to help me take my bag upstairs in the elevator. I pointed out the irony and he declared that he was the only one on duty that night.The bedroom looked comfortable, although short on power outlets; but my first observation of the bathroom revealed both hair and stains on the sink  yuck. Attempted to call down to the front desk to request the wifi code and the handset of the cordless phone didnt work. In the morning, I experienced a clogged tub drain as water pooled to about 3 inches while I showered and I then found that the light on the make-up mirror (a nice touch) was burned out. I reported all but the soiled sink (which I wiped down myself). The phone and tub were fixed by the next day, but not the make-up mirror. On the second morning, a random extra box of hand soap was left atop the minibar, where it remained despite at least a couple more housekeeping visits. Curiously too, housekeeping seemed compelled to turn one set of blinds up and one set down when closing them at the end of each day. And the decorative bolster pillow, which during the day rested atop the bed pillows, was placed on the floor during turndown  again, yuck.One last note, which is meant only to be factual and not critical: If you need to be able to personally control your HVAC, this is not the place for you. The system is set to heat during the cold months and despite setting the thermostat to 68 degrees, the room temp nonetheless hovered at around 73, a little to warm to be under a down comforter on even most winter nights. Windows of my 11th floor room of course were bolted shut according to fire code requirements. I may have been the only one in the city to appreciate the snow and temperature drop!	
Feb 3 2009 	Mixed feelings	Stayed at the Iroquois for 4 nights on a sightseeing / shopping trip to New York. First impressions were great - very efficient check in, nice staff, well finished room, lovely comfy beds, bath robes and Molton Brown toiletries. We spent our first night on the 11th floor but had problems with a broken thermostat (which left the room severely over heated) and noise from some sort of fan or vent outside our window (imagine an extractor fan full on over your head all day and night!). We were moved to the 4th floor the following morning with minimal fuss, which solved the temperature problem but unfortunately, not the noise. Everthing else about the hotel was perfect, including the location (on a relatively quiet street but just a short walk from Times Square) and the staff were really nice, but unfortunately everthing was overshadowed by the noise. Could only recommend if you could be guaranteed a room in a different part of the hotel.	
Jan 30 2009 	Love the Iroquois!	Since lot of year I'm staying at the Iroquois, as my buisness trip rest place...You fell at your own home and it's just as small to have intimity and as big to have all the comodities.For me the best! For me the best place to stay, breakfast is perfect! and as a single traveler I feel safe here!	
Jan 28 2009 	Location is its biggest asset	We love the location of this hotel and have stayed in several others in the same vicinity. If you are going to Broadway shows this is the perfect place to be because it's very close by but not in the Times Square hustle bustle.The hotel itself has a pleasant, clubby feel and is much more traditional in decor than most of the other similar type NYC hotels I've seen. The lobby is fairly small and there's a separate room off it called the library where there's some seating and a computer guests may use free of charge. There is also an adjacent bar and restaurant. We did not eat in the restaurant but did have drinks in the bar a couple of times and it was fine.We got a very good rate($180) through one of the booking sites so we were fairly happy with the place. If I'd been paying $300 or more per night we might have been a little disappointed. Our room was on the back side of the building and was very quiet. We were not far from one of the elevators but I was never bothered by noise. Our room was pretty tiny which is certainly not unusual in NYC. It did have a &quot;real&quot; closet which was a plus. The room consisted of a small desk and chair, a bed, a mini-bar and a small chest of drawers. The bed was comfortable and the bed linens were very nice. The bathroom was small but not uncomfortable. The toiletries were Moulton and Brown which are good. We were there for 4 nights but I had very little contact with the staff so I can't really give an opinion on service. There was usually a doorman there to open one of the doors and one of them helped us with our luggage and getting a cab upon departure. The front desk people were fine at check-in and check-out.Would I stay there again? Certainly if the rate was good.	
Jan 24 2009 	Nice hotel if you are getting a great rate	We got a rate of under $200 for this hotel. So based on that price I would give it 3 stars. If I had paid more I would have been unhappy. The hotel is in a good location. It is safe. The rooms are small but it's New York City.The negatives- The rooms are insanely dark! Which makes getting ready for two people quite a challenge b/c you are restricted to the bathroom mirror. So the other person cannot be in the bathroom at the same time. The concierge seems to be bothered when asked questions and usually wrong with the best way to get to places and incorrect subway stops. They are very slow with responding to requests. We waited 40 minutes for a roll of toilet paper. The bed is positioned about 18 inches from the hallway wall and it runs along the wall so you feel is if you are sleeping in the hallway when people are walking/talking thru the hall. It is really annoying. Don't take the hummer that is parked outside of the hotel (he is not affiliated with the hotel) he is 3x the rate of a taxi. Plus if you did take him once he will hound you the rest of the trip and he seriousily is parked outside the hotel all day and all night trying to get money (which he has to make a living but it is very irritating)The hotel is in a great location and it is clean and comfortable for under $200 or even $300 I would maybe be ok with it. Anymore than that and I feel you would be very disappointed.	
Jan 22 2009 	Horribly Small Rooms	I stayed at the Hotel in December because a good friend of mine recommended it let me tell you after that stay I'm going to have to rethink my friendship. The hotel looks fairly nice and so do the rooms until you have to spend a few days in there and then you realize its like taking a vacation in your walk-in closet. Look people I know its NY and space is limited but there are many many more hotels at this price range with more space. The staff was very nice except a guy at the front desk I believe his name was Antonio he seemed very condescending and fake (this is the way I could describe his manner) not the kind of service I'd expect from this kind of hotel. Also they do not offer 24hr room service as advertised I called down for food and they told me it would take 45 minutes I asked why so long and they told me they had to order it from a diner and it gets delivered to the front desk. When I finally received my food it wasn't it warm never mind hot and it was horrible food not what I would expect from a &quot;4 star&quot; hotel but they still charged me like it was even though I could have just as well ordered it myself and saved money. The only thing good about this place was the bellmen (who were very friendly every time I went in and out and really had personality they didn't seem to be putting on an act) and the hot cider in the lobby otherwise avoid this place!!!!!!!!!!	
Jan 17 2009 	Great NY hotel	Stayed for four nights at this small hotel. Great room, excellent decor and amenities. Good staff and great level of cleanliness. Most comfortable beds ever!! Amazing position just a short walk away from a lot of the main sites, including times square, shopping on 5th avenue, rockerfella centre etc. Brilliant diner called the red flame a few doors down, best place for breakfast or a quick snack. Excellent value for money, everything you could possibly need in a bustling city. A little bit of luxury to retreat from the madness! Would definately stay there again!	
Jan 14 2009 	Best hotel in NYC!!!	The Iroquois Hotel is perfectly located near Times Square. The staff are extremely attentive and are willing to go the extra mile with any of your needs. The time I spent here with my family was by far the best we have had in all of our trips to the city. It has us already wanting to come back. I will not stay any place else in NYC. Everything is at your fingertips when you stay at this hotel, shopping, great food and nightlife.	
Jan 1 2009 	Average Stay at the Iroquois	My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for 7 days over Christmas as a treat for my 40th Birthday. Having read the reviews I was slightly disappointed with the hotel and didn't really think it was great value for money or give the personal service it professes to offer. The staff were all fairly helpful and I found the doormen and the porters all very friendly, however the reception staff were polite at best and not as warm as I would have expected at a hotel of this size.Our room was nice and well decorated, but small for the price we paid and the bathroom was extremely small. The bath was not full size and I tried it only once and found it extremely uncomfortable.The bed however was huge (although we had paid an upgrade for this) and probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in! I also liked the iPod dock and the large TV.	
Dec 29 2008 	Comfortable and great location	We booked this hotel after finding a great deal online and reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. We stayed here for a few days over Christmas and were very pleased with our experience. We'd definitely stay here again if the chance came up and they were offering reduced rates.Good points:Fantastic location - hotel seemed right in the middle of key points of interest without being on a busy street. Close to restaurants, diners (we had breakfast at the Red Flame every morning), shops, and tourist attractions.Friendly staff - no attitude or pretentiousness, very friendly and helpful doormen and front desk workers.Clean and comfortable - the room and bathroom were spotless, sheets and towels clean and fluffy, no dust, no hair, a place I could walk barefoot in.Quiet - even though we were on the back part of the hotel, we occasionally heard honking and the sound of trucks being unloaded, but that was to be expected. We were pleasantly surprised and relieved that we never once heard a neighbour above or next to us. The front doors weren't soundproof, but at least the ceilings and walls were (or maybe we didn't even have any neighbours!)Technology - The TV, iPod docking station and DVD players were top-notch, and the wake-up call system was automated and reliable.Not so good points (nit-picky):Temperature/ Responsiveness - We had a heating issue the first night and it took a few phone calls and face-to-face reminders for somebody to actually come up and take a look. Once it was resolved though, we forgot it ever happened.Lack of washroom storage - As a woman, I need space in the washroom to lay my things out. While they had a few small glass shelves in the washroom, there was hardly enough room to lay out my hair straightener and make-up in the same place. It felt a bit like a juggling act.Running toilet - The toilet ran loudly for like 20 seconds after it was flushed. No midnight trips to the washroom if you have a light sleeper.Cold bathroom floor - Without a fluffy bath mat in the washroom, the marble floors were absolutely freezing. Not a big deal, but I had to either put on my socks, hop around or slide around on the floor towel every time I needed to go in.Overall we had a great time, and the Iroquois provided a wonderful place for us to come back each night to relax and rest up our tired legs and feet.	
Dec 12 2008 	Nice place Bill was great	I booked this trip last minute, I was greeted by Bill who was great! He was the start of a great trip. Bill greated us with a smile and also assisted my wife and made sure she was comfortable. After being in traffic for two hours, he really made us relax.This hotel was very quiet and comfortable. The rooms were clean and the staff helpful and pleasant.I will go back.Short and to the point, all around good place	
Dec 3 2008 	Amazing Impressive and Intimate with a FAB location!	My friends and I got together in the city for a wonderful weekend and the Iroquois helped to make it so special. The rooms were beautiful, clean and quiet. The staff was extremely attentive and willing to help us with ANYTHING we needed!! The treatment we received was wonderful. The food was WELL above average--TOP NOTCH!! We actually had wished we stayed there for dinner!! We had a BLAST at the bar--visiting and being treated like we were their only guests! I truly have to say that my experience at this hotel was a 10 all the way!! When I go back this will be the first and only place I will call. It is our new tradition...Can't wait to go back!!Many thanks to Scott and Alex!!!	
Dec 3 2008 	Home Away from Home	I am pleased to say that the Iroquois hotel is a wonderful place to stay. I have stayed in several Manhattan hotels and this small but luxury hotel has them beat! The staff was friendly and helpful from the moment we entered. The rooms were exceptionally clean and roomy. The king size bed was a little piece of heaven. The Frette linens made the bed one I wanted to take home with me! There was not a detail missed from the new flat screen televisions to the sparkling water in the refrigerator.Even the hotel bar and room service were exceptional. We had appetizers and drinks at the bar and Kasey the bartender was very attentive. He made suggestions and was right on! We also enjoyed breakfast in our room the following morning. The food was fabulous; they brought bacon and eggs to a new level. The GM Scott Geres cares about the guests at this hotel and definitely trains his staff to be the best. I highly recommend this hotel as a home away from home!	
Nov 24 2008 	Gold Guest addicted what Iroquois Offers!!! First Class NYC Experience!	The first time we stayed at this hotel was the December after 9/11. They have changed quite a bit since then, but even then the hotel was lovely. I love the quaint rooms, friendly service and wonderful extras. My favorite part of the room is thebathroom... SO much Luxury!!!! We go to NYC every year and last year couldn't stay here :*( Even though the other hotel was good, the Tudor... We like the location, luxury feeling and European feel of this hotel much more. It was wonderful to visit NYC in our favorite hotel :)	
Nov 23 2008 	Luxury in the City!	My college girlfriends and I planned to meet in the city for a little reunion and a lot of fun. The Iroquois was responsible for most of the fun. First of all, the staff was so unbelievably friendly and accommodating, from the bellmen, to the receptionists, to the bartender to housekeeping, everyone helped make our stay so wonderful, we felt like a group of queens from the moment we walked in the door, until we left the next day. The rooms were immaculate, the mattresses were like sleeping on clouds and the Frette sheets and bathrobes and Molten Brown bath products were a perfect touch.We had the most delicious drinks and appetizers at the bar before heading off to dinner. The pan seared scallops with porcini mushroom and foie gras butter was TO DIE FOR! The bartender even came over to our table and re-shook my martini when I was just halfway through - talk about attentive!!! We all had such a great time and felt so welcomed, instead of going out after dinner, we returned to the Iroquios bar to finish off the night, where we were able to enjoy each other's company as well as the service of first-class boutique hotel. I've traveled a great deal and stayed in many hotels and this one certainly stands out among the rest. It's a small hotel, but they skimp on nothing! Thanks for a truly fabulous weekend Iroquois, we'll be back!!!	
Nov 20 2008 	Top Shelf at The Iroquois	I have stayed at many large chain luxury hotels (Ritz Carlton, Four Season, Fairmont), none of which have the charm and personal touch that we experienced at The Iroquois. When we checked in the bellman went above and beyond, helping my family. The hotel GM, Scott Geres, was in the lobby and introduced himself and provided his contact information should we need anything. Our suite was OUTSTANDING! Top notch flat screen TV's in bedroom and living room. Very clean, comfortable furniture, bedding, and larger than any hotel suite I have stayed in, with bottle of wine and chocolates welcoming us. The concierge was also very helpful providing us with maps, reservations, and directions. The location could not be better. We walked to all of our desired destinations (shopping on 5th Ave, Rockefeller Center, Broadway shows, Times Square). When we left the hotel to go see a show on broadway the staff not only provided turn down service but set up the sofa sleeper, which was a very pleasant surprise after returning. If you are looking for a small luxury hotel in THE BEST location with better service and more charm than the above mentioned industry giants, book a room here!	
Nov 15 2008 	Much better hotels in NYC - pick another one please	The staff were not very helpful, the room was very small (no fridge for the mini bar), the bed was small (my feet hung off the end), and thin walls.The finishings are nice enough but there are plenty of hotels in the NYC that are much better than this one - so I would suggest people pick another one. Why risk it when there are better around?	
Nov 13 2008 	Magical weekend stay!	It was time to leave the spouses behind and we girls decided to stay at The Iroquois, as it was exceptionally priced at one of the travel websites and a very convenient base to see the main sights. My girlfriend's first extended visit to New York City and The Iroquois made it memorable. Many thanks to Alex, who graciously upgraded our Classic Room to an Executive Suite! We stayed one night in the Classic and it was quite adequate-- clean, a good size for a NYC hotel room. Comfortable bed, fluffy towels and bathrobes and quiet. I didn't hear any noise in the hallway or from other rooms. The Suite was heavenly with a spacious living room, sofa set, desk, flat screen TV, BOSE mp3 player, complimentary half bottle of wine and sparkling water. Once again, exceptionally clean surroundings with that incredibly comfortable bed, flat screen TVr; marble bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub. Turndown service was consistent with chocolates and weather card. There's a wonderful complimentary shoe shine service and that person does a great job!! We did attempt to order room service one morning and our card was not picked up; the next morning, however, breakfast was delivered promptly. Reasonable price for that breakfast, too. The entire staff is professional and pleasant. There's coffee available in the main lobby in the mornings and I could honestly say, that renovation of that lobby is finished (to give an update based on other travelers' info). This is not a large hotel (which I love) and I was extremely pleased with our stay. I recommend it highly.	
Nov 8 2008 	This is not a positive experience would not recommend	This is a real time review of this hotel. The day started relatively promising. I arrived on a redeye flight at 6am at the hotel, and the night receptionist was extremely friendly, saying that although there were no rooms available, he would expedite my request. Unfortunately, he was the only friendly staff member at the front desk and the experience has become increasingly frustrating from that point forward.The night receptionist handed my request to the daytime receptionist, and that's where any form of concerned customer service stopped. Now there is no sense of urgency, and the receptionists basically are telling me that I just have to wait until someone checks out. No one seems to want to resolve this issue, so here I am left posting a negative review.This is a disaster. I usually trust the TripAdvisor ratings and book all my hotels based on reviews posted on this site. This is not the case for this hotel and appears to be an abberation of it's #15 ranking in the New York City area.	
Oct 31 2008 	Fantastic stay (again)	This was the 2nd time we have stayed at the Iroquois..in fact, for this visit we didn't even consider staying elsewhere. The location was perfect for all the places we wanted to see.I had requested a quiet, non smoking room and we were allocated room 808 at the side or back of the hotel (not sure what but it wasn't overlooking the street). It was perfect as the room was quiet, except for the faint hum of the air conditioning units but that didn't bother us. We couldn't hear the usual traffic noise and only hear the occasional siren. If you are a very light sleeper I would recommend ear plugs.The room was spotlessly clean, with plentiful towels and toiletries. Bathrobes and a hairdryer were provided. Our room had 2 x double beds (classic) and they were so comfortable!. The staff we encountered were polite and helpful. We didn't use the concierge but we did use the bell hop services to store our bags on the last day.The renovation work was not apparent immediately e.g there was no workmen or noise in the lobby. On closer inspection I could see that there were some finishing touches to be completed but nothing obvious.The only service we used at the hotel was the useful internet connection in the library area off the lobby. We found other guests to be courteous and would not keep us waiting if we needed to use the computer.We used the popular Red Flame diner, a 2 minute walk from the hotel, for breakfast. The choice was huge and the breakfasts hot and filling. It opens at 6am, useful if you are awake early from jet lag!I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I am lucky enough to return to New York.	
Oct 24 2008 	Amazing Stay at The Iroquois	My sister and I just visited NYC for the first time. After careful research, we chose The Iroquois. I can't say enough nice things! The staff is top notch (we especially adored Marga the concierge and Bill the bell hop), the rooms are lovely, and you can't beat the location (2 blocks from Times Square and 1 block from 5th Avenue)! We also had free internet access and there was a great little diner two doors down where we could grab breakfast. I recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to the city. Thank you Iroquois for making our trip so memorable! Can't wait to visit again!	
Oct 24 2008 	Expensive but quite good	I would agree with that, although good, the Iroquois was not quite as good as I had expected, particularly for the price paid. The lobby is still under major renovations, and again this was not mentioned when I booked or apologised for. Service from front desk was efficient but not very warm, I was reluctant to go back for further information as it felt like you were bothering them at times. Given this is a Small Luxury Hotel, I would have expected more. The room and bathroom were small-ish, but fine, certainly by European standards. I very much liked the decor and fittings, and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had an 8th floor room with absolutly no view (a brick wall) and very noisy generators outside. We're not particularly bothered by noise, but this was quite noticeable.Given that the stay cost approx £250 per night per room (and of course there's no breakfast included in that) this was an expensive hotel, and I certainly wouldn't call it value for money, but I'm not sure that that isn't typical of most NYC hotels.	
Oct 23 2008 	Not my hotel	I have just been staying at the Iroquois. Just when I entered the sweet smell hit me which i am always associating with a cheap cleaning product (which it probably was) and I thought I was in the wrong hotell! The lobby although apparently just extensively renovated (what I read on tripadvisor) is dull and not welcoming.The rooms were pleasantely nice in comparison, some small but ok. What i really did not like was the service. it was just the bare minimum. I always had the feeling that they were happy when I did not ask them too much. On Sundays the restaurant was closed and there was only a very small menu with Hamburgers etc. For these kind of prices i don't think this is acceptable. In the whole i did not like the atmosphere of the hotel at all and will certainly not stay there again	
Oct 21 2008 	Positive experience	Just returned from a week's stay interrupted for two nights [went to woodstock] . Avoid the 11th fkoor inward rooms [not the ones on 44th st] as the noise of the outside compressors pours into and engulfs the room, especially at night time. We informed the staff about this. We hope the hotel manages to remedy this inconvenience.On returning we were upgraded to a suite which was what a suite should be; tastefully furnished and decorated, spacious and peaceful. What a contrast!The piece de resistance however are the staff. They were helpful, courteous, attentive and professional.Overall. if midtown is your destination the hotel is highly recommeded.	
Oct 1 2008 	Weekend in NYC	Our stay was highlighted by an extremely courteous staff, particularly the front desk and doormen, who assisted with our luggage. (My family does not travel light as we arrived with a large double jogging stroller, bicycle and many pieces of baggage). The amenities were fabulous as the room we stayed in featured a large flat screen television and IPOD dock/alarm clock. The staff made my 3 year feel like she was a princess in her own castle. I highly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting NY on business or pleasure.	
Oct 1 2008 	Did not live up to expectations	Had read reviews on the Iroquois on this website but unfortunately was not as good as I had expected. Arrived to find that the lobby was under major renovations. This was not mentioned when I was doing research but after my trip, I went and checked the site and there were quite a few mentions of it. Service from concierge/front desk was efficient but not the most effusive with more information. Given this is a Small Luxury Hotel, I would have expected more. Fortunately I did not have to use their 1 computer laptop to access internet as it was often used and had a line. The room and bathroom was much tinier than I expected. Possibly this is standard NY sizing but given this price, I expected a bit more. They possibly try to make up with it with Frette sheets and nice toiletries. Think it works for women but not sure the men would appreciate it. Having said that, it's a good location and New York is so much more about the city rather than the hotel room one is in.	
Sep 29 2008 	Loved the Iroquois	After reading many travel books and internet sites on where to stay in New York, we chose the Iroquois --it was the perfect choice. Located just a few blocks from Times Square, the theatre district, great restaurants, 5th Avenue, and Madison Avenue, we were able to walk to nearly all points of interest. The staff was very gracious and friendly and the Chief Concierge helped us navigate around the city with ease. We definitely recommend this hotel.	
Sep 25 2008 	A perfect spot	Our summer stay at the Iroquois was terrific. From early check in (the valet stored our bags for the day), to the lovely room and amenities, we were won over our first day in New York. Sure, the room was small, but we weren't there to stay in - we were exploring and shopping the city. The Iroquois was perfectly located. We could walk almost everywhere, or the doorman was always willing to jump out and hail us a cab for longer trips. There was work going on in the lobby, but it never affected us. The staff actually kept apologizing for it, but you can't improve without renovation. The staff were friendly and helpful at all hours. Our room was spotlessly clean and perfect for our needs. We felt safe and secure, a plus in any large city and away from home.We will definitely return to the Iroquois on our next visit.	
Sep 21 2008 	Nice hotel	Iroquois Hotel is about 3 blocks from Times Square. The rooms are not huge, but just fine. Its clean and well maintained. Staff is very nice and accommodating.	
Sep 14 2008 	A small but very good hotel	This is a really good hotel based two blocks from Times Square. My room was a &quot;superior room&quot; which included complimentary NYC times, shoeshine and turndown service. The main difference to a standard room seems to be the minibar. In my room it was a very stocked fridge, in a standard room, no fridge and minibottles just placed on a table.Wireless phones, flatscreen TV, free WIFI internet and a good selection of spa products in the bathroom. The bed was a kingsize and extremely comfortable. You should be aware that rooms are far from silent, the a/c units outside makes a permanent noise which can be considered loud. I don't mind &quot;white noise&quot;, actually I sleep better with it, but some in our party had a rough time adjusting to this.	
Sep 4 2008 	Great location but needs to improve	We arrived at the hotel off the back of a 7 night stay in a Vegas suite and to say the constrast was a shock to the system would be an understatement. When we arrived we were greeted by a reception area that was in the middle of being refurbished (the hotel conveniently managed to omit this during any booking conversation). First impressions count and needless to say this did not help one bit. The check-in was smooth and the staff friendly and our next experience was the antique elevators, very slow, very dated and very tired. Then the room, whilst it was tidy and clean the decor was also tired but the overwhelming lasting impression is the size, or lack of as the case may be. The bed dominates the room with just enough space to walk around and there was certainly not enough cupboard space to accomodate my wife and my self never mind store any bags/cases out of the way. Now I do not claim to be an experienced New York visitor and I was aware that hotel rooms in midtown Manhattan are small but was not prepared for just how small. We had a room on the front of the hotel overlooking 44th streat which was a bonus as I think that if we had been given a room at the back facing a brick wall or AC unit I would have turned around and walked out. The bathroom was reasonably well appointed with everything that you would expect. The room was furnished with most of the conveniences that you would expect from a deluxe/superior room; safe, iron/board, mini-bar, wifi internet access, wide screen TV etc but did not have any tea/coffee making facilities!? The room was serviced well with no complaints on that front . The hotel has a bar/restaurant called Triomphe attached and whilst the bar was small and friendly the food wasn't great by NY standards.Overall the biggest positive that this hotel has is the location. It's situated on West 44th between 5th and 6th Avenues and is a stones throw from some of the main NY attractions. However the hotel advertises itself as a boutique hotel with the obvious French theme and states 4 star rating and an entry on the Small Luxury Hotels of the world. At one point in time this may have been the case but unfortunately not now. The decor was old and tired and the boutique theme lost somewhere in translation. It tries hard with Molten Brown products in the bathroom and decent towels and linen but doesn't really come up to scratch I'm afraid. Certainly not for the prices they are charging.I don't have any major complaints about the hotel but there is definately better value for money even on the same street as the hotel is located directly next to the Sofitel and straight across the road from the Royalton which both looked more spacious and better appointed.Whilst we enjoyed our time in NY it's unlikely that we'll stay here in future.	
Sep 3 2008 	Top Notch!	On arrival at the hotel we were a little concerned as we saw work going on in the lobby but this turned out to be refurbishment (quiet) and not at all a hindrance. The staff were very friendly and the hotel boosted a real customer focus feel.The room was excellent. There was a large flat screen tv, Molten Brown products in the bathroom, chocolates on the pillow and the bed was very comfy.The room and bathroom was very clean with an excellent shower. The only thing I would say was that the they were both a wee bit small but this was overlooked at the level of service we recieved. Complimentary newspapers followed each morning.The location was superb, 5-10 mins walking distance from Times Square and the Subway. It would have been nice to have more than 1 PC in the library as there were times we needed to check things and the PC was being used but the concierge did a fantastic job of filling in the gaps.Room service was always prompt, however be careful when asking for laundary to be done as they stapled into our tops twice. On the whole, we will certainly be going back to stay at this hotel next time we are in NY as it was an extremely comfortable and pleasant experience. However, when you book a cab from the hotel, always go with the Yellow Cabs because the unmarked taxis charge 40% more at times and some of them are not licensed and insured to carry people. Do not let the door people talk you into using them. A great great stay!!!!	
Sep 3 2008 	It was OK...would not stay there again.	We stayed at the Iroquois from Aug.29-Sept.2/08. I was dissapointed when we arrived as I had a different impression of the hotel from the website. The hotel was OK....but nothing special. I had read some reviews about the lobby being under construction months ago...well, the lobby was still under construction when we arrived. The hotel just seemed runned down...very very small and the hallways and rooms needed upgrading. For example, the carpets looked dingy and old and there were large gaps between the doors so light go was beeming through the front door. I was just overall dissapointed considering we also had a deluxe room. The hotel was ok and I am sure most people would have found it ok, but I was expecting more. I think there are better hotels for the same price.	
Sep 2 2008 	Nice Central NYC Hotel	My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for our anniversary. It is located very close to Broadway, the theaters, and the subway line. The staff was friendly and helpful. We got several good suggestions for cheap drinks at local watering holes. The rooms are a comfortable size for New York City. The complimentary water was nice. There was supposed to be robes for use during the stay. Unfortunately there was only one robe for two guests and the robe we were given had someone else's hair inside it. The rest of the room appeared clean and well maintained. The sheets were clean and a good quality. The temperature was not really controllable. There is some sort of central air system which limits control of the air conditioning. The room was a bit overly warm during our stay. We were supposed to have a slightly upgraded room from the normal king room. I cannot say I saw anything upgraded about the room we got. In fact we had an undesirable view of an alley and fire escape out of the window. We were able to get a reasonable price for a good hotel at a great location for exploring NYC. The hot coffee in the morning and iced tea in the afternoon in the lobby were a great bonus.	
Sep 1 2008 	Positive Reviews were Right On	Just returned from our weekend trip to NY, couldn't have been more pleased with our accomadations. We were lucky and got upgraded (are there sweeter words when you are checking in?) to a King Executive, so did not find the room small. Beautifully appointed, clean and so comfortable after hours in the city. The staff was attentive and pleasant, whatever requests we made were answered it seemed as we put the phone down. Did not eat dinner in the hotel, though had a drink at the bar before going out. Breakfast was sumptious. Lobby is under renovation, no problems. Will go back in a heartbeat.	
Sep 1 2008	Good hotel not great	My wife and I stayed at Iroquois for five nights in late August. We went on the recommendation of our travel agent who got us a good deal on this property. When we arrived in mid-afternoon we were somewhat surprised that there was no door person to greet us and help us with our luggage. When we did get inside the hotel, however, (the lobby is currently under construction), staff were helpful and check in was a breeze. As stated in previous reviews, the rooms are quite small. We had requested a Superior Room with king size bed, which we got. The bed took up easily 75% of the room. The washroom was big enough, with the usual amenities. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The chamber staff was very efficient. Rooms were always made by early afternoon. In the evening, the turndown service--complete with Belgian chocolate--was much appreciated. Location in the theatre district and close to Times Square was also great. While hotel staff was very helpful, the concierge desk was not always staffed. The hotel only has two rather small elevators, which are in great need of upgrade. At times in the morning, the wait for an elevator with space was often more than five minutes.Overall, the stay was pleasant. But at an average of about $375/night, I have a feeling there are other properties which would provide better value for our dollar	
Aug 28 2008 	Best Ever	Three friends and I stayed at the Iroquois while in New York for a delightful week end this summer. It could not have been a better experience. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They made us feel special and at ease from the beginning of our visit.We also found the restaurant superb. The location was a plus for us because we planned to see several broadway plays.	
Aug 26 2008	Excellent Hotel	We booked this trip last minute and chose the hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. We made a good choice - it's a great hotel. We had a twin room. Very clean and fairly spacious, with very comfortable beds. Bathroom was also very good.The location of this hotel is also great; close to all the major attractions, but in a fairly quiet street so there's not too much noise at night.We loved this hotel and would definitely return for another stay.	
Aug 20 2008 	Quiet and great location!	Just returned from our long weekend in NYC. We booked our trip through American Express Travel and decided on The Iroquois based on the reviews and ratings on TripAdvisor. The combo room and airfare rates were better than booking through any other source I found, though they do seem to change daily - so, plan ahead and book 4-5 weeks in advance for the best deals.This hotel was renovated in 2006 and is currently undergoing a update to the lobby area. It is conveniently located on 44th just a couple of blocks from everything in mid-town. Closest subway station is a short walk to Bryant Park. Very convenient for our trip to Yankee Stadium!Our 6th floor room was quiet (which is amazing for NYC) and somewhat small, but typical-sized for boutique hotels. The bath was very well appointed and bed very comfortable, too.The staff was friendly and very helpful on recommendations, directions, etc. Couldn't ask for more!Highly recommend The Iroquois for your next stay in Manhattan.	
Aug 19 2008	Sweet private quiet almost secret	Right upon arriving, I encountered the best thing possible: a free upgrade to a suite. Since I was travelling with just a friend, it could not have been more welcome. The place is sumptuous, the service is discreet, and for lovers of &quot;boutique&quot; hotels I can't imagine anything better. Of course the amenties are appropriate to this size of hotel, but overall they left nothing to be desired. If only I could be assured of an upgrade each time, I wouldn't stay anywhere else! But the prices will give pause to anyone who's paid in dollars.	
Aug 15 2008	My favorite hotel in NY	I cant say enough good things about the Iroquois! Its a small and quiet jewel, just blocks away from Times Square. Although the rooms are consistently clean, comfortable and well appointed, its the staff that makes the Iroquois feel like a home-away-from-home. The genuinely warm hospitality I receive every time I stay is rarely found elsewhereespecially in New York. I highly recommend this hotel.	
Aug 9 2008 	A Quiet Treasure	My young daughter and I stayed at the Iroquois for a trip to NYC and we were extremely pleased. The rooms were clean, the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly and the location was perfect. We were only a couple of blocks from Times Square yet the hotel was quiet and peaceful. They even left some goodies in our room for my daughter. We would definitely stay here again.	
Aug 5 2008 	Home away from home	We searched expedia for the perfect hotel while we were in New York. We looked at the reveiws and judged the Iroquois the hotel that meet our desires. We wanted a hotel close to times square yet within walking distance to as many places as possible. We liked the charm of a vintage hotel which protrayed the romance of early era. Our hopes were more than meet. The hotel is smaller, rooms are smaller than the newer Ritz but the charm and the hospitality are beyond compare. We stayed one night at the Ritz for the fireworks and were so glad to come home to the Iroquis the next day. We missed the personal touch, we missed our friends at the Iroquois. The staff had nothing of the forced friendlyness we have found at other hotels. The rooms were beautiful, the bed was a dream, this was the perfect place to come back to after a wonderful day of exploring New York City.Marga Snyder was spectacular as the concierge, she researched our desires for tickets and shows, booked events and gave us information and followed up on all bookings. She also gave us information of other events that we might be interested in. We greatly appreciate her effort, she added so much to our vacation.	
Aug 4 2008 	About What You Pay For But Not More	At about $400 for a Saturday night stay, my expectations were pretty high for the Iroquois. While it didnt disappoint, it didnt exceed either. I cant quibble with the location; it is in the Theater District without the cacophony of Times Square and provides easy walking to great restaurants and to Grand Central Terminal. The room was about as small as a luxurious queen-size bed would allow and yet there was plenty of closet space (?). The only common area is the library which the hotel describes as cozy  cramped might be another word one would use.	
Aug 1 2008 	An Excellent Hotel	Stayed six nights on business. The hotel is an oasis of calm in hustle and hassle of Manhatten. The staff is excellent. The rooms are clean and well kept. A good nights sleep every night.	
Aug 1 2008 	Great location and quiet hotel	As has been written before this is a great central location for a lot of the sights and Broadway. The highlights for me were the rooms which were comfortable, quiet and a reasonable size compared to some I have stayed in in NY as well as the check-in and concierge staff who couldn't have been more helpful.Another plus was confirmed rooms next to our children.The downside is that the hotel perhaps lacks a little soul as there is no real lobby area to have a drink and relax while waiting for the rest of the party or deciding what to do next. There is the small bar and restaurant but I usually prefer the lobby area for that 15 to 20 minute chill time. They were renovating the lobby so that might address this when completed - like the previous review the renovation whilst disappointing was not a major distraction.All in all a good hotel - not sure it lives up to a &quot;leading hotel&quot; tag but I would still consider it to stay as it ticked a lot of the boxes with clean, comfortable and quiet rooms and good service coupled with the location.	
Jul 29 2008 	Stylish Great location	My husband and I recently stayed here one night while in NYC. The hotel was well kept- clean, spacious room. It's considered a small luxury hotel. The staff were friendly, and offered ideas for restaurants. The location is great- walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building, etc. Cabs were very easy to get outside to go to other areas of the city. The only downside, and it didn't affect us at all, is they are currently renovating the lobby. I would stay here again and recommend this hotel to everyone.	
Jul 16 2008 	Fantastic Hotel Excellent Service	This hotel was the perfect way to end a round-world trip. The location is sensational, right in midtown. 5 minutes walk from Times Square, and Grand Central Station. Central Park is only 15 mins walk away. The staff here are so friendly, helpful and polite. Their welcome was gratefully received after a flight from London. Nothing was a problem for them. The room, while a little small, was beautiful. Flat screen TV, the largest minibar selection you could hope for...and the beds. I could rave about the beds here for hours.... like sleeping on a cloud. Soft, relaxing. Three pillows to each bed, with luxurious linens. The bathroom was clad in marble, and spacious. With a bathtub. The service to the room was fantastic, quick and friendly. A point to note though, our room wasnt cleaned/beds made by housekeeping on our second day, until 3pm. I found that unusual. Maybe its common in NYC. My only true criticism of the hotel would be the door to our room. It rattled whenever the lift opened, or whenever another guest opened their room door. This was room 1001. No Fridge, but Ice is provided on request, or during the turn down service. A fantastic hotel for a little luxury in New York, and the most incredible sleep. Where can I buy one of those beds!?	
Jul 16 2008 	Loved the Iroquois	The Iroquois is a beautiful small hotel situated within easy walking distance from Times Square, however far enough away to be more peaceful than Times Square. (2 blocks?) The rooms are clean and nicely appointed. Comfortable beds and pillows. The staff was helpful and friendly. I will definitely stay there again when I visit NYC.	
Jul 15 2008 	Fabulous Boutique Hotel	The Iroquois was a delight on all fronts -- newly redecorated rooms; extremely convenient to the theater district; charming, helpful staff; outstanding restaurant. Plus a cozy library for gathering, reading, and online research. It's two doors away from the historic Algonquin, with lots of good restaurants close by. We especially liked the flexible and friendly staff. Can hardly wait to return.	
Jul 9 2008 	Loved my stay at the Iroquois	Stayed at the Iroquois for one night, at an economical rate of $199 before taxes. Beautiful &amp; charming lobby, friendly &amp; professional service, nice bathrooms, luxury linens, towels and toiletries. Not much of a view, and the room was quite small, but the comfortable mattress and Frette sheets made up for it. The room was extremely quiet., so I had a good night's sleep. I used to live 4 blocks further east, and my apartment was never that quiet. Belgian chocolate on the pillow, complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning. My new favourite hotel in New York. Plus, I can let people know I stayed at the same hotel as James Dean. He lived there from 1950-53.	
Jul 8 2008 	WOW what a nice hotel!!	WOW is all I can say. We had such a great stay at this hotel. We booked an executive king and were upgraded to a large suite. The staff was very friendly. The hotel was small and quiet, what an escape from the big city. Our room was very clean and very large. This trip was so nice, I will ALWAYS book this hotel when I stay in the city. For the price, you can't beat the luxury and friendly service. We have stayed in very expensive hotels in the city and this one beats them all.	
Jul 8 2008 	Quite and Central.	The Iroquois is member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World and is shows in the rooms and the service. The people there were very accommodating and informative. Location wise it was a two minutes walk to Fifth Avenue and a 4 minutes to Times Square, what else do you need. The only time I used the subway was when I went to the statue of Liberty tour which was on the southern tip of Manhattan, otherwise all my tours was done on foot. The concierge were very helpful , they got us a good deal to the Lion King Musical.The room was on the small side but was immaculate and super clean as was the marble bath with is Molton Brown amenities. The beds were VERY comfortable, the room had an LG LCD with HD channels. With some built in closets. There is a turn down service where they prepare the bed and put a weather card for the next day with delicious chocolate, a nice touch.A thing Im really picky about hotels is quietness, sometime I wonder if I'm in NYC, the rooms were well soundproofed.Really deserve to be an SLH. A fine pick indeed.	
Jul 7 2008 	Wonderful Hotel in the ideal location	We stayed at the Iroquois in a deluxe room for seven nights in April. We had a nice bright room at the front of the building overlooking 44th street; it was adequate in size for two people but not overly spacious, (could have done with more hanging space) although the bathroom was quite large and supplied with Molten Brown toiletries. The rooms were kept very clean and the bed was so comfortable, with good quality bed linen. A nice touch was the chocolates and weather card for the next day being left every night along with the bed being turned down. We would recommend having the continental breakfast in the hotel it is a reasonable price and much better than the Red Flame Diner down the block. There is more than enough to eat, with a choice of cereals, fruits, salmon, cold meat, cheese, yoghurts, pastries and bagels. There is a computer with free access to the internet in a room to the left as you come into the hotel, although this broke down a couple of times the hotel were quick to get it fixed. We found the staff to be polite and extremely helpful. The hotel was really nice and in the ideal location, very central for Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue shopping, Central Park, Bryant Park a great place to people watch, Grand Central Station and the Public Library on 5th, which are two, must see buildings. There is a wonderful patisserie called Le Pain Quotidien on 40th street across from Bryant Park for sandwiches, cakes, coffee etc. Also worth a visit are Woodbury Common shopping outlet for lots of bargains, get the bus from the Grey Line bus station. Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island is another great day out; The Top of the Rock observation deck at the Rockefeller Centre has better views than the Empire State, get there for sunset.Restaurants we would recommend are Michael Jordans in Grand Central Station good food and the cheesecake is huge. Ben and Jacks Steakhouse on 219 E 44th St. Trattoria Trecolori Italian restaurant at 254 W 47th St, good food at affordable prices.We found the best way to get from Newark airport to Manhattan was by taxi, the cost was approx $60 and it was far quicker than the shuttle bus which we had used previously.	
Jun 23 2008 	Wonderful Experience!	We had a wonderful stay at The Iroquois. The accomodations, staff, and restaurant were all excellent. The highlight of The Iroquois is their Concierge, Marga. Her assistance both before our trip and during our trip couldn't have been more valuable. She made numerous reservations for us, followed up when clarification was needed, and then made excellent recommendations on sites to see (or not to see), restaurants, and Broadway shows. Not only is her knowledge of the city incredible, but she is an absolute joy to work with. The Iroquois is very fortunate to have her on their team.	
Jun 22 2008 	Central location - great staff would stay again	Stayed at the Iroquois for one night in June, 2008. The property is on a great centrally street - West 44th - Sofitel and Algonquin hotels are nearby. Close to Rockefeller Center and Times Square (without being too close), it is easy to walk, grab a cab or take the subway to anywhere you want to go. The rooms are a decent size by Manhattan standards with room to move around in the bathroom, decent closet and storage space, a nice working desk and LCD wall mounted TV. The in room alarm clock also has an I-Pod docking station which is a nice add on touch. The front desk, concierge and doorman were all very helpful, personable and pleasant to talk with. I would stay at this property again.	
Jun 21 2008 	Great Hotel Fabulous Location	I just returned from a two night stay at The Iroquois. It was terrific. I have stayed at several hotels in the mid-town area and I would rate The Iroquois at the top of the list. Wonderful staff, we received great restaurant information from the Concierge.	
Jun 20 2008 	Lucky find!	Made a last minute trip to NYC for a weekend, found the Iroquois Hotel via TripAdvisor- a great find. The staff was helpful, the room was spacious and comfortable. There was free computer access in a cozy library off the lobby, free NY Times for Sunday Morning and a nice big umbrella to borrow for the day when it started to rain. We could have eaten at the restaurant in the hotel, but instead went to a classic NY diner for a very reasonable Sunday breakfast right next door. Will definitely come again	
Jun 20 2008 	My Secret Hotel in New York	Seems like not too many people know about this jewel in mid-town. Great service, super luxe accomodations and the most rockin concierge in the City. Marga Snyder, Chief Concierge has the ability to just make things happen. I feel like its my private residence in New York and stay there almost every time (when I have the choice). I have stayed at virtually every top hotel in New York and this one is my favorite.	
Jun 17 2008 	Best place in town!!	When visited in NY last April 2008, we ( husband &amp; 13 year old)had a G R E A T !! time at the Iroquois NY.The hotel offers the 3 basic needs for the avarage traveler:LOCATION - near time squareROOM - comfortable with all Necessary needs &amp; more..STAFF - Efficient polite &amp; very helpful with any request at any timeAll these theree parameters, when being preformed on the best possible way - will provide you with the best ever vacation in NY.Would definitely come back..	
Jun 12 2008 	Great Hotel	The Iroquois is a great hotel. We stayed at the Iroquois for seven nights. It is located in a central area between Bryant Park and Times Square. Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue, Grand Central Station and Broadway plays are all within walking distance. The staff at the Iroquois is friendly and helpful with sights and directions. We did have difficulty with the wireless internet connection. One minute it would work and the next there was nothing. We were moved to another floor (upgraded room w/no extra charge) in order to access the internet and it didn't work there either. The hotel is old but updated and very clean and neat. There was no view from either room which was kind of disappointing but the hotel was wonderful anyway. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to enjoy NY in a central location.	
Jun 7 2008 	Great hotel ideal for Broadway	The hotel was ideal for what I wanted; a comfy, decent hotel near to Broadway.	
Jun 6 2008 	European style hotel in the heart of NYC	We stayed here over Memorial Day weekend and would definitely stay again. The location is central--close to subway lines, the train station and midtown addresses. Knowing the rooms were on the small side, we booked a king room, which looked into the courtyard through two windows. Everything was charming, staff were cheerful and helpful, and the bed was comfortable. Seemed like a unique hotel you would find off a street in Paris with the emphasis on quality and service.	
Jun 3 2008	The best hotel in Manhattan	I have been to The Iroquois Hotel before when visiting New York on business, so when my husband asked me to book a hotel for our weekend get away I decided to go there. And what a good decision it was: this hotel is charming, from the welcoming staff, to the check in, to the gorgeous rooms and the beautiful marbled bathrooms ( and have I mentioned bath robes) to the chocolate on the pillows at night, and of course the bottled mineral water (complimentary ) on the table! The room is clean, quiet and spacious, and the beds and linens are great, even at home we don't sleep so comfortable.And since it was rainy that day, an umblrella was waiting for us when we went for a walk. The hotel is very well located, close to Broadway and also to 5th Avenue, and it was easy to just walk everywhere. There are also some great restaurants in the neiburhood.Even the town car the hotel booked for us to return to the airport was a pleasant experience.We are hoping to return to this hotel and we are very happy to recommend it to everybody.Liliana and Imi Mann, Toronto	
Jun 3 2008 	Absolutely Fabulous	Wonderful. The staff was friendly. Our room service was prompt. Loved the bathroom. Very clean, elegant, and we loved the option of opening the windows. It let so much light it.We had a flat screen tv in our room (the hubby loved that part). We booked this hotel for our second honeymoon and it just fit it perfectly. Our only annoyance? The slooooooooow elevators. I was impressed that our room was in between both elevators, and yet we never heard any foot traffic. It was so quite and just wonderful.We'd definitely stay there again! Wonderful location!	
May 28 2008 	Iroquios Wonderful Experience	I took my mom to NYC for the weekend in celebration of her 70th birthday. My mom and I are not familiar with the City. The Iroquios Hotel staff was so attentive, helpful and patient with us. We were made to feel very comfortable and at ease. The hotel itself is very charming; there is a wonderful reading room at the front of the hotel. Our room itself was both beautiful and clean. I recommend The Iroquis highly to anyone visiting the City who is looking for a small hotel just a few blocks off Times Square and walking distance to the theaters!	
May 26 2008 	Nice overnight stay	Clean but small room. Quiet safe block close to everything in Midtown. Staff helpful but not overly helpful.	
May 20 2008 	A wanderful commodation and remarkable services	Last week I had the pleasure of staying in the Iroquois hotel New York, the service was excellent, from the moment I step in the hotel until I check out 2 days later, it felt like home and felt welcome with the warm smile of the front desk agent and the professional services of the bellman's. The room was very nice, clean and quiet. The mattress was very comfortable and soft. The restaurant was great, the food was unbelievable and the staff was very kind and friendly. The concierge was also very helpful, they helped me booked limo services, Broadway shows. In conclusion, the stay was unforgettable and I thanks to all the staffs who kindly made my trip a pleasant experience in my visit to New York. I will definitely recommended everyone to stay at the Iroquois hotel in New York City.	
May 20 2008 	Loved the Iroquois	This is a great hotel. Perfect location for tourists between 5th avenue and times square. reception staff were very helpful. rooms were small but modern and very clean. loved the molten brown toiletries.would definitely recommend this hotel to tourists	
May 10 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	Me and my friend stayed in The Iroquois from 17th April - 22nd April fro 5 nights. I original was looking to stop at the Sofitel but it was alittle more expensive but had simlare reviews to the Iroquois. Upon arrive I found that the Iroquois is next door but one to the Sofitel. The rooms are very clean and spacious with flat screen tv (perfect pictures aswell), hair dryer, ironing board etc all you need from a hotel. I loved the added benefit of Molton Brown toilities in the bathroom. If I had know I would not have brought my own shampoo. The beds were very comfortable but the pillows were alittle too big for my liking! The only down side I experienced was the concierge was not the best but I didn't realy need her as it was my second visit to NY, but the recptionist were just as helpfull when I asked them any advice and recommending restaurants etc. The location is fantastic, right between times square and 5th avenue - this is perfect location for any tourist. Every moning we walked down to The Red Flame dinner just down the street who have a fantastic breakfast menu and the quickest serving waitresses I have ever experienced. Breakfast is in front of you within 4 minutes of ordering (yes I timed them).Overall I would definatly stop in this hotel again when I return in a few years or so. I spent hours reseaching hotels for my trip and I would just say to anybody doing the same, same your time and go with the Iroquois.	
May 7 2008	Great Experience and Value	A very nice traditional NYC feeling hotel, we were treated so well by everyone - had attentive if not excellent service experiences, all with at least some form of special request - from the front door guys, to the bar, the front desk team, the concierges, and the room cleanup staff. Rooms were always immaculately done upon our return. The elevator was a little painstakingly slow, but became charming as our stay progressed - probably won't request a higher floor with hopes of a view next time . . . though they tried to accommodate that as well. While we spent most of our time below 14th, a notable difference in the freshness of the air when coming uptown. Room and bath quite nice - adequately updated, very clean and functional. All around a great experience.	
May 5 2008	Lovely service	I spent three nights with my daughter - who had never been to New York before - and specifically wanted a boutique hotel that would seem more personal. We felt that the hotel was home and were happy to return at the end of each of three busy days of walking , shopping and theater. The room, though small, had comfortable beds with lovely Frette linens. The marble bathroom was furnished with plenty of towels and lots of Molton Brown toiletries. The staff was gracious and attentive and the Triomphe Restaurant was outstanding. The Iroquois is a member of Small Luxury Hotels and they always have superior properties on their list.	
May 3 2008 	Great location great service great value	My friend and I decided to spend a weekend in New York, and we booked rooms at the Iroquois because they were relatively well-priced and very well located for our theatre excursions. We were not disappointed. The rooms were well appointed, clean and comfortable. The manager himself asked to make sure we had everything we needed and to see if he could be of help. The front desk staff and the concierge were all very helpful with directions and reservations, and the breakfast buffet was a very good value. We would both definitely return.	
May 3 2008 	Loved the Iroquois	We have just come back from spending six days at the Iroquois hotel in New York. This was our first time in The Iroqouis. We have found it by &quot;mistake&quot; over the net thru an affiliated hotel after looking at the hotel website and reading the details, we have contact the hotel directly and made the reservation. As a frequent traveler with countless trips to NYC. I had never heard of it. As a global business traveler I have learned to judge hotels on the basic competency of the staff. Good service almost always translated into a good experience. My wife and I spent last week at the Iroquois. The hotel was fantastic. Classy, clean and very warm and welcoming. The room was enough for two people not to be falling over each other and their luggage. Our room which although wasn't huge, was very comfy, with a stunning marble bathroom and molten brown toiletries, which were regularly replaced. After a long day in the city, to come back and have our beds made and chocolates left on our pillow as part of turndown service, was great for us. The staff, as other people have said on here, are what really adds to this hotel. Friendly and pleased to help you. Complimentary Coffee at the lobby every morning from 7 AM to 10 AM Is a big pulse( I would start it at 6Am for the Jetlag suffers). And a cold lemonade for rest of the day. The hotel is well situated, close to the show we attended. close to times square, and the subway is a block away. It clearly has an European flavor to it, small but complete. It's a great location.All in all, we would definitely go back! V. recommended	
May 3 2008 	Excellent stay in a great hotel	We arrived at the hotel from Europe at 11pm and received a warm welcome from the front desk. We were escorted to our room which had 2 double beds . It was small but clean and well appointed . We had trouble getting the safe to work but they sent a maintenance guy to see us at midnight. The bathroom is very elegant but also small. Taking a bath was out of the question as it was tiny. Housekeeping were also great and never disturbed us. They left bottled water every day and the weather card at turndown is a lovely touch.The staff are excellent and always greeted us by name. However, they were not overbearing as can sometimes happen in smaller hotels. The location is perfect and the hotel has doormen who provided us with umbrellas , maps and were very helpful.There is a computer available to use in the lobby and you can check flight information in real time.It is located on a quiet street so we never heard any traffic. In fact we never heard the other guestd in the hallway either, the rooms seem to be very well sound-proofed.This hotel feels like a private European mansion and it's easy to forget that you are in the heart of Manhattan. I'm looking foward to going back.	
May 2 2008 	a lovely restful place in NYC	Spent three nights in an executive king room on the &quot;off-street&quot; side of the hotel. Wonderfuly quiet (for NYC), and quite luxurious. Perfect location from which to access all of the best of the city. Walked three blocks to the theater and Times Square, and easily cabbed everywhere else. The staff here makes a huge difference... all are friendly, welcoming, and well-informed. Room service menu was great, and service was fast and efficient. Trays could be better filled-out, but a minor complaint. This place is not cheap, but well-priced for exceptional service, rooms and staff. I won't stay anywhere else in NYC from now on!	
Apr 26 2008 	A great first time in new york hotel.	We have just come back from spending six days at the Iroquois hotel in New York. This was our first time in New York, and for my mum, her first time abroad. We chose it after looking at the pictures on the hotel website and reading the details, which are exactly the same as what you get. I had booked it as a treat for my mum, taking her abroad and wanting something nice. The hotel was fantastic. Classy, clean and very warm and welcoming. The staff, as other people have said on here, are what really adds to this hotel. Friendly and pleased to help you. Sandra especially was great...helping us from day one.Our room was a classic, which although wasn't huge, was very comfy, with a stunning marble bathroom and molton brown toilitries, which were regularly replaced. After a long day in the city, to come back and have our beds made and chocolates left on our pillow as part of turndown service, was great for us. Complimentary boot shining is also available.It's a great location, close to town. Before we went we checked on this site and saw that people said there was a good diner a few doors away. Go there - much cheaper and very nice food. Everything from fruit to cooked breakfast.There is a bar at the hotel, and a computer for guests to use - we used to email home and check flights - handy.All in all, we would definietely go back! V. recommended.	
Apr 24 2008 	Great location great hotel	We stayed last friday (April 18-20) through the weekend with the express intention of seeing midtown manhatten, shops, museums, theatre. The iroquois is in a prime location for all our tourist requirements.We turned up at midnight and as well as several staff on the front desk, we were expected and welcomed. The room was a standard room and spacious enough for two people not to be falling over each other and their luggage. Where in central manhatten can you get a reasonably priced large room ? ;-)Bottom line, weary after a day wandering around NY the room was all it should be; clean, enthusiastic air con ;-), potent hot shower, enough fluffy towels and robes and a comfortable bed.We checked into The Empire on W63 on monday night and sorely regretted not still being in the Iroquois (unfortunately someone else booked the empire for us).	
Apr 23 2008 	iroquois-attentive service	As a seasoned traveler with countless trips to nyc, I was surprised when our travel agent suggested the Iroquois hotel. I had never heard of it, but trusted our long time advisor. he gave us very good advice. As a global business traveler I learned to judge hotels on the basic competency of the staff. Good service almost always translated into a good experience. My wife and I spent last weekend at nthe iroquois. we were there to see a couple of broadway shows.The hotel is well situated, close to the shows we attended. close to times square, and many of new york's attractions. It clearly has a european flavor to it, small but complete. The rooms are on the small side but well appointed. What sets this place aside is the service. the staff was competent and attentive. polite but not overbearing. no false smiles with a hand out for a tip. the concierge, marga, was more than outstanding. Very important everwhere, but particularly in nyc. The hotel restaurant was excellent but small, make a reservation when you book.All in all a great weekend.	
Apr 19 2008	Oasis in the Heart of Manhattan	My 22 year old daughter and I went to Manhattan for her college graduation gift. After much searching for just the right place to stay that would not break our budget, we chose the Iroquois. This beautiful hotel, located conveniently between 5th and 6th avenues on 44th street, fit our requirements perfectly. The hotel is very clean. The front desk staff was professional and helpful. I never heard a peep in the hallways from other guests or housekeeping. We enjoyed being on a quiet street, but just blocks from Times Square and Broadway theaters. We did not hear the sirens and traffic noises that you might expect in New York City. Our room was a &quot;classic&quot; with two double beds, which fit our needs and budget. It was small, but fine for the two of us. The bathroom was very clean with a full tub and shower, nice marble floors, and fine linens. I would only make two recommendations. A small refrigerator, maybe even tucked into the closet. And, a larger room safe, capaple of storing a laptop computer would have been helpful. We did end up leaving our laptop with the front desk, which is not the ideal place, but we did feel it was secure with them.I recommend the Iroquois for vacation, business, long weekend get-aways, and I look forward to staying there in the future.	
Apr 6 2008	Location and no more	ok, location is a must, but room is so small!! We where located on a room with views to a patio, and the noise of the air conditioners machines was so loud that make us hard to sleep. Ordered a baby sitter and arrived half an hour late. Club sandwich at room service was just ok, and service was not friendly. But, yes, its location is above discussion, is excellent. Will give them another chancem perhaps that day we had a set of circumstances...	
Mar 26 2008 	Mixed stay	We stayed at the Iroquois in a one bedroom suite for five nights over easter. The suite was spacious &amp; nicely decorated &amp; very clean. The location is excellent. The staff were for the most part very pleasant - especially the cleaning staff.We had a number of irritating problems though. First on the day we arrived I had to call 3 times over a 5 hour period &amp; speak in person to the front desk before someone brought up an extension cord for a machine that assists me breathe at night while I sleep. The cord should have come promptly after the first call. This is the only hotel in the world where I've had such a problem.Second, &amp; maybe because it was Easter, the hotel seemed under staffed - 70% of the time there were no doormen. The concierge was absent for a lot of our stay &amp; made silly mistakes like booking 2 restaurants for the same night for us. We were called every evening to check if we wanted the sofa bed made up in the lounge room ? It seemed v odd.Breakfast in the room was very limited - essentially a continental breakfast. Room service after hours was not from an on site kitchen &amp; was limited. The advised it would take an hour &amp; they couldn't guarantee it would be warm ?All room service including breakfast came with a $4 delivery charge plus 18% service. An incredible mark up.Also we could hear everything said &amp; done in the room next to ours - there was a connecting door - luckily this was only in the lounge room of our suite but it is still strange when you're paying a lot of money for a suite to not get privacy.None of the problems were terrible but they were aggravating when added together.	
Mar 24 2008 	Great location. Clean and comfortable.	I would definitely stay here again. It was very clean, decent size for the two of us. Excellent location! Very close to Times Square, Broadway, Grand Central Station, everything! Very nice.The only downside...the elevators were quite slow. If you don't stay too far up the stairs are a good alternative.	
Mar 18 2008	Praise for The Iroquois NYC	March 18, 2008Praise from SwitzerlandWe have recently returned from another of our very pleasant stays at the Iroquois. The hotel seems to have an on-going programme of small improvements which in toto make rooms and the breakfast even more attractive. We continue to feel that at least one of the hotel's major assets is the quality of its personnel. Everybody you encounter seems to want to help and does - a particular salute those behind the reception desk. Have already made reservations for another visit a few months from now to which we look forward.Tony Podesta	
Mar 3 2008 	Perfect	I am from Germany and I just returned from a wonderful trip to New York, a few days ago.I stayed at this lovely hotel &quot;Iroquois&quot; for 5 nights at the end of february and I absolutely loved it!!! Each and every staffmember is very caring and attentive and they try to fulfil every wish you have.The rooms are very nicely decorated. The beds are the most comfortable ones, I have ever slept in and it was hard to get up in the morning. I loved the shower, it has such a great pressure and it really wakes you up. Even though, I did not really have time to watch TV, I loved the flatscreen TV in the room. The hotel restaurant &quot;Triomphe&quot; is amazing and has the best food ever. The Frenchtoast in the morning is great, everybody should try it. I have never tasted a better one...!!!The location is perfect, right in midtown next to Timessquare and the shopping district on 5th Avenue. The Concierge can provide you with details about where to go and what to see. They gave me great tips.This hotel is definately worth its money and I would absolutely stay there again.	
Feb 23 2008 	A Lovely Hotel	My husband, eight-month old baby and I just returned from a wonderful five-day stay in New York. We would definitely stay at the Iroquois again. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out was hassle-free. Our room was a Deluxe room which was suitable for our needs. The room was not large by any means. Before we arrived, we had requested a crib for the room. The crib wasn't in our room yet, but we told the gentleman helping us with our luggage that we requested a crib and he told us he would let them know. It wasn't long before the crib arrived. The crib was actually a play-pen but the cute thing about it was that there was a mini Iroquois robe on a wooden hanger hanging on the crib especially for our son. My husband and I wanted a few hours out just the two of us and so before leaving our home, he emailed the hotel and requested the service of a babysitter. The hotel uses the Babysitter's Guild and the hotel arranges the booking for you. When we arrived at the hotel, the confirmed the babysitting arrangements with us via a memo. The dates and times were correct and the babysitter showed up 15 minutes prior to the start time. I was initially apprehensive about leaving my son but the Babysitter's Guild has a good reputation and the hotel has been using them for many years. It is pricey at $25.00 per hour but it is worth it for peace of mind.We didn't get to eat at Triomphe but based on other reviews, I will make sure we eat there when we go back. The Red Flame, a couple of doors down, was always packed. My husband picked up take-out breakfast from there one day and it was very good and reasonably priced. The hotel is in a great location... shopping to the left, Times Square to the Right. We walked everywhere... to the Empire State Building, Times Square, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, the United Nations, Fifth Avenue.Some people may consider the hotel pricey for its size but I take into account its location. Sure you can stay somewhere cheaper but it may be off the beaten track. The hotel is definitely small, but that's the way we like it. We can't wait to return.	
Feb 6 2008	Great Hotel	The Iroquois is a beautiful hotel with a great location, it is two blocks away from Grand Central and is near Times Square and 5th Avenue.The hotel is small but has the feeling of an Inn tucked away in Manhattan.The rooms are small but elegant. Bathrooms are very clean and bright.Only down side was the noise as our room faced the front of the hotel.We had dinner at the Jewel of India, just down the block. Food was great and not too expensive, the staff was okay.Brunch at Sara Beths on Central Park South, excellent!	
Jan 31 2008 	Will defiinitely return	I share in all the other wonderful reviews of this hotel. The concierge staff is five star as was all the staff we interacted with -- well trained and very attentive. They arranged excellent transportation for us to and from airport. We stayed in a King Executive room and while it was the size of most hotel rooms it was more than adequate for our needs -- nice sized closet, wall mount television, marble bath, big desk. Free wireless (why oh why doesn't every hotel have this!) excellent bed and bedding, great breakfast and the best location. Wonderful restaurants within easy walking distance -- best one is the hotel's Triomphe. Husband's conference at the Mariott on Times Square (will never stay there again) so easy walk for him. Only complaint was in the bath -- it was very cold during our stay and the bathroom seemed to never warm up -- wish they would have installed radiant heat in the floors when they redid the bath. But that minor complaint (and it really wasn't too uncomfortable once you ran a hot shower) and some painting they did on an elevator while we were there that had incredibly strong odors are the only negatives associated with our stay . They definitely will not keep us from returning!	
Jan 27 2008 	Astounding Service!	I moved to the Iroquois from another hotel where I was underwhelmed by the service. The Iroquois experience was like entering a different world by comparison. The reception was amazing and the staff are universally helpful, friendly, polite and willing, even eager, to deliver above and beyond the call.The reception area is lovely, with a small &quot;library&quot; with comfortable seating and a computer and free Internet access. The entire hotel offers complimentary wireless Internet access which is a rarity even at luxury hotels like Four Seasons, which I think Iroquois outshines.The hotel's restaurant, Triomphe is actually as good, in my limited experience, as is promised. Small but elegant and excellent food, nice bar, comfortably between formal elegant and &quot;biz&quot; casual.Of all the Iroquois's virtues, however, it is the standard of service and care that I have found extraordinary. I have stayed in at least a dozen &quot;luxury&quot; hotels in New York from the Soho &amp; Tribeca Grand's to Four Seasons and Ritz. Iroquois (certainly for the money) bests them all. Whoever is doing the hiring and training at Iroquois understands what true excellence in service is all about: making the guest feel like their concerns are paramount and that everything possible has been done to meet and exceed one's needs.I come to New York to work often and I plan to make Iroquois my new home away from home. Hope to see you there!	
Jan 25 2008 	Love Love Loved it!	This hotel was simply elegant, contemporary and a true find. The hotel is only 3 to 4 stories, but it surpasses the skyrise hotels by far. It's only 3 blocks from Times Square and offered daily complimentary hot cider. Staff was nice and helpful. We got the deluxe room with king size bed. (Deluxe rooms feature queen or king, so make your preference known!) But the standout feature was FREE WIRELESS INTERNET IN YOUR ROOM! you can't beat this hotel. it's wins &quot;best all around!&quot; (The only &quot;con&quot; was the $20 per person continental breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. But walk down 3 doors and have a hearty meal at the local diner for half the cost!) Would definitely return!	
Jan 25 2008 	Egged!!	We actually loved the Iroquois, night staff was lovely. Our room, a deluxe was great with a gigantic window. My problem was with the room service and Sunday am staff. There is no breakfast room service with the exception of a continental for $14.95, they do encourage you to order what you would like and they will accomodate. I ordered two poached eggs, toast and jelly, a small fruit bowl and coffee. I got this but with only one piece of toast and no jelly and charged $27. On checking out, I wanted to discuss this with someone and asked for a form or whatever. I was told by the surly front desk lady. Put it on Trip Advisor. so heeeerrree you go Iroquois, maybe you should have a chat with this lady.	
Jan 18 2008	A True Gem!!	The Iroquois is a true gem within the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. I was greeted with class from the manager Scott and treated with class by his team of professionals the entire weekend get away. If you're looking for a exclusive getaway in Manhattan, look no further!!!	
Dec 30 2007 	Fabulous Stay great location and awesome staff!	Our stay at the Iroquois was fabulous. The hotel is located right in Midtown Manhattan and a short walk to many many tourist locations. This boutique hotel is cozy, modern and well maintained. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Some might complain that rooms are small, but remember this is New York City and it's all about location and service. The Iroquois delivers. We were very pleased with our room which faced the front of the hotel and the bed is very very very comfortable. The nightly turn down service and goodies, daily newspaper, internet access, and helpful Concierge were just some of the little things that added to our experience and the hotel's charm. The breakfast was deliciously awesome! We also had lunch at the Triomphe (hotel dining room). The menu choices were unique, the presentation appealing and the portions just right. Definately worth a splurge. Nevertheless, there are still many dining choices in close proximity for the budget-minded.We drove to NYC, so we found the parking garage across the street very convenient and affordable. I would stay at this hotel again and again.	
Dec 27 2007	A Bijou location and special experience	I have discovered a ''home''in New York ideally situated ,a small intimate and very friendly hotel that deserves another star ,if only for the people that work there and for the industrious ever present affable Manager,Paul Celnik.As a creative person I notice everything ,and so I can only say that the attention to the smallest details in this wonderful place is perfection itself. Service is carried out with a real smile ,the staff are very courteous and attentive.And it's very clean!Breakfast is a treat with the best offering of fresh fruit and much more. The Triomphe Restaurant ,part of the hotel is a major find,again an intimate setting and the food is fantastic....the Tuna divine!I hope that not too many people notice my rave review....because I intend to be staying there whenever I go to New York!...and I want to be able to reserve a room.But do try it out...Kindest regards to everyone at the IroquoisNicky Wallace , Dublin	
Dec 20 2007 	Good Central Hotel	This hotel is in a fantastic location and the rooms are nice. However as with most central hotels the rooms are pretty small and it is noisey but not very noisey. Good staff but the only real reason to stay here is the location.	
Dec 19 2007 	Wish we could have stayed longer!	This is a 5 star hotel all the way. Wish I could give it more stars! The room was amazing. Very quiet and comfortable. And that bed, I wanted to just back a truck up and take it home with me!The staff was gracious and helpful! Thank you for a wonderful stay. We will be back!	
Dec 12 2007 	Superb Location great staff but noisy room	We booked the hotel to allow us to stay &quot;in the action&quot; in New York and it did not disappoint. The location is superb - 2 blocks from Time Square and at one end of all the big 5th Avenue shops. Being central in Manhatten, Central Park, Broadway, Empire State Building and 5th Ave are all easily walkable. Staff are lovely - really friendly and helpful - concierge sorted helicopter flights for us with less than 3 hrs notice.The room was very luxurious (Deluxe room) - bed very comfortable, but the room was dark and the hotel fans running the heating were on the same side as our room and ran all day and night - so there was a constant humm from them. This stopped me giving it 5/5	
Dec 6 2007	A wonderful hotel!	My husband and I just spent 2 fabulous nights at the iroquois. Everything about our stay was great. The staff was friendly and attentive and very professional. Our deluxe room was SO comfy-the beds are really great. We loved the morning coffe in the lobby and the afternoon hot cider when we came to rest up for our evening plans. There is a computer to use with internet access in the cozy library in the lobby. The location is the best-especially for theatre-goers...no cabs needed. We hope to visit again.One note-our room faced the street and sirens,horns,etc were noisy,so maybe I'd ask for a room that didn't face the street. Did I mention the free shoe shine every night? It's a great place, so much nicer than those huge hotels.	
Dec 2 2007 	Great staff	I enjoyed my stay at this hotel mainly due to the staff and the location. Every single member of staff gets a full house from me, they were wonderful, ready to do all they could. I did not try the resturant but the bar was nice and the library room is cozy. The net did not work in my room so there is free internet connection there if needed. My only real dissapointment was in the room. I have never paid as much for a room, ever, and it was very very small. I expected a lot more for the money. But I stress, what the room had, was nice. Good bed, nice bathroom, nice TV. But I would have liked a much bigger room for the price, one of the smallest room I have ever been in. I was told they were all that size so dont expect much. Try the Red Flame diner a couple of doors down, great food at a good price and it is very New York.	
Dec 1 2007 	A pleasant surprise	Stayed at the Iroquois for a long birthday weekend. We were somewhat concerned based on some of the earlier reviews we had read at this site. From our frequent travels into the city and what we had read elsewhere we thought it would be worth a try. We were right! The hotelis well kept. The staff friendly and helpful. The rooms clean with more than enough room. We had been concerned about some of the earlierreviews that had said that the rooms were small and tight. We did not find that. The library area and the small, well equipped and functional fitness area were welcome amenities. The closeness of the hotel to the Midtown area was also welcome. The hotel was perfect for a 3-4 day weekend on a luxury scale. Looking forward to returning to usher in the New Year.	
Nov 30 2007 	My Home Away From Home	Where do I begin? From the ambience of the hotel, to the room amenities,to the cleanliness of the hotel and to the staff themseleves - I have had nothing but wonderful experiences.I have been staying at the Iroquois going on 15 years now and would never even consider staying anywhere else - when traveling for business, the comfort and care that I receive here is second to none - t is indeed my home away from home.Keep up the great worl guys!!!!Kathie	
Nov 2 2007 	Perfect Location	My husband and I were in New York for three nights, and found this hotel to have the most perfect location of any hotel we have stayed in. The subway, theaters, restaurants, shopping... everything is nearby. The hotel lobby is small, but efficient. The &quot;New York Library&quot; is a great little room that houses books, a computer and printer (we used for printing our boarding passes), and daily newspapers. The concierge is also right there, and staffed with knowledgable people. Always friendly front desk staff made us feel at home, and the doormen were always welcoming and helpful. Iced tea at the front desk, candy in dishes and morning coffee gave it a warm atmosphere. This place is not stuffy. The room is a decent size by New York standards, and all of the furniture and amenities are top drawer. Loved the Frette linens and robes. We were greeted with a bottle of wine, chocolates, and sparkling water, and on day two we returned home to fresh fruit and a perfectly clean room. This place has it down. New York is a noisy city, and this hotel is no exception. We were on the 12th and top floor, but honking cabs and garbage trucks were clearly heard through the closed windows in the early morning. Oh well, that's New York. Go to the country if you want quiet. We ate at the hotel restaurant, Triomphe, and found it to be intimate and have excellent food. We loved the small plates, and the service was very good. Breakfast at the nearby coffee shop, The Red Flame, was terrific, and unbelievably cheap. Another great food tip is the Greek wagon at around 50th +/- and 6th. Let your nose find it for you. This is amazing and fresh Greek food that will feed two people for $5. So, we will probably stay at The Iroquois when visiting New York again. They made the stay just about perfect, and who could ask for more?	
Oct 29 2007	Overall 'Pretty Good'	I'll start by saying I will rate this place 3.5 out of 5. The Iroquois is in a great location in downtown NYC, very close to the theater district and hundreds of shops and restaurants. Upon arriving, we were asked if we needed help with our bags, which we declined. It wasn't clear whether our room was ready when we asked (even though it was an hour after check-in time) but nonetheless, within a few minutes, we were on our way up the elevator. The room that my girlfriend and I shared was costly compared to its size (almost $600 for a suite that barely fits a king sized bed, a small desk, and a dresser). However, the hotel itself as well as the room was very clean and classy. The bed linens were also particularly nice, and comfortable. The plasma HDTV was nice, especially for watching game 3 of the Red Sox vs Rockies world series. However, none of the HD channels worked, and neither did the HBO. For the price we paid, I was going to take advantage of the free overnight shoe-shining they offered. You put your shoes in a bag outside your door by 12 AM, and by 6 AM your shoes are back and shiny. Apparently there was a malfunction since my shoes were never shined.We asked about the HD channels and the shoe shining when we checked out, but we were answered with what basically amounted to an &quot;oops.&quot; The HD had stopped working, and the hotel was unable to get technicians in on the weekend to fix it. In other words, they were too cheap to pay the weekend rate, since in NYC I find it hard to believe that someone wasn't available to perform this service. Most of our time was spent outside of the hotel anyway, and TV is not generally one of my concerns. We were happy to have our parking ticked validated for the garage across the street. But, the hotel's claimed discount was wrong, and we ended up paying more than we thought for parking. So overall this place is nice and comfortable, but nothing special, at least in our experience.	
Oct 17 2007 	Great Hotel with Outstanding Service	After having read the reviews of the Iroquois I decided to give it a try. The room was comfortable, the linens top-of-the line and the afternoon iced-tea a lovely extra touch. But it was the service of the staff that made this stay exceptional. I will definitely visit again.	
Oct 15 2007	Fabulous staff and luxurious European style hotel	We enjoyed The Iroquois as our platform for a wedding weekend in New York. Over the four days, we had events throughout town .... Central Park West, Upper East Side, a gathering and run in Central Park, The Boathouse, Battery Park Gardens, and there in Mid-Town at The Century. With one suite and four additional rooms for a total of 17 room-nights, we had special needs in setting up, cars to and from, extra towels, and TLC. Quiet and convenient.Every member of The Iroguois staff rose to the occasion, was thoroughly warm, accommodating, and thorough. Enjoy!	
Oct 12 2007 	Very nice and comfortable.	This is a great small hotel. The linens are first class, the bathroom is very clean and modern. One of the best showers I have ever had in a hotel room, the hot water came in immediately and lots of water force from the shower.The only complaint I have is that the room is dark. Dark blinds on the windows and only three lights in the room. I ended up taking the shade off the lights to get more light. Also, the Do Not Disturb notice is on the doorbell and not a hanging sign. Because we did not know where to turn the sign on, we were disturbed both mornings at 8:30 and one afternoon, the maid just walked in while we were in the room.Also, if you have a car there is not a designated area to park in front of the hotel to check in and no valet. The parking garage is across the street with a discount of the daily rate for hotel guests - $30 per day. Small inconvience but certainly doesn't take anything away from the hotel.Nice little bar off the lobby, closed on Sundays.	
Sep 30 2007 	very nice	stayed for two nights on business, appreciated the helpful front desk, high quality linens, bathrobe, marble tiles, chocolates on the pillow, and efficient air conditioning. pleasantly surprised to find that although my room was quite small, it had windows in the bedroom, bathroom, and closet. and it could not be in a more central location, beyond all of the attractions, if you're looking for a drugstore or food most hours of the day/evening, not to worry.	
Sep 21 2007 	May not suitable for people over 6 feet tall	I want to begin by saying that the Iroquois reception and reservation staff are superb. It was their friendly telephone manner that determined our selection of the hotel. As well, we were truly grateful for the bottle of wine and chocolates they gave us in celebration of our 25 year anniversary. We also believe that the amazing room we had was because of the staff wanting us to have a memorable occasion. The sleeping room and bathroom were luxurious. However, the shorten queen size bed felt a bit odd as your feet and legs hang over the end. There is no readily available ice or ice bucket. As well, if you touch anything in the bar fridge, the item's price is automatically added to your bill. So if you are thinking of having a chilled glass of wine, you need to involve housekeeping or make sure that you tell the front desk to deduct any &quot;moved&quot; items from your bill. If you are wanting a cup of coffee in the morning to warm you feet that may have been exposed to the night air, you will need to call room service or go down to the front lobby since there are no coffee makers in the rooms.Having no readily available ice or coffee is not a big deal. And as for a shorten bed the amazing pillows and sheets make up for any discomfort. What reduces our rating of this hotel is the lousy housekeeping. Dirty glasses were not removed and cleaning was minimal. As for complaining about this lack of service, we should have talked to the front desk since contacted housekeeping staff made no apology for their lack of effort. So our recommendation for this hotel is excellent if you get a good rate. We have two other more generic travel complaints. We can't stand bell boys. If we were able to carry our luggage half around the global, why do hotels think it is imperative to pay someone to take our luggage via elevator 100 feet? If we need help, we will ask for it. I would rather just give $5 dollars to a bell boy just to leave us alone. Our next beef is with US airways, who cancelled our flight 2.5 hours before departure without any compensation or assistance in finding alternative arrangements. Many of the 65 stranded passengers spent the night in the LaGuardia airport waiting for the next available flight. Next time well take Blue.	
Sep 17 2007 	My Home Away from Home	As a transplanted native New Yorker who travels to the City on business at least twice a month, I try to stay at The Iroquois as often as I possibly can. I can count on smiling faces and consistently considerate service and amentities when I come &quot;home&quot; after horrible flight or back-to-back meetings. And, they have a fabulous flight status tool that has saved me many hours hanging around airports. JQuinn,Chapel Hill, NC	
Sep 17 2007 	Details Make the Difference	Stayed at the Iroquois last night and was very pleased. Attention to detail counts, from the courtesy at the front desk checking in (with the lovely tea offered at the front desk); the king sized firm bed and firm pillows; complimentary sparkling water, flat screen TV; an abundance of towels and toiletries in the bathroom, which had lovely hot, hot water; the lovely young woman who came for the turn down service and offered me extra chocolates; and lastly, upon departure being asked if I enjoyed my stay. I've stayed several times at a well-known hotel just a few doors down and never had the service I received at this hotel. Small but elegant. Give it a try.	
Sep 9 2007	Extremely decadent	My daughter and I stayed at The Iroquois for a week last month and we couldn't fault this Hotel in any way! We travel a lot and have had many hotel experiences, however, The Iroquois is definitely second to none! The rooms are very spacious given the prime position of this Hotel and have been refurbished without sparing any expense. The marble bathroom is simply divine and the amenities that this Hotel afford are more than generous. The library area off the main entrance is also divine. The room service meal that we enjoyed on our first night after a long day of travelling to NYC was five star as was their Restaurant. We have found a regular stomping ground for our future visits to NY and we would not stay anywhere else upon our return! Last but not least the staff are extremely friendly and the Manager of this Hotel is very much &quot;hands on&quot; and wants only the best for the Hotel guests! K. Berkhout, Australia	
Sep 4 2007 	Double bed for two adults in a hotel that charges $ 425 per night	(Weekend rates) is unacceptab, in my book. We were stunned to find out how small and uncomfortable the bed was, and could not get a proper night sleepat all. I complained, but all I got was an offer to switch to a suite, at a price which was over $800 a night... (And yes, I told the girl at the front desk I am going to write about my experience, so others could learn to avoid this hotel,to no avail).This is a relatively nice hotel, small (105 rooms, I was told...)nicely done &amp; clean, with good service and great location.The drawback is the VERY small size room, I mean V E R Y small, which found me banging my head over the stonecladded side table while turning at night..., and yes, again, traveling with my wife, she asked for an inflatable matress (They had none...) and could not get to sleep properly either. We would not consider this place again. There are many other hotels in the same block, for this price. Do not forget to ask specifically for a minimum of Queen size bed, for two adults in a room, since what is the standard in any chiep motel in the US, is &quot;special&quot; in a &quot;Boutique hotel&quot; in Manhatten. Though we made reservations well ahead of time, and arrived early in the day, we were not properly accomodated. Take this into considerations while dealling with this hotel.	
Aug 29 2007 	Small but luxurious rooms and great service	My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois during a recent weekend trip to New York and really enjoyed our stay. Our room was small, but clean and very nicely furnished. The service was friendly, and the large flat-screen TV and DVD player in the room were a nice touch. The hotel's location near times square, is extremely hectic, and probably should be avoided if you don't like crowds. But this location is very convenient if you are in NYC to see theater. The reason for my 4 star rating instead of 5 star is that for the price, I was hoping for something a little bit extra, like more spacious rooms or inclusive breakfast. Tips:-The restaurant in the hotel (Le Triompe) is fantastic. I tried their 6-course tasting menu for dinner and fond memories of it still linger in my mind. :)-db Bistro moderne (a restaurant a few steps from the hotel) is also great.-The International Center of Photography is very close to the hotel and is worth a visit.	
Aug 24 2007 	Comfortable Bed Ultra Clean Nice Staff	I've walked by this hotel many times over the past three decades and never thought about staying here. in late August, I had a reception and dinner that would end late, so instead of heading home on a very late train, I stayed at the Iroquois. I'm glad I did. The desk clerk was polite and friendly. I was upgraded to a &quot;deluxe&quot; room. This hotel must have been recently renovated because everything looked fresh and immaculately clean. The room was small, but larger than where I usually stay -- The Chemist's Club/Club Quarters a block away. The bed was very comfortable, turned down at night with Belgian chocolates on the pillows, with soothing music on the radio. The bathroom was spotless and featured Moulton Brown toiletries. Even the way they folded the soft, plush bath and hand towels and wash cloths was artistic. There was a one-liter bottle of Poland Spring sparkling water in the room, and unlike many hotels that charge you $5, at the Iroquois, it was with their compliments.What kept me from giving a fifth star? As a previous reviewer noted, I couldn't get the sound to work on the LG flat screen TV's digital channels. The volume on the analog channels was fine. There was a CD player in the room. In the morning, there was a copy of the New York Times placed in a nice cloth bag (not an oversized plastic baggie or thrown on the floor) hanging on the doorknob. There was also no bill slid under the door, which I actually liked. Whenever I see that in the morning, it's almost like saying, &quot;Reminder -- don't forget to pay and try to leave early.&quot; Check-out took less than a minute.I did not eat at Triomphe. As expected, breakfast is expensive. I just grabbed a cup of excellent coffee in the lobby and walked three blocks to Grand Central to catch an early train. That close proximity to the station makes this a conveniently located hotel. Broadway is a block away for those who want to catch a show. The Iroquois is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels chain and deservedly so. I will definitely stay here again.	
Aug 24 2007 	Beautiful hotel in excellent location	My husband and i stayed at this hotel for a week for our honeymoon. We stayed in a one bedroom suite, which although pricey was extremely spacious and beautifully decorated. The complimentary molton brown toilettries, chocolates and bottle of wine were nice touches. The staff were all very friendly, also before our trip the consierge arranged tickets for the yankies game for us and the seats were fantastic. The location of the hotel was perfect, especially as it was our first time in New York. We would definately stay here again and would recommend to our friends and family.	
Aug 24 2007 	Classy Hotel in a Fantastic City!!	My boyfriend booked a trip to new york as my birthday present - very generous eh! He choose this hotel as he wanted something a little special, and he def choose well!!!!Upon arrival we were given a wonderful greeting by the Hotel Reception staff who proved extremely helpful during the whole of our stay. They were happy to help with all our questions and requests relating to our room and also allowed us to exchange travellers cheques daily, which was great.Our room was lovely, a nice big bed which was really really comfy, a fantastic large plasma TV at the bottom of the bed which was a bonus! The Bathroom was wonderful, floor to ceiling in marbel. The bath was great, and the shower over it was super powerfull, which came in handy after long days of sightseeing.The safe in the room was free to use and was operated by your own chosen pin code, and we found this really easy to use and extremely handy. There is a mini bar in the room, we did not want to use this, so requested that it be emptied to take away the temptation which the reception staff arranged with no problem at all.There is free broadband internet access available in the libray, just off the main reception and this was great and proved very helpful. The location couldn't have been better, just a few blocks from the bright lights of Times Square!So,,,, if you are looking for a hotel with a little bit of class and are willing to pay just a little bit more than average, then this is hotel is perfect! I'd would def recommend, and in fact my boyfriend and I are planning to go back (as we've still so much to see!) and we'll def be stopping there again!oooh - if you find yourself on 8th Ave between 46th &amp; 47th Street, you must call into Scruffy Duffy's for a drink, it's a great irish pub showing loads of live sports - def worth a look! Cheers.	
Aug 20 2007 	Wonderful stay; Highly recommended	My husband and I stayed at The Iroquois for 3 nights in August during our first trip to New York. The hotel is conveniently located and we highly recommend it to future visitors. We stayed in a deluxe room with a king size bed. While the room may be comparably small, it is elegantly decorated and very clean. The hotel provides ample towels and fresh towels and chocolates are provided during a nightly turn down service. We will definitely stay at this hotel again when we return to New York.	
Aug 15 2007	NIGHTMARE!	Our whole experience at this hotel was a disaster. We checked in after a long flight and wanted to get changed. Unfortunately our room was not ready. We never got to rest/freshen up. We had to leave and come back in an hour. When we returned we finally got to see our rooms. There was nothing special about the rooms. It was tiny. It only consisted of a bed, tv (although it was a nice flat screen, half the time the channels wouldn't change/hear them), and a bathroom. The beds were pretty comfy though. The desk/concierge wasn't too friendly. Every time we asked for help/info it always seemed like a hassel. I never felt comfortable. We got an ajoining room with an outer door. That way we could keep our doors open and close the outer door. Well... the outer door locks and there is no way to open it! We realized it and asked the maid to please ask the desk to open the door. We returned about 4 hours later to find a locked door. So we went down to ask the desk and they said they would send the engineer up to open it. Why don't they just have a key??? GOSH. Well we waited... and then waited some more for the engineer. It took about an hour until we could finnaly get into our room. Anways. Overall this hotel was a nightmare. It was clean and pretty but it had too many errors. There are tons of other hotels in NYC so go try them instead of The Iroquois.	
Aug 14 2007 	Absolutely wonderful stay at the Iroquois	Booked two , non-smoking rooms, one double and one queen on 5th floor. Their 2nd floor has some smoking rooms, fyi. The entire stay was fantastic. TEach and every member of the staff was exceptionally professional and politely personable. Beds, linens, bath were impeccably appointed, very clean. I booked on-line using the hotel's website and found a better, summer rate than on the travel websites I usually use. While the hotel was perfect, our meals at the Triomphe restaurant were unbelievably delicious. Each bite was heavenly. Hope to go again soon. Wouldn't stay anywhere else.	
Aug 8 2007 	Comfortable and Classy with Superb Service	We loved this hotel. At $300 a night, it was more than I really wanted to pay, but it turned out to be worth it. For one thing, my husband fell ill and spent a lot of time in the room. It was nice for him to have a comfortable bed, a decent-sized room, and free DVDs to watch. My little boy loved the kid-sized robe and &quot;Batman&quot; bubble bath they gave us. And when I accidentally left my carry-on bag (with crucial stuff like my laptop) in the lobby when we left, the staff found it, figured out it belonged to me, and managed to call our airport-limo driver with enough time for us to turn around, get back to the hotel to fetch the bag, and still get to the airport in time for our international flight. That's good service!! In our five nights at the Iroquois, we found the location excellent, the hotel restaurant superb, the staff friendly and helpful, and the room well-appointed and quiet. The bigger hotels can be more glamorous, but here we felt at home.	
Jul 19 2007	Comfortable reasonably priced hotel in great location	My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for three nights in mid-July. The location, 44th between 5th and 6th, is very convenient the theater while not being in the middle of the craziness of Times Square.Our deluxe room was suprisingly spacious, with a full closet and a large bathroom. We've stayed in several other NYC hotels in similar price range that had microscopic bathrooms, so this was a nice treat. The bed was comfortable and the towels and bathrobes were very plush. The lobby is quite small, but there is a nice library with free newspapers and a computer and printer (nice for printing boarding passes). This hotel is a great value. Based on our experience with other hotels in New York City, this one is very reasonably priced, yet the rooms are upscale.	
Jul 10 2007 	Nice hotel in good location	We stayed in an executive king room during our stay at the Iroquois last spring. Beautiful room in great condition. For NYC hotels, it was a decent size and good value. Our bathroom was a good size as well. The room was on the street side which gave good light, but a lot of traffic noise (especially on garbage pickup night.) But at this hotel it's either noise or a dark room! Our only complaint was a strong smell of cigarette smoke one night. We were told it was a nonsmoking floor. The front desk sent someone up (very responsive) but he could not locate the source of the smoke (??) We think it was coming under an adjoining room's door. A wet towel under the door solved the problem. All in all, this is a really nice hotel for the price and a great location.	
Jul 4 2007 	Location and staff are the best	My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for 3 nights. We thought the hotel was a very good value at $300.00 a night for a deluxe room. The room was nicely decorated, very clean, and in great condition with flat screen wall mounted tv and very comfortable bed. The location couldnt be beat with only 2 blocks to Times Square. The staff was friendly and did everything imaginable to please. We did not like the pillows provided but when we ask for different pillows, two memory form pillows were quickly delivered to the room. The drawbacks are the size of the rooms and baths- they are small. The halls are narrow. There is not much to the lobby. There are two elevators and while they were a little slow we did not encounter any significant delays. We did find in our mini bar two opened and partially consumed beverages but they were removed promptly when we called the attention of the front desk. All in all a good experience.	
Jun 28 2007 	Perfect Small Hotel in Manhattan	I loved staying in this small Hotel with friendly understated service. The room was of a high standard with a great bathroom and downstairs there was a small but comfortable library which was a useful resource, with a pc for guests use. Located in W44th just off 5th avenue The Iroquois was only a walk from everywhere I needed to go. Perhaps the best feature was the outstanding small resteraunt in the Hotel but with its own entrance from the street, or access from the hotel lobby. Triomph - this not only had some of the best food I've eaten in a restaurant but also a good selection of well priced wines with a good choice availble by the glass. Again the service is friendly and understated. If you are going to New York on business or pleasure and want a quiet hotel to retreat to then I would recommend the Iroquois. My only criticism is I would have liked a kettle in the room - I'd rather make my own tea when I'm out of England......	
Jun 25 2007 	Amazing customer service	I was traveling with a girlfriend to NY to see a show (Blackbird with Jeff Daniels - if you get a chance- see it!) We chose the Iroquois based on TripAdvisor reviews. A few days before we were to arrive I got a call confirming that I had requested a room with two queens and they wondered if I could accepta a room with a single King Size bed. No! My friend and I did not want to share a bed. The woman on the phone assured me it would not be a problem. When we arrived, however, the front desk informed us that they had no rooms with two beds, could we take a room with a single King Size bed? I was about to get hot under the collar and reminded her that I had just confirmed a room with two queens a couple of days before. She quickly offered us TWO rooms for the price of one - we each got our own room with a queen size bed and our own bathroom. Now THAT is what I call customer service! We had a lovely stay, the rooms had recently been renovated and were luxurious. I plan to stay at the Iroquois every chance I get.	
Jun 25 2007 	Room like a cave	I have to agree with a previous review, great location, nice staff, but that is it really.Breakfast not included, attached bar (not really a hotel bar) no atmosphere and pricey. Sauna was never on. 2 lifts, both very slow. we were on the 3rd floor (2nd in english) and had to walk up and down the stairs all the time, not a prob for us, but not good.Room was horrid, Very small, just room to walk round the bed. We couldn't tell if it was day or night out, very disconcerting. window pointless as was up against the brick wall of the next building. AC was loud, I had to use ear plugs to sleep . If you didn't close the bathroom door you had to sit sideways on the loo, and couldn't get to the toilet paper. No tea/coffee maker.You go to NY for the views, I was very disappointed to be staying in a cave, it felt like being underground!	
Jun 22 2007 	Great place in great location	My wife and I stayed 4 nights and were very happy, this was our first trip to NYC, read the reviews on this site and they were all very accurate. The rooms were small but very nice and clean. Staff was great. Would surely stay here again, the location is perfectly in the middle of it all. Enjoyed this gem!	
Jun 20 2007 	Everything I had hoped for and more for our anniversary	From start to finish, our stay at the Iroquois was great. The room was large enough, very very clean, a staff that wanted to please you and a terrific location. of all the theatre district hotels i would rank casablanca and iroquois tied for #1, everyone else is a distant 3rd. will stay again and have told all of our friends to book here and to mention our name as you get rewarded for referals	
Jun 17 2007 	It was a small dark room....	I just returned from a two night stay at the Iroquois for business in the Times Square area. I picked the hotel because of the location and the good reviews on this web site, but I can't rate it nearly as high as most travelers.The location is great, just a half block from 5th Avenue and a block and a half from Times Square. The room was clean with a comfortable bed and a flat screen TV. The staff was friendly and efficient, but that is about it for my list of positives.I was in room 206 which was very small and very dark. I couldn't tell if it was day or night out. I had a view of a brick wall and garbage. There was a large AC generator somewhere close by that kicked on and off with a loud noise that prevented me from sleeping well. If you didn't close the bathroom door to use the toilet, you couldn't get to the toilet paper without getting up off the toilet because the room was so small. There was no coffee maker either, and for $300 to $350 a night, I want a coffee maker!i wouldn't stay again...	
Jun 14 2007	Superior hotel	This small but wonderful hotel is a a gem in the middle of the city. It is close to the theaters as well as the multitude of nearby restaurants plus it is a short walk from Grand Central Station. The doormen smile as do all of the staff at the desk. Each of them asks politely if there is anything more I needed and this place feels like a home away from home. The rooms are not large but very comfortable for a limited stay. I loved the king bed with large soft pillows and covers that wrapped around you. The housekeeping staff is efficent and caring. Even the chocolates on the pillow at night were delightful.This is my favorite hotel in New York. You'll really like it if when you want comfort, smiles and a warm homey place to stay.	
Jun 9 2007 	Fantastic!	My sisters and I celebrated my mom's 80th birthday over a May weekend at The Iroquois and, as my mom describes it, it was truly a weekend she will never forget. First of all, the hotel is magnificent! It is warm, elegant and inviting (plus it is convenient to both Fifth Avenue and the Theatre District). Secondly, the staff is extremely accommodating and went above and beyond to make my mom's birthday a memorable one. They arranged for the six of us to have a beautiful suite plus 2 adjoining superior rooms which were all very lovely and comfortable (the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable). We had ordered a couple of bottles of champagne, a fruit platter and a cheese platter to be delivered to mom's suite before her arrival, which they were, and a short time later, after we polished off the champagne, a staff member arrived to deliver a complementary bottle of wine and a box of chocolates, which was a nice surprise. The service was impeccable! The staff was extremely attentive and did everything they could to ensure we were happy. I have stayed at 5-star hotels before, i.e., the Peninsula, and find The Iroquois to be in the same league. For a truly memorable experience, plan to stay at The Iroquois. My family and I highly recommend it and will definitely return.	
Jun 4 2007 	Delightful stay at the Iroquois	My ten-year-old daughter and I stayed at the Iroquois from 30th May for three nights. We arrived at lunch-time and our room wasn't ready (check-in is at 3) but they stored our bags while we went off for lunch and shopping. Our first room was exquisitely decorated and had a delicious bathroom and an enormous flat-screen tv; but was a little cramped. When I mentioned this to the lady at the front desk she asked if I would like to upgrade to a suite, so we spent our last 2 nights in super luxury (with TWO enormous flat-screen tvs) with our own living room, dining room and kitchen in addition to bed, bath and walk-in closet. The staff were without exception not just friendly and polite but actively kind; I would have to say the service was outstanding - our requests were always attended to quickly and courteously. My daughter loved the free dvd library and the internet access from the itsy-bitsy &quot;library&quot; on the ground floor. The hotel's restaurant, Le Triomphe, was also excellent. The location - midway between Grand Central Station and Times Square - could not have been better. We will definitely stay there again.	
Jun 3 2007 	Some good ... Some not so good	My husband and I just checked out of the Iroquois. The location is great and very near Times Square and all the shows. We had our theater tickets delivered to the hotel on check in and that was really terrific. The room was small and we didn't have any view at all ... looked at a brick wall. But, the room was very, very quiet which we thought of as positive. We did have a negative experience when asking for additional towels (had to ask twice), and pillows (three times). Internet wireless being &quot;free&quot; ... is a positive, too.	
May 29 2007 	Beautiful room and excellent staff	We stayed at the Iroquois over Memorial Day weekend, and absolutely loved it. Other reviews provide details about room size, furnishings, and convenient location, so no need to rehash those here, other than to say that this hotel is everything we've come to expect from a Small Luxury Hotel property.We sat in the Triomphe bar and had drinks one evening, and decided to order dessert after coveting the lemon meringue pie of the gentleman sitting next to us. He asked us how we were enjoying the hotel, whether the concierge had been helpful, whether we'd tried the restaurant and how we liked it, etc. ; it turned out he was the manager of the property. He seemed genuinely interested in our feedback, which was all positive, and particularly proud of the fact that many of the staff had been with the hotel for a number of years. When we got back to our room later that evening, he'd sent us up a bottle of wine. This is a hotel that takes pride in providing excellent service, and it shows.	
May 29 2007 	Terrible concierge	This hotel has both good and bad aspects. On the good side, the suites are very nice and spacious. The free DVD's to borrow are a nice touch. The location is great. The subway at Bryant Park is the closest and it's nice to walk through the park during the day. Know, however, we took cabs towards the end of our trip and thankfully the hotel is between two of the most famous hotels on the west side: the Algonquin and the Sofitel. Not one cabbie ever heard of The Iroquois, but when I mentioned either the Algonquin or the Sofitel, they knew exactly where to go.Due to a very shoddy concierge staff however, we won't be staying here again. Thinking it would save us time &amp; trouble, two weeks before our trip I booked the house limo to take us to The Iroquois from our home and back. We were quoted a price, worked out the times and were even given the color of the limo and the driver's name. Two days before, I called to confirm the pick-up time and was told there was a problem with our booking. I was told that the other concierge girl had us quoted us the price for a town car &amp; not a limo. They said the limo would be almost double the price each direction!!! They told us they could call out a different company for the price we were quoted, but that &quot;we might get a foreigner who speaks no English&quot; and they couldn't account for the way they'd drive!! They said they would &quot;absolutely not send their top-of-the-line limo out for that price&quot; and the only thing they would do was send the other company and &quot;it wasn't going to be a very nice limo either.&quot; I was shocked! They wouldn't budge. I called my regular limo company and luckily, after explaining the situation to them, they took us both ways for even less than The Iroquois quoted originally. I cancelled the limo service with The Iroquois and thought the matter was done. I was sorely mistaken.When we got to The Iroquois in our privately booked limo, there was a letter waiting for us at the front desk confirming that we were using the house limo to go home. This was the very same limo we had cancelled with concierge two days prior. The concierge representative that was there happened to be the same girl I actually cancelled with and she apologized for this SECOND error and said shed correct it. We got the &quot;corrected&quot; letter later that day, but unfortunately, concierge must not have read it themselves, since it was simply a copy of the one we received earlier. We contacted the front desk this time who said theyd take care of it. We didnt see the concierge hardly at all the rest of our trip.When we checked out, our account was still wrong and concierge was again not at their post. We therefore had to speak with the manager and the front desk again before we could check out since our bill was all wrong due to this now beyond pathetic concierge error.The hotel itself was very nice. However, if you need to book anything through the concierge, I would not recommend this hotel. The Iroquois concierge does not honor its word and they dont value their customers at all. The last thing you want to do is spend your vacation in the lobby and on the phone trying to fix the staffs mess.	
May 27 2007 	Great concierge!	We were 2 old friends, almost 60, in the Big Apple for the first time. We were referred to The Iroquois hotel through one of the packaging companies that do plays/hotels. We got tickets to three of the major shows and 8 nights at the hotel. Check in was easy, very nice service and greeting. We got the rooms requested. Service all around was very very nice. Best of all was the helpfulness of the conceirge. She helped us book restaurants and other shows. Led us to great restaurants and other adventures. A big plus was the wireless internet service that was complimentary with the room. The location was absolutely perfect for our plans. We saw 5 plays in all during the 8 days, and a jazz pianist one evening. We were able to walk to all evening entertainment from the great location of the hotel. We booked prix fixed meals prior to dinner at some of the historic restaurants, 21, Sardi's. Tavern on the Green. Some really great spots. All in all we had a great time, enjoyed seeing the sights and saw great plays.	
May 3 2007 	The Iroquois is a gem!	This gem is located within walking distance to the theater district, shopping, and subway access. The intimate feel of the welcoming hotelis refreshing. The emphasis is on customer service and the staff could not be more accommodating. The rooms have the most luxurious bed and bedding. The restaurant and bar are fantastic.	
Apr 22 2007 	The Iroquois is a gem!	This is a gem of a hotel. Excellent service, beautiful rooms, fantastic location and charming dining options. For business, it's spectacular. I can't wait to book my stay with my family for leisure travel.	
Apr 20 2007 	Really great!	My stepmother and I stayed here during the incredible heat wave of early August 2006 to see JK Rowling speak at Radio City. The hotel is in a great location, down the street from Times Square and is a really easy walk to the Music Hall. The food at the adjoining restaraunt was fantastic and offers an early &quot;theater&quot; dinner if you have to eat early. The hotel room itself was just gorgeous, and the decor was really beautiful. We only had one little snag that was mostly our fault: We misread the time that our train departed and had to really hurry out. The hotel employee was unable to get a taxi for us, and after 10 minutes said it would probably faster to walk. Not sure if you've ever run from Times Square to Penn Station in 105 degree humidity, but I wouldn't recommend it and it surely was not faster than a cab. And we missed the train. Oh well. Otherwise, a great stay and I'd definitely go back!	
Apr 9 2007 	Enjoyed the Iroquois!	Just returned from a 2 day stay in NY and really enjoyed staying at the Iroquois. I liked the location and the room was very nice, clean, and comfortable. The concierge was very helpful in helping us with our dinner arrangements and making suggestions.On Sunday evening the hotel bar is closed, which was a little disapointing since we were looking forward to one of the flavoured martinis advertised in the elevator. Oh well, no big deal, we went elsewhere...I would totally recommend this hotel.	
Apr 7 2007	A little something extra at the Iroquois	When my boss shorted me a night at the Sofitel next door (surprise, you don't have a room for tonight!), I to the Iroquois and was able to book a room for that same evening... what started out as very stressful day ended up to be a lovely surprise! I was upgraded to a suite (for the same price as a regular room) and was treated to a comfortable living room (didn't really get to enjoy it though, for the one night I was there) and a spacious &amp; beautiful bedroom/bath. The king-size bed was very comfortable and the flat screen TV, fancy alarm clock (wish I had time to figure that thing out!), jacuzzi tub were the perfect was to end a stress-filled work week away from home. The only downside was the icky, teeny tiny shower - I felt like I was in a vertical coffin, and couldn't wait to get out of there! Overall, it was a great experience &amp; I couldn't have been happier with the staff and treatment.	
Mar 31 2007	Wonderful unexpected experience	I planned on a one-night stay for business but ended up staying for four because the ice-storm cancelled my flight. What started as a disaster ended up being a pleasant weekend in NYC, largely due to the quality and service at this hotel.Knowing that I was going to pay $300+ for any decent room in midtown I wanted to try something new and perhaps better than the usual W, Hyatt, Waldorf and other hotels in the 300-400 range. Based on reviews here on Trip Advisor I decided to take a chance...I was not dissapointed. The reviews are quite accurate.Excellent for adults looking for a quiet yet conveniently located hotel. The rooms (I had two similar ones) are spacious by NYC standards with a chair+ottoman, full size dresser and smallish desk with chair. Well-laid out. Bathroom amenities (Molton Brown, my favorite) and fixtures (compact Ritz Carlton style) were superb. Plasma TV, windows that actually open, frette linens, comfortable bed (almost Ritz-like), mini-bar, etc. Only thing missing is a coffee maker; I hope someone from the Iroquois is reading this.Staff was quite accommodating to all of us stranded travelers. They kept the same rate through the weekend despite typically higher charges. They had the uncommon ability to know when to help and when to leave you alone. I especially like the hot cider at the front desk in the evening...it took the bite out of the ice storm. Loved the library off the lobby, perfect antidote for small NYC rooms.I spent the weekend watching the St. Patty's parade (started in front of the hotel) and shopping. It is convenient to the men's stores on Madison. Didn't get a show in but this is a perfect close yet quiet location. I will never stay at another NYC hotel again. This is my new home away from home.	
Mar 29 2007 	What a Find!	The Iroquois is one of those finds that you almost want to keep to yourself, but we couldnt help ourselves: My husband and I came back from our trip to New York telling everyone, We stayed at the most wonderful place!Just a few weeks ago, I, too, was scrolling through these reviews, wondering if they might be too good to be true. Believe me, this hotel is superb. I was attracted by the Frette linens and robes; my husband liked that a 24-hour fitness center was available, and that discounted parking was right across the street. The amenities are luxurious, the bed and bedding the most comfortable weve ever slept in. But it was the friendly, attentive service that made us feel so welcome and pampered. We were warmly greeted by every person we encountered.The front desk upgraded our room upon arrival, not knowing that we were celebrating our anniversary. When the manager discovered it was so, he sent wine and chocolates and a lovely greeting to our room. And he remembered us and the occasion for our visit at check-out. Those were very nice touches in addition to other details we appreciated -- the chocolates and weather card at turn down; the complimentary coffee and the Times in the morning; having a CD player in the room. It all added up to a lovely, singular experience for us. Believe me, well be back!	
Mar 27 2007 	MY FAVORITE STAY	I have stayed at many hotels in NYC and the Iroquois was one of the best experiences I've had thus far. The hotel was very clean and well appointed from lobby to room. Italian marble in the bathrooms and bathroom fixtures were impeccable. The room was very clean and well arranged and linens were high-quality and very comfortable. The big plus was the staff. All were welcoming with a smile and ready to serve and all very knowledgable about the neighborhood and NYC attractions. The restaurant and bar, TRIOMPHE was excellent and the hotel is centrally located and close to Times Square and browadway attractions. I will definitely return and have already recommended the hotel to a handful of others.	
Mar 25 2007 	Overall a great place to stay!!	We stayed at the Iroquois for 4 days at the start of a lengthy international vacation.We had never stayed there before but were immediately impressed by the way the staff rushed to accommodate our needs due to severe disruption caused by US Airways' usual incompetence. Rescheduling and rearranging check-in/out went incredibly smoothly with everything professionally handled by a very experienced and knowledgeable staff.The food is excellent - some of the best breakfasts and dinners we have ever had in over 30 years of travelling. Friendly, pleasant wait staff were eager to please and attend to our every request. An innovative menu made the servings sparkle with fresh ingredients and attention to preparation usually lacking in many NYC hotels.The hotel is well situated being convenient to both the theatre district, major department stores and mid-town Manhattan business venues. Rooms are fair-sized, even large by New York standards, and are clean and well appointed. Linens and furniture are well above average and certainly qualify for a &quot;luxurious&quot; label. The housekeeping staff are attentive and work promptly and efficiently to respond to requests.The prices are extremely reasonable - even &quot;best value for money&quot; would be a fitting description!We'll stay here again at every opportunity!	
Mar 13 2007 	Wonderful Stay	I stayed here with my friend (girls weekend). We loved it. The beds were very comfortable with great linens. Our room had a flat screen tv with free HBO and plenty of channels, not to mention a DVD player. There was no view from the window (another building) but we weren't in the room much so that was fine. The bathroom was a nice size as was the oddly shaped closet, great use of space. The service was very good and friendly. My favorite thing about this hotel was the feel of comfort. It was a small luxury hotel but didn't have any false pretenses. The people were friendly, not snooty, and I always felt comfortable there. The room and hotel were very clean, turn down service was wonderful. The air conditioning and heat worked great. I don't havea single complaint. Also, very well situated to everything.	
Mar 1 2007 	The BEST boutique hotel in NYC	This was my third stay at the Iroquois and each time it just keeps getting better. The rooms are small but impeccable. The beds are luxurious and comfortable. The bathroom is completely marble and CLEAN. The staff is accomodating and friendly. And the resturant is excellent. The central location makes getting around Manhattan easy. Within walking distance of great resturants, shopping and just blocks from Times Square. Great for business travel...but I would stay here for pleasure too.	
Feb 14 2007 	Great location helpful service	Last summer, I went to NY with some friends for my third time, and we were very pleased with The Iroquois. The location is excellent, close to Times Square and the Fifth Avenue, but in a quieter street. The lobby is small, ordinary and disappointing, but the rooms, although small, are very comfortable and include a well stocked mini-bar, a DVD player and a big flat screen TV. Bathrooms (which for me are very important) are spacious, clean and luminous. The staff is nice and helpful, and speaks fluent Spanish. There is aslo a small gym that during my stage was empty all the time.	
Feb 13 2007	Love this small gem of a hotel!	This was my second time staying at The Iroquois. Last year my husband and I stayed there for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay so much that I booked a room there when traveling with a girlfriend to NYC for 4 nights. I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of the front desk staff and one of the doormen were still there - a sign of a good hotel when they can keep staff. My husband and I had been upgraded to an executive king for our stay and I have to say that our room, on the back of the hotel, was exceptionally quiet and comfortable. I was alittle worried when I was learned that the classic doubles, which I booked for a girlfriend and me, weren't located in the rear of the hotel and therefore might be noisier. I really had no cause to worry. This time we were on the top floor (12) and while we had little in the way of a view, the room was perfectly comfortable, exceptionally clean, and almost as quiet as the room my husband and I had. The beds are incredibly comfy - the soft linens, terrific pillows, and great mattress - made for some very comfortable sleep! The marble bathroom is a delight even if it is on the small size. The plasma tvs are quite large and of very good quality.The hotel feels very European, which I prefer, over some of our oversized American hotel chains. While there is no coffee pot in the room, there is free coffee downstairs and continental breakfast (cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, juice) delivered to your room is very reasonable (there was so much food the two of us could share one breakfast). We also enjoyed having a drink and some small plates in the hotel bar where the staff is friendly and unpretenious.The location of this hotel is perfect. There are a number of hotels on 44th so cabs are readily available. You can go downtown easily by walking to Fifth Avenue and uptown by walking to 6th Avenue. Since our daughter lives in NYC I expect to return and plan on staying at The Iroquois again where I feel very welcome and can relax in a calm environment.	
Feb 3 2007	The Iroquois a terrific place to stay	Loved this hotel. Clean, comfortable, attractive rooms. Room was small, like so many in large cities, but not overly so and very comfortable. Loved the 36 inch flat screen TV with DVD player.Could kick back at night and watch my favorite movies. Wonderful staff. Incredible location. Within walking distance of so much. Will definitely stay there again.	
Feb 1 2007	Great value for money!	We have just returned from 3 nights at the Iroquois Hotel. This is our fourth trip to New York in 6 months and we found this to be the best hotel weve stayed at so far. The location is great - near shopping, the museum mile, theatres (Broadway), New York Library and Central Park. In the same block you also have two banks and opposite the hotel a parking garage. The rooms are cozy and attention has been paid to detail. The beds are soft and all rooms have wireless. It took a minute to figure out the shower, but the bathroom with Molten Brown products is clean and well proportioned. The staff was more than helpful, providing information on restaurants (and helping with bookings). I would go back here in a heartbeat! We paid $239 per night for a room with a queen size bed  booked it via the internet. The only thing we found odd is that when our friends tried to book a similar room over the phone  they were given a more expensive room option  no mention of the $239 per night. Our friends phoned back to tell them that they were aware of a room with a queen size bed for $239, and were able to change their booking.	
Jan 29 2007	Great Hotel Great Location	Just arrived back from a weekend in New York with my Mum.The Hotel Iroquois is in a fantastic location 4 mins walk from Times Square allowing you to walk to many destinations easily!.The hotel staff were pleasant &amp; friendly &amp; we appreciated the nice little touches such as a card with the weather forecast for the next day left on the pillow, chocolates and the turn down service.We had a classic twin &amp; the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in! The room was very clean &amp; tastefully decorated with a wonderful flat screen TV. After a tiring day it was like coming back to a home from home.The free internet access in the library &amp; the wonderful coffee in reception in the morning were a plus.We had a fantastic time &amp; I would definitely stay at The Iroquois next time I am in New York.	
Jan 16 2007 	Fantastic Location! Great Hotel And Staff!	My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois hotel this past weekend for one night. It was a lovely experience. The location of this hotel in the theater district is perfect! Its less than two blocks from Times Square, and its in walking distance from most of the theatres and surrounding restaurants. A big plus, the Iroquois is located directly across from the Hippodrome parking garage. Have the hotel validate your parking ticket and youll pay a discounted rate. For these reasons, we will definitely stay here again when we go to another show on Broadway.We reserved a CLASSIC room through American Express Travel. We got a much better rate compared to the hotel and other travel website rates. The room was nicely decorated, clean, yet very small. There is a large HD Flat screen television on the wall and desk in the room. For a short stay, its perfect. We were assigned to room 300, on the third floor. The view from the windows is towards a small alley/courtyard. Not pleasant to the eye, but it has its advantages. The room is not subject to most of the street noise. We were actually quite impressed how quiet it was. We heard a few horns hear and there, most likely from the cars that are exiting the parking garage. The hotel locked up our luggage after checkout, and held it for hours till we left the city. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful!The only complaint I have with this room is its location within the hotel. Its directly next to and across from two elevators. I also believe there is housekeeping quarters nearby. So we heard every person coming and going, as well as doors opening and closing. Since its low season, we did not find this as bothersome, but I can imagine it would be if the hotel was full. You can hear conversations right through the door loud and clear; as they can hear yours. For this reason, I could not give it the highest rating, but I would stay here again. I would recommend requesting a room further away from suites 300-303 if you are assigned to any of them.TIP: try the diner next to the hotel for cheaper, delicious breakfast!	
Dec 27 2006 	Enjoyed the Iroquois	I just spent three nights at The Iroquois and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. The location is great and the hotel itself is very clean and well maintained. Sure, the rooms are a bit small and mine had a view of an alleyway, however, that isn't much different than most New York hotels. The sauna wasn't working well when I was there, however, the staff was attentive to the problem and got the situation worked out.The beds are very comfortable and the flatscreen television worked well. The free WiFi helped me get over the jetlag.I recommend the Iroquois.	
Dec 20 2006	A great boutique hotel	I stayed at the Iroquois a couple of years ago and had a pleasant enough experience so I returned a couple months ago. Much to my delight, they had made major improvements in almost every area. New super high-quality linens, absurdly comfortable beds, high-def LCD screens, etc. etc. Anyone who has ever booked a room in NYC knows there are always two things you are forced to deal with: rooms priced at a premium and they're relatively small. So the Iroquois is not cheap but nothing in NYC is and it's really great to see they have put a lot of that money back into the hotel. And with the new TV's the room seemed twice as big. Those annoyingly huge bureaus that you see in hotel rooms are no longer there with the new TV's. All in all, a great stay with a great location.	
Dec 13 2006 	Disappointed with the Iroquois	We stayed at the Iroquois for three nights in November.The night we arrived there was no doorman/bellman ton duty to help with luggage so we dragged our heavy cases from the car, up the steps and into hotel. The check in staff were polite but unfriendly. I had booked a superior room and requested one with natural daylight and a view if possible. The room we were given was a rude shock!It was tiny by any standards - absolutely not suitable for two people. We could not stand in the room together along with our luggage. As we had flown for twenty four hours from Australia we had planned to order room service for dinner. Our plans had to change - there was Nowhere to eat in the room.A very small desk on one side of the bed doubled up as nightstand but no nightstand on the other side, I made do with the window sil to balance a glass of water on.The Frette robes were yellowed all over and really threadbare in places, the door handle came off the bathroom door, so we had to leave that open to avoid being locked in.There was no natural light At All in the room - the window faced a brick wall, so that, coupled with the Tiny size of the room made for a very claustraphobic experience so bad we moved room next day and paid the extra for a slightly larger room.So disappointed with the Iroquois - we won't be staying again.	
Nov 13 2006 	Ideal Location	The Iroquois is in a perfect location for seeing all the sites and only a couple of minutes from Times Square. The Iroquois has well equipped bedrooms but they are small. We booked a superior room which was very comfortable and clean and the Molton Brown toiletries were an added bonus. The coffee served in reception each morning was a great way to start the day.I would recommend the Iroquois although I did think it was expensive. However, we stayed during the marathon weekend and we haven't been to New York before so it's difficult to say whether there are better places to stay which are better value for money.	
Nov 9 2006 	Fabulous Location	We came to the Iroquois on Columbus Day weekend. It has a terrific location being 2 blocks from Time Square and 2 blocks from Grand Central Station. The location to everything really made our stay enjoyable. The rooms are very small and you don't necessarily know what you are getting when you arrive. We booked out room well in advance, but when we got there we were put in a small room with a double bed--so small that with two of us, one person needed to stay in the bed while the other person dressed. We complained to management and they moved us to a queen room on the third floor which was great-also not that larger, but much roomier, and made the rest of our visit very enjoyable. The free internet is nice and wireless were great. It is right next door to the Algonquin Hotel which seemed like a nice place as well. The bed was amazing-very plush and wonderful--and the plasma tv was really nice as well. We'd stay here again-but we would want a guarantee of a queen room.	
Nov 8 2006 	I Agree - Not to Be Trusted	I booked our stay more than 3 months prior to arrival, booking a small suite. I was called a few days before my arrival and asked to relinquish my suite. The excuse they gave smelled fishy, but I decided to be a good guy. I told them they needed to give me 2 adjoining rooms because I had a 10 year old daughter traveling with us. I stressed that the rooms must be adjoining. We tried to gain access to our rooms at 3 p.m. and we were told that only one room was ready, that there was still a guest in the other room. At 6:30 p.m. the &quot;guest&quot; was still in the other room. My requests to speak with a manager were dismissed, although he was on-site. We overheard the staff discussing the fact that some investor's brother had the room and had left the hotel without removing his luggage and they didn't want to bother him by removing his luggage. Finally, they moved the luggage out at 7 p.m. The rooms could hardly be considered adjoining. You had to cross a small hallway between them; there was a door between the hallway and the rest of the hotel with no more than a bathroom door lock on it. The next morning at breakfast we overheard the manager with his guests at the next table, and we surmised we had been bumped from the suite to accommodate the manager's daughter, her cousin and his inlaws. DO NOT TRUST THIS HOTEL. THEY PUT EVERYONE AHEAD OF THE THIRD PARTY PAYING GUESTS.	
Oct 28 2006 	The Iroquois not to be trusted.	My husband and I had a guarenteed reservation made weeks ago. Our reservation was for a larger room with a queen bed. We arrived and were told we had a double bed, which meant the room was very small. I showed the desk clerk our quarenteed reservation. I was told the hotel DID NOT quarentee their bed size? We went with the bellman to look at the room. With the three of us in the room there was no floor space left. The bed looked smaller than a double. We refused the room and my husband went looking for another hotel. I waited in the lobby with our luggage, while I waited several guests checked in and were giver a larger room with a queen bed. i asked why our reservation was not honored and was told the other people were with a group? Fortunately we were able to find another hotel at a higher rate.DO NOT STAY HERE. The hotel is not to be trusted to honor you confirmed reservation!!!	
Oct 17 2006 	Loved the Iroquois	I recently stayed at the Iroquois Hotel. This property shines due to location, style, and service! It is located in the center of the Theatre District and next door to the Algonquin Hotel (a must for 5:00 cocktails in the cushy lounge). Immediately when you walk inside the hotel the city noise is quietened by warmth and an inviting entrance. To the left of the foyer is a very nice library on 44th Street with complimentary computer access. My Mom and I checked into the Iroquois on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived early and our room was ready. Before we could get to our room, the staff delivered complimentary wine and chocolates. Although a bit small, the rooms are very nice with down comfortors, duvets, marble bathrooms, and plasma flat sceen t.v.'s. There was a small problem receiving a fruit and cheese gift from a friend on arrival, but the Hotel Manager insisted on not charging her and called her to apologize. Overall, I would highly recommend this property if your stay requires this bustling neighborhood.	
Oct 10 2006 	Fabulous stay at the Iroquois	The Iroquois is a wonderful small hotel that makes its guests feel welcome, comfortable and pampered. It is idealy situated in mid-town Manhattan with easy access to Broadway theaters and the best NYC restaurants.The room, while small, was comfortable and beautifully appointed with quality furnishings and amenities including a plasma TV and DVD player. My wife was particularly impressed by the quality of the bedding, bath towels and robe. Our room was an executive king at approximately $525 per night plus taxes.The hotel discount at the large parking garage accross the street was appreciated. It cost $93 to park for 3 days. Not bad in an area where it can cost up to $60 to park for one night at the theater. Remember to have your parking receipt validated at the front desk.The only imperfection in an otherwise perfect stay were the slow elevators. We would definitely stay there again and look forward to our next visit.	
Oct 1 2006 	A better bed than my own! Fantastic location!	We loved this hotel! We were attracted to the idea of staying in a smaller boutique hotel with character instead of some giant, boxy Marriott-like monster hotel. We certainly got what we were looking for and didn't have to sacrifice a great location to get it. It's within 2 blocks of Times Square but oddly we never heard a peep at night. We had been warned that you can't find a quiet hotel near the square -but we never experienced any noise issues. The staff was friendly and very attentive. We arrived at noon and our room wasn't quite ready but they were very helpful and apologetic. They offered to store our luggage which was fine because we were ready to get out and explore anyway. When we returned, we found a lovely bottle of wine and delicious chocolates compliments of the staff. The room was clean and bright and well-furnished. My favorite part however, were the bed linens! Unbelievable! Better than my own! The whitest, softest comforter and softest sheets - like sleeping on a cloud. And I think we had 6 pillows to choose from. The only negative about the room was a disappointing view of the fire escapes, but we got over it quickly. The other side of the hotel might have had a better view but probably more noise. The bathroom has floor to ceiling marble - very beautiful and VERY clean. Plenty of towels, GREAT water pressure in the shower, and wonderful, plush robes for your use. Seriously, I really felt like I was staying at a friend's house and not a hotel. It was great to have a warm, quiet, comfortable oasis and the end of a high energy day. We visited the bar a few times during our stay. The service was friendly and the house wines were excellent. I loved the decor - check out the pictures for yourself. Loved the little library in the front of the hotel with access to the internet. Is was great to be able to check email as we came and went. I would definately stay here again. Great place for couples. Go ahead and book it!	
Sep 25 2006 	Not worth the money	My wife and I spent five days at the Iroquois. Check-in went fine. However, when we arrived at our room, we noticed the shower window was see through. It was missing a film covering which prevents seeing into the shower. They moved us to another room on a lower floor (4th). Noise was a major problem throughout our stay. The a/c did not keep the room cold. When we would call down, they would send someone up that would tell us the room felt cold to them. They told us they turned the a/c down from outside the room. It did not seem to make much of a difference. Each room does not have it's own a/c unit. It is from a central unit and you are not able to really control the a/c by the thermostat inside the room.The room itself was okay, small but nice. However, the bathroom was dirty. The shower was moldy and you could tell it had not been properly cleaned in quite some time. When the front desk rang our room to see how things were, I was unable to hear them as there was a problem with the phone. The phone did not work properly until the last day of our stay. At this point, we opted to clean the shower ourselves instead of complaining. The DVD player in the room quit working 1/2 way through a movie we were watching. Granted it might have been the DVD we borrowed from the front desk, but they did not even offer to check the player. We checked out the Sofitel next door after we were settled at the Iroquois. The rooms were much larger and the hotel is more luxurious. Unfortunately, they did not have any rooms available.We have stayed at other Small Luxury Hotels (Hotel Commonwealth, Boston - which was wonderful) and while this hotel is small it is certainly not luxurious. We would definitely not recommend this hotel.	
Sep 19 2006 	High expectations mostly lived up to	My husband and I stayed here between 2nd-9th September with another couple. I had researched places to stay for a long time and from the comments on here decided to go for this one as it got rave reviews.This boutique hotel has an excellent location and has been beautifully rennovated, with a nice reception, library, and restaurant. Our room had a really comfortable bed, plasma screen, sumptuous furnishing/bedding, molton brown toiletries each morning etc etc, but it was an odd shape and a touch cramped. It was not as spacious as our companions room. Also - neither rooms had 'views'.The staff were really helpful and friendly. Coffee/tea is served each morning in the lobby - nice touch - but essential really as there are no coffee/tea facilities in the rooms.The restaurant - the triompe is very very nice. beautiful food. loved it. small and intimate.The only other thing id have liked is a bar area or somewhere to sit in the hotel when you arent in the room. A place to meet people, relax etc - the iroquois does not have this.However it was a fanastic week and would recommend it to anyone.	
Sep 12 2006 	the Iroquois was a ideal setting.	Before the school year began, I wanted my 10-year-old daughter to have her first visit to NYC. I had spent a lot of time on the web trying to find just the right hotel and picked The Iroquois. We spent four days (3 nights) and it turned out to be a great choice. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We had taken a red-eye flight in from the west. Since a room was available, they let us check-in in early. We unpacked then set out for our first walk around Manhattan. When we came back to the room, they had replaced one of their regular fine bathrobes with a small size one for my daughter. That is the kind of special attention we got during our entire stay. Their concierge was knowledgeable and seemed very objective. She listened to our interests and didn't appear to be pushing any particular places or tours (unlike some I've found in other hotels). The rooms are typical NYC size -- but very nice. The wall-mounted, flat screen TV was great. It was one of only a few nice hotels where I could find two large queen size beds. The location -- between Broadway &amp; 5th Ave. -- couldn't have been better for our trip of sightseeing, plays and shopping. It was a wonderful father/daughter experience -- and the Iroquois was a ideal setting. I'll certainly go back on a personal or a business trip.	
Sep 11 2006	Great Little Hotel in Pefect location	I booked this hotel having read other reviews on Tripadvisor. I wanted a clean, nicely decorated hotel with a bit of luxury in a central location. This is exactly what I got !! On arrival at the hotel we found the staff very helpful and courteous. We were shown to our room on the 6th floor and found it very clean with smart decor and a lovely bathroom. The view was not brilliant as the room was situated at the side of the hotel and overlooked the rear of another hotel. However, the quality of our room and cleanliness more than made up for the view. As for the location it couldn't have been better. We were able to walk to many of the main attractions: Grand Central station, Times Square, Broadway, Empire State, 5th Avenue shopping area with Tiffany's and Trump Tower and Macy's on 34th Street. Central Park we just got a bus to and it only took about 10 minutes.There is nothing I would say that is less than satisfactory about this hotel it was excellent in every way. Our only mistake was to book our trip through Travelocity. We were lucky to get there at all after all the mix ups and long overdue refund after I changed to this hotel from another, Then when we got to the airport there was a problem with the booking they made. They have no real customer service department and the one they do have is virtually impossible to contact so we will never book anything with Travelocity again (BEWARE). We will go back to this hotel but book another way.The only other word of warning I would give is that the restaurant which you can use for breakfast up the road was not value for money to me and my partner felt the fried breakfast was deep fried and overcooked. We ate the rest of our breakfast's eleswhere, the Apple Cafe in the Empire State Building excellent value for money. I got steak and eggs for the same price as a small fry up in the other place.	
Sep 3 2006 	Less than stellar performance	We stayed for a total of six nights at the Iroquois Hotel from August 23rd through August 29th, 2006. Our experience was overall disappointing, mainly because of the laconic and almost passive aggressive attitude of the front desk staff. Throughout our stay we encountered various problems; when we attempted to rectify them the hotel staff was dismissive and invariably made us feel each problem was somehow our fault.1. When we checked in very early in the morning we were laconically pointed towards the elevator, with no offer being made to assist us with our luggage.2. The second night we did not receive the turn-down service (and the eagerly anticipated Godiva chocolates). When I commented on this to the front desk the next morning I was informed that I must have left on the &quot;Do Not Disturb Sign&quot;. This was not the case. In fact, I couldn't figure out where or how to turn on that sign, even if I had wanted to.3. Sometime during the afternoon of our second day the internet wireless went down and I was unable to conduct some business. When I brought this up with the front desk I was told that the internet was up and there was no problem at all. (Translation--I was somehow doing something wrong). It turned out that the internet was indeed down for the rest of the evening and was not up and running until the next morning.4. The servicing of our room was consistently late (past 2 in the afternoon). One afternoon we returned to the room past 3 p.m. and it had still not been cleaned. Of course, I informed, once again, the front desk. Needless to say, they were not pleased with me. I noticed that with each of my &quot;complaints&quot; they became less and less cordial.5. Our last afternoon at the Iroquois we requested that the hotel book a taxi for our departure early the next morning. My husband was informed that the bellman would get back to us shortly with the details--we are still waiting . . .! We eventually booked private transportation to the airport.There were positive things about the Iroquois. It has an excellent location--two blocks from Times Square without the 24-7 din one finds there. Great restaurants, museums and shopping opportunities are within walking distance. Also, if you don't feel you burn enough calories exploring Manhattan, the hotel has a respectable, if small, exercise room on the premises. Finally, the complimentary wireless, high speed internet is a great amenity.To summarize, the Iroquois has the fundamental elements that comprise a great hotel; however, their staff needs a few lessons in customer service.	
Sep 2 2006 	Quality Plus	My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 nights at The Iroquois New York Hotel in May and we were delighted with the accomodations and friendly, helpful front desk staff. The location is ideal; close proximity to Theatre District and Central Station. There is a very good and inexpensive restaurant next door for breakfast. It is very clean, exceptionally comfortable beds and all amenities are included . Daily newspaper, bottled water. We had a room with two double beds, down comforter, Egyptian cotton sheets. It is a small boutique hotel so expect the room and closet to be on the smaller scale. Highly recommend.	
Aug 31 2006 	Very Good Service Great Location	I stayed at the Iroquois on a business trip. It was in a great central location right off 5th Ave. in midtown, near shops, theaters, restaurants and a quick walk to Grand Central Station. Yet it was not too near super noisy Times Square. The service here was very good. It was on our corporate preferred list of hotels and since these can be hit or miss; I looked it up on Trip Advisor before I booked it. Since the reviews were good I decided it was worth a try. The service at the front desk, the restaurant, and the bell desk was excellent. I was upgraded on check-in and the room was quite comfortable. There was a flat panel TV, a very comfortable bed, a complimentary 1/2 bottle of wine, bottle of Perrier, and a small box of chocolates. There were terry robes in this room and the towels were nice and fluffy. I had some problems with the wireless internet, but was told they have signal boosters available. The room was a typically small NY hotel room, but it did have a desk. There was also a small fitness room at this hotel. I have already recommended it to friends and I plan to stay there on my next trip to New York.	
Aug 17 2006	Great Experience	My wife and I stayed for six nights in a executive king bed room at the Iroquois in July. We chose it after we have read a lot of good reviews about it. The room size is NY standard, whereas the bathroom is pretty big. We really liked the personal approach of its staff.A little draw back for us was that fact that one is not able to switch off the AC. (I solved this problem in my way though..)When reported to the GM, he substiuted us to a free dinner at the superb Restaurant Triomphe downstairs. Great gesture! When my wife got sick, the concierge called a doctor she personally knew well and organized a quick appointment for us. I have never experienced this kind of personal treatment in any of the big hotel chains. We will be back at the Iroquois.	
Jun 21 2006	Highly recommended	My wife and i opted to stay at this hotel as it is a member of &quot;Small Luxury Hotels of the World&quot;. Located between Times Square and 5th Ave, the location could not have been better. From previous reviews I had understood that the rooms were small, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were not as small as I had feared. Our room faced the back, and that was OK, as it is probably more quiet than the front. The staff was good, but I honestly would have expected a little more attentiveness. The only &quot;bad&quot; experience was when we ordered ice for drinks, and the staff who came was visibly displeased with the tip he received. In my opinion it is OK to be displeased, but not OK to show it in front of the customer. I can highly recommend the hotel for other visitors to NYC.	
Jun 12 2006	Well located but very small	I booked this hotel as it is part of the small leading hotels of the world group and is recommended for children. On arrival the staff were lovely and really nice to my 2 year old son. I had only been in the room a few minutes when reception called to check if everything was OK - a nice touch. Shortly after a staff member arrived at the door with a Batman bubble-bath for my little boy - a really nice touch. The room is crammed with equipment - games console, CD, DVD, plasma TV, minibar but being so small it is a bit tight on space. The bath leaked which was a bit dissapointing and we were overcharged on our drinks order and had to ask for the refund to be returned to our room which they reluctantly did. The location is fantastic, you are 1 minute off Fifth avenue and a short walk to Central park, FAO Schwarz, Rockafeller Centre, Empire states, Times Square, Central station etc. Only one of the door staff were friendly, the others were a bit grumpy. In hindsight, I wish I had booked a cheaper hotel because beign tourists we went out really early and came back really late and so didn't need a nice hotel. Also, the bar was really small and the only communal area was far too small for a child, there isn't really anywhere in the hotel to be with your child other than your small bedroom and the restaurant is too formal to feel comfortable in with a child.	
Jun 11 2006	None better in the city	We just returned from a weekend in NYC and stayed at the Iroquois Hotel on West 44th Street. What a lovely hotel with superb staff. Alot of extras like a complimentary bottle of wine, Perrier water, NY Times delivered daily, fruit tray in the afternoon. Wow...what can I say. They even gave us complimentary drinks at their bar which is lovely.Our room was boutique size with a desk, chair and queen size bed. Nice size bath with tub with shower that was delightful and the shower had excellent pressure. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quality stay when visiting the city. It is one block from 5th Ave and all the shopping you would want. We must admit this price is not cheap but you truly get what you pay for here! Worth every penny and we have stayed at a lot of NYC hotels. This is second to the Omni Berkshire.	
Jun 10 2006	Ideal location wonderful staff	The Iroquois is a wonderful luxury boutique hotel just 2 blocks from bustling Times Square and 1/2 block from 5th Avenue. Indeed, this location is very quiet in spite of the proximity to Times Square and 5th Avenue. The hotel is flanked by the Sofitel and the City Club and Algonquin.Underground parking is very convenient just across the street, $30/day with Iroquois validation, well worth it. For those driving into Manhattan for a last minute visit, just a short drive from the Lincoln Tunnel to the hotel. If you don't have too many bags be sure to take a right into the parking garage just before the hotel entrance and then check-in to the hotel. Otherwise you will have to drive around the block after checking in as there is alot of traffic with other guests arriving at the various hotels on this block and you cannot back up. If you would prefer the staff take your bags you can pull up in front of the hotel long enough to unload the bags and then drive around the block to access the garage and then check-in.Upon arrival we were upgraded to a deluxe room on the 10th floor, which afforded a view of the Chrysler bldg and 44th St. No problems with noise at all. Windows can be opened if desired.The bed is wonderful, as everyone says, and the bathroom is very nice, excellent shower. Plasma TV and nice furnishings. Everything is spotless, of course. The room is on the small side, but adequate for a couple for 3-4 nights. Longer stays may want to upgrade.Aside from the location, the staff is what makes this hotel so wonderful - everyone is very helpful and attentive to your every need. Margo is a great help in selecting restaurants and sightseeing trips, and the front desk is great - they even leave you a personal greeting on your phone before you get to your room.We did not dine at the restaurant, but the small bar is nice and the bartender is a very nice girl from Russia, unfortunately I cannot remember everyone's names. But the entire staff is extremely courteous and attentive.We highly recommend the Iroquois Hotel for its location and staff - I would not consider another hotel in NYC when visiting Manhattan, and this hotel receives many repeat guests for a good reason.	
Jun 2 2006	Iroquois: Centrally Located in NYC	My husband and I just returned from a one night stay at The Iroiquois. We had an overnight layover in NYC coming from Rome on our way home to San Diego. We decided to stay at the Iroquois due to the reviews posted on TA and because it is a member of the &quot;Small Luxury Hotels of the World&quot;. It lived up to the SLH standard of excellence. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a deluxe superior room which was elegantly appointed with a luxurious bed, plasma TV and Molton Brown toiletries. In addition, this hotel is centrally located in the theatre district. We were very satisfied with the service and the room and would recommend this hotel.	
May 13 2006	in love with the iroquois	our family spent four days in luxury at the iroquois, and could not have had a better experience. the service staff, concierge, and the general manager were congenial, extremely helpful, and made us feel that we were the only guests on the premises. i cannot wait to return to nyc, and would not consider any hotel than the iroquois.	
May 12 2006	Elegant Oasis	What an incrediblly pleasant surprise! I discovered the Iroquois on line and decided to stay there with my daughter, her three children and myself . They had a wonderful set-up: a small living room with a bedroom and bath on either side. The rooms were beautiflly done: Plasma tvs, fine bath fixtures ( I'm ordering the same toilet for my bathroom) fine linens plus great help.This hotel is near ToysrUs, DB's great restaurant, and convenient to the theatre district-a real diamond-concierge,etc terrific!!!MomMom ( Bobbi ) Schimmel-Wynnewood, Pa.	
May 11 2006	Great 2 Night Stay at the Iroquois	I just returned from staying two nights at the Iroquois. I visit NYC about four times a year and use four-to-five star hotels. The Iroquois is definitely in this group. Nice touches from plasma screen TVs to excellent linens and toiletries. The staff was very attentive (less than 5 minutes for ice to be delivered to the room) and room service was quite prompt. Like most older hotels, the bottom-rate rooms are small ($309), but fine for a single traveler. Overall, one of the best values in NYC - great location and a definite repeat. These guys try hard to please!	
May 1 2006	TripAdvisor Reviews Steered Me Right!	After reading Trip Advisor reviews regarding this property along with the affordable price, we decided to give this property a chance. It was the real deal and I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the property. I have traveled to NYC several times and this is the best property I have stayed at, especially considering the price. Ask for room 1200, it has a great view of the Chrysler building!	
Apr 26 2006	Loved the Iroquois!	We just returned from five days at the Iroquois. This was my first trip to NYC and could not have made a better choice of hotel. The location is excellent! Close to everything you would want to see or do. The staff is very friendly and so helpful. With only a little over 100 rooms you will appreciate the individual attention you receive and the relaxing atmosphere of this hotel. After a busy day in the city it was so nice to come back to such a pleasant environment. The rooms are beautiful! Very, very clean and well appointed. Large bathrooms with great water pressure. The bed was extremely comfortable and had nice linens. Turn down service was a plus and appreciated the daily weather report card they left along with delicious chocolates. Overall, you cannot go wrong staying here. It is definitely a luxury hotel. The Iroquois will definitely be my first choice of hotel on my next trip to NYC.	
Apr 11 2006	The Iroquois - Great Stay	My husband, two teenage children and two teenage newphews stayed here for five nights for spring break.We had a two room suite and adjoining superior room which woorked out perfectly for our group. The location was perfect, rooms were tastefully decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful.The beds were fantastic - we could hardly pull ourselves out of them each morning, not to mention trying to pull four teenagers out of them!We would definately stay here again.	
Apr 9 2006	Small clean calm lovely... the Iroquois	I have just returned from a quick visit to NYC. I found my stay at the Iroquois to be the highlight of my trip. The small, quaint size makes it a nice home while visiting bustling Manhattan. I was pleasantly surprised to find my room ready to check in at 11:00 a.m. after I had flown all night from L.A. The comfy beds and exceptional shower were just what I needed to recharge. Although small, the room was so comfortable that I overslept and missed some prime sightseeing time. The next day I got smart and used the wake up service. The location made it perfect for theatre goers like me. The Iroquois rooms were immaculate and the service was very accomodating. The staff was very helpful when I needed to store my luggage on my last day since I had a late flight back to California.	
Mar 8 2006	Perfect for visit	My husband and I spent Saturday and Sunday night at the Iroquois. I had stayed once there before with a friend and decided then that I could stop trying different hotels in NYC. The staff are friendly, helpful and accomodating. The room (we had a king executive this time) was large, clean and comfortable. We really don't spend much time in the hotel room, but you do have to sleep and clean up there, and the facilities were fantastic. The linens and bed are great, and the bathroom was large, spotless, well-lighted and had plenty of towels, hot water and water pressure. We were given a bottle of wine and chocolates, which were delicious, and it was nice to find a fresh bottle of Perrier when we arrived back in the evening. We had breakfast at Triomphe, and it was delicious with prompt and attentive service, and delicious food. The location can't be beat. We will definitely stay there next trip.	
Feb 23 2006 	Our New York City favorite	Our recent stay at the Iroquois was a delightful experience of elegantly decorated rooms, wonderfully friendly staff and an especially warm hospitality. The hotel General manager Mr Paul Celnik is always on hand for his excellent personal touch and attention to detail. This hotel will be our New York City home for years to come.	
Feb 21 2006	Perfect Selection-Met all Expectations.	This was a three day (Fri-Sat-Sun) trip to NYC for my 10 year old daughter and me. Her first trip to NYC and I wanted it to be special, since it would be a memory of a lifetime for her. First task: Pick a hotel.First, we saw the Iroquois featured on a TV travel show and I made a note of it. Second, I used the TripAdvisor Reviews extensively to check out independent reports of the several hotels I was considering. One criteria was for a small, luxury type hotel ( 4-star minimum) that would not overwhelm my daughter but provide comfort, class, service, relative safety and great location. In this regard the Iroqouis met my expectations.I expected smaller rooms per the reviews I read and was not surprised. Even with a double bed room, the room was &quot;small&quot; by some standards. Same goes for the bath; but it was marble and spotlessly clean with very high quality towels and robes.The beds were fantastic. The bed linens and comforter were first quality. We slept well.A note about room location: Many first timers to NYC want rooms overlooking the city. From experience I knew that an &quot;inside&quot; room is generally preferrable for noise considerations. I also booked the room from the hotel's website and took advantage of an off-rate program for the time of year I was visiting. So, room location was what I expected. We got room 1108. Yes, another Review writer (who had room 1107 )commented on a noisy &quot;compressor&quot; (actually a fan) audible from the room. I heard it also, but my take on such things is different: As long as something like that is not overwhelming and is classified as &quot;white noise&quot; I find it can be a benefit for sleeping.The TV is a top notch flat screen plasma unit. High definition channels come alive. BUT, there were some stations listed on the channel card that were not available. And that list was somewhat limited to begin with. This actually was not a big deal, because we were not hanging around the room anyway and late night arrivals meant we promptly went to bed.The closet space was very limited but ingeniuosly fitted into the room. A room safe was provided.We noted the snack and drink bar unit but I instructed my daughter not to touch it due to the high prices that normally accompany them.The free bottle of Perrier was nice.Staff was great and helpful. Even the desk clerk hailed a cab for me when the bell staff was otherwise engaged. Concierge very nice and helpful.We only ate one breakfast in the hotel. It was good and not that high priced by NYC hotel standards. I wish we could have tried the Triomphe Restaurant for lunch or dinner but time did not permit. My impression from their menue is that they try to keep the meal prices within a somewhat affordable range at least as hotels go. (For budget friendly eats, go a few steps west in the same block to the Red Flame.)The best thing about the Iroquois,aside from the great way they treated my little girl, is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! Can't beat it in midtown.Now, if that bathroom was just a bit bigger......!	
Jan 19 2006	great time	My stay at the Iroquois hotel was wonderful the staff was outrageous. We ate at the restaurant at the hotel the food was superb and the attention of wait staff was excellent. The hotel is small so they cater to their guests. The Iroquois hotel is centrally located to get to broadway shows and museums.The rooms are beautifully decorated with flat screen televisions and cozy linens on the beds.So all in all I recommend this hotel with at least a 5 star rating.	
Jan 17 2006	Excellent Boutique Hotel Convenient to Sights	One of the Christmas gifts to my family was a weekend in New York. Co-workers, fed up with the snobby Sofitel, had been staying at the Iroquois and gave it rave reviews. I am typically a Marriott points junky, so I have been staying at the Courtyard on 41st for business, but am frankly fed up with the crowds, waits for elevators, no restaurant/bar, and weak service that Marriott provides. For this trip in early January, no convenient Marriotts were available, so I decided to look into the Iroquois. I did my research on the web. They had a very user friendly site, and I reserved a suite or two rooms that adjoined since we were traveling with a 7 year old and a 9 year old. I immediately got an email response confirming our reservation with all the detail required. We walked from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden (since we took the train into the city from Trenton) and got to see a little of Times Square on our way to the hotel. We arrived very early in the morning so I did not expect our rooms to be ready, and they weren't. A very professional and apologetic staff member told us exactly when to come back and introduced us to the concierge and the bellman to store our bags. The concierge was extremely helpful and provided maps and directions. I had done a lot of planning in advance so had already made some reservation. We took the concierge's advice on 5th Avenue, the SONY museum (free) and a carriage ride through central park. We also took her advice the next day on the Museum of Natural History and the Hayden Planetarium which were both great. They had fresh coffee in the morning in the lobby. The rooms were very nice. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and everything was clean. There is a mini bar (careful, has motion detectors, need to watch small kids)and the hotel leaves a small box of chocolates and small bottle of red wine to welcome you - a nice touch. The rooms were nice sized for NY and the bathrooms looked like they were recently redone and had marble tile. For two nice rooms at less than $500 total for both rooms per night, it was definitely worth it. The best part was that it was a small hotel, so no waiting hours for an elevator, the staff was very friendly, and you could walk anywhere - Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Central Park - yet it was quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends who are looking for a nice boutique hotel. I heard the bar is great (we didn't go we were with kids) and we did not get a chance to try the restaurant either - maybe next time.	
Jan 17 2006	The best small hotel in New York	For many years, we stayed at the Mayfair Hotel on 65th and Park, it was once a Regent, then it was an Italian chain, and it had Le Cirque, but mostly it was a very personal luxury hotel. After it turned into a condo or something, we tried many hotels, the St. Regis (too big and snobby), the Helmsley Palace (too big and impersonal), Gaansevort (very nice but lousy restaurant and crowd is young, Regency (nice but pretentious) until we found the Iroquois. First of all, the street is great, with clubs, restaurants and other neat hotels. Secondly, the convenience to the theatre district, Grand Central, Fifth avenue shopping and general mid town. Secondly, the rooms are absolutely beautiful, very Ralph Lauren look, with English traditional furnishings and very comfortable. The staff is great and the bar is the place in the area, and with a small restaurant that is as good as anyplace in the midtown area. Internet connections are free, they have a library, a gym, the best breakfast in Manhattan in a special room, they get all your messages, they have a theatre concierge where the best tickets are yours, and then the great bar and restaurant. We had an occasion to meet the manager and he remembers every thing you need and overall, we would stay no where else when we go to New York.	
Jan 15 2006	Our new home in New York!	Celebrated our 25th anniversary in New York and after reading reviews of all the hotels, chose the Iroquois because of location and we did not want a large chain hotel. The Iroquois exceeded our expectations! From the moment we checked in, we were pleased with the service and although our room was small (which we expected) it was so comfortable with a wonderful bed made up with fine linens. The bathroom was sparkling clean and had the plushest towels! We can't wait to go back to New York and the Iroquois!	
Dec 29 2005	An excellent choice	We had a great stay at the Iroquois Christmas week. Let's get the negatives over with first. Yes, the rooms and bathrooms are small by US standards but by New York City standards the room size was fine. There is no view but unless your 30 stories up, you'll have to put up with lots of NY street noise. Give me a quiet no view room any time. Now the good stuff. Reservations were simple, convenient, accurate, and pleasant. The staff was efficient if not absolutely perfect (one of our rooms was passed over for housekeeping but quickly fixed when we notified the desk). The sheets, towels, robes better than any other first class hotel I've stayed in. HD plasma with DVD player. Excellent ac/heating; comfortable, quiet, even. Rooms were well kept; no carpet stains, water leaks, etc. Free Perrier each day. Excellent location for theatre, shopping, MoMA. Two very big thumbs up on this one.	
Oct 12 2005	Would not stay again	My husband and I stayed here for our 6th wedding anniversay -- we booked a Deluxe King - which was very small and extremely hot! No screens in the window - so you can't open them without getting more than fresh air in -- we repeatedly asked the front desk staff to ensure our room was made cooler -- and the response every time was that it &quot;would be taken care of immediately&quot; -- it never was -- though after spending 3 nites sweating and complaining -- the morning of our checkout they asked if they could send an electrician up...big help!We ate breakfast - once at the Hotel restaurant - we asked for additional piece of toast which we were charged $9.00 for and if we had gotten green tea instead of regular tea with our breakfast they would have charged us $6.00 for the tea bag!On either side of the Hotel is the Alogonquin and the Sofitel Hotel -- both of which always had a bellman stationed outside to assist with cabs -- more often than not the Iroqois you you getting your own cab -- no bellman outside. Extremely short staffed hotel.They gave us wrong directions - bad advise -- the conceirge - instead of helping us find restaurants handed us a Zagat survey to fend for ourselves -This Hotel surprisingly is a member of the SLH (Small Luxury Hotels) -- it should be a member of the SNLH (Small NON Luxury Hotels).	
Sep 7 2005	Would stay here again and recommend	Our experience at the Iroquois was a positive one. We were only in town for one night (9/2) to visit a relative and see a show, so our interaction with the staff was limited. We did arrive early, however, and they were very friendly. We were offered a room immediately, but were forewarned that it was on a smoking floor. We passed on the offer, checked our bag, and came back a few hours later to a great room. It wasn't huge, and it didn't have a view (fire escape/alley), but it was clean and quiet (we have four-year old twins so silence is a valuable commodity!) and the bed felt sumptuous. The bathroom was clean and the robe kicked you-know-what. Yes, the elevator is small, but it got me to where I needed to go. And the staff at the front desk gave us the heads up on which elevator was fastest, so that was cool.Only complaint: our room was FREEZING. I guess I could have complained, but I adjusted the thermostat per the instructions provided and dove under that huge comforter instead.	
Aug 29 2005	Iroquois	Stayed in the Iroquois in mid August. The location is perfect! The rooms were nice, the beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom had a great shower. The room was small (normal for NYC) and when I asked for something high with a view the girl at the desk just looked at me. I was given a room on the second floor looking onto a fire escape. There isnt much of a lobby, so we spent all our spare time at the Algonquin lobby (fantastic) a couple of doors down. Having stayed at both the Algonquin and Iroquois, I will go back to the Algonquin.	
Aug 8 2005	Loved it!!!	I stayed at the Iroquios hotel during a business conference July 25-27, 2005 in a standard queen size room. I had read the reviews from this site regarding the rooms because my biggest concerns are cleanliness and space. I am willing to pay the extra money to have clean sheets, minus the bugs! Anyway, the rooms were clean, no bugs, and spacious. I would definitely stay there again, without a doubt. The price was reasonable as well to be in midtown area ($275.06 per night). Please view the pictures I have attached.	
Aug 4 2005	Jewel of a hotel	Stayed at this hotel as part of a weekend cyberpackage by Northwest Airlines. The staff at the Iroquois worked exceptionally hard to please--from the bellman to the concierge to the front desk staff. As a member of the Small Luxury Hotels' club, I was upgraded to a view room; they were very nice when I asked to be moved to the back of the hotel instead (no view, but very quiet). They delivered wine and fruit to our room with a note congratulating us on our anniversary. The concierge gave us great resto suggestions. The bellman got us a car service (cheaper than a cab) to Newark airport.

Aug 1 2005	The Iroquois Hotel - July 26-29 2005	The location is perfect - Two blocks from Times Square and two blocks from Grand Central. It is within walking distance to many tourist attractions, great restaurants and Subway stations. However, the room was small (I reserved an Excutive King) with not a whole lot of room for storing luggage and other personal items (but more than likely you will not be in the room very much). Even though the room was small, it was very nice. Good linens and a nice bathroom with nice decor/furnishings. I called to confirm my reservation about two weeks prior to arrival. I informed the rep that the trip would be my first wedding anniversary and my wife's first trip to New York (in hopes that we would have a good room). Like I said earlier, the room was small - which was okay - but the view was of the central air unit (there was a large pool of water outside of one of the windows which constantly bubbled and made loud noises). I requested to be moved to another room, but there no other rooms available. That was the only downside of the trip. If you have the option, request not to stay in room 210!! The staff was very friendly and approachable. By then end of the week, some of the staff knew our names. I would definately stay again - in a different room.	
Jul 7 2005	The Iroquois is awful	I went to the Iroquois with anticipation since it had a very appealing website and was touting itself as a luxury hotel and was unpleasantly surprised to find that the hotel was extremely short-staffed, resulting in a situation where one's requests were handled rudely. The room I stayed in, billed as an executive king room, was very small, very dimly lit and depressing. They claim to have 24 hour room service which they dont. They do not have a telephone operator or direct access to the services, everything being routed to the front desk, which could not really process these requests being tied down to answering phones all day.All in all I found the Iroquois a ghastly experience	
Jun 7 2005	A nice part of the apple	We really enjoyed our stay at the Iroquois. This was our first stay in a Manhattan hotel and we were looking for a smaller non-chain hotel to get a real experience of New York. This hotel was just as we expected with no unpleasent surprises. We never felt crowded and the staff was very helpful and courteous. We stayed on the 11th floor. Our deluxe room had a king bed that was plush comfort. The bathroom was exquisite with the smooth marble tile throughout. The water pressure and temperature of the shower were excellant and there were oatmeal soaps that we both liked. The robes were a nice thick heavy cotton that made a nice finish to your shower. The minibar was clearly marked with terms and prices. They had a computer near the lobby that we could use to look things up, and they stored our luggage after check out when we had a couple of hours to kill. This building like others of its age has a central air conditioning unit. Our only complaint we could have would be the room temperature was difficult to control, but it was never really uncomfortable. Another big plus is this hotel is centrally located so you can walk to Grand Central Station, Times Square, theaters and tour buses. It is a nice part of the apple.	
Jun 6 2005	Great Service	My stay was outstanding. I had requested a room with a view of the Chrysler building and even though they couldn't promise anything, they got it done. I ran out of toothpaste and they delivered a new tube. In the evening, I requested a table at Triomphe, and the concierge made it happen by reserving a corner table by the door in the bar -- a really nice spot. It was raining when we left for the theater and they gave us umbrellas. Tremendous service. I won't hesitate to stay there again -- hopefully soon.	
May 23 2005	Adored the Iroquois	Oustanding service. Wonderful modern rooms. Extrmely courteous staff.	
May 7 2005	Luxuriously comfortable	We stayed in the Iroquois for 2 nights even though the rooms were small the beds were luxuriously comfortable.It was convenient to Times Square,Broadway and fifth ave.and on a quiet street.	
Mar 30 2005 	A good 4 star	Staff excellent, rooms quiet, location good for broadway visits-a good value for the price, cannot really adjust temp in room-building has one tempa nice, tourist hotel-molton brown toiletries are a nice touch-typical small old building new york hotel; good that had computer in little library for guests internet use for free	
Mar 17 2005	Two thumbs up	My husband and I stayed in the executive suite with our daughter and niece in October 2004. The hotel itself was nice and there was an adequate gym with a sauna that we were pleased with. Our room was quite large, with a decent sized living room and queen hide-a-bed for the girls. The only thing I'd change about the suite layout would be to have the bathroom located between the living and bedroom. As it stands, if one of the girls had to make a trip in the middle of the night, they had to trek through our bedroom.Everything was very clean and the room was well appointed. Minibar and extra costs are clearly marked so you don't get any surprises come checkout time. The highspeed internet worked well, which isn't always the case in NYC hotels.The location is fabulous! You're just a few blocks from Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Fifth Avenue stores and just about anything Midtown has to offer.All in all, a nice little hotel and probably worth the $600 a night we paid for our suite.	
Mar 1 2005	The Best Hotel Experience I have Ever Had!!!	The Iriquois Hotel is full of wonderful caring people, beautifully appointed rooms, delightful amenties, and little &quot;spoil me&quot; surprises that have made me a loyal fan for life. I simply will not stay anywhere else in Manhattan ever again unless I have to!!!I was so impressed with the friendly helpfulness of the staff (they even remembered my name!), the &quot;surprises&quot; on my pillow at night, the gratis shoe shine for my morning meeting, a comfortable, well-lit room and fast computer to get my e-mail, a sumptuous bed that even eliminated my usual nightly leg pain, a gorgeous room with a marble bathroom, lovely bathrobe, hair dryer and toiletries, beautiful wood furnishings, down and feathers, immaculatly clean and even a refrigerator, stocked with lots of my favorites!!! Yes, you pay for those, but after a long meeting, it was a nice little treat!!I arrived to a warm, comfortable, stunningly appointed room, and just loved the quiet and comfort. So much so, I spent as much time as I could there, morning meditation, pre-dinner bath and evening reading, and of course, the news on the TV in the armoire.And don't let me forget the great restaurant as well. I took time to tell the manager I was so pleased and pleasantly surprised at my &quot;find&quot;. He was so gracious and pleased he invited me to speak with the owner. Now tell me, when do you ever get the CEO and Chairman of the Board on the phone?? It is truly understandable, after speaking with them, why this Hotel has everything going for it. No wonder the staff is so loyal and happy in their work.Stay here, you will love it... it is worth every cent, has the highest rating on Orbitz, and don't even think twice next time about where to stay... I told everyone I know about this Hotel, and know they will kiss me on both cheeks if they take my advise and stay... do it, and have fun!!!	
Feb 22 2005 	A perfect hideaway in midtown...	I stayed at the Iroquois while I was in NYC on business about 3 weeks ago (late January '05). Everything was perfect. The rooms are small but perfect for one person traveling alone on business. (Reminder: 99% of hotels in NYC have very small rooms.) My flight arrived at 8:30 AM so I was at the hotel shortly by 9:30 AM and just wanted to check my bag with them but they had a room ready for me so I was able to freshen up before my meetings. I had a room on the 6th floor (600) that faced a little courtyard which was quite nice as the hotel is not tall. About 10 minutes after arriving, they called the room to make sure that everything was satisfactory. The bed was amazing, like sleeping on a giant pillow. Wonderul linens and down pillows with big duvet. The bathroom was great with Molten Brown toiletries and a showerhead with unbelieveable water pressure. I was concerned about the handle on the shower because it felt like it was loose so I told them at the front desk when I left to go to dinner around 7 PM, when I returned 3 hours later it had been fixed. The room had a COMPLIMENTARY liter bottle of SmartWater on the desk when I arrived! Nobody offers free anything anymore. The hotel also had complimentary overnight shoeshine service which was quite nice. The Iroqois offers a nice [big] continetal breakfast in your room for $11.95, a steal in NYC. I was on business and paid $260 per night, including tax. That is a steal for 4-stars in midtown during the week. I booked directly from their website, not through a broker. Trust me, you always get treated better when you book directly. This was a superior New York hotel experience!	
Feb 13 2005 	VERY Small Luxury Hotel	I recently spent a total of 7 nights at The Iroquois Hotel. Even the &quot;luxury&quot; rooms are VERY small. Carpets and upholstery spotted, furniture not in the best condition...disappointing and certainly NOT for a standard for a member of the &quot;Small Luxury Hotels&quot; group. Reservations department refused to make good on a Guest Referal Program they &quot;offer&quot;. Good, attentive staff at the hotel bar. There are lots of better places to stay in New York.	
Feb 1 2005	Unparalleled experience at the Iroquois	I recently hosted a 95th Birthday party for my grandfather at the Iroquois and its fantastic restaurant Triomphe. Our guests literally ranged from 3 to 95 years old, and the hotel was a great fit for all. The staff were totally accomodating about everything we needed and the many extra touches only enhanced our experience. From the junior Frette robes for my little nieces to the complimentary bottles of wine for the more mature guests, they provided all the necessities for a memorable family weekend. And the comfortableness of the beds at the Iroquois will now be a recurring topic of conversation among my family! And the dinner far exceeded our expectations! The food is outstanding, and truly stands out in a city known for great restaurants. All the guests were surprised by just how good the meal was. My family (a food loving one!) will be talking about the apple caramel bread pudding for some time... but only after it's done talking about the scallops appetizer with foie gras and porcini mushrooms. And I'd confidently put the filet mignon up against any I've ever had. Each bite was a distinct enjoyment.  My family comes to NY quite a bit, and I know they'll always first consider the Iroquois when looking for a hotel. Most importantly, my grandfather loved it all. He stayed there Saturday as well (even though he lives on the Upper Eastside). As a lifelong New Yorker who has experienced it all in this city (including storied business lunches at the Algonquin), Pop had never heard of the Iroquois or Triomphe. But since then, he's been raving about both and smiles widely when talking about the weekend. He keeps saying, &quot;We have to go back to Triomphe for dinner!&quot; For the convenience offered, the comfort of the rooms, the attentive staff, the amazing food, the luxurious but homey decor, the excellent value... you will not find a better hotel in NY City.	
Jan 25 2005	Not great for the money	We stayed at the Iroquois for a week in July. Great location, but small room and a view of a brick wall 5 feet away - don't be fooled by their web site pictures showing a great view. The staff were great at check-in, and they were very helpful with restaurant recommendations. Biggest complaint was the Do Not Disturb sign. Apparently we triggered the electronic sign somehow, but it was never noticeable to us when leaving or entering the room. So for the final 2 1/2 days of our stay the room was never made up. We ignored it the first day and figured that we must have been in the room when they came to make it up. The second day we didn't get back to the room until late, after the shows, and found that all towels were still wet and nothing was cleaned. We called the front desk, where they told us that our Do Not Disturb sign was on. I looked and looked and couldn't figure out where it was. Anyway, they said it was too late to get us any clean towels - couldn't they have taken some from a vacant room? Overall disappointed for the money we spent.	
Jan 5 2005	Wonderful little hotel	We spent a week at the Iroquois over Christmas and New Years and thoroughly enjoyed it. Rooms are comfortable (and larger than similarly priced ones at the Royalton or Millenium Broadway in the same area). Also, being a small, older building, it has elegant touches such as marble baths, high ceilings, etc. We were also pleased with the comfort level--plenty of hot water anytime, thick towels, bathrobes in the room, etc.There is also a fitness room with finnish sauna on the third floor, which we LOVED. Staff were friendly and helpful without fawning. Location can't be beat--we walked everywhere except one day spent at uptown museums, but the subway is 2 blocks away, and several bus lines run up and down 6th and 7th aves.We would definitely return to the Iroquois!	
Nov 23 2004	Second Time Was Different	This was our second visit to the Iroquois and it was an entirely different experience. We were regulars at the Algonquin but got tired of the problematic heating and AC and the fact that some rooms (and suites) are dogs for the money -- notwithstanding the old hotel's historical charms. Friends had tried the nearby Iroquois so we gave it a try in 2003 and really loved it. We had an east facing room with a wonderful view of the Chrysler Buildling at night.We just returned (November 2004) and the second visit was a totally different experience. The room we were given (1107) was below a compressor that roared all the time. I wear a hearing aid but could hear the hum of the machine even with the aid off. We asked for a room change but was told the hotel was full but a change might be accommodated the next day. They did move us the next morning and the rest of our stay was more-or-less fine -- a pipe broke and there was no hot water early Friday evening, and one of the two small elevators also stopped working and this created long waits trying to get out or back to our room in the company of other irritated patrons.The Iroquois (like the Algonquin) is an old building with limited capability to provide the amenities of more modern hotels.I don't know if we will go back or spend the extra $100 a night for a large room with working facilities.	
Nov 18 2004	Lovely Hotel - Superb location	We had a wonderful stay at the Iroquois for 4 nights at the beginning of November. The hotel is clean and well decorated throughout, with very pleasant and helpful staff. Superb location - on west 44th Street between 5th &amp; 6th Avenue next to the Sofitel and Algonquin hotels. A 3 minute walk takes you to the heart of Times Square or 5th Avenue, with many other sites within easy walking distance. The rooms were a little on the small side (but I understand most in New York are) but the bed was so comfortable and the marble bathroom equipped with Molton Brown toiletries - it was a pleasure to come back from a day's shopping/site seeing for a soak or just to relax. We didn't eat in the restaurant but it also looked very nice. (There is a diner just a couple of doors away that has an excellent menu, especially for breakfast).I would definitely stay here again on my next trip and would recommend it to everybody!	
Sep 12 2004	My *favorite* NYC hotel	A superb location on 44th Street midway between Grand Central Station &amp; Times Square, next door to the Alconquin; better-than-average furnishings in soothing tones, Frette linens, heavy terrycloth bathrobes; rooms have a CD player/clock radio &amp; a desk with adequate work space &amp; lighting -- and you can open the windows, a plus in my book; an excellent fitness room &amp; sauna; and a fine staff which is professional, attentive &amp; courteous, but not obsequious.I have stayed in every type of room offered here. Yes, the non-suite guestrooms are cozy by out-of-towner standards [averaging 250-275 square feet], but this is Manhattan. You can pay much more for even less space, comfort, and service elsewhere, e.g., the W hotels. Indeed, one can often book a suite at the Iroquois -- with a not-at-all-cramped living room doored off from the graciously-sized bedroom &amp; a bath which includes both a soaking tub and separate, walk-in shower -- for less than a standard room at many better known hotels. Plus, all the rooms at the Iroquois have marble baths [combined tub/shower in non-suite rooms] and are well sound-proofed; I have never heard noise from the rooms around me or the hallways. If you are a very light sleeper, however, you don't want a room which faces onto 44th Street.The Iroquois was first suggested to me several years by the folks at Express Reservations (a great booking service by the way) as being especially appropriate for a businesswoman traveling alone. They were right; I've always felt secure &amp; well cared for there, even at the bar where a solo woman will feel quite comfortable &amp; enjoy having an after-theatre nightcap. And it's been a wonderful place for weekend visits with friends from out of town.In short, I recommend it highly.	
Aug 17 2004	Not worth what they charge	Small room &amp; bathroom.They only had limited internet ready room when I stayed in June. Check-in takes forever, even when it was not busy. Elevactors took forever, and like a coffin. Definately not worth over $200 they charge for what they provide. Location is great but there are other hotels that are more competitively priced and you get what you pay for. I like Sofitel next door.	
Jul 10 2004	Terrific Hotel	I had an enjoyable 2-night stay at the Iroquois. The room was beautifully appointed and included many creature comforts. Like the extra soft linens, luxurious terry robe, Belgian chocolates, CD player, cable TV including HBO, free high speed internet and NY Times. The lively central location was so accessible to everything New York, that I walked everywhere, at all hours. The lovely new marble bathroom and hot shower was always a welcome nearby respite. As well as a hotel laptop and printer that was available in the hotel library. I repeatedly used it for quick email or tourist info.	
Jun 28 2004	Hated it!	Staff was mediocre. The rates I reserved was not the same when we checked out.	
Apr 12 2004	Tiny room but lovely bathroom	We stayed here April 7-11, 2004. Overall, the hotel was fine. The bedroom was very small and cramped, but the bathroom was huge by NY standards. The floor to ceiling marble was lovely. Everything was very clean, and the beds were very comfortable. Besides the room being small, my only other complaint would be the temperature. It was centrally controlled so we couldn't do anything with the heat. Opening the window didn't really help; we were still very hot. However, the small touches provided by the hotel and its staff were nice (i.e., complimentary bottles of wine and water).	
Apr 9 2004	The staff helped me survive the Blackout of 2003	I had the misfortune of vising NYC during the Blackout of 2003. Within fifteen minutes of checking into the hotel, the power outage occured. The staff couldn't have been more considerate, understanding, and helpful. The manager/owner pulled his car up outside the front door and played his radio so that we could find out what was going on. As it got dark, they provided us with fresh fruit and drinks. Our only light source was from the car parked on the sidewalk (again the managers car), shining it's headlights into the darkened lobby. With bedtime approaching, the bellhops and staff helped everyone to their rooms with the few candles and flashlights available. They were very patient with even the grumpiest of guests. The staff remained calm, cool and collected throughout the entire ordeal and remained so after things returned to normal. Many of the larger hotels actually turned their guests out during the ordeal and I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't stayed at the Iroquois. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Feb 23 2004	Iroquois only so-so	The room was VERY small and our hotel window looked into neighboring buildings. Location was OK, but I feel, everything considered, that there are better values elsewhere.	
Jan 19 2004	Good Experience	Stayed in Aug., 2003. Everything was as good, or better, than expected. Would recommend to others and stay there again. Excellent location (44th Street is relatively quiet and close to theatre district - but not too close) Courteous &amp; friendly staff.	
Jan 16 2004	Great Location	We stayed over X-mas in 2003. I will confirm that the rooms were tiny but they were very clean. The service was good but we paid a little more than we would usually on tips etc... based on a previous a review.We had a little child and they did their best to accommodate us in a boutique-style hotel. Overall no major complaints. A great place for a weekend getaway for a couple (if you get a deal &lt;$250/night).The hotel is situated and there is corner store close by with fresh fruit etc....walking distcance to Rockfellar and Times Square was a bonus.	
Dec 27 2003	Enjoyed our Stay	We enjoyed our stay very much. They always have their guests in mind and found the concierge very helpful.	
Dec 8 2003	Iroquois a disappointment-tiny room and rude staff	Our room was tiny for the price we paid. We have stayed in many other hotels in NYC for less money and have had much more space. We had one small roller suitcase which we didn't need help with, but the bellhop was determined to help us, and then when we gave him a $2 tip, we heard him mutter under his breath (but so we could hear),&quot;two dollars!&quot; in a disgusted voice. That set the tone for our stay very nicely. Nice bathroom (it was about half the size of the bedroom). Overall, you can definitely get better value elsewhere. We wouldn't stay there again.	
Dec 6 2003	Possiblt New Yorks worst!!!!	THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED AT. No one had a clue what was going on. The rooms are extremely small and very noisy!!!!!!!!!!
