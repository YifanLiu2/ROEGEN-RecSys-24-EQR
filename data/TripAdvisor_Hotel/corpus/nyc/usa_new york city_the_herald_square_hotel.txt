	Excellent location everything else was so-so	We stayed there for 7 nights - in 2 different rooms. Both rooms were noisy in the morning and you can hear people talking loudly and slamming doors. The second room we had was just next to the rooms where they were renovating which may explain the noise - not sure about the first room. The staff were mostly ok except for this grumpy lady in her 30s who was awfully unhelpful. They provide lockers at $2 per usage if you need to leave your bags at the hotel after check-out. The first room we had was very small but the second was slightly bigger and newer. The selling point for this hotel is its location at 31st &amp; Broadway which is 2min walk from Macy's and 1min walk from the subway which is just 1 stop from Times Square. Me and my wife were there on Thanksgiving and we could catch the parade literally just around the corner. Yes, if you need a cab, get one off the street for one yourself, as the reception charges a ridiculous price. Room comes with free Wi-Fi internet access and LCD tv with HD channels.	
Nov 20 2009 	Superb location. Great for the price!	I have stayed at this hotel twice.It is absolutely clean. The beds are of high standard.Modern wallmounted LCD tv &amp; nice furniture in rooms.Only thing to be ware of!Dont ask the reception to call a cab for you, if you ei, have an early morning flight!They have an arrangement with some &quot;private&quot; cabdriver, whoom charges overprices. No taximeter or nothing!So. Ask for a YELLOW cab!Have a nice stay :-)Mike :-)	
Nov 12 2009 	our brillant visit to nyc	fantastic location at a very good affordable price. It wasnt the ritz but cleaned room every day on suite heated floors in renovated rooms was brill. Coffee machine in reception only had selected times which was a pain as after a long day you want a hot drink in your room. Empire state building was a stones throw away.. Definatley would stay here again fantastic budget hotel.	
Oct 30 2009 	great little hotel	we arrived to this hotel from 10 days in a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom lovely villa in florida so my children were very disappointed when they saw the room especially when they realized it wasnt the room they had seen on the website! we have been to ny before so knew what to expect. the room was a little oldfasioned,bathroom was tiny,wardrobe was tiny t.v was on top of wardrobe!thats the negatives ,the pluses outweighed them! room was very clean,cleaned and new towels every day.bathroom clean,had no problem with shower. plenty of channels on tv for kids. staff were very very friendly and helpful,receptionist in morning was great,drew us little maps and diagrams each morning. have to give a special mention to AZIZ so helpful! gave the kids sweets,helped with our luggage and when we said we needed a taxi to airport helped us with that-we ended up in a lovely car at a great price! thanks aziz,you are a great asset to this hotel!hotel is close to everthing,especially important to us as we had 2 11 year olds with us. a couple of mornings we got breakfast sandwiches from wendys(on the corner to the left) got our free drinks from downstairs and gave the kids a relaxing breakfast in the room.(great for the budget!). after being ripped off for a couple of meals out we found a great cheap place to eat.when you come out of the hotel turn left,at the wendys turn left onto 5th,then walk up. inbetween the burgerking and starbucks is a little place called miau. they serve mexican,we had starters (nachos,cheese etc.)meal each,beers and soft drinks(free refills) for 4 of us and it was $47. what a bargain,staff were lovely aswell.we have stayed in ny before in budget and expensive hotels and found this hotel was probably the best for location/value. free safe in room was a bonus,as mentioned by others was very safe hotel. would recommend as a budget hotel.did all usual touristy things ,be aware if you want to go up close to statue of liberty or up the crown you need to book online before you go otherwise you can just walk around the gardens.	
Oct 28 2009 	lovely!	as a young traveler i wasn't too picky when i booked my hotels, i just wanted something cheap with no bed bugs, so i was blown away when i got to the herald square. it was so much more than i expected.the lobby was a bit tacky but my room was lovely, and clean! it was a bit small, but that was no issue for me.the bathroom was clean, and new!the location was incredible, i walked most places during my stay but when i needed to catch a train they were practically at my doorstep!the staff were really nice, too! i would really recommend this hotel!	
Oct 22 2009 	great hotel staff very good allways friendly very helpfull	We have stayed in this hotel 3 times central location good value staff very friendlywill stay there again We have told friends about it no frills very clean	
Oct 14 2009 	Clean and Cosy hotel with great location	My husband and I visited NYC in Sept 2009 and we came across this hotel via tripadvisor.com. Our cab driver had a hard time finding the hotel (he's a 3rd generation New yorker) and even joked that it might be a dodgy place. Our initial apprehension was put to rest the minute we stepped into the hotel. The staff was courteous and very friendly, entertaining my husband with chatter when he asked if the water was safe to drink from the tap (they say it is) and we felt very welcomed by them. A lot of emphasis was placed on safety - only 1 keycard was issued (can drop it off at the front desk if we're worried about losing it when we're out and about) and also the front door of the hotel has a security feature where by it locks automatically and would only open when one of the staffs presses a button from the office. The room also has a safe (albeit, kind of old - set the password and try it out first before you use it because it locks without having you set a password first!)The room and toilet was very clean, and had a pleasant smell (NO MOULD!) and the sheets were clean and comfy. The room was small, with just about enough room to move around the queen sized bed but when we chucked our bags on the floor we ran out of walking room. But checking out the website and the fire-escape floor plan, it seems that all the rooms differ in sizes so each room is unique. in short, i didnt get the room as featured in pictures on the website, but we were satisfied with the room nonetheless. Location wise, we were very close to 5th avenue (though 5th avenue is very long so you have to walk a bit along 5th ave to get to the shops) and a street away i think from the empire state building. what my husband and i really loved was that we were so close to the harold square station for the subway, and it was quick and easy for us to get about (less than 5min train ride to the natural history museum!). There were many subway lines going up and down town so it was a real convenience. There's a pharmacy across the street, a restaurant just downstairs and Koreatown just around the corner (The Korean restaurant behind 31st street called Mondoo is a ripoff!). Also, Macy's just about a block away, near the harold square subway entrance. If you intend to ship back your shopping, there's a post office right downstairs too, to the right of the hotel when you exit. It was raining a lot when we were there, so we called in some sandwiches (Speedy's) from brochures placed in the room ($1 per local call out!). Neighborhood wise, it's a street away from the quieter areas so if you're the cautious sort it'll be good for you to pay attention. The street which the hotel is on is safe and busy in the day, and in the evenings you can walk over to the irish pub which is about a 5min walk.The only thing unsatisfactory during the trip was that they were doing carpentry work on a room on my floor - you can hear an electric saw ripping at 6am in the morning. It took me 26hrs to get to New York and I was suffering terrible jetlag so the noise was not appreciated. But overall, aside from that issue, we were very pleased with the hotel and we would most definitely stay there again if for some reason we have to go back to NYC.	
Oct 13 2009 	really good hotel in midtown	Stayed with my husband a week in the Herald square hotel in the beginning of september. At first we were offered a very small room, but when the staff realised we were staying a week they came with a bigger one. All very clean and quiet.positive: near a few metrostations, in a nice and central neighbourhood, quiet street, nice staff.negative: free coffee/ tea is nice, but why on certain times? We were allways to early or too late.To take a shower was really a challenge: it is difficult to get the temperature you like, allways too hot . So like an other reviewer suggested before: I mostly took a bath.But the price in relation to the quality is good, so I would certainly stay here again.	
Oct 13 2009 	VERY happy with this hotel	I've just returned from a nine day stay at the Herald Square Hotel with my two sons aged 16 and 12. I got a good price booking direct through the Hotel. After I had made my booking I was comparing other rooms and got a cheaper price on the same room, duration etc. I called the Hotel to ask about the difference in price and the person I spoke to told me &quot;prices are subject to change, if you see a cheaper price, cancel your original booking and re-book&quot;. I did this and saved AU$1000! On arrival in our room, which was a two double bed room I was thrilled, room was not &quot;tiny&quot; as everyone had assured me nearly all rooms in Manhattan were. We had a wall mounted flat screen tv, very decent sized bathroom with bath and INCREDIBLY comfortable beds. The room was very clean and although the hotel foyer, hallways etc weren't very impressive who cares?? You don't sleep in the hallways! We were on the ninth floor and as you looked out and up from the windows the Empire State Building was right there. Another great thing was the ability to open the windows!! I HATE air conditioning, so nice to sleep with fresh air coming in but when it did get a little warm we switched on our individual air-con. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful. A couple of days before we were due to check out I suddenly discovered I had no money left on my travel card because the Hotel had double charged me for our stay. I spoke to the Manager who handled the matter swiftly and professionally, calling his bank and mine and getting the money refunded. This was our first trip to the US and I couldn't have been happier with our Hotel, so nice to have somewhere clean and comfortable to go back to after walking the streets of this fantastic city all day! As many other people have said you also can't beat the location, close to all the action, Penn Station, Empire State, Times Square, Macy's etc but very little noise (save for the ever-present car horns!) so sleeping was comfortable.	
Oct 10 2009 	value for your money	I was in the city to spend some time with my daughter who was staying with friends. Transportation is all nearby, the rooms are peaceful; no noise in hallway. You get to really rest at the end of your day. There are restaurants very close by where you can acces meals at any time. If you need to get something washed, you can do it yourself quickly in the well appointed laundry room. To use a common expression &quot;you get the most bang for your bucks&quot; at the Herald Square.	
Oct 9 2009 	The best return visit ever.	This hotel is awesome! Even after our previous stay we are still impressed anew. We have never had a better stay in a New York Hotel. From the magnificent entryway, with that cute cherub over the door, to the art gallery on the walls everything demonstrated a care to detail that can not be beat. And the rooms, absolutely magnificent! The bathrooms are outfitted in period hardware, and they are immaculate. The beds are the most comfortable we have ever found in a hotel anywhere. To top it all off the staff are responsive, cooperative, and helpful. In many instances they anticipated out needs before we even expressed them. And all this for an incredibly reasonable price. We booked directly, found it over the web, read some reviews on the internet relied on the recommendation of friends who were spot on about this place. On top of all that the location is perfect for exploring and finding your way around the city We will definitely stay there again and again when we visit New York.	
Oct 9 2009 	The easiest hotel I have ever stayed in.	I have been to many hotels and this was the easiest to get around. It is close to everywhere. The rooms where great and the service was fantastic.I loved how I could walk to Broadway and many restaurants.	
Oct 9 2009 	very good value	I really liked this hotel. The room was lovely, and the bathroom was huge for a NYC hotel room bathroom! Bigger than my bathroom at home. The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel itself was very quiet, although there was a construction site nearby that started clanking away at 7am. I thought the free coffee and hot chocolate was a nice touch, although I never took advantage of it. There are washers and dryers in the back of the first floor for those on longer stays. They also have storage lockers for your luggage after you check out, which was a little strange, as most hotels will hold your luggage for free until you're ready to actually leave.The only real complaint I had was at check-in. There were two people at reception, the woman was helping someone, so I went to the man's window. Well, he was apparently VERY busy flipping idly through the reservations, because he totally ignored me. When the woman finished up checking in the other people, she chirped &quot;I can help you here!&quot; I'm glad she was there, who knows how long I would've stood there before that guy lowered himself to actually do his job. Other than that bad first impression, the hotel was very nice and a great value for the money.	
Oct 8 2009 	New York on a budget	I stayed in this hotel for a week and it was a great experience. The hotel is located near everything: Times Square, Penn Station, Broadway, May's. It is easy to go from there to anywhere! The room was small but it had everything I needed and it was clean; the bed was comfortable (I did not miss my bed!). The service was very good and the staff were nice and friendly.Also, since I booked with many months in advance I got a great price!	
Oct 8 2009	Theater Trip to New York CIty	We stayed at the Herald Square Hotel, and it was VERY nice. The people were helpful, the room was clean and adequate, and the decor was beautiful. It was not far from the Theater District, and it was very reasonably priced. We saw Billy Elliot and Phantom of the Opera and they were superb. We had seen Phantom before, but we never tire of it, and we had seats directly under the chandelier. Billy Elliot was one of the best shows I have ever seen. Our seats were in the &quot;peanut gallery&quot;, but we could see everything just fine. The way the sets were done was quite intriguing. We saw Trent Kowalik as Billy, and he was an amazing dancer and actor, and the boy who played Michael (David Bologna?) was very cute and funny. We ate at the Metro Cafe, which has a wide variety of food and is very reasonably priced. We also visited Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. Although some of the figures were not very good likenesses, many of them were, and it was a lot of fun. We were intrigued by the chairs, tables and benches set up in the middle of Times Square. All in all we had a great time - it was just too short.	
Oct 3 2009 	Way overhyped; really not that great	We booked based on all the rave reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp. Our room was nothing like the photos on the website. It wasn't one of the renovated rooms and was really tired. We didn't have a flat screen TV; we had an old fashioned bulky 14&quot; TV. The bathroom was tiny and the bathtub was like something out of a horror film; it was discoloured and deeply marked in several places and there was a rubber matt glued in the tub covering up god only knows what. The bathtub was long overdue for replacement; it was disgusting. There was an extremely strong bleach smell in the bathroom when we checked in; at least they cleaned it. The worst part was their rule about one pass key card per room. We were three friends (which we stated when we reserved back in August) and we were forced to share one pass card for the entire 6 days. The stafff refused to let us have another pass card for our room so it was extremely inconvenient and a big hassle. By the way, we are responsible adults in our late 30's and 40's not partying teenagers. The manager and manageress were very rude about this matter. We were very disappointed with the dinginess of our tired room based on the images presented on their website. Also the free coffee was only available between 7 am and 10 am and then from 3 pm to 7 pm. So if you wanted to grab a coffee between 10 am and 12 pm, you were out of luck. Also it was out of order a few times during the times it was supposed to be available. In summarizing, a good location but the room was not nice and was noisy even with the wooden shutters. Bed was comfortable. Our room phone didn't work properly either and a friend in a nearby hotel was unable to contact us during our stay as calls could not be transferred to our room. It was like being back in the 1940s. It was just OK; wouldn't stay again, didn't really have any of the charm the website conjures up.	
Sep 29 2009 	Perfect for travellers looking for great value for money.	I'm writing this very belatedly, because I am amazed this hotel isn't rated more highly. After being completely shocked at the high prices for accommodation in NYC, a friend recommended TripAdvisor to me and I then spent a lot of time researching hotels in NYC. Coming from Australia, we had a lot of travelling to do, and needed to be mindful of what we spent on hotel rooms along the way. What I was looking for was &quot;clean&quot;, &quot;comfortable&quot;, &quot;safe&quot; and hopefully with rooms not the size of shoe boxes.We arrived into NYC late at night, and as I had booked the hotel on line at a great price (at the time, 3 years ago, US$99 for the room) I kept wondering if the hotel might be too good to be true. It wasn't. We loved our room (2 double beds), a small but adequate bathroom - with heaps of fluffy towels provided - and plenty of room for our luggage. It was great standing at our window at night just watching New Yorkers going about their lives.Each morning, my husband would go to a convenience store around the corner to buy yogurt, then fruit from a vendor on the corner and then bring back coffee from the lobby area for our breakfast. We made use of the free ice, and used the internet and the laundry in the building. We loved the quaint posters on the walls, and enjoyed the building's history. It's position in NYC was very central, but just a little way away from Times Square, which suited us.And Penn Station was just a few, easily walkable, blocks away.For those people who don't wish to stay in 5 or 4 star hotels (or whose budget doesn't allow it) you can't go past this hotel. For all you backpackers and holiday makers, check out this hotel's website, you might get a bargain like we did in 2006.	
Sep 29 2009 	Good hotel...Good location	Hotel is absolutely fine..Room was spacious, clean and quiet, even for the first floor..Staff were helpful and courteous..Fairly easy to walk east and west and used subway for north/south trips..Just one thing to be aware of...Room advertised at $249 per night..After adding the FOUR different taxes, that became $289 per night	
Sep 26 2009 	Very good budget hotel	We stayed four nights at this hotel. Our renewed room was very nice: excellent and beautifull bathroom; very confortable queen beb; free wi-fi; safety box; hairdryer; work desk; cable tv; everything clean and working properly. The coffee machine and chocolates at the lobby were very usefull. The negative points are of minimal importance, if any: there is no room service, but we never use that anyway in any hotel, so no problem for us. No minibar, but an ice machine at lobby. Small reception, but we didn't go to NYC to stay at a hotel reception. No restaurant, but a plenty of restaurants nearby.Of note: we stayed one night at the more expensive Sheraton, and our room at the Herald Square was much better than at that hotel.If you want luxury (and paying for that) look for other hotels, but if you look for a simple and nice hotel just to have a good sleep at night after a day full of activities, this is a really very good one.	
Sep 24 2009 	awesome beds monica and ayleena ..stars	Fantastic location right next to Empire State Building,easy access to whole of manhattan,1st room was a lil dissapointing ,lil tired looking but the bed was amazing ,spent 4 days here then 6 with family and last two days back at hotell,2nd room was fantastic totally refurbished ,amazing bed again,wonderful decor ,lovely towells,the two staff i dealt with were wonderful ,Monica and Ayleena ,try to get these girls if you can ,friendly ,accomadating and professional.all in all I would use this hotel again but I would make sure I book the new room which was awesome,slight noise from air con and outside but nothing to moan about,no view to speak of but hey I was in NY...hoping to be back next june /july ,thanks Herald Square for a lovely visit ..kisses J ,xxxx	
Sep 23 2009 	Superb location really clean and nice!	I stayed at this hotel 4 nights in September with my partner. I chose the hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor and I have to say that it was a great choice. The hotel is just off 5th Avenue, our room on 8th floor was clean and very cozy and all staff were helpful. We have booked about one month in advance and got excellent rate too. I really recommend!	
Sep 22 2009 	Comfortable basic great location!	I stayed at the Herald Square Hotel for 8 nights in September 2009. I was travelling alone and had a small room to myself with an en suite bathroom and a double bed. It is a basic hotel, but very comfortable and clean. My bed was very big and the bathroom was spotless. My view was terrible - an airshaft, but I was only there to sleep and shower so a view was not a priority to me. My room had a flatscreen TV with lots of channels including HBO. This was good for nights I was tired and wanted to stay in and also for checking the weather in the morning as my airshaft view gave me no clue! The staff were friendly, I had no problems with them. There was high speed internet available at $1 per 5 minutes which I used a couple of times without any problems. I was told by staff that there were hot drinks available in the lobby, but I never used this facility, but I often saw people sat in the seating area around the drinks machine. The location of the hotel was probably the best thing, right in the heart of midtown, a few blocks from the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens. Perfect if you need to pop back to drop off your shopping bags or get changed for dinner without wasting too much time. Also very near to a few subway stops, which I used often. If I had any complaints it would be that there seemed to be some building work going on in some rooms near me and a few mornings I heard loud banging and various other noises. This wasn't a major problem for me as I got up early most days, but some would find it irritating. Maybe check your room is not near any building if you feel this would bother you. Overall, I enjoyed my stay, it was expensive to me, worked out about £100 per night including tax, but I think for New York and for what you are getting (eg. comfy, clean, great location) that is a bargain!	
Sep 17 2009 	Central location simple rooms	We just returned from our NYC vacation. The Herald Square was a very practical and affordable option and well worth the money. It was a great location to the subway and Herald Square as well as a walkable distance to Times Square and the Theater District. The front desk staff was very friendly at check in and helpful. We had a queen room that was not one of the remodeled ones and it was clean and tastefully decorated. Our room was one the 4th floor and in the back so it was quiet. The room itself was not large but that was okay as we were not in New York for a leisurely hotel stay, but to explore this great city and simply have a nice place to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was small to say the least but it was clean. The shower also had good pressure which can sometimes be a trouble in older hotels.The only negative I would say is that we slept in one day and didn't want maid service and left a do not disturb card on the door. We came back after a long day of touring to find our room cleaned. It wasn't bad that it was cleaned but we had flown in late the night before and our stuff was everywhere so we just wanted to settle a bit before a cleaning. Plus, we don't like to waste water and energy by having our room cleaned everyday. I was slightly perturbed that the staff disregarded the do no disturb sign and cleaned anyway.Also, we enjoyed the complimentary coffee, tea, and chocolates in the lobby. Free Wi-fi as well which we used and really appreciated.	
Sep 11 2009 	Good price. No frills not even shampoo.	The lobby is scary - I felt like I had stepped into a hotel in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The hotel staff sits frighteningly behind glass, like at a cheap motel. The front desk staff was efficient, if a bit cold. They did answer any questions I had, but definitely, they work under the &quot;no frills&quot; policy also. The elevator is slow, though it works fine.I was on the fifth floor. Hallways are maybe 4' wide, but didn't mind - that's part of the NY charm. The room, which the woman at the front desk described as an &quot;upgrade&quot; was as bare bones as bare bones come. I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about when they describe wonderful rooms or granite countertops. The main room had 2 full size beds - which were great - VERY comfortable. Otherwise, basic old green carpet, and an old laminate shelf ran along the other wall holding the TV. No alarm clock, no waste bin, no desk, no closet door, no mirror. Bathroom was basic - one sink. Generally clean except for a few odd hairs. Tub/shower was happily very clean. No shampoo, no conditioner, so make sure to bring your own. Since I only slept there and was out and about most of the time, it was just fine for me, but if you're looking for any luxury at all, or trying to impress somebody (family, honeymoon, romance), I would not recommend here. If you're young, on a budget, spending minimal time at hte hotel, then it's just fine.$2 lockers in the lobby let you store your bags on the day you check out if you're not immediately running to the airport. I used them on my last day - very convenient, though I'm accumosted to hotels holding your bags for free. Oh well. Maybe they can use my $2 and buy some shampoo and lessons in customer service for the staff.Oh, and no doorman or concierge, so have fun wandering out to 5th Ave to flag down your own taxi.	
Sep 11 2009 	Friendly Staff and Great Price	I stayed at this hotel in July with a couple of friends based on a recommendation that I received. From what my friend told me, I expected great service, free coffee and a nice room: my expectations were met. Definitely will be staying here again.	
Aug 24 2009 	great location staff very rude	in the heart of Manhattan (area Koreatown) in a walking distance and close to everything. It's good budget choice, but the service at the reception was terrible; staff was rude, unsmiling, not helpful and seemed to give off the impression that they were only there for the paycheck.I worked for years in the tourism and i cannot even imagine behaviouring that way!the room was small, but clean and functional, though it was a non renovated room; comfortable mattress, flat screen TV. it's very very noisy from the street, 24 hrs a day, even in the night )	
Aug 9 2009 	Pot Luck	Booked a New Queen room two months prior to stay. Arrived late evening and were sent to an old musty room with a bathroom in what can only be described as a cupboard at the side which stank. Went straight back down to reception but were told that it was the only room available and they would see what they could do in the morning. The following morning I went back down to reception. I was given the key to the only refurbished room available. A tiny room on the ground floor, at the back of the hotel with the view of a wall and a workers cradle. Reception told us that the room given to us on our first night was an &quot;up grade&quot; and that they DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL GET THE ROOM YOU HAVE BOOKED.The choice therefore was a large smelly room with a tiny smelly bathroom, or a tiny clean refurbished room where we were unable to have the shutters (both outside and inside) open as there were workmen right outside the window. We chose the latter.That said, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was small but clean and bright; however, showers were a nightmare as the water temperature was totally random. There was no other way to wash your hair, so you had to grin and bear it.The location was good very near to restaurants and subway station.Previous reviewers thankfully found a different hotel to the one we experienced; however, it would seem to us that it is pot luck whether you get a nice room or not.	
Aug 8 2009 	Good option for family travel in NYC	The hotel is very nice and clean, and it is a very good option for budget travelers. This is very good, considering the reviews for other hotels in NYC, where people found rats, cockroaches, etc.You can have breakfast at the hotel, because there is free coffee, hot chocolate, tea, etc. at the lobby in the morning and in the afternoon.The location is good, with subway one block away, and also very close to times square.There are plenty of places to eat for reasonable prices.The rooms are very good, big and clean. The bathroom was OK, but the only problem is that the shower did not work properly. It was impossible to mix the hot and cold water. We solved this by taking baths, which is relaxing, but takes longer time.	
Aug 3 2009 	Great	It was an great experience, excellent locations, staff is nice, I would stay again for sureAndreia-Rio Claro-Brazil	
Aug 3 2009 	great design clean hotel! Best value for money!	Perfect Located in the centre of Manhattan, near to subway stations and at a safe area. The rooms were very clean, the bathroom too, newly decorated, but with a little bit rude personel.	
Jul 28 2009 	Beautiful!	I stayed at the Herald Square Hotel with my boyfriend who had never been to New York before. The room was beautiful and romantic. The high ceilings and gorgeous marble bathroom were shocking to us, who, as budget travelers, were not accustomed to anything like that. Also, it was cool that the building had a lot of history to it! Korea Town was GREAT to have next door. We went out for a $30 meal and were given SO much delicious food. Amazing! I would definitely stay again, but make sure to ask for the New Rooms!	
Jul 28 2009 	Lovely hotel - bargain price great location	Recommended by a friend, this is a great hotel in a great location. Friendly reception, nice and spacious with free self serve coffee in lobby. room plenty big enough for family of 4 (2 Queen beds). Empire state building literally round the corner, short walk to Penn station for trains to NJ, and Times Square not far either. Slight problem with the loo on first night was sorted immediately. Very clean. Would definitely stay here again.Fantastic breakfast at the nearby Cosmic Cafe. Highly recommended!	
Jul 26 2009 	Best value in NYC	I can't really add anything more to the reviews already given on Trip Advisor - great location, very clean, polite staff, great value for money. This is a budget hotel so do not go there if you are expecting room service or a huge penthouse suite!A little tip for you - if you are arriving/departing from JFK don't waste your time and money on a taxi or a shuttle bus, particularly if you arrive during the rush hour otherwise you will get stuck in traffic. It is much less hassle to take the Air Train from the airport ($5) followed by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to Penn Station (approx $4). Penn Station is only a couple of blocks walk from the hotel.It's also a good idea to check various websites for the best price before booking. Try the hotel's own website (easy to find via google), Expedia and Booking dot com.	
Jul 23 2009	Great location 	Herald Square Hotel located in the center of Manhattan has an excellent location, very close to a subway station. The bathroom was very clean and large, nicely decorated. The room was also nice. Good choice for both business and leisure travelers.	
Jul 23 2009 	Fab location great hotel	Just back from New York, hotel was very good.. Very clean and very central. Empire State building is just around the corner, Times Square about 10 minute walk.We had a queen room with a bathroom. Room was good size, bed very comfy, you need it after walking around NY all day. Our room was on the ground floor, it had a small window looking out onto the fire escape, but we were told that if we wanted we could be moved. It didn't bother us as we were in the room only to sleep. Hotel is perfect for a holiday in NY!	
Jul 18 2009 	WONDERFUL PLACE TO STAY	In June and July 2009 my daughter and I stayed at the Herald Squre Hotel. Both times were great, but the July stay, we arrived early and the front desk upgraded our room with no extra charge so we could go ahead and rest awhile. The room was so much nicer than the room we were to get and the service was excellent in a city where that is sometimes questionable. This hotel is n the middle of everything, so it is a great play to stay for such an affordable price. Thank you so much and on our next trip we will definately stay at the Hearld Square Hotel.	
Jul 11 2009 	A Fantastic Little Gem!	When I am in Paris, I stay in the 6eme arrondissement and surround myself in a neighborhood rich with Bohemian Parisian artistic culture that provides a quaint feel. When I travel to New York City, I look for the same quaint feel but I want the New York City vibe and culture. We all know how expensive the city that never sleeps can be and how much there is to see and do. So when I stay in this great metropolis, I want to be able to access New York City but on a respectable budget. And I always seem to find myself at the same location, The Herald Square Hotel. What a fantastic little gem! The accommodations are outstanding, the staff is welcoming, the location is superb (only a few blocks from Penn Station and the subway) and if I really get lazy and don't want to head too far but I feel like taking in some New York energy, there is a trendy and very New York type of restaurant-cafe next-door. On my next trip up to New York City, I will stay at the same location. I highly recommend it!	
Jul 8 2009 	Great option in expensive NY	I chose this hotel because of it's rave reviews on tripadvisor and i'm glad i did so. The hotel has a great location, the staff is nice, the rooms are really big, with great matress, and clean bathrooms. There's also complementary drinks and cookies on the looby. All in all, for the price you pay, it's a great option.	
Jun 28 2009 	Location classy and a great value!	We loved our stay in NYC as a result of this hotel. Location is excellent. We could walk to Broadway and to the Amtrak station (a few blocks away). It's a real neighborhood with juice bars, and hole-in-the-wall breakfast places, amazing pizza &amp; salad places. It rained hard while we were there, and we were directed to a street vendor who stands at a certain corner selling umbrellas whenever it rains! We got two for $9. I got a different look at NYC this time--a community in action sort of look.Staff is friendly and professional. Downstairs automatic coffee machine is amazingly versatile. Laundry room is v. efficient. There is one computer downstairs, but the place has wireless. There's an Indian place that serves lunch, a Dunken Donuts/Subway fast food place (yes, they are together!) as well as a high end chocolate and wine restaurant next door; there's also a whole neighborhood of fancy Korean restaurants around the corner. We saw lots of German tourists in our hotel this time. Made conversations fun.Did I mention the place is lovely in a tasteful and determinedly non-chain hotel kind of way? We got sick the second day there and just wanted to stay in our rooms and nest, which we did. It was v. comforting to have the drugstore, and an acupuncturist (at the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine on Broadway), and juice stand so close.We would stay there again anytime we're in NYC. No wonder this place won their city's award for best hotel value.	
Jun 25 2009 	Great Location... good value	We stayed here for 4 nights in March as part of a bigger US holiday.Great location, but the rooms (or ours at least) are a big small. The place is clean though and within walking distance of everything you need in New York.Definitely recommended for budget travellers.	
Jun 22 2009 	Fabulous	I love this hotel. I've stayed here at least 5 times. It's clean, neat and inexpensive and super well located. Also next door to a fabulous Wine and Chocolate Bar where they serve a 20 layer crepe with fresh whipped cream between each layer until midnight outside under the NY City Stars!!!	
Jun 19 2009 	very nice experiance	The Hotel was nice and the location was great for our first time in New York. The Staff was extremely helpful and wonderful to help with any Questions we had. the rooms were very clean and comfortable. I will stay here on our next trip to New York and would recommend you to stay here. The rates were very reasonable.Gary and Juliet Moore Tiffin, Iowa	
Jun 19 2009 	A gem of a budget hotel in midtown Manhattan!	Me and my girlfriend stayed for 5 nights at this great little hotel, which is situated in an area of Manhattan commonly referred to as Koreatown. Staying here you are within walking distance to most of midtown with it's many tourist attractions and shopping meccas, most notably Macy's and Empire State Building - if you're into that sort of thing - and the subway is just around the corner, opening up the rest of NYC for you to explore. There are also plenty of places to eat in the vicinity - ranging from cheap street vendors to fine dining - which is convenient as the hotel does not provide breakfast (or any other food for that matter). The room we stayed in (new large queen bedroom) was a nice size, with a lovely bathroom, a huge, comfortable bed almost requiring a step-ladder to get on top of, an intentionally doorless closet containing a large digital safe, an iron and an ironing board, a large desk with a mirror, and a somewhat noisy air-con device in a corner below the window. There was not much of a view out the window (a few dour looking brown brick buildings with windows displaying ill-kept and half-abandoned offices and storage spaces), but if you are anything like me and my girlfriend you would certainly not be in NYC to sit in your hotel room and look out the window. The room was cleaned well on a daily basis, and we always found a fresh supply of towels provided when we returned from our daily/nightly excursions. During our stay we were always met with a friendly and polite attitude from staff, and they were helpful on the few occasions when we needed their assistance. Checking in and out was a quick and easy process, and the rates are very reasonable considering the location of the hotel and the standard of the rooms (just over $920.00 for five nights). All in all, a great place to stay if you're planning to visit The Big Apple.	
Jun 16 2009 	Great Hotel - Great Location	We recently stayed here 3 nights and I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel. The front desk was helpful, the room was clean and quiet, the price was great, it was located near the subway stops. Downstairs there were washers/dryers, soft drink machine and an ice machine. Off from the lobby were tables/chairs for the complimentary coffee/tea/hot chocolate.It was everything good you hope your hotel will be. An added bonus was that we were able to check in early, a welcome surprise we had not anticipated. We had fully expected to store our luggage in their lockers, which we did on the morning we checked out and stayed in the city the rest of the day and picked up our luggage late that afternoon. When you check in, pick up a brochure of the history of the hotel, it is very interesting. I hope to go back to NYC one day and the first thing I will do before I go is make my reservation at the Herald Square Hotel!	
Jun 15 2009 	Fantastic hotel for some fantastic days	I chose the Herald Square Hotel after some search in the internet. The prices were as good as they can be in NY, the reviews were great, so I booked through booking.com. And fortunately everything went out very well!!! First, the location. The 31th st is near the heart of Manhattan. The Empire State Building is 2 blocks away and the Times Square is in 10 min walk. There are 2 subways nearby, in the Herald Square and in Penn Station, with access to almost all the lines. Now, the hotel. In sum, it's really nice. The reception isn's very &quot;cosy&quot;, but works well and fast. People are friendly and ready to help with questions or tips you need. The coffee end tea available for free is also great!We stayed in the 3rd floor, with view to the back. No noise from the street but the air-condicioners are a bit noisy, with a constant sound that irritates when you want to sleep. Not a big question, but something to rethink by the hotel management. The room itself is small, but as everything people need. Very very clean, the bathroom is perfect for a few days away from home. Now, some tips. Use the bus, it's fast even when there is transit, and it's so easy to understand where it goes. Buy the metrocard, it's 25$ and includes subway and bus for 7 days. Buy the Citypass, it's 79$ and includes the main museums, the trip to the Statue of Liberty and the Empire, and allows you to avoid lines for tickets. Go to a gospel singing cerimony in a church in the Harlem, it's beautiful. Take a long walk in the Central Park, so so nice. The Metropolitan is really big, so don't go there if you are in a hurry.	
Jun 4 2009 	A good budget choice	This hotel was reasonably close to Times Square and is a good choice for those on a budget. Staff were helpful and arranged a taxi to the airport. Rooms are small and bathrooms are shared but for the price it was ok.	
Jun 1 2009 	Absolutely Fabulous!	Stayed at the Herald Square with friends for a week in May. The hotel was fantastic - room really bright and spotlessly clean and the beds were so comfortable, just what we needed after a day out in NY! It is in the perfect location, just round the corner from the Empire State, Macys - and a 10 minute walk to Times Square. All the staff we came across were friendly and helpful and really helped to make our stay as comfortable as possible.I love the Herald Square Hotel and would recommend it to anyone - really couldnt fault it!	
May 13 2009 	Quaint hotel close to Empire State Building	Quaint 9 storey hotel one block from Empire State Building. Stayed 5 nights in renovated Queen bed room. Room 918 on top floor has a tiny outdoor courtyard with a view of the Empire State Building - highly recommended. Quiet room, large with bathroom with shower over bathtub with Victorian style amenities. Large on wall plasma tv, free wireless internet - big plus! Super comfortable bed and pillows. Great housekeeping service. Friendly staff. One block from subway located on 32nd street. Pleasant walk to Times Square. 24 hour deli opposite subway, recommend O'Reillys Irish pub for a drink or meal - one block away. Good souvenir shop around the corner. Easy to book on their website. They can organize airport transfers also. Recommend Citylights all loop tour including 4 bus tours (hopon hopoff), Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Hudson River cruise, choice of ticket to either Empire State Building or Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Centre - all valid for 48 hours but we had prebooked and got a bonus day so extremely good value. Looking for theatre tickets try TKTS centre in Times Square for half price seats. Most plays and musicals available except Wicked and Billy Elliott. Wicked is worth buying full price - amazing musical! If you love cake try Magnolia Bakery for vanilla cupcakes - YUM!	
May 4 2009 	Hidden Gem	Lovely hotel, Clean, Fairly modernComplementary Hot Drinks in the morningGreat friendly helpful staff, easy check in and check out.Connivent lockers for late travel.The room was available so we were able to check in a few hours early.Also allowed to check out a little late which is unheard of in the city.Great clean bed, linens, roomy wash room.We were in a room facing an office building there was a hum but no loud street sounds.We had fun would stay again.	
Apr 27 2009 	Very Nice Hotel	Stayed 4 nights in a refurbished room on the ground floor (decorated nicely with beautiful parquet flooring). I had called in advance and requested to check in early (my flight arrived early in the morning) and just as requested the room was ready. The location of this hotel is SUPERB and the room and public aread were very clean. My only problem was that the water in the shower kept going hot and cold. Never the less I would definitely stay at this hotel again	
Apr 22 2009 	What a little gem - highly recommended! Superb location!	I searched forever to find us a hotel for the Xmas season (just before 17-22 Dec) in NYC and this one nearly passed me by. We almost ended up at the Hotel Pennslyvania but I'm so glad we didn't as last time I stayed it was grubby, but from what I've heard it has gotten grubbier! The Herald Square hotel is cheaper and nicer - it's a no brainer! We were given a refurbished room (score!) which was lovely, and we didn't mind at all that there wasn't much to see from the window because - at the end of the day - we were SO central (right by Macy's too!).  We took advantage of the free coffee and treats in the little cafe area in the foyer (a lovely touch) and found the staff to be friendly and very helpful indeed.  Broadway and Fifth Avenue are ridiculously close (seconds to walk) and the Empire State is on this hotel's doorstep. It's so great to find a little place like this in the middle of such a big vibrant city (especially at these prices) - it's the sort of gem you want to uncover everywhere you go. They say you get what you pay for, but at this hotel I felt we got a lot more than that.	
Apr 21 2009 	Ok rooms - terrible service at the check in desk	I led a group to NYC and had our rooms booked by a professional travel agent months before we arrived. The Herald Square hotel couldn't find our reservations - that had been verified 2 days before we arrived. The credit card was not run for the total amount due which messed us up. The rooms were nice, but the shower would turn cold in the middle of the shower and there were no controls to shut the heat off in the room, so some rooms were roasting hot. Fortuntely the windows did work. The electrical outlets were in very strange places for the bathroom. We requested the updated rooms through the travel agent, but I guess that was lost also, because we were in the older rooms. Lastly, the total amount of all our rooms was not given to me so the charges from my credit card were hundreds higher. If they would let the leader of a group book all the rooms that would not happen.	
Apr 20 2009 	Prime location value for money	The hotel is in a very convinient location: Macy's, Madison Sq garden and Empire State Building are all within 10-15 minutes walk. The nearest subway is one block away, Penn Station 3-4 blocks away. The hotel itself is no 5-star, but in its own class a very good one. We stayed for 6 nights in a renovated Queen room, which was smallish but adequate if you don't want to spend your entire holiday in your hotel room. The room was spotlessly clean, the cast iron bed was super comfortable and the decor neutral and pleasant. The flat screen tv had a lot of channels to choose from, and there is a free WiFi in the hotel (ask for the code when checking in). There were also a hairdryer, a safe and a make-up mirror in the room. The bathroom was big and airy and very beautifully decoreated in early 20th century style. The bathtub was big and the rain shower nice. The room was cleaned daily and the bedlinens and the towels changed.Outside the hotel looks better than when you get into the lobby: the reception is a bit dull as the staff sits behind a glass like in a post office. Nevertheless the staff was very helpful in all matters. When we got to the hotel, we didn't get any hot water but the maintenance guy fixed that in 2 minutes. There only limited services in the hotel: a free coffee automat in the lobby, guests' laundrette (handy for backpackers), a vending machine and a locker room for luggage if your plane leaves in the evening. The Herald Square is perfect for an independent traveller who doesn't want to pay a fortune for a hotel. There is no restaurant or breakfast room at the hotel, but there are plenty of restaurants around, and the Koreatown with its Korean restaurants is just one block away. There is also a post office almost next to the hotel, and on the othere side of the street, there is a small convenience store which is handy for a late snack or buying drinks for the hotel room. The only negatives would probably be the drab decor of the hallways and the lobby, and the fact that our window was to a courtyard that was quite dark, more like a ventilation shaft. The central heating was also a bit too efficient. We paid around $180 for a night, but made the reservation well in advance using the hotel's own pages.	
Apr 15 2009 	A hidden gem - what a wonderful hotel!	This hotel is an absolute gem. I would class it as a boutique hotel for sure. Great location, very helpful staff and wonderful amenities. The only disadvantage would be no coffee/tea making facilities in room. Our room was small but really cute. I highly recommend this hotel!!	
Mar 31 2009 	Great location pleasant staff lovely room-fantastic!	We stayed here for 10 days during March and found the overall experience very enjoyable!PRO's; Wonderfully central location, near Herald Sq &amp; subway station. In walking distance of Midtown attractions, even Central Park in 40mins at a push! Staff friendly &amp; helpful with our requests, safe location, wonderful restaurants &amp; shops close by (try 'Speedys' buffet style cafe). Room was beautifully decorated, chandeliers, comfy bed, widescreen TV- unexpected luxury! CON's; No daylight in the room which added to the length of our jetlag! Asked for quiet room but was very near janitors closet- therefore early morning clammering and talking over the radio in the corridor. No heating in the room for first 3 days, once this was fixed the radiator would judder and clang loudly approx 5 times a day (&amp; in middle of night- probably an airlock). All things considered I would definitely go back! I would ask for a room with a view to get some daylight though!!	
Mar 27 2009 	Well located and good value!	We really liked our stay at the Herald, the staff were very helpfull and the rooms BIG for the price we paid!! Free safe was a bonus and lockers to store luggage on final day for only 2$ was a bargain!No tea making facilities in room but enjoyed the free hot drinks in lounge area and took these up with us.Rooms cleaned daily to a good standard (fiance a cleanaholic). Felt safe and location of hotel was good everything was walkable especially the empire state building that was just around the corner...Would stay again!!!	
Mar 23 2009 	will be staying here again	it was nice to go to nyc and still not have to spend alot. a short walk to time square and macy's and 1 1/2 blocksto msg . may not be fancy but well worth the money spent. room just remodeled and very clean	
Mar 23 2009 	Most Comfortable Bed Anywhere!	As part of a choir trip package to perform at Carnegie Hall, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt at Grand Central Station, then moved for a couple extra days to the Herald Square. Herald Square was a better deal, clean room, bigger bathroom (with a vent fan; no fan in GH bath), very comfortable bed with new mattress,friendly staff and a very decent location. Wife says the bed was &quot;heavenly&quot;. This is a quaint old building which has been renovated and remodeled. I can only speak to our experience, but we plan on coming back to NY and will definitely stay at the Herald Square. Also, subway nearby on Broadway, Penn Station a short walk away.	
Mar 7 2009 	Good reasonable inner city accommodation	Close to Penn Railway Station as well as the Grayline Double Decker Bus stop near the Empire State Building. Shared a room with another couple - really comfy queen beds but the room was pretty small, but enough room to put the cases on the floor &amp; had a big bathroom. Another friend travelling with us had a single room, which was very small, but okay if you're only sleeping there. There's a sitting room with tables in the foyer where you can relax or have a tea/coffee which is provided free of charge. We thought it was good, clean accommodation in a good location. Nice meal at O'Reillys Irish Pub close by.	
Feb 28 2009 	Clean hospitable value for money hotel in central location.	We loved the free hot chocolate. Staff were always helpful. The room was small but clean and functional. Location was brilliant and provided excellent value for money.	
Feb 12 2009 	Excellent Rooms and service	I stayed at the Herald Sqaure Hotel for the Westmister Dog Show. I was very pleased with everything about the hotel. The new lobby is a new addition and it really is very lovely and comfortable. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful and ready to offer suggestions of things to do in the city.	
Feb 10 2009 	Great Hotel!	My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at the Herald Square Hotel. Their web site has some great deals, and on top of that, when we checked in we were upgraded to one of the newly renovated rooms. The room was beautiful, with a brand new marble bathroom, new furniture, flat screen TV, and a VERY comfortable bed. The location was amazing, close to everything! Also, the staff was so nice and helpful. I would definitely stay there again!	
Feb 5 2009 	Best price downtown Manhattan	After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor my boyfriend and I decided to go to HeraldSquare Hotel anyway.What a great surprise!!!Let's be honest here people....who's going to NYC to stay in there room?...NO BODY!....The room was small but really confortable (especialy the Queen size bed)...Flat screen TV + a really clean bathroom. The Hotel is actualy the old Life Magazine building wich add charm to the stay.The hotel is at 5 mins of walk of the Empire State Building and 10 mins of walk of the Flatiron building....A great value...I highly recommended this hotel to alot of other friends! :)	
Jan 8 2009 	fab hotel !!!!!!!!!!! great value for money	my husband was 40yrs in nov went for a treat ! will defo stay again hope to book gor my 40yrs birthday in oct !!!!! well done mary c. cork	
Jan 6 2009 	Nice hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of November. Unfortunately both of us caught a gastro bug on the way over and spent almost the whole time being very ill in the hotel so we definitely made use of our room!Fortunately we went for a renovated room (our friends both stayed in non renovated rooms and said that they were tiny and very very basic, one of our friends even had the electricity to his room cut while he was having a shower and had to shower in the dark!). We spent ages looking at hotels and this was the cheapest we could find when we were looking (although still quite expensive). The room was on the second floor and gorgeous, chandeliers, huge queen size bed which was very comfortable, wardrobe and safe in the room. Beautiful bathroom with the biggest rain fall shower I have ever seen. There were also mini Aveda bath and hair products which was wonderful for me as I love Aveda! The room was very warm but there was air conditioning which was a little loud but overall fine. We had a big flat screen TV opposite our bed with loads of channels which was great for watching TV in bed. There was also a little table with a couple of chairs which was great since we did have to eat take away in our room on a few occasions because we were ill.The only bad thing about the room was that it was a bit dark. There was one window in the bathroom and the room which both opened up on to an internal part of the hotel so there wasn't much natural light although plenty of bright internal ones which made up for it and there was also some sort of extractor fan thing which we could hear if we opened the window. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom but it was really weak and took me about ten times longer than usual to dry my hair and it kept getting scorchingly hot making it difficult to hold. I did have my own little powerful travel hairdryer but with the adaptor just made it also very weak which was a little annoying.There was also some sort of work going on at the hotel during the day which was a little annoying for us as we ended up being ill and having to sleep during the day while there was constant very loud banging and drilling going on. Usually this wouldn't bother us tho as we would have been out sightseeing.The location is decent, mid town and just a block away from the Empire State and Broadway. The nearest subway stations were a couple of blocks away in various directions.Check in was efficient and the staff were fine. There were coffee facilities in the foyer which we used and there is a bar next door to the hotel which is quite nice.Would stay here again if got a good rate.	
Jan 5 2009 	Wonderful and cheap!	Stayed here for 8 nights over New Year's 2008/09 and couldn't have been more impressed. Staff were friendly and helpful, hotel has great amenities (guest laundry was very handy), the room was much bigger than we thought it would be, with a huge bathroom. Location is obviously a drawcard, but the room was a quiet oasis in the heart of the city. Compared with other hotels in NYC in this price range, the Herald Square is exceptional. Highly recommended!	
Dec 14 2008 	Again still good	As usual i stayed in this hotel to bridge an extended stay after a business trip where i stayed in Novotel . Booked the thanks giving night from the hotel website being the cheapest way everytime . got a single private bathroom room for $ 115 all inclusive . The only problem that you by age starts to change your standards . the hotel have excellent complimentary coffee stand in the lobby and reliable free wifi in rooms and other areas . also they are one of the rare hotels who will book the shuttle bus to the airport for you . the location is excellent close to empire state and shopping area 2 mns walk to macy s five mns to fifth avenue in addition to buzy 34th street with all know commercial brands such as gap , old navy , victoria's secrets , banana republic , aldo , bebe name it . also sbarro a good alternative for quality and value meal is 3 mns away and a diwan read pharmacy 24 hrs on a stone throw . i have stayed in many hotels in new york but this one for that price is the best . the problem is that you have to ensure getting the room with private bathroom it has become very expensive now for double room but stil good value for single and 2 double beds	
Nov 26 2008 	good clean hotel excellent location	this was a very centrally located hotel. 5 stars for location, it was a 10 minute walk to times square, 5 minutes to penn station, macys, empire state building etc,etc. it was very close to the herald square subway station which made it very easy to travel all over the city. even though its located right in a busy area it was very quiet inside the hotel, we were on the 5th floor and couldnt hear any street noise.The room itself was small and old looking but functional, it was clean and the housekeeping service was good. the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a good size and was very clean, the linen was also nice and clean. there was a safe and a new tv in the room, there was no tea/coffee facilities in rooms. there was very little space to put suitcases the room was pretty much taken up by the bed. we could hear a bit of noise though the walls. the hotel itself and the location felt very safe which was great. the lifts were very slow. The lobby area was great but unfortunately the coffee machine was out of action and never got fixed while we were there. there are laundry services (self service) and internet access (only one computer though) available for a price. The staff were ok, some were lovely but others were a bit rude and abrupt but we found that with a lot of the service staff all over new york anyhow. it seems pricy for a budget hotel but when you consider the location and compare it to other hotels in the area that offer private ensuites it is really very well priced. beware they dont include taxes in the advertised rates they add them on at the end of your stay. there is a city tax, state tax and occupancy fee. overall we found taxes increased our bill by 15%. all in all this is a great hotel if you want a room just to sleep in with a private ensuite on a budget in an excellant location. I wouldnt recommend it for travellers who want to spend a lot of time in the hotel room.	
Nov 24 2008 	Fabulous Location	Have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Herald Square. Having tralled the internet for hours trying to find something reasonably priced, clean and central we settled for here. It really is a great location, central to everything. Empire State and Macy's around the corner, Madison Square Garden a short walk away and plently of places to pick up the MTA (New Yorks Underground).We had a refurbished room, which was really spacious, very clean and had an extremely comfortable bed, which is what you need after walking around all day long! The showers were also very warm and the room was cleaned and fresh towels left each morning.There are two lifts at the hotel, which are extremely slow and sometimes take ages to reach your floor, so a couple of times we took the stairs. There is a coffee machine situated in the reception/rest area, which is a nice touch, although it was out of order for two of the days when we were there!As with most of America, the prices quoted on the internet for the rooms DO NOT include tax and when we were presented with our final bill it included almost £50 per night various tax charges, which was quite alarming and increased our expenditure by £200.All in all a great location and a pleasant stay.	
Nov 23 2008 	Excellent!	This hotel has a great price for New York City. It has a good location, aproximately 12 blocks from Times Square, and near the subway and Penn Station. It is clean and the staff is extremely friendly.	
Nov 18 2008 	Somewhat Overpriced	Very well located in the heart of New York City and just a block from the Empire State Building, the Herald Square Hotel was, for lack of a better word, average.Although some of the rooms have been newly remodelled, ours was outdated but generally tidy. The bathroom was clean but a bit old and the appliances (TV, airconditioning etc) looked like it dated back to the late 70's early 80's.The staff were friendly enough but seemed to give off the impression that they were only there for the paycheck and the hotel did seem a bit over priced even by summer standards.It's somewhere to sleep and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who likes to spend some part of their holiday relaxing in a hotel.	
Nov 17 2008 	Excellent location	I stayed at the Herald Square hotel for one night and it cost me just over $100 which is pretty good for New York. The room was tiny but it was clean, I had my own bathroom and it had a tv and safe. The location of the hotel is fantastic and there are some nice places to eat nearby.	
Nov 13 2008 	Great little hotel	Stayed at the Herald Square Hotel 13/10/08 - 20/10/08 also 24 and 25/10/08 first visit to New York so was unsure which way to go for a hotel.Very happy with the Herald Square, good location and rooms were very clean.If you want a hotel with a big flashy lobby it is not for you but if you want value for money and very comfortable beds then look no further.	
Nov 6 2008 	One of New York's gems	Our family of three (2 adults and 11 yo) spent 5 nights at the Herald Square Hotel (HSH) in September. I would rate the HSH as one of New York's more affordable gems.We arrived in New York early on a Monday morning after a red eye flight from San Francisco. We wanted to drop our luggage off and begin our exploration of New York. We were pleasantly surprised to be told that they had our room available and we could check in then and there.The room itself was comfortable. While the room was not huge, it did have two double beds and there was enough room for our three large suitcases. The room itself was quiet, and there were shutters and block-out blinds on the windows. The comfortable beds and pillows meant that we all slept well. The bathroom was adequate, with plenty of hot water. There was also a free room safe for the storage of valuables.Housekeeping was very good. We always returned to a nice tidy room at the end of the day. Hotel staff were always pleasant and helpful.The HSH also has a good laundry facility and a pay internet kiosk. They also offer free coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the lounge adjoining the foyer.The location of the Herald Square Hotel is excellent. We regularly walked to and from Times Square. Or there was a subway stop two blocks away. Penn Street Station is also only a ten minute walk away - even when wheeling suitcases. We found a number of restauants within about a 15 minute walk (There is also a good restaurant right next door if you dont want to walk). For breakfast, we walked less than 2 blocks to Speedys. In summary, the Herald Square Hotel is a very pleasant hotel and very good value by New York standards. We would definitely stay there again.	
Nov 6 2008 	Perfect location	Just back from 4 nights at the Herald Square hotel and the hotel was perfect for my needs. Booked a single room with bathroom (room 410) cost $460 for the 4 nights which is great value for New york. The room was, as expected,small but given the amount of time I spent in the room that was'nt a problemLobby with free tea/coffee etc was an added bonus. I'd also recommend the Airtrain service if coming from JFK airport, terminus is Penn station which is a short walk from the hotel. From Hotel to Airport took about 50 mins, cost was $12.25, much cheaper than a taxi especially when travelling on your own.	
Oct 31 2008 	New York on a Budget	This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. It is a small friendly hotel, the rooms are basic, but they are clean and adequate. This time our room was quite big with a good size, bright bathroom. Unfortunately we were on the ground floor. (We must have looked old and infirm when we arrived, when in fact we were just recovering from an awful flight) The room was dark as the window looked out onto a small backyard, so we didnt have a view at all. We should have asked to move to another room on a higher floor, but apart from the darkness it was a good room. There is a lounge area near the main entrance and a small area with tables and chairs where you can have a drink of coffee, tea or hot chocolate from the machine. Also, there are bowls of sweets, and lovely Italian biscuits for guests to help themselves to.The hotel is in a good place, just round the corner from the Empire State Building, a short walk from Times Square and Maceys. We ate at the Heartland Brewery on 5th Ave most nights and would reccommend it for a good meal.I would definitely reccommend the hotel if you are looking for a budget hotel in New York. You dont spend very much time in your room, there are lots of wonderful things to see and do. Just ask for a room on a higher floor.I would also reccommend the show Spamalot. It is brilliantly funny.	
Oct 31 2008 	Great Location Great Price	I stayed here with my mum and a couple of friends and despite the inital confusion over the outstanding balance the hotel was GREAT especially for the price you pay! The hotel is in an ideal location - walking distance to Macy's, Empre State and Times Square and close to the subway. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean and the hotel have tea, cofee and internet facilitiesWould definately go back and I do recommend.	
Oct 24 2008 	Best price 	I stayed her for a week in september and was really impressed with the location and price. The staf wasn't the most helpfull and the rooms where as tiny as they can get, i was only there for sleepig anyway. But for that price and location (right around the corner from the Empire state building) you just cant find a better deal!	
Oct 12 2008 	Great Location and a friendly staff	Had a very pleasant stay at the Herald Square Hotel last June. Stayed for a week with my girlfriend, and our room was pretty much what we had expected. The Hotel is close to many great shops and we fell in love with the breakfast menu in a restaurant chain nearby, called Speedy´s. We were satisfied with the service and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who´s looking for a good bargain while also getting a great location. And also we asked a woman who was working in the lobby to get us a shuttle to the airport, and the driver that we got was very nice and professional.	
Oct 9 2008 	great warm place in chlly NYC	We had a wonderfull 5 night stay at the Herald. We got a great bargain: we got a new room for the price of an unrenovated room. The bed was really nice, the room was really clean, good service and excellent location. The room was big enough for us two. Nice and quiet and nice decorations. Everything was well looked after. there is no breakfast service, but they have suggestions for nice places just around the corner. There is a free warm drinks service in the lobby where you also can relax and read a paper. I would really return.	
Sep 23 2008	Herald Square is a square deal	We stayed for 3 nights in one of their (supposedly) unrenovated queen rooms, so not their cheapest option, but still a bargain compared to other hotels near Amtrak's Penn Station. (The double bed rooms were all booked so this was the cheapest option for 2 people.) We may have lucked into a nicer room than we paid for as it was quite large and the bathroom looked like it had been redone in the past year or two. (Room #512.) We booked directly with them online 8 weeks in advance of our September arrival.Our 5th floor room overlooked the busy street, but it wasn't too noisy. The black out shades and comfy bed made for a good night's sleep. Few frills (other than the nice selection of tea in the lobby), but definitely a good deal in a VERY convenient location. There was a desk with one chair, but otherwise if you both wanted to read the options were to either sit up in bed (there were overhead lights over each side that made that possible) OR go down to the lobby. I never saw the luggage locker as we had a rolling duffle that the desk clerk said was too large for them. For $1 a bag it was worth it to leave the luggage with them in the larger storage area so we could arrive earlier than the official check-in (our room was not ready when we arrived at noon). It was great to have a reasonable bagel/deli place within 2 blocks for breakfast.	
Sep 16 2008 	Stayed twice would do so again!	What else are you looking for when staying in New York? Rooms that don't break the bank, excellent location, friendly efficient service and a hotel thats got history but you're not paying for the privilege! Not the biggest of rooms but you're in new york, you're not supposed to stay in for any significant amount of time! We'd be more than happy to stay there again.	
Sep 12 2008 	Love the Herald Square Hotel!	This was my second time staying at the Herald Square Hotel and again I was not disappointed. I arrived in NYC very early (5:30am) on the morning of Sept 8 and knew that my room wouldn't be ready. I was fully prepared to throw my bag into one of their storage lockers and head out to explore the city, so I was not put off at all when the front desk clerk told me nothing was ready. He gladly gave me the key to the guest/public washroom so I could freshen up and change, sold me a token for the lockers, and told me to enjoy the free coffee, etc.. in the lobby/lounge before I headed out. For the price I paid ($99 for a single room with private bathroom), I actually got a double room courtesy of a free upgrade when I checked in later in the day. I'm not sure if it's because they took pity on me, having arrived so early after being on a bus all night, but I didn't care the reason - they did the same thing when I stayed for 4 nights last year - I just knew I appreciated it. The room was not huge, but if you come to NYC expecting all the hotel rooms to be palaces (expecially in period/character buildings like this one), then you can only blame yourself for any disappointment you feel. The room was clean, however, and the bed was amazingly comfortable (must get the name of the brand they use), and the whole place was quite soundproof from what I could tell. I only ever saw people in the elevators and even though the hotel was fully booked, I didn't even know I had neighbours right next to me until the day I checked out and I saw them coming down the hallway as I waited for the elevator. I've recommended this hotel to friends and they've come back saying the same thing. Even though the price of the single room has gone up $20/night (from $79 to $99/night) from when I stayed there last year, I can say that it's still a great bargain for NYC, where the closest thing you'll find in price is a hostel where instead of having a private room, you'd be sharing both a dorm room and a bathroom.	
Sep 3 2008 	Good Hotel Great Location	Good city hotel. The room was small but clean and comfortable. Perfect location: near Penn Station and the Empire State Building. Free coffe and biscuits. Negative things: one of the employees at the front desk was quite rude, the rest were nice and helpful.	
Sep 2 2008 	NOT the best deal in town!	This was the first time staying at the Herald Square Hotel and we wouldn't do it again. It is a good location but it lacks the basic necessities and the front desk staff were not helpful and unwilling to do even the simplest of things. We asked for the toll free number for the airport shuttle and the front desk clerk told us she didn't have it. Since we had paid for our hotel upon arrival, she told us that we could not use the phone in our hotel to call the shuttle. Then I noticed the toll free number for the shuttle on the wall next to the computer and pointed it out to her. She said it was a concierge number and I couldn't call it but it was the exact same number that I had called from Canada! I told her this and she just shrugged her shoulders. I thought this was very rude. Call yourself for your shuttle because they charge extra to book it for you.The hotel says that they have coffee, tea and chocolates available all of the time but this is not true. There are no chocolates and they do not replenish the tea or milk, etc. in a timely manner.The hotel lacks shampoo, conditioner, radio, telephone book, city guides. I was not told this when I booked and luckily, we brought our own. You have to be very careful which room and what floor you get as some rooms are without windows, are musty and not pleasant as we heard from other guests. We were also charged an additional $40 for the room, compared to the price I was given over the phone. In meeting other tourists, we discovered there are hotels with better prices and better accommodations. We will not stay at this hotel again.	
Aug 8 2008 	A great city hotel!	We went there for our honeymoon in May after reading the great reviews. The price was reasonable, the bed was comfy and the bathroom quite roomy. The staff was friendly and we had no problem with staying an extra night. The coffee in the morning was great and one day we even walked to the Dunkin Donuts and bought food in to eat at one of the tables in the lobby. The room was clean, we did'nt want to spend a fortune and we we used the extra savings for a show a few nice dinners. We did go to the wine bar next door. I would stay there again.	
Jul 29 2008 	Small rooms 	The first thing that you have to know about this hotel (specially for those who visit NY for first time) is the location, very close to the Empire State Building ( 1 1/2 blocks) the Madison Square Garden (3 blocks), Times Square (10-15 minute walk) and many Subway stations.The rooms are small (it doesnt bother me, because i went to meet NY, not to get relax in the hotel) but OK an clean, and there was some dust in parts of the hotel, but it isn´t a dirty hotel.The price is affordable $120 per night ( i think it´s cheap, because similar hotels have rates from $200 per night)	
Jul 26 2008 	Great location but awful otherwise (this was in 2003)	I'm going to preface this review with the fact that I stayed at the Herald Square Hotel almost five years ago, when a room could still be had for under $100 a night, and it could have changed substantially since then. Judging from the number of positive reviews posted here, that's a possibility. But you might want to take a look at some of the negative reviews, as there's also a possibility that there is a range a room types, some a lot better than others. I may have had the worst room in the house. In 2003, there was no link on Expedia with which to review the hotel, and I definitely wanted to review it, as my experience there was terrible. I just took a look; there's still no link on Expedia. That should tell you something.My first contact with reception was a phone call to ask if it was possible to upgrade to another room with two beds, in order to share with another guest. The woman who answered the phone said there were no alternative rooms available. When I asked if there was a possibility of putting in a cot, she dismissed that with a laugh, and then cut me off.When I got into the room, I could see why she had laughed: it was tiny, and one of the dimmest, dreariest spaces I've ever been in. There were no windows to speak of, only one high up toward the ceiling that looked out to what seemed like an alley way - only you really couldn't see out at all. The room was bifurcated at the foot of the bed by a demi wall-column that doubled as a closet. The whole feeling was closed-in, positively clausterphobic.I would have tried to change hotels then and there, only it was a Friday night on a big game weekend, so the prospects were dim. I was pretty much stuck there for Friday and Saturday nights, but was determined to get out for Sunday night, which I did.There's no lobby in the hotel to speak of, only a small room with the reception desk behind plate-glass. Off to the side is a small room that did have a computer that guests can use, one very small amenity in a hotel that had virtually none. The other redeeming feature was the artwork on the walls - reproductions from the old Life Magazine, which used to own the building.I had one other encounter with the woman I first spoke to, and that was when I called to cancel Sunday night. She was once again very rude, and I told her so. Note: it is very rare that I ever say anything like that to anyone.A final insult from that visit was what looked like hugely inflated phone charges on my bill for the few phone calls I made - beyond the usual hotel gouging, I'd say. Needless to say, changing hotels from Herald Square to the Quality Hotel Times Square was a huge relief. I traded one tiny room for another pretty small one, but the latter was simply heavenly by comparison!	
Jul 22 2008 	Good value - maybe splash out for en-suite next time	I stayed one night at the Herald Square Hotel and but for the state of the shared bathing room, I was impressed considering the room rate. Taking a shared bath room is always an adventure anyway.I was in one of the $89 single rooms ($89! In NY!), which was tiny and clean with a very comfortable single bed. There was a rockin' cold air conditioner in the window, a small nightstand, a safe, a sink with mirror and bar of soap, a hand towel, washcloth, and bath towel, and a clothes hanging bar. The room smelt a little fusty and close (like a small room smells in the morning when someone has slept in it), but since it has a window a/c and not central ventilation, that makes some sense.To get to the shared bathing room (one per floor if I recall), I went down my hall, through a door, left, left again, and down another hall. This was slightly inconvenient in the middle of the night. The bathroom was stifling hot at all hours - seemed like it had the heat on in the hottest weekend in July - and twice I discovered someone had not flushed. Yuck! This is clearly not the hotel's fault, but in any case it made me wary of using the shower. The folks at reception were unfailingly friendly and kind and allowed me to check in as soon as my room was ready - 10 a.m. in this case! The complimentary coffee, tea, and chocolates were handy, as was the free wireless. The location is clearly fantastic. I'll stay there again if I can get one of the single bed en-suite rooms. They are fantastically reasonable in price as well.	
Jul 15 2008	Awesome! Awesome!	When booking online I wasn't sure what to expect....4 girls managed to live quite comfortably in a 2 queen rm for 8 days. It was very hot while we were there and the airconditioning was a godsend. Always fresh towels, friendly staff and very clean. They have laundry facilitys which was great, a nice lounge with tea, coffee, hot chocolate etc. The only thing that sucked was there is only 1 key per room, but you can drop it in the box at the front desk for others to pick up later.Beds were soooo comfortable ,linens nice and fresh.The location was.....AWESOME! You are in walking distance to practically everything and if not...the subway is at your doorstep. Post office is a few doors down, great Irish pub a block away, Pax deli around the corner, which was great (and cheap) for breakfast. I can't wait to come back!	
Jul 7 2008 	not bad	the hotel was not bad. the staff was very kind and the room was quite clean. we could have coffee, tea, chamomile, and also some sweets whenever we wanted. the hotel is really in the centre of the city, and this is another good quality of it, as in new york we found an odissey to move by subway (I wonder why the city still doesn't think of a renew of the subways...they really need it!). for the rest, the room was quite small, but given the price, it was appropriate. the only thing that was not satisfactory was the light: the room faced a wall at a distance of a few meters, and during the day there was almost the same light as during the night.	
Jun 26 2008 	For the rate in NY best choice	Before I went to NY, I stayed one week looking for a hotel and the best price/hotel tha i found was Herald Square. The first day I stayed in a single room, because the queen room wasn't available. The single room was very clean and with a great bed (little old), but the Queen Room that i stayed was new (618). Good location for Manhattan, very close to the subway and to Empire State. If you want to stay in NY and don't want to spend a lot of money in the hotel this is the best choice.	
Jun 26 2008 	Don't overlook a good budget Hotel	Don't be put off by first impressions.Sure the lifts are slow (there's stairs for the impatient!).This is an excellent budget hotel, centrally located for sightseeing (Empire State Building) &amp; shopping (Macy's) &amp; eating ( Little Korea), just request one the newly renovated rooms.We stayed five days after a long trip through Central Asia and Russia and greatly appreciated the hotel's services such as the guest laundry , the internet room and the 24 hour tea/coffee making facilities in the lobby/tea room, not to mention the extremely comfortable bed and the HOT water (which eventually does appear).99.99% of the Herald Square staff were professional and exceedingly polite and helpful with the exception of ......yep, the rude, unhelpful, surly check-in person who couldn't 'find' our reservation made nine months previously.Classic case of &quot;Computer says....... Naaaaaaaaaa!.&quot;So.... don't be put off by first impressions.........(tho' I think those without people skills should be moved to back of house at best)........ the Herald Square Hotel has much to recommend it!	
Jun 10 2008 	Great rates in the city	Considering the rate of $99/night in the city, I knew I wouldn't be given much. The room was small, but clean. There was just enough room for a twin bed and me to walk around it. Overall, I had a good experience. It could use a coat of paint and more outlets (I only had 3)! If you choose this type of room, I would advise you take a power strip. I had to rotate charging my phone, laptop, video camera, and rechargeable batteries. And I had a hair dryer and flat iron to deal with too. My main complaint about this hotel is the shower, they need to do something with the plumbing. I'd set the temperature, then it would turn cold on me and then really hot. Even with the cold water off completely, it would still be cold. That was really annoying. But I know they were doing some work on my floor so I hope that will be addressed soon. If I were to get a good rate as I did this time, I would stay again. It's in a decent part of Midtown and close to everything.	
Jun 9 2008 	Bathroom as big as rest of room	I've stayed at the Herald Square several times over the years, in rooms ranging from bathroom-free to unrenovated queen, and it's always been a dependable budget option. Where else can you get a bed and a bath for $99?Actually, the last time I stayed all there all I got was a bed and a bath. Either I've been extremely lucky and upgraded every time I've been there, but this room was literally a cubby hole--bed, a couple of narrow shelving units mostly occupied by phone, TV etc etc and a bathroom that was as big as the room itself. Since it was just me and just a base of operations, it wasn't that huge a deal, but the lack of storage area was a little disconcerting. Lighting was minimal and there was no natural light--the room's window opened to an empty shaft. Turn around with your arms outstretched and you're going to hit something.Even so, the Herald Square is still one of the best deals in the city...extremely clean, efficiently managed and apparently I'm there enough that some of the desk staff recognizes me now.But next time, either I'll keep my fingers crossed for an upgrade or move a step up on the room chain.	
May 23 2008 	Herald Square Worth the Money	For $250 per night in Manhattan the Herald Square is good value.Be sure to get room with Simmons Health Smart mattress. Good location for Times Square and subways. Our room was clean, there was plenty of hot water, the staff was friendly and helpful and when we had to relocate due to room construction noise close to our room there was no problem whatsoever. Overall, a good experience and worth the money. If you want plush, move up in price.	
May 22 2008 	Basic hotel in a great location	The Herald Square is nothing fancy, but it's in a great part of New York City. I stayed there for one night when I was going to a nearby jazz club. The elevator was very slow, and the first one to arrive had a cart of dirty towels in it. That wasn't really a great first impression. I took the stairs for the rest of the time there and had no problems. The room was small but extremely clean. The lighting in my room wasn't the best, and there was no outlet in my bathroom, but the bathtub was large and the shower had great water pressure and enough hot water. There were plenty of towels, the sheets and blankets were all in very good condition, and the door locked securely. Much to my surprise, the hotel was silent all night, and I got a good night's rest. The staff was friendly, though I did sort of get the feeling I was on my own. For a $20 deposit you can get a hairdryer or an iron (but no ironing board), and there's free coffee downstairs all day. It's not a hotel where I'd want to spend a lot of time, but it's great if you're just looking for a place to sleep and freshen up.Overall, you can't beat the location, and if you book early enough in advance, you can get a room for a good price. I'll stay there again.	
May 21 2008 	Very pleasantly surprised!	After reading some reviews, my new husband and I made it a point to ask for a renovated room and it was well worth it. We were in Manhattan for 2 nights while on our honeymoon and were very happy with the accommodations. We stayed on the first floor in a room with a comfortable bed and a flat screen television, and although it had no view out the windows it was quiet and spacious, clean and nicely decorated. The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful and the coffee machine in the lounge area was a definite plus. The location is great: 2 blocks from the Empire State Building, 1 block from the subway and only a couple more for the train station (we carried a week's worth of luggage with no problem), and right between Broadway and 5th Avenue (we walked to Mamma Mia from the hotel). We are very grateful for the Tripadvisor website! Thanks to all of the honest reviews we had a fantastic honeymoon!	
May 19 2008 	Great hotel for the price	My boyfriend and I spent five nights at the Herald Square and were very pleased with our stay. The room was big and very clean with a functional AC unit that kept it cool and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was big and bright. Although we had no view whatsoever, we were pleased with our stay. The downside was the change in temperature in the water while showering, especially in the AM. The hotel staff were not so friendly, but that was not important to us. TIP-If you need a cab to and from the airport, take a yellow cab and not a private cab as recommended by the hotel, the fee is $45 dollars plus toll compared to $65 plus toll with a private cab. All in all we had a great time, the hotel was in a good location with all tourist areas close by. We would return and recommend it to others.	
May 6 2008 	Great find	This was my 4th trip to NY and I've stayed in some dumps which cost more than the HS hotel, so I was slightly weary about staying here having read some of the other reviews - however I was pleasantly surprised. We booked an unrenovated triple room (2 double beds). The room was small, had a dated decor feel (looked very similar to the pictures on the previous review) and there was not much of a view from the window, but who cares. The most important thing is that the room is clean, secure and the linen is fresh - which it certainly was. The beds were extremely comfortable which is important after a long days shopping. The hotel has a great position (walking distance to Macy's) and the nearby Metro gets you uptown and downtown easily. The people on the door were friendly and the bar next door is great for a glass of wine. There's also a great place called Speedy's on Broadway which is great for breakfast.Overall, considering it's NY and the cost of hotels, this is an excellent budget hotel.	
Apr 28 2008 	ok for what you pay	I stayed in the smallest room available in this hotel on the 6th floor. It was indeed small and the bed was relatively small also, though comfy. The rate was excellent for a midtown hotel. The biggest issue is the heating system-which is automatic and you can't control; meaning that they will operate it whenever they feel it's cold outside and not when you need your room to be warmer. The AC you can control yourself. The view of my room was towards a stairway and the next building is 10 feet away, so you need to light up your room even in daytime. If you open the window, a food smell might come up since there is a restaurant (wine&amp;cheese bar) next door. I think they would need to work a bit on putting individual controlled heating devices and to insure a better ventilation for the rooms-mine felt stuffy if I wouldn't have opened the window a tiny bit at night. Overall, you get what you pay for; nothing fancy here, but good location, friendly staff, free coffee&amp;tea 24/7, free wireless internet conection.	
Apr 23 2008 	Not worth it	I booked this hotel for a birthday weekend for my boyfriend and I. This was the cheapest hotel so I booked and hoped for the best. Overall, I realize its New York, but I definitley don't feel I got my moneys worth. I didn't get a renovated room so I wasn't expecting much. The bed was pretty comfortable but small, we had a double but it was much smaller than any double I had ever seen before. Also the comforter had a stain on that grossed me out, it may have been coffee but eww.Our view was of a fire escape that looked right into our room so the blind was always shut for privacy so our room ended up being pitch black at 10 am. The toilet didn't flush right and it took 15 minutes to get hot water and we had very weak water pressure. The people at the front desk we generally friendly but the biggest problem I had was the guy that held our bags after we checked out. Our bus home did not leave until 5 so the hotel offered to hold our bags. The man came and got our bags and led us to the closet, after stuffing our bags (which had breakables) very carelessly into a cubby, he then demanded us to tip him!!! I reluctantly tipped him because I was scared and didnt want him to mess around with our luggage. After returning to pick up our luggage we went back to the closet and found that our luggage had been moved around the entire closet. The man handed us a few bags and then we realized he forgot about half, which included my laptop. The he handed me a bag upside down and stuff started falling out and the breakables bag had been squished and crunched. Then he had the audacity to ask for another tip!!! I told him no and left. Overall not worth it!	
Apr 20 2008 	Best Value NY Hotel	This hotel was recommended to me by a neighbor. I booked a renovated room with a queen size bed and was delighted with the hotel and room. The room was spotless, well furnished and will appointed. the bathroom was clean and will appointed with piping hot water in the shower.There is free wireless internet, a flat screen TV and importantly, a safe in the room to lock up your valuables.I did not have a view, but as I spent most of my time out of the room, this did not bother me.The hotel is superbly positioned, close to the main Broadway Theaters, Madison square gardens, Times square and all the big shops. The empire state building, Rockefeller Center and Times square are all in easy walking distance. There is also a subway station just around the corner.This hotel is excellent value and I would certainly stay there again.	
Apr 11 2008	great	Very clean and comfortable. Nice rooms with new beds and bedding. Nice plasma tv with cable.Free wi-fi. Great location - within walking distance to many things.	
Apr 10 2008 	Loved It	Great location, The staff were friendly and helpful. 24 hour service which was good. Our room was small but clean. The showers a very small.The hotel is just behind the empire state building, and very close to macys and some major shops. I would recommend anyone to stay there.	
Apr 6 2008 	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm................	We stayed in room 312 for 4 nights. Really pleasantly surprised, clean, safe, freshly painted, flat screen tv and agree with all about the comfort of the queen sized bed!! Although the en suite could do with freshening up a bit it again was clean. The shower was very weak water pressure but was hot all day. We were on the front of the hotel so you can expect to hear some traffic noise, mainly in the morning. Really good location for attractions, times square, empire state etc. Didnt really need any help from staff but seemed helpful enough giving out maps and directions, plus there is someone on the door pretty much all hours through the night which was good. All in all would recommend and stay again if we were to visit NY again.	
Apr 4 2008 	better than adequate	I stayed in room 319 for four nights, paying $735 inc of all taxes. My overall experience was positive. My room was in the un-refurbished section. When I asked about changing, the lady at the desk told me I would have to pay more. Ah well. The room faced a dingy concrete building but was at the end of a corridor so I heard little of other guests. The room was cool at tfirst and then rather warm - I'm not sure which I prefer. The hotel room was perfectly adequate and clean, however, and, as others have described, the bed was extremely comfortable.The pluses are the location (two blocks from the Empire State building), the bed, the relative quiet. The staf were courteous to me.Negatives: The hotel had a low rent feel, given its insistence on a $20 deposit for an iron and a $25 phone deposit (using a phone card, however, is free - I received my deposit back with nothing deducted after making 3 calls to the UK). It makes you wonder who stays here?	
Apr 3 2008 	Very good hotel	Very good hotel for New York. Great location for shopping. My family stayed five nights in two renovated rooms on the 1st floor. They were spacious and clean with comfortable beds, flat-screen TV and lovely marble-tiled bathrooms.We then travelled elsewhere before spending one night at the hotel before flying home. This time we were in two rooms on the 9th floor, which, although renovated, managed to be GRIM. The bathrooms weren't as well decorated and the bedroom furniture, apart from the beds, wasn't very nice.So AVOID THE 9TH FLOOR!!The staff were generally very friendly and very helpful. There's complementary tea and coffee, and although the hotel doesn't offer breakfast, Speedy's Deli a few minutes walk away is very good. We prefer anyway not to take the generally mediocre complementary NYC hotel breakfasts.The lobby area isn't very impressive and the corridors generally are a bit grim, but I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL. It's good value for New York, and the renovated rooms - on the 1st floor anyway - are excellent. P.S. While you're here, check out the wonderful Korean restaurants on nearby 32nd St. (bet. B'way &amp; 5th). Kum Gang San, for example, does great barbecue dishes.	
Apr 3 2008	Book a "New Queen Room" and you'll love it!	We stayed at the Herald Square for three nights in September 2007 and loved it. The hotel building is nothing flash, especially the reception area, but we were expecting this having read the reviews on TripAdvisor. But I was pretty confident that the &quot;New Queen Room&quot; we booked on the hotel website would be adequate and value for money - and it was! The bed was very comfortable, the room huge by NYC standards and the bathroom was immaculate. The room was quiet, the TV was good and everything in the room worked as it should. Other pluses: the laundry facilities, the free tea/coffee/hot chocolate/cookies in the lobby, the fantastic mid-town location and the staff were nice enough too (didn't have that many interations but check-in and check-out were painless). And, on check-out we were presented with a lovely souvenier keyring which was the (unexpected) icing on the cake after a very pleasent and comfortable stay. We paid US$209 before taxes/night which was very reasonable for the standard of accommodation we received. I would definitely stay gain and would recommend to others who want good value for money in an excellent midtown location. I have attached some pictures of the room so you can see for yourself.	
Apr 2 2008 	Great staying: more than a budget hotel!	I stayed at the Herald Square for 5 nights, last week. They gave me a new large queen room, which was stunning: big, very clean, high ceilings, flat screen and a beautiful shower. The bed was so comfortable, the crew always nice and helpful and the location is absolutely the best. It was very different from my idea of 1 star hotel (more three or four, seeing the room) and the price for nyc is quite reasonable, so I don't understand people complaining about slow elevators and few extra services: everything you'll possibly need you will find at the herald square, all the rest is enjoying the city!	
Mar 30 2008 	ILNY	Excellent budget hotel next to everything (walking distance from Empire states Building). Compact room but with everything (plasma TV, desk, iron board and iron, safe, daily room clean and change of towels) very clean room and bathroom. Great facilities (laundry room with dryer, free beverages from coffee machine, internet point in office space, lockers available for suitcases [handy for evening flights].Looked at Tripadvisor hotels reviews before booking the Herald and chose it especially for the cleanliness rating which has not disappointed. Very good experience, the hotel is central to all the places to visit (MET, Central Park, Wall Street, Grand Central, Empire State, Time Square...) either by foot or subway.	
Mar 27 2008 	Great location - wonderful beds!	I've just come back from a 4 night stay in the Herald Square Hotel. I was very impressed with everything about this hotel. The location is superb - located on west 31st Street between 5th and Broadway, the Empire State Building is literally around the corner as is Macy's. Walking distance to so many of the main sights. I walked to MOMA, Times Square, St Patrick's Cathedral etc. The staff were very friendly (thanks especially to Augusta and Karl), the room was immaculately kept and the bed was wonderful - I had 4 fantastic night's sleep. The free tea, coffee, hot chocolate etc in the lobby is a great idea. I will definitely stay at this hotel again as would the friends I travelled with. Well done Herald Square Hotel!!	
Mar 24 2008 	Small but clean and comfortable	I had a single room when I stayed, and the room was very small but had a private bathroom, which is rare in NYC for the price of the Herald Square Hotel. No-frills but very clean - the best part is the bed, I had a FABULOUS night's sleep on the VERY comfortable mattress. FYI, they advertise hairdryer, iron etc. on the website, but be prepared to leave a $20 deposit for each, which you get back when you return it. The lobby had a coffee machine, and in the morning they put out cookies, chocolates, etc, all complimentary.I would absolutely stay at the Herald Square Hotel again!	
Mar 21 2008 	Good hotel!	We just got back from a 2 night stay at the hotel. We did have an older room and I thought the rate was wonderful ($98 a night). I had read many reviews here and thought we were getting a &quot;newer&quot; room until I realized that I had booked just a regular queen. This was okay because we're more for cost than for extra comfort and room that we don't necessarily need right now. Anyway, arrived at the hotel at 2:00. The being buzzed in wasn't a problem as there is a huge window where the receptionist sits right by the front entrance. She said our room wasn't read and would be ready at 3. We went out and came back around 3:15 and it still wasn't ready, so we went out and decided to come back at night when we were ready to go to bed. They rent out lockers for $2 each to leave your luggage in--ours barely fit in 1--2 backpacks, a small duffel bag and a rolling carry-on. Our room was an older room--bed, night stand, small bathroom and a closet. This worked for us though as we only needed the room to sleep in. The bed was comfortable and it was an enjoyable time. I would recommend this hotel. I looked at the rates recently and noticed that they have gone up significantly. I'm assuming they are trying to make up for their renovation rates. About 2 days after we booked our room, I found our same room on their site for $150 more! The staff was friendly, but nothing exceptional. The location is great--very close to so many sight seeing places!!!! We only saw the older room that we stayed in--heard construction noise in the morning, so we're assuming that they are redoing the entire hotel and won't have older/cheaper rooms for much longer. Overall good experience.	
Mar 20 2008 	The Reception Staff Have An Attitude	When I first arrived my single bedroom was an ok size but there ws drilling work so I asked to be moved. They moved me to a much nicer room which had been newly decorated and was pleasant and spacious. When the weekend came I was moved into a shoe box as they had no other rooms available. I HAVE NEVER SLEPT IN SUCH A TINY ROOM BEFORE IN MY LIFE!!!!!!It was so small it should have been free. It was one of the most horrendous experiences I have ever had. I was paying exactly the same amount but was moved into a room quarter of the size of the previous one because of lack of space. The room was so small I had to keep the door open when I was sitting inside it. When paying in advance for my room I was billed for using my free access number calling card from the hotel phone. I asked why I had been charged for this and was told &quot;We are done dealing with that&quot;. Never in my life have I experienced such rudeness from hotel staff. Needless to say, I checked out the next day because of the tiny room and the general moodiness of the front desk staff. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!!!!!!	
Mar 20 2008 	A bit grim	Stayed at the Herald Square hotel for 6 nights and even though it is a cheap hotel but NYC standards, we were still glad to leave. Going by other reviews we must have got an old room as it was old fashioned and depressing. The bed, though, was very comfortable. The hotel in general was also drab and unwelcoming as you have to be buzzed in by staff, and the lift is very, very slow. We did enjoy NYC, but on reflection, should have stayed at a nicer hotel (we booked it solely on the reviews here - everyone has different tastes).	
Mar 10 2008 	I'd Like To Keep This One a Secret!!	Just returned from a belated Valentine's Day weekend with my wife in Manhattan. We selected the Herald Square Hotel a few weeks ago based on a recommendation and made reservations. When we showed up, I must admit, I was a bit apprehensive due to the fact that you have to be &quot;buzzed in&quot; to get into the hotel lobby and the receptionists are behind thick glass. I felt I was in a bank in a bad neighborhood. However, this is a no-frills hotel. There is no concierge, no porters, so I can understand why they would take certain security measures. From what I understand, the hotel is undergoing renovations, and parts of the lobby prove that fact. There is a decent sitting area and another area where you can grab a cup of free coffee along with complimentary chocolates.We discovered that this hotel used to be the original LIFE magazine building, and they have done their best to preserve that heritage with many, many LIFE photographs positioned throughout the lobby &amp; the building.We arrived early on Saturday and were told that our room was indeed ready. The receptionist was very friendly and told us that we have a beautiful room on the 8th floor. Great! Keeping in mind that this building was built in the late 1800's, the elevator ride was an experience. In this day and age of super fast elevators, the elevator here is as slow as molasses. If you're in a hurry, take the stairs. Our room was a surprise. Everything in it looked brand new. From previous poster's pictures, it seems as though our room was just recently renovated. Also, since we were on the top floor, we had 15ft high ceilings, which was a treat. The walls were freshly painted, we had a window view to nowhere, which is fine, as there's nothing to see out any 8th floor window in the city, unless you're on the shoreline. There was a queen sized bed in the room. As for the size of the room, it was fairly small, but with the high ceilings, it didn't matter. The bathroom also appeared freshly renovated, completely tiled, with a brand new tub, and a rain-style shower head. The bathroom was about 1/4 the size of the room, very large! One minor complaint was that the hot water took a little bit of time to get warm, but once it got there, no issue.Room amenities included a 27 inch flat screen TV, a large room safe, a small table, a small desk, and a telephone. At night, there were no strange noises and it was very quiet.The location is very good, right on 31st &amp; Broadway. You're withing walking distance to the Village, Penn Station, Grand Central, the Empire State building, Times Square, &amp; Rockefeller Center.My wife did not want me to write this review as she would prefer to keep this hotel a secret, but fortunately, I believe in sharing.Since it is my understanding that the hotel is currently being renovated and since we were lucky enough to be put on the 8th floor with the higher ceilings and renovated rooms, this is definitely a favorable review. Judging from some of the other rooms shown in previous poster's pictures, I would recommend that if you're coming to this hotel, that you ask for a renovated room.Total cost for a Saturday night stay with all taxes, for a room with a queen sized bed: $196.	
Mar 9 2008	a dump	what a dump, ok so the location is good, but it's no better than a glorified boarding house unless you have one of the upgraded rooms. Lobby is revolting, elevators travel at snail's pace, seating area in the lobby is at youth hostel standard, there is no bar - just a vending machine for coffee. rooms are tiny, bathrooms the size of a closet, Hotel was cold, numerous requests to put the heating on were met with disdain (it;s not cold enough outside yet!!) well it was cold enough inside. Corridors are noisy and unattractive.	
Mar 3 2008 	A good find	this is a good hotel if on a budget. we had a newly renovated queen room which was nice, but on the small side. are window didn't look out to much, a courtyard for all the buildings. The bed was very comfy which was needed after a good day of shopping! The flat screen tv is a nice touch aswel as the aveda soap in the bathroom. the room was very clean and the staff were alright, not the best! the hot chocolate is god down stairs and for location, it was perfect. just off the the main roads so you avoid noise at night and right beside macy's and someother god shops, just a few blocks from madison square etc... i would recommend it o anyone!!!!	
Mar 2 2008 	Good value	Good location, low rates, ugly lobby, slow elevator, great beds.	
Feb 19 2008 	Great Location and Price	The place we used to stay at has been converted to condo's so we were on the look out for a new place. Ended up at the Herald Square Hotel. The location is right by Macy's. The room was small but very nice. The window looks out on nothing... kinda claustrophobic at first, but we got used to it. The bathroom was all newly redone. Make sure to ask for a refurbished room. It has flat screen HD tv and new bed. The elevator was very small and the lobby is nothing to get excited about. But, we felt safe here and rest very well at night. Hardly any street noise at all. For the price and the location it is a great spot, unless you are looking for luxury and extra amenities like a restaurant in the hotel. They said there was wireless internet but I could not get a strong signal in the room. We had to call for help twice, once to learn how to turn down the heat and the other to get hot water in the shower. Both times the response time was minutes and the problem fixed immediately. We highly recommend this place and hope to see more rooms fixed up for the future.	
Feb 9 2008	Nice Stay at the Hereald Square	Booked 1 remodeled queen room directly on the hotels website at $139/night for 4 nights in February. Location is fine as other reviews state so I wont elaborate  although it is in a business district and there are not many good places to eat nearby, but it is easy to use this as a base and go from there.The hotel is undergoing renovations and bins full of building debris were being wheeled through the lobby when we checked in. The lobby is very dull with the exception of the little coffee room off to the right as you walk in. The coffee machine makes horrible coffee, but there is also tea and hot chocolate. A bowl of Hershey kisses and peppermint patties was a nice touch. The coffee room was very clean, as was the first floor rest room. The locker area was in need of some TLC but it provided ample room to securely store our luggage as we checked in very early and our room was not ready.The elevators need help, but I cant see anything being done about them until the hotel is done using them to haul construction materials in/out of the hotel. Our room on the 9th floor was spotless. The bright white fluffy duvets, white sheets, pillowcases and blankets were fantastic and you could tell at a glance they were clean  you dont have to shove a dirty comforter into the closet at this hotel!Room had wonderfully high ceilings, a flat screen tv, desk, table with 2 chairs, 2 queen beds, a large closet with plenty of hangers and luggage racks. Our working windows opened to 31st street. Heat would not shut off so our windows were open for the entire stay but the room was more than comfortable. There is an exposed radiator pipe in the bathroom that is dangerous, if touched it could cause a serious burn; if we had had children with us we would have had to have done something about this. The hotel provided soap; hairdryers can be borrowed at the desk (we brought ours) bring your own shampoo and lotions. My photos are a little dark  our room was bright, clean and cheerful.Staff was friendly and accommodating. The hotel has many security cameras which are monitored from the front desk area. At night you are buzzed/in out by the attendant on duty  there was always somewhere there anytime we came in day or night.This was a good value in a city with outrageous hotel rates, and it was safe; we would return.	
Feb 6 2008 	Great hotel in an excellent position - what a bargain!	We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Herald Square and can honestly say its a fantastic hotel!We had one of their refurbished rooms and it was wonderfully done. Huge 15' ceilings, flat screen TV and a really comfy bed! The bathroom has also been lovingly done with a bath so big you could swim in it. I couldn't belive how much space there was for a midtown hotel.The room was thoroughly cleaned every day and the bathroom came supplied with Aveda tolietries (which I love!).The desk staff are a little brisk, but I don't think this was a problem, it seems to be quite usual in NYC.The position the hotel is in is great, easily walkable to Macy's, Empire State Building and there are plenty of subway stations really close by.I would recommend this hotel, not only to those travellers on a budget, but for any traveller who wants some comfort after long days sightseeing and shopping in the city.	
Jan 29 2008 	Great location!	Room 208 is quite large and one of the newly renovated rooms.Our room was very clean and quiet. Great location. The hotel validates parking around the corner at a rate $21 a day.	
Jan 28 2008 	Great Location	We chose this accommodation after reading reviews in TripAdviser. The location was excellent for our purposes and proved to be very good value for money.The staff weren't particularly friendly but they provided help when requested.The room was very small but that was certainly not a problem - we were there to enjoy the city not the room. It was clean so that was enough.	
Jan 25 2008 	Fabulous!	I stayed here with my husband in May 2007. It was easy to find and in a great location. The bumped us up to a nicer room which was unexpected but very much appreciated. The room was clean and spacious. The bed linens were fantastic. The only thing I would add is a refrigerator. The service was also very good. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family.	
Jan 21 2008 	Great Location Cheap Accomodation	We stayed here from late December 07 til early January 2008. Unlike all the other hotels nearby, Herald Square did not put up their prices for the days surrounding New years. Which is great, considering it is a 15 minute walk to times square. It is very close to empire state, madison square garden, macys and 5th Avenue. The staff are very helpful and the cleaning staff are amazing. Our room was cleaned daily and we got fresh sheets and towels, which is hard to come by in New York for under $300 a night.There is free tea/ coffee/ hot chocolate machine downstairs, as well as a laundry and computer room. There is always staff at the front door making it very safe.The rooms are smallish, and the bathroom is even smaller, but you dont spend much time in your room in a city like New York.I would thoroughly reccomend this hotel. The only advice I would give would be to ask for a newly renovated room, which is much larger and nicer than the old ones, and comes with a plasma television.	
Jan 20 2008 	Fantastic New York Find	We booked our stay at this hotel directly through their own website after reading the great reviews on here, and it certainly lived up to our expectations.The hotel was perfectly situated for both sight seeing and shopping. Based in Midtown is definitely the place to be, only 3 blocks from Macys, 1 block from Empire State Building &amp; just a 20-25min walk to Time Square.We booked one of the Queen Bedrooms &amp; as we were travelling with another couple requested our rooms be close, which the hotel was able to arrange for us. The Queen rooms were perfect for a stay in New York as all you need to do is shower &amp; sleep! The rooms were surprisingly spacious, recently decorated, very clean &amp; modern, complete with a flat screen TV &amp; the most comfortable mattress we've ever slept on (which after a hard days shopping is very much appreciated!)All this &amp; it was the cheapest hotel we found in mid-town NYC.All in all we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone &amp; we would definitely be booking there again.	
Jan 14 2008 	Biggest bargain in NY!	We have just come back from a 4 day stay in the Herald Square Hotel and found it excellent all around.Paying $99 per night we weren't expecting a lot. However we have paid a lot more for a lot less in NY on a number of occasions! Yes the room was small but was fine (who spends a long time in their room in NYC anyway?!) Bed was extremely comfortable, room was spotlessly clean and the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. The free tea and coffee in the lobby was a great extra too.Location is excellent - 2 blocks from Macy's in the middle of town. We will definitely stay again and would highly recommend it.	
Jan 12 2008 	False Advertising - Think Twice Before Staying Here	I found the listing for the Herald Square after searching under Boutiqe Hotels for NYC. The Herald Square website looked great. However, once we got there, we realized that website is in no way representative of the place. The lobby was the best part of the hotel and even then, I found that the fact the staff remained encased behind what I assume was bullet proof plexi glass disturbing. There were some problems checking us in under the last name Carlson. The staff kept mixing us up with Karlsen(stay with me... there is more to the name problem later). We were &quot;upgraded&quot; to a better room and then took the incredibly filthy and noisy elevator to our floor. We entered the room and it was small, which is to be expected in NYC. However, the carpet was dirty and worn out - I have no idea how old it was, but can tell you that neither my sister nor I dared to walk on it in bare feet. The furniture is basically formica cabinetry which IS NOT shown on the webpage. The lights in the room sparked when turning them off and on- very scary. The A/C unit in the room did not work, and despite several calls to the front desk to have it fixed and one vist from a maintenance person, it was never fixed. There are no hair dryers in the room and to get one, you had to leave a $20 deposit. We called the front desk for cups and were told they would bring some, but they never arrived. Not having cups is not a huge deal, but the disregard of our request is indicative of the type of service at the place. On our last night there, we requested a wake up call so we would be sure to catch our flight. The call never came and luckily we woke up on or own in the nick of time. We checked out and again experienced the confusion regarding the last name &quot;Carlson&quot; vs. &quot;Karlsen&quot;. We were assured everything was correct and we happily left this horrible hotel and experience behind us. Weeks later, the Visa bill arrives and we find that were charged not only for our stay (Carlson), but also for the other &quot;Karlsens&quot;. We contacted the hotel to have the error corrected and were treated very rudely by unconcerned staff. We were told it would be fixed, but of course, it wasn't. Many calls later with many rude employees, the issue was corrected. This hotel did not have ONE redeeming quality. There are other boutique hotels in the city that do a much better job. Don't waste your time/money at this place. It is truly awful.	
Jan 8 2008 	Great location	This is a nice little hotel in a great location. it is within walking distance to the empire state building and all the major shops! staff were lovely and very friendly. the only problem we had was that the room we had was absolutely tiny! the bed barely fit into it! other than that though, the hotel was fine and if you are looking for a basic hotel with a good location, its perfect.	
Jan 1 2008 	Unexpected Gem for a budget class hotel	My wife and i stayed in the Herald Square Hotel for 2 nites in december as part of a shopping trip to New York/Boston. We were a little apprehenisive based on some previous reviews, and yes the hotel doesn't look much from the outside, and the foyer is tiny, and the lift looks dodgy! But its the lovely room that makes all the difference..The newly renovated rooms are surprisingly spacious for NY, the bed was huge and very comfortable, there was a plasma TV, lovely bathroom, and all very clean..It had a lovely feel to it overall. The location (31st) was also perfect for Macys, within walking distance.. and also within walking distance to Penn station/Madison Square Gardens, which was handy for our train up to Boston. We also found the staff to be very helpful and efficient.My advice would be; don't be put off by first impressions, this is an excellent budget hotel, ideal for shopping, but make sure to go for the newly renovated rooms.	
Dec 18 2007	Fantastic Value	I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Herald with my husband and 2 teenage children. This hotel provides fantastic value for money. It is ideally situated in Midtown , round the corner from the Empire State building and Macys.Checking in was very efficient and we were upgraded to a new refurbished room. The room was relatively spacious, with 2 large double beds, which were very comfortable indeed with quality bedlinen. There was a flat screen tv and dvd player, and the bathroom was very clean. Hair dryers can be borrowed from reception for a $20 deposit. Additionally, the hotel provided free beverages (tea, coffee, hot choc etc) in the lobby are which is handy in the morning. There is also a utility area with washers and dryers should you need them.We had a great trip and will use this hotel again next time we visit.	
Dec 15 2007 	Great hotel in midtown	We stayed at the HSH from Dec. 12 - 14, 2007. Location is very good. Room was excellent and the bed was the best. Front desk staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful. Would not hesitate to stay here again. Will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends.	
Dec 15 2007 	A real find (but don't tell everyone!)	This hotel is a real gem. As previous reviewers have said, fantastic, comfortable, beds, with sheets changed daily. Also, plenty of fresh, clean, towels every day in the bathroom. Location of the hotel is great, very near to Macy's. I think a hotel nearer Times Square would have been a bit too much for us. Would highly recommend Le Bon Gout deli just around the corner from the hotel for very good and reasonable food also. I can't recommend this place high enough (for the money). Go there, you won't be disappointed.	
Dec 6 2007 	Good Stay	The Hotel was as expected in the reviews. Room was Small but extremely clean. Hotel is Old looking and they are currently doing up all the rooms (2 rooms beside us were being done up and finished within 3 days of us being there).Hotel is well located on 31st 5th and is only 3 blocks from Macys (which the G/f was very happy about). If you like Clean and Cheerful hotels with not much fancy airs and graces then stay here.	
Dec 4 2007 	Second stay even better than the first!!!	We've traveled with another couple to NY several times and stayed at Herald Square twice. We booked the remodeled rooms and would highly recommend! Their reception staff was good the first time but has improved since our last visit - more professional. Monica was extremely helpful, polite and accommodating! A gentleman working on the morning we left was also just as nice and helpful! He recommended a great Italian place around the corner, Bella Napoli - we loved it, great NY charm and very reasonable. Our rooms were very clean and the beds are AMAZINGLY comfortable! I've never slept in a more comfortable bed, other than my own. This hotel is going to great lengths to be a great hotel and they are succeeding. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends and co-workers. It's hard to beat the price or the location, unless you want to be right in Times Square. It's a short walk to wherever you want to go and walking is much faster than a cab. :)	
Dec 3 2007 	A Basic Hotel Centrally Located.	My Husband &amp; I stayed here from Friday, 2nd November for 3 nights. It was our first time to New York so I had booked it upon a recommendation by some colleagues. They had told me that this hotel was very basic but that the location was excellent because a lot of places were within walking distance and more importantly that it's not as expensive as other hotels. I did compare the prices to some other options I looked at on the web and it certainly seemed to be the case, unless of course you managed to get a &quot;special&quot; or one didnt mind some of the tacky places that were on offer. Therefore, on these grounds we decided to try out the Herald Square Hotel. I would now entirely agree with what we had been told in advance; the Hotel is rather old fashioned, nothing glamorous about it. Our room was very basic, very small but clean and it looked out onto a wall and fire escape (no room with a view here!! ). There was some sort of fan or air con system at our window blowing in cold air on the first night, although there was an adequte amount of bed clothes on the bed so we were still warm but standing or walking about in the room it felt cold. We told the receptionist the next day and I think the heating was turned on as it seemed better. During our 3 nights stay, there wasn't really any noise, apart from the air con in the room, so we were grateful for this. In conclusion, we would recommend this hotel if you are just looking to be centrally located in a basic (with TV), clean, very small room without any fancy trimmings at a reasonally priced rate. When I say &quot;reasonably pricedt&quot;, well this is New York we're talking about, so the prices are above and beyond what we'd normally expect to pay. I think it's suitable for visiting tourists who will be on the move throughout most of the day and just want to use their room as a base; somewhere to sleep after a day's shopping and doing all the tourist sites. Just be prepared it's not the Hilton by no stretch of the imagination, that's for sure. :)	
Nov 27 2007 	What a wonderful hotel!	With all of the commotion in NYC at holiday time, it's wonderful to know there are still hotels to be found with this level of charm and comfort AND reaonable rates! I'd stay again in an instant!	
Nov 17 2007 	Scarred for life on dodgey beds!	This hotel has a great location but is expensive for what it is. I hadthe pleasure of meeting the grumpiest receptionist in the world and weboth cut our legs on the pointless bits of metal sticking out of the bottom of the bed. Small room with no natural light which is wierd andsomewhat disorientating. There's better for cheaper around.	
Nov 16 2007 	the truth about the rooms	We stayed at the Herald Square Hotel for six nights in the beginning of November. We booked through the hotel website 'a standard double room' several months ago and that was the only option available for our dates. As they promised early bookers 'the best room selection' I hoped that we'll be getting a new room (having read the reviews below). Our surprise when we opened the door was not a very pleasant one. The room was really small, which is something normal for Manhattan. It had the tiniest window possible overlooking a wall and fire escape stairs that were constantly used so we had to keep our curtains tightly drawn at all times. The biggest problem, however, was that it was dingy, smelly, very basic and soooo old. It looked liked the shabby motel rooms in B movies. The one time light beige furniture had become dark gray from dust and time and the carpet carried all sorts of stains. The only nice thing was the soft bed with clean sheets.I went down to reception and asked if we could be upgraded to a better room since we were staying for almost a week. The rather rude reply was 'Well, you booked the cheapest room, what did you expect.' I explained that their website didn't offer any other option - if it was specifically written that I could book a new room for a higher price I would have done that. Besides I don't think that 270 dollars is exactly cheap - and it certainly is expensive for the kind of room that we've got. The lady agreed to move us to a new room... if we paid another 100 dollars per night. Now, having in mind that the Herald Square as a whole is not very different from a hostel or a pension and it definitely doesn't offer the service or amenities of a hotel (after all it has only one star - a fact that we didn't pay much attention to, but you shouldn't overlook it) I think that 370 dollars is wayyyyyy to much even for a new room. Yes, the location is great but when I checked, the prices of the four star Radisson next door turned out to be similar - 390 dollars and the difference was HUGE!So be careful when you book the Herald Square. It's widely advertised as a budget hotel but the new rooms are overpriced and the old rooms are bearably tolerable. This place is good value only when not too busy (in January for example) but at these times you can find great deals at much better hotels as well. Next time I'll definitely go somewhere else.	
Nov 7 2007 	family from Croatia	We stayed at Herald Square Hotel last September (8 nights).That was our second time in New York City. First time we stayed at Herald Square Hotel, too. What to say - excellent!We'll be back!	
Nov 4 2007 	Great value for money	We have just got back from visiting New York New York, and we found this hotel to be in a fantastic position as it is right near the Empire State Building, which is approx about half way mark of Manhatten Island, the hotel was very clean, the beds were very comfortable and great pillows, our room was big enough as was the bathroom, if your in New York, your not in the room much anyway as there is to much to do and see. We didn't explore the Hotel to much as we were hardly there anyway, and buy the time we got back to the Hotel, we were really in need of that fantastic comfy bed. I would recommended this hotel if you are doing the site seeing bit in the big apple, all the important aspects of the hotel were ther eeg: goodbed and hot water for the much needed shower.	
Oct 31 2007 	honeymoon	We stayed at Herald Square Hotel during our 10 day honeymoon in April. We found the hotel here at Trip Advisor and decided to try it based on the good reviews. Don´t let the impressive entrance fool you. This is a quite simple and average hotel. Look at all the candid camera pictures before you decide to stay here.Got a small and dark room on the first floor with a tiny window towards the tiniest and darkest court yard ever. The room was normal sized, clean and had a newly renovated interior with a large flat screen TV. The bathroom felt new and clean. Our strongest impression about this hotel was how clean they kept the rooms, and not to forget, the location was excellent. Just a block from empire State Building. For honeymooners this might not be the most romantic getaway. But we had a great time in the City anyway!	
Oct 25 2007 	Loved the Herald	My husband and I stayed here while on our honeymoon in the USA we stayed from the 24th September 2007 to the 27th September 2007 3 nights total.We had a great time at the Herald. We had one of the new refurbished Queen bed rooms. The room was nice although it was really small but aparently all New York rooms are small, just so you know what i mean by small, it is smaller than my bedroom at home, it had the queen bed in the middle with two side tables and where the side tables ended thats where the walls were, there was a desk at the end of the bed and only enough room to walk in between, dont get me wrong it was a great hotel, i was just expecting it to be a little bigger by the photos i seen on this site.The bathroom was big, room was clean and had a great bed.If it had a fridge it would have been even better, they invested money into a magnifed makeup mirror I think a fridge would have been a better investment.The facilities were good, free coffee and laundry facilities. Great location. 1 block from the Empire State building and a few blocks to times sqaure.Overall we had a great time at the Herald Square Hotel.	
Oct 22 2007	Excellent location and good value	I chose this hotel because of the price around $230 per night was the best I could find for a hotel with good reviews and location. We stayed 5 nights in a &quot;large double double&quot; - unfortunatly the hotel was full and we couldn't get a new room.The hotel is currently working through renovations. The room we had was on the top floor and hadn't been renovated but it was clean, spacious and the beds are very comfortable. I was just a little &quot;tired&quot; in appearance.The hotel is what I would describe as no frills. There is no conceirge (although I did hear reception booking cars to the airport) or in house restaurant/bar. They do have a lounge area with a free hot drinks machine which is a nice touch.The real plus about this hotel is the location. I cannot stress how good it is for the money. Walking times are 3 mins to the Empire State Building, under 5 mins to Macys, 20mins to Times Square, 2 mins to subway (try it, its much easier than it appears). There are plenty of places to eat within walking distance (there is a restaurant right next door to the hotel but we didn't try it). I can recommend the cafe of the Radisson (2mins) for breakfast - the a la carte is much better value than the buffet upstairs, the basement restaurant in Macys is excellent for dinner and the Heartlands Brewery Diner at the entrance to the ESB is great for lunch and dinner.The only thing I would say is if you are looking for luxury stay elsewhere but my recommenmdation would be to spend the extra shopping etc and stay at the Herald Square.P.S - other recommendations. Try New York Party Shuttles if you want a tour, go down to the TKTS booth at South Seaport to get theatre tickets (we got Grease with a third off - we had been told it was virtually impossible to get those tickets) and get the bus to Jersey Gardens if you want outlet shopping it is so much better than Woodbury Common and very easy to do without buying a tour.	
Oct 14 2007	I recomend	Excellent location.The hotel have everything that we wanted.	
Oct 13 2007	Pleasant stay!	I stayed at the Herald for 6 nights in a single room ... and have to say I was pleased overall.Clean, quiet, Comfy bed, free HBO, free coffee in the basement, excellent central location, fairly priced; you can't go really wrong!However there clearly was a problem with my smoke alarm, which went off several times during my first time... and i was told to &quot;just leave my window open&quot;, &quot;you don't want to wake up with your room full of smoke&quot;, and yes that sounds kinda scary. Plus I had to get dressed to go to reception to fet someone to fix that up... This wasn't very professional.4/5	
Oct 1 2007	Good Value	We were pleasantly suprised here, expected a fairly basic hotel given the price (we paid $200 for &quot;new&quot; double). The location was brilliant, we had no view but this meant it was quiet. New bed, linens and flat screen tv. Free coffee everyday and biscottion Sunday.Staff extremely helfpul, our toliet overflowed a bit and someone fixed it within minutes.Some rooms in the hotel are apparantly a bit tired but ours was great and again for NY a great price and location. Would definately recommend paying the extra for a new room.Would stay again.	
Sep 19 2007 	Great price 	I was pretty bummed out after researching rates on hotels in NYC (Manhattan) for 2 double beds for 4 adults. I was anticipating we would have to spend around $300 per night for a decent place when we were going to be out on the town most of the time. Then, my father-in-law brought this hotel to my attention. Upon reading their website, finding a rate of approximately $220/night, and the location we decided this was what we were looking for. We booked about 3 months in advance to make sure we got a room here.Our room was on the ninth floor and it was toward the back of the building. There was a window in the bathroom and along the same wall in the room and both looked out at another brick building. Even though the view was nothing, it was quiet at night! Considering what I had read about the size of rooms in Manhattan, I thought we had quite a bit of room to move around. The bathroom was small but nothing less than what I expected. I think we were in one of the newly renovated rooms as it was nice and had a flat-screen television. My only complaint would have been the 1 elevator that serviced the ninth floor was slow. We had one time where we waited about 10 minutes for the elevator after pressing the button before it made its way to the top.The location on 31st street between Broadway and 5th Av. was very nice. It is 2-3 blocks South of the Empire State Building and 2-3 blocks East of Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. We were within 2-3 blocks of several subway stations. There is a major subway station at Herald Square (31st and Broadway) where several trains stop to get you to where you are going. Several things are nearby including the Manhattan Mall and Macys. At night, the store fronts on 31st Street all have the metal fencing over the windows which kind of make the area dark and unattractive, but during the day it looks much better. Dont let this scare you if you get there past dark.Overall, it reminded me of hotels in Europe that Ive stayed at (local ones, not chains). It provided us with a nice, clean, comfortable room. There really are no extra amenities, like a continental breakfast, shampoo or hairdryers, but we werent looking for that or were willing to forego that for the more favorable rate. I would say that it met my expectations. I would recommend staying here if you are comfortable without many of the amenities of a chain hotel but looking for a nice place to stay with as good of a location as any at a decent rate in Manhattan!	
Sep 15 2007 	Super Clean! Super Value! Super Location	This hotel is New York City's best kept secret. Seriously. Start with the great prices. Add in the amazing location. To top it off, our room was HUGE, the bathroom HUGE (bigger than friend's entire studio apartment), and the entire room was immaculate. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom stocked with plenty of towels and Aveda soap. There was even a flat panel TV and free HBO! What else could you ask for? Sure the lobby is small, and the elevators tiny, but these are very easy to overlook. I recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget in New York. I will definitely stay here again.	
Sep 14 2007 	Loved this place!	First, I was a little unsure about this place because it was in a great location but was only $99 a night. That's unheard of for NYC. Also, the website was kinda sketchy and well, interesting. The hotel is 2 blocks from the Empire State building, and so close to everything like shops and subway stops. The room itself was kind of small but the bathrooms were rather large and the bed was SO comfy! My room had a little tv in it but my sisters had a very nice flat screen. The desk staff was very nice and gave us lockers to store our stuff early. Parking was only $21 for overnight (also unheard of), just make sure you get your ticket stamped by the hotel. Otherwise it would be $50- $60.  Will definitely stay here in the future!	
Sep 13 2007 	Great Value!	Stayed 21 - 25th Aug 07. We had a renovated room on the 9th floor which was great 2 x big and really comfy beds, nice bathroom with powerful shower , flatscreen TV, could not fault the room for the price we paid.There was some work going on at the hotel, with much of the exterior of the building covered in scaffold and work being done to the entrance area, howeever this did not interupt our stay at all.Great location, walking distance to Times Square, Empire State, Manhattan Mall, Penn Station etc.. plus bars, deli's close by also.I'd Definately stay here again.	
Sep 3 2007 	All I can say is WOW!	Man, what a place. I had read some of the other reviews and can only say that the nay-sayers got it wrong. The hotel is in this fabulous location, the room I was in was newly re-furbished with a flat panel TV in the room, a free internet connection, and a bed that it to diw for. I slept better there then I do at home. No kidding, the bed is like floating on a cloud. And the bathroom is magnificently appointed and beautifully maintained. I wish I had furnishing like that at home. The staff was warm, friendly and very responsive to all of my needs and requests, they helped me with direction to different places of interest, theater tickets and advice on the best places to eat in the area. An area that is centered in one of the best places to shop in the city. the hotel is billed as a bargen hotel, and price wise it is, but the condition of the rooms, the staff, the free internet, coffee and breakfast bar, and staff make it more like the resort hotels of days gone by. Will I be staying there again? and will I recommend it to my friends and co-workers? You bet I will. In my opinion The Herald Square Hotel is one of the best kept secrets in New York, and I'm spreading the news to everyone I know.	
Aug 31 2007 	What a great find!	The great location is only part of the reason I would recommend this budget-price, but semi-luxury hotel. We have just returned from 5 nights there and we booked the refurbished rooms specifically (to avoid the room 'lottery' that other reviewers spoke about).We were both astonished to see the luxurious modern style of the room when we opened the door. Everything was brand new and the furnishings and fittings throughout were more reminiscent of a 4-star hotel (not quite sure how they get 1 star?). The shower pressure was quite low and took a while to heat up - but we were on the 9th (top) flr.The cable TV (HBO), quiet air conditioning and the wonderfully comfortable bed made for a welcome oasis after being on your feet for 12-hours in 90 degree heat!To finish things off in style - they even provided us a stretch limo for the same price as a cab, when we had to leave to go back to Newark Airport at 4am!Can't speak more highly of this place - loved it!	
Aug 26 2007 	a great place to stay	Just returned from 5 days at the Herald Square and want to write a review of gratitude. I was very surprised when I read the last few reviews. They could not have stayed at The Herald Square. The rooms at The Herald are amazingly upgraded and equal to rooms at other hotels for twice as much. They are spacious with super comfortable bed, flat screen TVs and quality fixtures and finish work. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location is centrally located. I also love the theme of Life Magazine, it is a museum experience to see the Life Magazine collectable covers. The Herald Square is the best kept secret in the city. low prices for a high price experience.i can't wait til the lobby is complete and look forward to staying there again soon. I highly recommend The Herald. Ron, newport beach ca.	
Aug 21 2007	price of a hotel service of a youth hostel	I've stayed there for a short period of time and I was really disappionted by their service. They charged you by hotel's standard but the service is rather appalling, I would say, worse than some friendly and nice youth hostels. When I checked in, the reception was rude and impatient. If you arrive early, you have to put your luggage in the locker room. But be warned. No one would come to help you. You have to sort out everything on your own. The single room is tiny (the photo shown on their website looks deceptively larger). I understand the location is their plus but with such bad service, I would never stay there again.	
Aug 18 2007	Too Little	Spent a week at this hotel. Room quite small, barely larger than the queen size bed. Long counter in room with upright chairs, but no comfy chairs to read or watch tv. Wi-Fi seemed to work well. No window in room -- apparently all rooms except the few in the front have no windows. Wall a/c unit, roars loudly enough to keep you awake even on lowest setting; when a/c off, room gets stuffy quickly. Hotel in midst of very slow renovations, so there is pervasive, sharp odor of paint and carpet adhesive everywhere.Best features: maid service and bathroom -- but bring your own shampoo. Lobby features include indifferent clerks behind bullet-proof glass walls and nice self-service coffee bar. Hotel appears to target European tour groups. Very convenient to Herald Square subway station, but it is a long slog on foot to Penn Station.	
Aug 14 2007 	OK but a bit of a lotto on rooms!	We entered this hotel with some reservations having read poor reviews. Although the reception is behind glass I didn't find this a problem. They were currently painting/decorating so there was scaffolding outside and wet paint inside. We were initially put in room 604. On entering the room it was disappointing. VERY small, old and tired looking bed sheets, no wardrobe, a light that didn't work, incredibly dark and the toilet and sink drained very slowly. We had no point of reference so spent the first night in this room. It was clean. In the morning we asked if there was a bigger room and the lady in reception seemed to know of how bad 604 was. We had to check back into the hotel at 2pm (a little inconvienent) and she said she had a much better room. We then got room 614. It was bigger, had a wardrobe, had excellent bedding and had a much better bathroom. However, the phone did not work (which when someone is banging the door next to yours for a long time at 5am, it is a little worrying that you can't contact reception!) Do not expect a view from any window here!! Also be aware there was no hair dryer in the rooms.Friends of ours checked in 24hours after us, they had room 10. They had booked on-line at the same time as us and were paying the same rates. However they were upgraded due to lack of rooms to room 10. This was a very nice room. Recently decorated, big bathroom, flat screen TV, hair dryer and much more spacious. This room is only approx $30 a night more and well worth the extra money!Location was good and I am sure that for the price in NYC it was a good deal.	
Aug 12 2007 	So-So	The location is not bad, but could be better. From our perspective, we would have preferred to be closer to Times Square or the 42nd Street area. The street that the hotel is on (31st Street) is a bit dark and run-down and several buildings were undergoing renovations, including the hotel itself, making it a somewhat depressing street.The lobby was being painted while we were there by an extremely slow painter, who seemed to be painting just one wall every other day, and so the lobby had an unfinished appearance throughout our one-week stay. The lobby itself is small and cramped and the persons at the front desk are insulated from the hotel guests by what appears to be reinforced glass, which was a bit off-putting and impersonal (this is the first time we had ever seen a hotel lobby of this type in all our travels, and it was more suited to a bureau de change in a dangerous area). Some of the staff were a bit rude and unhelpful, while others were helpful. There is a laundry area on the ground floor with fairly new washing machines, but you have to purchase tokens to operate the machines. The sign in the laundry says that detergent is included in the price of the tokens, but when we enquired about this, the person on duty said that the machines dispensed detergent automatically, and so we did not need to bother with this. Unfortunately, this was just not true, and so our clothes went through the wash cycle without detergent, which was a bit infuriating.The toilet clogged up on the first night, but an attendant came within 5 minutes and fixed it immediately. The hot water came and went and it was difficult to maintain a constant temperature. To our amazement, around the 3rd day of our stay, the housekeeper/maid left a message on our room telephone complaining that we were not keeping the bathroom clean, which we found objectionable, not only because it was an exaggeration (all that happened is that we left a few towels on the floor and personal effects on the vanity counter), but also because we did not appreciate paying for a hotel room with a daily cleaning service and then being told to clean up the bathroom in order to help out the maid. This is the first time we have ever experienced this type of complaint in any hotel anywhere in the world in the last 20 years and we found the message to be unpleasant and impolite.The room was relatively small (we were in one of the deluxe double-bed rooms), but it was clean, and the beds were comfortable. The room was bit dark because the window was small, and the room lighting was inadequate. The air-conditioner worked reasonably well. The bathroom was small and it was difficult to use the sink because of the cramped layout.The elevators were old and slow, and only one went to the top floor. There was no breakfast service.We would not stay at this hotel again because its bad points outweighed its good points. We stayed at the Metro on 35th Street in 2005, and we had a much better experience for more or less the same price. In fact, the price of a double room at the Metro in 2005 was lower than the price of a double room at the Herald Square Hotel in 2007, and the Metro is a better hotel and you get a daily continental breakfast	
Aug 3 2007 	A great budget hotel	At $99 a night, booked on-line on their web site, this hotel was not only a bargain but was satisfactory in every way. I had a small older room but it was spotless, air-conditioned, had a in -room safe, super comfortable bed, the bathroom was clean and the towels changed every day ...in short, everything I needed as a single traveller. The view was my only complaint as it looked into a dark inner court which did not allow for a lot of sunlight. This concern vanished though everytime I thought about the price and it was quiet, not facing the street. Coffee, tea, and hot chocolate were available for free 24hrs. The location was also great, three blocks from Penn Station and about 1/2 a block from 5th. Ave. and close to subways and buses. The neighborhood seemed perfectly safe and there were several places to eat nearby. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.	
Jul 31 2007 	my trip in nyc	very good hotel in the full center of manhattan and midtown.central.just a regret = personnal is not sympatical.	
Jul 30 2007 	Perfect location clean 	I stayed for 3 nights and 4 days at the hotel and it was clean and comfortable..the location was great as it was on 7th Avenue which is near to Penn Station &amp; Madison Square Garden...it was also close to the Empire State Building on 5th Avenue..Times Sq is on 7th Ave too and is abt 10 blocks away and i enjoyed taking the walks as the weather was lovely when i was there so that i could take in the sights and scenery...The price was reasonable and not too expensive so that the rest of the budget could go into my shopping sprees, food and souvenirs...-Dianne from Bermuda-	
Jul 28 2007 	Best Value!	I booked a small single room and they upgraded me to the Queensize room for no extra charge. The staff were so friendly and nice! I had to leave my bag and luggage in a locker room because check in wasn't until the afternoon, but the guys at the front took the time to go through maps and tell me what sites I should go visit while I wait. I was travelling alone and I felt very safe at this hotel, its walking distance to so many great places. It might not be ideal for everyone, but as a traveller on a budget I can't think of anywhere better.	
Jul 22 2007 	Very Happy with our Stay	I was really unsure where to stay in NYC, I didnt want to spend a ton of money but didnt want to stay in a dump either. A friend told me about the Herald Square Hotel and I must say it lived up to my expectations. Our room was relatively spacious with 2 very comfortable double beds. The bathroom could have used a little renovation but not too bad. The room had a flat screen TV with a DVD player and plenty of closet room. My only complaint about the room is that there wasn't an over head light near the closet so it was hard to see inside your suitcase at night time. The lobby had free 24 hour coffee and hot chocolate and at various times cookies or candy. Also, the parking garage nearby gave what I considered a great rate - $21/day! I will definately stay here again when returning to NYC.	
Jul 8 2007 	Lovely Hotel in a Fantastic Location	I stayed here for 4 days at the end of June, begining of July and loved it! The location is fantastic! 2 blocks away from the subway, close to shopping (macy's, victoria's secret, manhattan mall, etc) and major sights (empire state building, madison square gardens, etc). The hotel's facade was under construction during our stay, but the interior was lovely (despite the glass-encased front desk/reception). They have a lovely breakfast area where they offer free coffee/tea and sweets such as biscotti, peppermint patties, wafers. There is also a lounge with comfortable couches. There were also other things that made the hotel convenient such as on-site laundry facilities, an ATM, and lockers for those who arrive before check in, or have to check out way before they actually depart the city. The staff was also quite nice. The rooms were simple, beds were heaven, pillows were plush, and everything was clean! Windows were small, and the views weren't anything to write home about, but there's air conditioning and adequate lighting within the room itself. I stayed in the queen room and found it spacious! I have no complaints about this hotel. The price for the quality and location make this hotel a huge huge bargain! I would definitely stay here again!	
Jul 4 2007 	Charming hotel	Had a lovely stay at the Herald Square hotel in NY. Choose it because of the location in the centre of the city close to a.o. Empire State Building, very good price, and experiences from other travellers on this website. It is a simple, small hotel, but everything you need is there. Room and the rest of the hotel are lovely decorated by pictures from Life magazine. Had a very comfortable bed and very clean room. The view from the room was a wall, but you're only there to sleep. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to others.	
Jun 27 2007	Great hotel great location	The HSH was great! Is was one of the cheapest hotels I could find in NYC and I was so glad when I got to my room. I didn't have much sunlight but that wasn't so bad. I had a bathtub, free cabel-tv and a great bed and great pillows, what more could you wish for? The facilities in the hotel were great also, an ATM, laundry-room, internet-computer, free coffee (great coffee too!) 2 phonebooths and a soda-machine. No breakfast or dining but the Dunkin' Donuts is just around the corner. I'm not used to staying in hotels but for this money, I would stay in this hotel again if I even go to NYC again...and I will.	
Jun 26 2007 	Good NY hotel for the price	I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and was quite pleased with what we got. Hotels in NY are generally horrendously expensive for not very much, so we were quite happy with the price and location. It was only a couple of blocks from the Empire State and a short walk from Macy's. We generally didn't spend very much time in the room (we were in New York, after all) but it had A/C and cable TV (although the channels tended to drop in, drop out a little bit...) The room was very clean, although a little small - but after travelling in Europe a pleasant surprise. Also, they gave us a 10% student discount, which I thought was great - you have to book through their website though. Overall, I would recommend it to others :)	
Jun 18 2007 	single room	I stayed in a single room with bath at the cost of $99 a night. This is a great price for NYC. When I booked this room I was told it was a very small room, so I was prepared. The room itself was in the back of the hotel on the 5th floor. It was about 8 X 10 feet in size plus a private bathroom with a tub. The room was very basic, it did have a window that opened on to a air shaft. It allowed light to enter, the view was to a solid wall of a building. My bed was very comfortable and had only one pillow. The room was very clean. I did have one instance of a bug, when I called downstairs they offered to change my room and spray.The staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful. I did enjoy the tea and candies in the entrance area. The hotel had two elevators. A great location, very close to Penn Station. I do recommend this hotel. Be prepared for a very tiny room if you choose a single. I will stay here again.	
Jun 15 2007 	An Affordable Hotel for a Family looking for Adventure in NYC on a Budget	I am a faithful tripadvisor user and trusted the reviews on this site and, boy, they did not let me down. The Herald Square Hotel was an affordable option for a single mom and her children. Not only did we save money, but we did so in comfort, cleanliness, and with a great location.As mentioned before, the beds are pure heaven and we all got five great nights of well-needed sleep. Our room faced the street and there was never any distruptive nights due to the noise from the street. The bedding and linens were equally nice and VERY clean. I was shocked when I got there and found that each bed had FOUR fluffy, comfortable pillows. I am a person who sleeps with at least two pillows and was estatic to see I would have two pillows without having to call down to the front desk.The room itself was a spacious double room that was well-maintained and cleaned daily. My kids had plenty of room to move around and I felt comfortable with them playing on the carpet with their toys. I was in one of the rooms that had not been refurbished, but the bathroom was fine. It was clean, had plenty of hot water, and fabulous fluffy white towels. One day we left the room early and came back for a mini rest pretty early in the day. By 9:00 am our room was already cleaned. That was a nice surprise, too. The hotel is located at 31st and 5th and has two convenient subway stops that are easily walked to. For eating, there are Speedy's, Dunkin Donuts, and Empire Pizza, all for a quick bite to eat. There are even two pharmacy stores (CVS and Duane Reade's) close by. With two kids, it seemed I had to pop into a pharmacy at least once a day...allergy medicine, snacks, etc.I also have to say that the staff was really friendly. The staff always greeted us and asked how our day was and what we planned/had done for the day. I was impressed because they always greeted my children. We enjoyed the complimentary coffee, hot chocolate, and biscotti. I highly recommend the Herald Square and plan to stay there again if I am lucky enough to visit the Big Apple again. This was a very FAMILY FRIENDLY hotel. love the NYC and the Herald Square.	
May 27 2007 	Excellent budget hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Herald Square Hotel for 3 nights in May and I can't recommend it highly enough. Having booked it as a budget hotel for a price much lower than I'd found anywhere else I was a bit worried about what we'd find when we got there. However the room, which had been recently refurbished I think, was a decent size,spotless and newly carpeted. The bed and bedding were really comfortable and clean. The private bathroom also spotless with bath and shower and clean white fluffy towels provided every day (bath was slightly short but not really a problem!). We had a room-safe, wardrobe with sliding mirrored doors and a little dressing table with large mirror and chair. Also bedside cabinets and cabinet with TV and storage underneath (old TV but we hadn't gone to NY to watch telly!). Nice little lounge downstairs in the foyer and area with tables and chairs in case you wanted to pop out to nearby bagel place and bring back breakfast, and a free hot drinks dispenser with coffees, hot chocolate, teas etc , tea bags of every variety and even a bag of Hersheys Chocolate Kisses or Mints to help yourself from!We found staff to be friendly and helpful, one arranged for the shuttle service to collect and take us to the airport when we left.The hotel is 5 minutes from the Empire State Building (go when it opens at 8am and you will be first in there and no queues) and within easy walking distance of lots of places you want to see, subway also. Maceys is round the corner and leave the hotel, turn right and walk down the street and you will find a friendly Irish pub (O'Reillys) serving nice food at reasonable prices.I would definately stay there again. Actual location of hotel is down a slightly dark and dingey looking side-street but we felt safe enough in the area walking back at night.	
May 22 2007	great memories	This hotel, for my husband and I, was what we wanted! A place to go in, dropp our gear go out and paint the town red and then finally sleep. Its hotel was great for people who are likley to be staying out in the city mainly.The bed was fantastic. It was clean and so comfortable I miss it. Its not a lap of luxury but you do find it a nice surprise as it has what you need from a standard hotel in it. The staff were all honest and helpful I would return back to it next time.	
May 21 2007 	Wonderful Hotel!!	My husband and I recently stayed at the Herald Square Hotel (May 18 - 20) and it was a wonderful experience!! We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms and were very pleased with our experience. We arrived at the hotel at 1:30pm and were able to check in even though check-in was not until 3:00pm. Our room was spotless! It was smaller than we expected, but very, very clean. I have stayed at many hotels, including the Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons, and this hotel room could compete with those in terms of cleanliness. When it was time for us to leave, the hotel called us a car service, which arrived on time to the minute! The hotel location was also great!! It is near a shopping mall and many restuarants and subway stations. For New York City at this price, I think this is the best you are going to find. My husband and I will not hesitate to stay here again!!	
May 20 2007 	Medium opinion	Good location. Average (but clean) room. The staff is not very friendly. It is strange to find the reception behind a glass wall (as in an adminstration). Breakfast is not included and there is no breakfast on site. (The only service provided is a free coffee/tea/chocolate machine). We decided to buy our breakfast in a very good bagel's shop on 5th avenue, to bring it back to the hotel and eat it in the lounge using the free coeffee machine.	
May 17 2007 	Totally unacceptable hotel experience	I recently stayed here for four nights, at an average cost of over $200.00 per night, largely based on favorable recommendations, the hotel's charming website, and the location. What a total disappointment! The hotel door was locked when I arrived at mid day, and I had to attract a staff member's attention to &quot;buzz&quot; me in. The two surley receptionists were in a cubicle behind what appeared to be bulletproof 1 inch thick plexiglass, with a tiny slot at the bottom to slide your payment through. My7th floor room was dark, cramped and equipped only with a small TV mounted near the ceiling, almost impossible to see except from the bed. The window opened for scant ventillation to the stuffy room, but the neighborhood is noisy, and the open window made it more difficult to sleep. The only good thing about the room was a comfortable queen bed. Housekeeping did a good job daily as well. But the reception staff remained surly the entire time. To get a hair dryer, they required a $20.00 deposit, with firm instructions that it was not refundable unless the hair dryer was returned in person to the reception desk. As a final insult they failed to call a cab for me, as promised, and I nearly missed my flight to JFK. BEWARE! This place is a dive, overpriced and poorly represented here and in their overly optimistic website. Never again!	
May 14 2007 	Perfect for first time to New York!	I had a great experience at this hotel last August. It was my first time to New York and I am poorer than dirt, but also like my privacy so didn't want to stay in a hostel. I had a very small room with an ensuite bathroom, TV, free wi-fi, and safe. It was everything a young single girl traveler would want. Located in Mid-town Manhattan so I was able to walk everywhere and there was also several subway stations nearby. I felt completely safe in my room and the surrounding area. They have free coffee in the morning, soda vending machines, lockers, and you can even book tours right there with them. The staff at the front were very courteous, but also very efficient and didn't make me stand around waiting for very long. Also when I arrived there was a nice, little old man walking around the lobby telling the story about when the building used to be the newspaper headquarters and handing out keychains as a gift to the new guests. This is a budget hotel, but I feel like you really get a good deal here and I would certainly stay here again! Just don't go here expecting room service and all those extra amenities and you'll be completely satisfied!	
May 11 2007 	Best Value Hotel in NYC!	I stayed at the Herald Square Hotel from May 8-May 10 and I was very impressed by my hotel room, and by the service at this hotel. Though the Herald Square is a one star budget hotel, and the decor of the hotel itself isn't that great, the new queen rooms are very nice and extremely clean. There was a small blood stain on the bathroom wall when I arrived, but I reported this to the front desk and it was taken care of immediately. I also tried to take a shower one afternoon and noticed there was no hot water, so I called down to the front desk and hot water came through immediately afterwards. This is the best valued hotel in NYC, and as long as they don't raise their prices, I will continue to stay here (in their new queen rooms only) everytime I'm in NYC!	
May 7 2007 	Comfortable clean and superbly located	I was very impressed by this hotel. I would echo the observation that if you come to NYC for the hotel experience, you should go elsewhere, but if you're looking for a convenient base offering value for money then you probably won't find much better than this.I was upgraded on arrival to a 'refurbished' room, whatever that means. The room was small and on the ground floor at the back of the hotel, but it was tastefully furnished. Amenities included a large flat-screen TV, a safe and a clock radio. The bathroom had a bath/shower. The room was clean when I arrived and kept clean during my stay.The Herald Square is only three blocks from the Empire State Building and well positioned for other attractions. For an energetic walker it's well within striking distance of Central Park in the north, Ground Zero and Battery Park in the south, Broadway to the northwest and the UN to the east.Nothing spoiled my experience of the Herald Square. A broken lamp was soon fixed. The air conditioning from a next-door building outside my window was loud but I used earplugs and was not bothered.All in all, I would go back in a flash, and I would recommend it to others.	
May 1 2007 	Great Stay at The Herald Square	We have just returned from a fantastic week in New York and a great stay at the Herald Square Hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room (which was just a standard) was very clean and looked like it had recently been decorated. We had plenty of room to store our cases and shopping bags and the bed was very comfy. On the downside the air con was quite noisy as was the street outside - but we didn't go to New York for a peaceful holiday! Would definately stay there again.	
Apr 18 2007 	Found this hotel through trip advisor-very impressed!	A perfect hotel - great staff, great value for money, great room and location. I searched through trip advisor and we were over the moon with our stay. We got upgraded on arrival - it made our stay!	
Apr 18 2007 	Nothing amazing comfy bed good value!!!	I found the Herald Square to be realy good value. Its nothing amazing but the bed was really comfy, our room was very clean and the staff were very nice. Its in quite a good location, close to some of the best attractions so good if you are short one time!Good for the price especially for new york!	
Apr 16 2007 	not bad	We stayed here around Christmas time. The location is excellent,with easy access to the subway. The rooms are OK for a budget hotel,but our hall was being worked on during our stay {noise and paint fumes}.No breakfast,but there are many great places around. Centrally located,and historically significant {the old Life Magazine building}. MUCH cheaper than most Manhattan hotels. Friendly staff. All in all,not bad {especially for the price}.	
Apr 5 2007 	Very pleased overall	Stayed 5 nights at the Herald Square, starting Mar 17 (St Patrick's Day, right after a blizzard). We chose it because of the price, location and reviews, and we were not disappointed. The room seemed smallish at first, but was very comfortable and clean, and the bed was great. It looked attractive and had lots of good lighting. The steam heat made some noise, but didn't spoil our sleep. The first one awake can use a small cozy lounge beside the lobby to avoid disturbing their roommate. Bathroom was clean &amp; functional too, with fresh towels every day. Lots of places to eat nearby, either down Broadway or towards Lexington, including a trattoria at 31 &amp; Lex that was reasonable and very good. Subway stops are very convenient in both directions, as are busses. We felt very safe in the neighbourhood, didn't see anything to alarm us any worse than at home. The street was quiet at night, but only half a block from Broadway.Only complaint about the hotel - there were construction noises from the renovations starting at 7AM. Overall, we were very pleased and would gladly return.	
Apr 2 2007 	Right place right price and clean.	Here's the question: Have you come to New York to stay in an hotel or to see and experience the city? If you plan to hang out in the room, you'll probably feel a little disspointed in this hotel. But frankly, if you're the kind of person who stays in the hotel room, you aren't coming to New York for the right reasons, are you?This hotel ticks all the important boxes (clean, safe and central)and -what's more- is highly affordable. That's rare. Which makes this hotel rather wonderful. The only &quot;complaint&quot; (it's not even that..just a gripe) is that staff behind the counter seemed a tad stressed out by life. Ok, I guess that's a fact of life when you're checking in 30 to 40 people every day. If you can handle yourself socially and you stay polite, the staff are helpful.	
Apr 1 2007 	Can't go wrong with the Herald Square	We stayed at the Herald Square for a couple of nights (March 16&amp;17). We had gotten excellent feedback from friends who'd stayed there. We got an excellent rate through Expedia. We got there early and though we couldn't check in early 'cause the place was filled to capacity, we left our luggage in a locker for 50 cents. We thought the room would be small because 1)it wasn't one of the renovated rooms and 2)we'd heard the horror stories of rooms the size of walk in closets in NY, but to our surprise, the room was quite spacious and nice. The bed, like everyone said here, was just fabulous, soooo comfortable and very clean, as was the room. The bathroom was clean--though it didn't have a hair dryer :( The water was nice. The TV was OK, many channels to choose from. There was a safe in the room. If I were to complain, the only thing was that the heater was a little loud at night. But other than that, the room was quite comfortable. I tried a few of the freebies in the lobby (can't go wrong with Van Haute coffee). Also good hot chocolate, latte &amp; mocchaccino. They had a wide variety of teas and also biscottis-- all included, which was nice. There's also a Dunkin Donuts right in the corner. Staff was extremely nice and helpful. They recommended a couple of places for lunch (a cafe called A Bon Gout right on 5th and 31 was particularly good, with hot and cold buffet, good coffee and pastries and even beer!) The location of the hotel couldn't be better. We walked to a concert at Madison Square Garden. Macy's and the Empire Estate Building are within walking distance and many other NY landmarks as well. All in all, I don't think we'll stay anywhere else if we ever visit NY again, especially considering the rates. ;-)	
Mar 27 2007 	First class accommodation	Just returned from New York stayed in the Hearld Square. Good central location just around corner from Macys/Empire State Building. Within easy walking distance from Time Square. 34th Street Subway a block awayAccomodation first class got upgraded to Queens Room. The room was large and very well finished. The bed was particulary comfortable it was hard to leave in the morning. Flat screen TV with film channels,hairdryer and large safe. The rooms were cleaned daily to a very high standard. Excellent coffee facilities with biscuits in lobby. This is all you need as area is well served by cafes/resturants and delis. Staff were all very helpful and when i go back to New York i will not be staying any where else given the reasonable price.Look forward to returning to the Hearld.	
Mar 26 2007 	great place	this hotel came highly recommended by my tenants.i was looking for a place that was central to everything.and affordable. this place was right on the money the rooms have a cozy feel. the renovated rooms are lovely. but because they are more expensive than the rooms that have not been renovated there only worth shelling out the money if youre going to be spending more time in your room than outside. or if youre looking for a marriot hotel feel on a budget. the staff is super friendly and helpful. the hotel gives you an overall feeling of home. nothing here is too comercial.	
Mar 14 2007 	Small but perfectly formed and what a bargain!	Small but perfectly formed and what a bargain! With hotels in New York generally expensive we were a little apprehensive about our $99 a night double room in the Herald Square Hotel but were pleasantly surprised, the room was clean, bed comfortable, private bathroom always hot water (although sometimes a litte too hot!) and cable TV. The room was fairly small but perfectly adequate for our 4 night stay and the free coffee machine in the lobby was great for warming up after the sightseeing. The hotel's located in midtown and convenient for the subway and sights, and although we preferred some of the areas downtown for nightlife it was only a cheap cab ride away.	
Mar 5 2007	Convenient friendly clean. Bargain!	Me and a friend stayed here in Sept. '06, both of us from UK. We'd both separately been to NYC before, staying at expensive hotels - shame we hadn't seen this place.Rooms clean and tidy - fresh towels, bathroom cleaned and room tidied daily. Fresh soap even after just one use! Room a little compact, but for $99 per night in the middle of Herald Square district who cares? Shower and water always hot. TV with all major news channels. Air conditioning.Staff friendly and helpful and were happy to order taxis and answer questions. Handy locker room to stash your suitcases in on your last day.Great location - 10 min walk from Times Square. 5 min walk from Penn Station. Subway close by. Oh, and some big department store nearby. ;)Will definitely come back to this hotel next time I go NYC....C. Sharp.	
Feb 26 2007 	Perfect	One of the bests, if not the best, hotel to stay in manhattan. Amazing value, great location (2 blocks from Empire State Building, between 5th ave and broadway). The hotel staff is friendly and work out your problems promptly. Everything is clean, spotless! I couldn´t find a better deal.	
Feb 21 2007 	What a great Location!!	I will definitely stay at the Herald Square again! Great location, great value. I had a shared-bathroom but it was not a problem since it was never occupied when I needed it and always spotless clean! Room was extremely small but the bed was comfortable. I chose this hotel for its location and I stayed there for 5 days during a work assignment trip. You can't beat it for NYC!	
Feb 17 2007 	Good Hotel Nice Stay	Stayed here with my girlfriend in Feb 07 and it was perfect for what we required. The price is very good for Manhattan. It is midtown and is only 2 mins from the Empire State building and 5 mins from Macys. There are loads of subway stops within 5 mins walk. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was basic, clean and the shower was good so no complaints. The staff were friendly and there was absolutely no wait for checking in or out. I would definitely stay here again.	
Feb 12 2007 	An Excellent Value For Manhattan	The Herald Square Hotel is a great find. I just moved away from Manhattan late last year and thought I wouldn't be able to afford any decent hotels for return visits. I'm so happy! Now whenever I get homesick I can jump on the train and be here in a few hours. Now, the hotel isn't luxurious, but it is nice. It provides an excellent value for the price. It's very clean and the staff couldn't be more helpful. Apparently, I was put in the old unrenovated part (no flatscreen tv for me ! Next time I'll know to request a new room), but the towels were soft and fluffly and the bed was to die for. The only bad thing I can say is that it's location is in tourist hell, midtown Manhattan. Most New Yorkers avoid midtown liker the plague so it's very good that the subway stop about one block away from the hotel provides a quick and easy fast escape from that blighted, expensive part of town.This hotel will become my new &quot;home sweet home&quot; in New York City.	
Jan 28 2007 	Beware of false reservations and charges	I made a reservation for 2 nights to stay at this hotel, however I had to cancel the reservation, which I did 2 weeks in advance.The day that I was supposed to stay there I was charged for 2 rooms ( I only had one) plus when I called up, the man read me reservation numbers that I never heard of before. I am very precise when it comes to writing down this kind of information. I had the confirmation and cancellation numbers and the ones read to me were soooo far from what I had. I made the reservations right from the hotel website and cancelled them the same way. Why do people work in customer service and in hotels when they have no idea what they are doing? This was a very stressful situation especially for someone who lives on a budget like me. So beware unless you have money to throw away. I have to call my bank and the hotel again to get it all straightened out. I will NEVER EVER try this hotel again.	
Jan 26 2007 	Super hotel stay there	My boyfriend and I were staying at The Herald Square Hotel in September 2006, and we were NOT disappointed. And if we are going to New York again, we will absolut stay there again.The hotel is near lot of thing, 2 minutes walk from Empire State Building, 5 miuntes walk from Macy's and so on.The room were perfect, service and cleaning is absolute okay.Are you going to New York, stay at The Herald Square Hotel, I promise you will love it.	
Jan 13 2007 	appreciation of the herald square	each visit to the herald square increases my appreciation for it. i travel alot and whenever i go to ny, i get to stay in another newly remodel room at the herald square. these new rooms compare with most 4 and 5 star hotels in manhatten for 1/3 of the price. i love thehotel's central location and appreciate the free wifi. the staff is very nice and the beds are first class. the flat sreen tvs are a welcome bonus and the decor and history of the hotel, make my stay there a wonderful treat. i highly recommend the herald square, if you want great quality at very affordable prices. don from newort beach ca	
Dec 28 2006 	Nice Place Good Location	Influenced by the glowing reviews we booked on-line at the hotel web site, at a very good rate, for Christmas night.The hotel is located on a little-used side street that after 5 had a dark and lonely feel. 32nd St, the next street over, is bustling with lots of Korean restaurants, a nice Ramada hotel, a car park with polite uniformed attendants, etc.The car park has an arrangement with the Herald Square for parking, our tab for one night for an SUV was $21. Can't beat that in New York.Without our asking, our room was upgraded to one of the renovated rooms, which was very hospitable of Reception.The room was indeed very nice, beautifully done, high ceilings. The bathroom was one of the largest I've ever seen in a NYC hotel and very clean and bright. Warning: there are no toiletries or even a shower cap so bring your own.Brilliant LCD tv mounted on the wall with easy viewing from the bed, a small sitting area with two chairs and a marble-topped table in one corner. Heating was fine--a steam radiator with decorative cover, cooling was fine--a window unit, not too loud. No coffee/tea-making supplies in the room. Also had some hot water issues, but the hotel guests were probably all taking showers at once.The hallways are utilitarian to the point of being reminiscent of the old Soviet-style drabness, but they did look freshly painted.The refreshment room off the Lobby is very nice with a comfortable sitting area, decorated for Christmas, and a picture window facing the street.Coffee good, hot chocolate offered as well as good biscotti--all complimentary.Is this the lap of luxury? No.Would we stay here again? Most definitely, it's clean and in a great location.	
Dec 24 2006 	Continues to be great value for money	After reading reviews for this hotel on Tripadvisor my wife and I took the plunge and booked it for a week in December 2006. We were not disappointed and earlier reviews have proved to be reasonably accurate.As my wife and I were basically on a shopping trip we did not plan to spend much time in the room - the priority for us was security and cleaniness at an affordble price. In this regard the room had a safe and access to the building was via a security door manned by 24 hr reception. The linen was changed every day and the water was normally perfectly hot (it ran cold one evening out of 6). The location on 31st street is very convenient to Macys and the Empire State Building. All of this in Manhattan for just over $100!On the downside the room (esp the bathroom) was tiny but apparently this is the norm in NYC. We were advised that we had been upgraded to a room with an extra bed - if this was an upgrade we suspect the other rooms must be quite small. The room decor was pretty grim and dark although there was nothing to suggest that it was unclean. The hallways were in the process of some badly needed redecoration although the new colours won't inspire anyone.The coffee area and restroom off the foyer were spotless and very comfortable. All in all ecellent value for money and we'll be back.	
Dec 16 2006 	look out for the mosquitos	We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and wished we had booked else where, Our room number 804 was next to the air conditioning unit, which was extremely noisy throughout. I was also bitten several time by mosquitos and when I complained about the bites. I was told I would have to pay extra to be moved to a differen room. I even had to buy spray to keep the pests away.The receptionists were unhelpful and more concerned with filling the rooms than dealing with the issues. Best avoiding this one if you want a good time in New York.	
Dec 15 2006 	Made a great 1st trip!!	I'd just like to thank Herald square for making our stay such a plesant one. The service was great, as was the rooms. We'll deffinatley be booking here on our next visit!	
Dec 14 2006	Great room great location	We were recommended to stay here by some American friends of mine, so we checked on the hotel website and found it looked good. We arrived at Penn NY Stn and it was only two blocks down 31st street to it, so was definately walking distance. The lobby isn't the greatest-looking and the lift/stairs and corridors aren't the smartest, but there were plenty of signs apologising for their appearance - they were in the process of re-decorating. The staff were friendly enough. The room (120) on the first floor was very good - a New Queen Room. The window over-looked the fire-escapes of the ajoining buildings so not great. We had the plasma screen as decribed and it was beautifully decorated. It was small but not claustrophobic. The safe worked, which was good. The bathroom was spacious with a good shower, however the towel rail was prone to failing apart and dropping towels and face cloths into the toilet below... In conclusion, we'd recommend the hotel to others. It's in a very good location, just a few blocks from the Empire State Bld and is 100yrds from 5th Ave. Just be aware that it's being redecorated.	
Dec 6 2006 	When they say small they mean SMALL!	I had all but given up hope of being able to afford a fall weekend in New York when I checked out this hotel's website (---) and learned that they had &quot;small single&quot; rooms at under $100. Experience has taught me that most Manhattan hotel rooms are small, so I figured that these must really be tiny. But the price was there, and the hotel was reasonably well rated, so I booked it.And tiny it is: a bed (big enough for me, and I'm 6'2&quot;), a shelf unit that holds up the TV and doubles as a rude desk, the little safe on which the phone and phone book sit, a bathroom with a sink, a stall and a seat, and that's it. This is not only for one person, but for one night as well, since there's no place to hang anything up, not even a hook on the wall, and scarcely any room for baggage beyond an overnight bag.As for the hotel itself: There's a comfortable sitting area in the lobby. (The coffee machine wasn't working while I was there.) There's a laundry room and an internet kiosk that actually works. The place overall seemed a bit on the shabby side - which, however, not to be confused with seedy.Location is convenient to the Empire State Building, Macy's and the Morgan Library. But this is New York, and public transit will get you almost anywhere. And at this price, I could have paid for a taxi had I needed one.Will I do this again? Maybe - but I'm likely to pay more for a real room.	
Dec 6 2006 	5th year and still love it !!!	Just back from a 8 day stay in this fab hotel in the Heart of New York City. For location, this hotel couldn't be better, around the corner from Macys , Empire State Building and 5th Avenue. For value, you will not find a better hotel for the price. For service, well, the staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful if they tried, Monica on the front desk , a diamond. The rooms are very comfortable and always kept clean, the updated ones are the best and the beds are soooooo comfortable it's hard to get out of them and as others have said, the double and queen rooms are by far the best for size. The tea and coffee in reception is great, especially for those on shopping trips and have no time to waste over breakfast, grap a cuppa and run. We have gone there for the last 5 yrs, we found it by mistake and it was the best mistake we ever made. It's a great hotel for your stay in NYC and we will be back again.	
Dec 5 2006	Looking Elsewhere	I booked this hotel because of the on-line reviews and pictures. Plasma TV? Where the hell was that? Mine was average and everything on it was red. The pictures on the web site showed a beautiful room, spacious, touting amenities. Mine was small, no closet, step up to the bathroom (causing many stumblings), no clock., Asked about that. Told that &quot;some&quot; rooms have clocks, and some have dressers/drawers.&quot; Extra $40 + tax /night more for that. I declined. Couldn't open the window, constant noise from some AC outside anyway. Hair dryer had to be checked out at desk with deposit. Thankfully I brought my own. Don't worry about having to tip a doorman. There isn't one. Hotel staff is behind glass. Bullet proof I'm guessing. They did have nice towels and good pillows. Coffee, tea, etc. in the lobby. That's pretty much it. If you can afford a few bucks more, go elsewhere.	
Dec 5 2006 	Luxury Rooms at Bargain Price	This is a wonderful hotel!!! Although the lobby may not look like much, I was amazed at the room's ammenities. A beatifiul bathroom with new fixtures, a flat screen TV, an amazing, plush bed -I couldn't believe how great the room was and how little we paid! Not only are the rooms well appointed, but they are very clean (and I am a certified neat freak!).Another great thing about The Herald Square Hotel is it's location. Herald Sqaure is a great area, full of excitment and centrally located to all of New York's sights and attractions.I will never stay anywhere else in New York again!	
Nov 30 2006 	Beware room 108!	We booked 2 rooms in March for our stay in November this year. After reading the reviews in this site I rang them in September and made sure we had 2 of the upgraded rooms.When we checked in we were given 108 and 118, one at least 40% bigger than the other. 108 is a pleasant room but in no way should be charged the same rate at 118. I spoke to various people culminating in the manager, and there was nothing they were prepared to do. We were told 'it is an old building blah blah', maybe in New York it is, but we come from York in England and some of ours date back to the 1200s, so weren't impressed by that excuse.I was mostly annoyed that we had booked so far in advance that you would think they would put us in comparable rooms.Overall we had a good stay - very clean and comfortable beds. After all you don't go to New York to stay in the room.Just be aware that room 108 is tiny, with a single wardrobe, so if it is offered to you just check it out first.	
Nov 23 2006 	Perfectly Placed	I have just returned from a 5 night trip to New York staying in the Herald Square hotel. We booked this hotel after reading all of the good reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel was exactly as described. Location is excellent, which is all important in NY. We had booked a large room with two double beds and this is what we got. The beds were extremely comfortable and blissful to sink into after a full day of shopping and sightseeing. The room was thoroughly cleaned each day with fresh towels also supplied daily. I definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning. Having stayed in an 'upmarket' hotel last year, the Herald Square beat it hands down.	
Nov 21 2006 	Not perfect but great location	We stayed at the Herald Square Hotel in November 2006 and generally found the experience to be a positive one. The hotel is most definitely not the Ritz - but the value of the accommodation cannot be questioned. We struggled to find any hotel room in New York for the night we wanted to stay and were happy to pay $169 + tax for this hotel when we discovered it was available. The hotel looks far more luxurious from the outside and the grandeur of the building is evident, but walk inside and the illusion is lost and you cannot fail to be disappointed to see bullet proof glass surrounding reception and the slightly dated and unattractive decor in the foyer area. We were not lucky enough to to be given a refurbished room, so our's was fairly small and basic. However, it was clean and had a very comfortable bed. The air conditioning was incredibly noisy and the walls so thin that you could quite easily hear people in the adjoining room. It was nice, however, to be given complimentary coffee in the foyer and we even managed to connect our laptop to the wireless network which was free of charge. The location of the hotel in our opinion is the hotel's greatest asset. It was literally a stone's throw away from the Empire State Building and Macy's. Overall the Herald Square is a great option if you are looking for a well priced, clean hotel with no frills in a fabulous location. If you manage to get a refurbished room, then you will have hit the jackpot!	
Nov 18 2006 	Great hotel great location	For the price this hotel was fantastic, rooms are basic but very clean. Bed was good and bathroom is a good size. TV with loads of channels and also aircon unit (even if its a bit noisy.) Area hotel is located is quiet.Great tea and coffee facilities in reception and staff very helpful.Location of hotel is fantastic 2 min walk from empire state building, metro and Penn station and 15 min walk from Tiime square.Nice Irish Pub 100 yds away and plenty of places to get breakfast.make sure you book through hotel website to benefit from best price and best rooms.I will use this hotel the next time I visit New York and would also recomend it to friends and family.	
Nov 15 2006	a hidden jewel	I was advised by a friend to try it out. I have stayed in NY 100 times over the years. By far, this is the best value I've found in the city. Great location, minutes from everything. Helpfull, courteous and knowledgable staff. The room was new, quiet, clean, amazing bed, and had a flatscreen TV. The bathroom was spacious, bright and had a large shower and bath.The history of the hotel was quite interesting in itself. I was there for a week in early November. I have highly reccomended it to friends and family. Overall it was an outstanding gem and will be staying there on my future trips to NYC. The website is also done in the great spirit of NYC. Have fun , live high, and save alot of money.Mark from Los Angeles.	
Nov 15 2006 	Life in the big city	I only stayed here two nights but of the four hotels I tried while in New York this was my favorite. The fact that this was once the office building for Life magazine still is apparent in the hallways but the seasonal displays of Life covers was a nice touch.They are in the midst of renovations so be warned that the hallways still look a bit rough but the rooms and the common areas are comfortable. The staff is above and beyond what I expected of this budget hotel.I stayed in a single room [comfy twin bed] that had not been renovated and although the room was small it was clean and certainly a deal at $89 a night! My bathroom was very clean and the tub meant I got to soak after walking my self around the city. The location is great for exploring midtown and the onsite laundry and internet terminals a real plus.Id return and not just because of the price, the staff made me feel very welcome and the gift of a key chain [of one of the cherubs on the facade] was just the icing on the cake.	
Nov 14 2006 	Tiny room	Reasonable location, safe area, near Korean restaurants, Macy's, Herald Square, subway, etc. I had a small single room, with the bathroom down the hall. The room was so small, you couldn't even open the door all the way to get in... and it was still over $100 per night. It was clean and quiet, no real waiting to use the bathroom down the hall, which was also clean. Absolutely no room to open your suitcase on the floor or anywhere else, except on the bed. Staff was reasonably friendly and polite and helpful in arranging airport transportation. Free coffee/tea in the lobby was nice. Some renovations going on in the hotel, try to get a renovated room on a renovated floor. New York hotels are expensive, but I just thought the room was too small for the price.	
Nov 11 2006	We loved the Herald Square Hotel!!	I have traveled around the world and I must say this was not only a very reasonable rate but was also one of the nicest rooms I have seen in a long time! The beds were incredibly comfortable with the whitest, softest sheets and blankets including a comforter which all felt like the beds of some of the finest European hotels. The bath room had a deep luxurious marble bath with double sinks and great lighting, hair dryer and plenty of room to get ready for night out. We watched movies and listened to music on the large flat screen television and sat together at the lovely private cafe style table in the room to share a bottle of wine at night and our coffee in the morning beneath a large arched window. The long dressing table with a lighted magnified mirror made getting ready simple.Every person from the front desk to the maid that cleaned the room- were polite, helpful and always smiling. We splurged on the best room as it was our anniversary and with these rates actually had plenty left over to go out and eat at some of the finest restaurants in the city! We will be back!	
Nov 10 2006	Herald Square Hotel - one of the best deals in town	Last month (8-15 October), my cousin and I stayed at the Herald Square Hotel, and we were extremely happy with our overall experience there. We shared a large double/double room (two double beds) facing W31st Street, which was more than adequate for our needs. Everything was immaculately clean, including the bathroom, which was admittedly small, but this was compensated by the fact that there was a full tub as well as a shower, and the water was hot, with wonderful pressure. The towels were beautifully large and fluffy, and replaced every day. The beds were amazingly comfortable, and the TV had more than enough channels to keep us happy on the nights we didn't go out. One thing that particularly impressed me was the staff at reception. They were unfailingly friendly and helpful, something I have not always encountered at previous visits to other hotels in NY. Two futher pluses were the limitless tea/coffee/hot chocolate available 24/7 in the lobby, and the laundry available for use by guests, with state-of-the-art washers and dryers. The location was also great, with many great eateries in the vicinity, and of course Macy's a short two blocks away (we made good use of the sales that were on!).We paid $189 per night for the first five nights, and $199 for the last two, booked through the hotel's website. Right up till the time I left on my trip, I kept checking various other hotels to see if I could get a better deal, but everything else was far more expensive - apart from the Radio City Apartments, which always seems to be booked out months and months in advance!I can heartily recommend this hotel for excellent value for a budget price.	
Nov 8 2006 	Very small room !!!	Having been inspired by all the positive reviews of this hotel I decided to book a single room for 5 nights. I contacted the hotel a couple of days before to see if I could get one of the newly renovated rooms but was informed that the single rooms had not yet been done up but was assured that I was getting &quot;a nice room&quot;. When I saw the room I have to admit I was shocked and disappointed at how small it actually was. I was able to stand with my arms outstretched and touch the two walls. There was a very small window that didn't give much light as it looked out onto a building opposite. My big concern was, as the window didn't open, how I would get out in the event of a fire. There was a smoke alarm but this wouldn't be much help if the fire was on the corridor outside. There was an air conditioning unit which looked about 50 years old and made a lot of noise when in use. Overall my stay was pleasant enough as I was out most of the day and returned late to the hotel just to sleep. The room and bathroom were very clean and fresh towels were supplied each day. The staff were friendly and helpful and the free tea and coffee in the lounge is definitely a plus. The location is excellent if you are in New York to sight see and shop - although don't buy too much as there is very little storage space in the room. I would probably stay there again but would perhaps pay for a double room and one of the renovated rooms.	
Nov 3 2006 	A Labor Day Weekend Treat	My wife and I stayed at the hotel over Labor Day Weekend. It rained all day Saturday, but the hotel was dry and cheerful. It raised our spirits just to be there. What a treat! I am an Historian and a teacher and I was doubly thrilled to spend time in this historic building with all of the magnificent art work, covers from Life Magazine, displayed all over the hotel. The room we stayed in was just magnificent. An extra comfortable queen size bed, down comforters and pillows, a flat panel TV, and a bathroom that was so beautiful that my wife wants to re-decorate ours at home on a similar theme. And the bed, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud; soft, clean, and inviting. I have a bad back and often have trouble sleeping in beds other then my bed at home, not so at the Herald Square Hotel, I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillows. It was one of the most restful sleeps I have ever had away from home. I also have to say something about the staff; they were attentive, helpful, courteous, and in every way helped to make our stay terrific. We will definitely be staying at the Helald Square hotel on our next trip to NYC.	
Nov 2 2006 	Perfect for our stay.	Clean, comfortable and a great position in the city. The HSH was perfect for our short stay in NY. Highly recommended.	
Nov 1 2006 	Great location	There is no doubt the room we had was on the small size... but we had a large suitcase and large rucksack full and managed OK. This is a great hotel in a fantastic location just a couple of blocks away from the Empire State Building.There is really good free coffee downstairs in the lounge and it looked like they were re decorating it while we were there (not that caused us any problems at all)I will have no reservations (excuse the pun) in using this again	
Oct 30 2006 	Beware of Bedbugs!	We stayed at the Herald Square hotel from October 16-20. We lucked out and got an amazing room on the 9th floor or so we thought. The first morning that we were there my girlfriend woke up with bites on her hand and arm. We thought maybe there might be bugs but we couldn't see any in the bed and the room was so nice we thought, how could it be? Our second night there she woke up in the middle of the night to something biting her again. In the morning we called front desk and told them what was happening. They wanted to come up to the room and see the bites and she said she would get changed and come down but before she had time, 2 minutes later, someone from housekeeping was at our door ready to inspect the bed. We were really annoyed that this guy came up and was going through the bed while we were still in our pajamas! When he couldn't find anything he said it must be an allergy to the down pillows. My girlfriend is a doctor and she informed him that allergy does not present like that, he wouldn't believe her. So they changed our room to a much smaller one on another floor and that room seemed fine.Aside from irritating us by not believing that there could be bugs, the hotel staff is friendly and our only other complaint is the water pressure and the lack of hot water. The only reason we are writing this is because we know Herald Square is a budget hotel and with that comes a certain level of expectation but we paid for one of the &quot;new queen rooms&quot; and although they looked nice they aren't worth it. This was our second time staying there and the first time was a better experience....before the renovations. It looks nice and it should be good but it was disappointing.	
Oct 28 2006 	Great deal !	Clean rooms clean bathroom free coffee GREAT position..what more could you ask for such a cheap price??? Me and my boyfriend were so pleased by this hotel we must spread the word!!	
Oct 26 2006 	Budget Hotel Excellent Location - Overall great value for Money	Six of us stayed at the Herald Square for eight nights recently and I can confirm that most of the reviews on here are pretty accurate. - The hotel is in a fantastic location (very short walk to Macy's, ESB and Madison Sq. Gardens). - It's clean and the beds are super comfortable- The rooms do need to be renovated but they are currently in the process of doing this (if possible, pay the extra for one of the newly renovated rooms which are really nice).- The staff are very nice and helpful, they upgraded four of us to better rooms than we had booked (e.g. my fiancé and I had booked a standard room and they upgraded us to a queen. Our friends had booked a queen and they were upgraded to a new room). Having been there now I would recommend if you're a couple that you go for at least the queen room option. That way you might get upgraded to a new room if you're lucky, and if not, the queen rooms are fine (although they need updating they are a decent size and have really comfie beds with duvets instead of horrible scratchy blankets!!)Basically - don't expect luxury and you won't be disappointed! Oh one final word of warning - the single rooms are absolutely TINY!	
Oct 19 2006 	Very good choice ask for the refurnished rooms	I just came back after 5 nights at the Herald Square Hotel with friends and I agree with the other reviews: it's clean, the location is simply perfect, the area is safe and full of restaurants (I prefer the ones around Madison Avenue, but it's plenty of choice everywhere at walking distance), and the price is more than ok. I've also found the staff quite friendly and helpful: our impression was that they try really hard to give their guest what they need, and the free coffee is a nice thing to get when you're back after a busy day.In general, the hotel is pretty basic and the rooms are on the small side. BUT... surprise surpise. They are renewing all the hotel, bit by bit, and as we had the &quot;old&quot; rooms, just before we were leaving, a guy at the desk (maybe the manager?) insisted to show us one of the refurnished rooms . And the new rooms are *gorgeous*! Still small but very well furnished, with a sparkling bathroom and a plasma tv: definitively 3 stars level for a 1 star price! So, try to get one of the new rooms, and your stay will change from all right to heavenly! They told us the best way is to book online and then call them and ask for it. (as I'll definitively do next time!)Claudia	
Oct 16 2006 	First time guest and was very pleased!	It was my boyfriend and I first trip to NYC. Knowing that the hotels were expensive and there are alot of bad places in NY, I decided to do some research. Based on my research, I found Herald Square to be the best deal and reviews. In addition to the great reviews, the other hotel guest left some great tips in which we used during our stay. (i.e. where to eat-Speedys, and hotel only takes money for the lockers and for the super shuttle. There is also a real good restaurant northeast of Speedys. I forget the name of the restaurant, but we went there for drinks one night and had breakfast there the next morning.) So, if you have time to read through all of the reviews, do so, to get more tips. It was VERY helpful. Although the hotel received good reviews, I was still a little hesistant. But I was VERY HAPPPY with our stay at Herald Square. It was safe, clean and the staff was very friendly. I would stay here again. Room: we received an upgrade to our room. It was expecting something small, but it was nice to have something just a bit bigger. Bathrooms: small, but cleanSafe: good and safe. Shopping: there is so much shopping in the area, maybe about 2 blocks north of the hotel. i.e. Macys, H&amp;M, Footlocker, Ninewest, etc etc etc. Food: Speedys, the place I mentioned above and there is also a good restaurant right next to the Empire State Building. Subways: there are so many near the hotel.	
Oct 15 2006 	The Herald Square is the Place to Stay in Manhattan	I stayed at the Herald Square in November 2005 and in November 2004. The room I stayed in each time although small, was adequate for me as a single traveller, I was offered an upgrade but declined it as I was happy with the room. There was a shower and toilet in my room and fresh towels were provided every day along with soap and shampoo if I needed them. The bedding was very clean and the room itself was cleaned daily.The location is great and the price for me as a budget traveller was great. I have stayed in more expensive hotels in Manhattan, but as far as I am concerned all I want is somewhere nice and clean to sleep. I will be staying again this November and would recommend the hotel to anyone.	
Oct 12 2006 	best value in the city!!	I hve been to NewYork City over 1 dozen times .....each all but a few alone.....I have stayed in many differnent hotels....high and low end.......I am a Trvael Agent as well.........I truly beleive if you want a clean, quiet and good value hotel....this is it........	
Oct 11 2006 	Great apart from rude guy at front of desk	We stayed at the Herald Square for seven nights till last week.The room, while small, was clean and the bed was comfy with nice bed linen. The room was serviced each day which was good. It's not a luxurious hotel by any means but suited us fine as we were out sightseeing most of the time.The only bad part of our trip was on the day we had checked out. We left our bags in the lockers after checking out and went to buy tickets for the Airport Shuttle. We were staying with friends that night but were coming back to the area the next day so it was convenenient for us to leave from the hotel or nearby. We were just about to purchase the tickets when the clerk advised that it was cash only and we did not have enough. No matter, he said we could get them later when we came to collect our luggage.We returned at 4pm to collect our bags and once again went to the front desk to purchase tickets for the shuttle bus for the next day. There was a different guy on the front desk this time. He seemed very harassed and was extremely rude. He informed my husband that he was too busy to sell us tickets right now and we'd have to come back in an hour. We explained that we were leaving and he basically shrugged. When we asked again he simply ignored us. It was the only flaw in an otherwise smooth stay but his rudeness left us with a bad impression of the hotel.	
Oct 6 2006 	Expected a Little More	This was my first time to NYC and I only had 24 hours there. We arrived by train and walked to the hotel. It wasn't too bad of a walk, depending on how much luggage you had. The best thing about this hotel was the comfortable linens on the beds. The room was very plain with simple furnishings. It seemed a bit small, but I have no others to compare it to in the city. Most of the guests in the building seemed to be tourists from other countries trying to visit the city &quot;on the cheap&quot;, too. The hallways are narrow and are not carpeted to help cut down on some of the noise, which we found a bit distracting. You could hear people in nearby rooms and it echoed in the halls. The only real problems we encountered while there were a running toilet (which I regret fixing myself after seeing the inside of the toilet tank) and one of the two elevators appeared to be out of order twice in a 24 hour period. It's not a very large place so there isn't much in the way of amenities. It was nice to find local delivery menus in the room and there was an area off the lobby to do your own laundry. The best thing about the hotel was it's proximity to the Empire State Building. You just round the corner and walk about 1 1/2 blocks. They also had a later checkout time, which was nice.	
Oct 5 2006 	Great Place to Stay with minor niggles	I loved my stay at the Herald Square Hotel. Checkin was quick and efficient, but I found I was in one of the older non-renovated rooms which was small but clean with a single bed, clean bathroom with shower and bath. There were a few small problems and that was the hot water was not the most reliable, having to run the water at least a minute to get any, and then when it was running, it would start to run cold (sometimes). The only other thing I thought was an issue was that the lifts (elevators) were very very slow! Most annoying if you were in a hurry! Still, after my stay here, I would stay here again. By this time next year, all rooms should have been upgraded. Management does need to look at the hot water issue though.	
Oct 5 2006	what a treasure	Herald Square Hotel NYC I just loved this hotel. It was clean,quiet,had wonderfully comfortable beds and the staff was always cheerful and really helpful,and to top it all off the rates were very reasonable.You just couldn't find anything else like it in such a great location. Thanks HSH for such a great stay and see you next year. J.Rosewilde	
Oct 4 2006 	Great Value	Our first visit to NY and we really did not expect much from this hotel. But given the wonderful location the value was exceptional. The room was basic and the air con noisey but that was a small price to pay to be 2 mins from the Empire State Building or Broadway. If you want to explore NY on a budget this is the place to stay	
Sep 20 2006	Best Value in the city	Without doubt the best value in NYC. . .Great BuildingGreat LocationGreat RoomsNice Staff200 bucks a night got me a twin double room on the top floor (9th) with view over downtown, 34 inch wall mounted plasma TV with DVD, big white bouncy, comfy beds, nice bathroom, loads of fluffy towels, prompt, friendly and efficient maid service - what more could you want? A little hidden roof terrace with a direct view of the Empire State? Oh - there was one of those as well!I have stayed in hotel rooms costing 3 or 4 times as much that are not as good - the Herald Square should be your first stop if you want a good value hotel in NYC. 10/10	
Sep 19 2006	A great week in the Big Apple	We spend a great week in NYC 11-18 Sep. The Herald Square Hotel is centrally located in Mid-Town Manhattan near 31st and Broadway and the price was reasonable for NYC (about $150 per night). We were 2 mins walk to the subway and the hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly. The room was small but comfortable with a nicely appointed bathroom, AC, TV with HBO and Wi-Fi and a safe to keep you valuables locked up when you're see the sights. While no breakfast was avail in the hotel, there were tons of reasonably priced restaurants (mainly Korean) within 5 -10 mins walk. They did have a coffee machine that kicked butt. 100% Columbian, decaf, hot chocolate or, my favorite, cafe mocha. There was also a nice sitting room and a dining area if you found a take-out meal.As for the tourist thing, we bought a 7 day Metro Card at LaGuardia Airport and a New York Pass at the Planet Hollywood at Times Square. There are tons of attractions and we did some we might not have done normally but they were free (well the tour was part of the cost of the pass). A couple of things we did that stood out were: MOMA 4th &amp; 5th floor (Pollack, Monet, Van Gogh, etc...), The Met, Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Colbert Report and a Yankees-Red Sox game. Overall this was a great hotel and we plan to stay there again when we vist NYC next time.	
Sep 15 2006 	Excellent for those looking for accommodation only hotel	I would consider this hotel excellent for somebody who is visiting NYC to see the city as opposed to lounging around a hotel. It serves its purpose as a safe, clean, comfortable and well located hotel to sleep and shower in.The newly renovated rooms are very nicely decorated. My room on the ground floor had plasma tv, phone and extremely comfortable bed &amp; bedding. The room had black out blinds which was very relaxing. The room was also extremely quiet. The bathroom was new and very clean. The room size was very small and I think two adults would find it tight. I was staying with a group and from what I heard the room quality varied drastically with some of the older rooms not yet renovated. From my previous trip, I remember the rooms on upper floors being more spacioius but a lot more basic. The staff were very helpful. There is no restaurant or breakfast bar (coffe is available in reception) however, Starbucks and some great take out breakfast places are nearby.The location was excellent. You could easily walk to Times Square and the subway is around the corner.	
Sep 10 2006	Great place for a great price!!!	After reading reviews on trip advisor, I booked this hotel for my mother and I for a trip to NYC over Labor Day weekend. We both were EXTREMELY pleased. The room was very nice; it wasnt as small as I thought it would be. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and the hotel staff was as welcoming as any. The location was perfect, within walking distance of everything worth seeing on a trip to NYC. There were complementary warm beverages and lockers for use to store luggage. Be mindful however that the staff is adamant about their renting policies (i.e. lockers, irons etc), when they say you must have cash, they mean it. Renting an iron requires a $20 cash refundable deposit, and I believe the same thing goes for hair driers and other appliances. They could be a little nicer about explaing their policy without sounding like wardens, but I guess law is law. But dont let that discourage you, overall this was a great place to be. I highly recommend it and I will definitely be back!	
Sep 10 2006 	You get what you pay for...	The staff at the Herald Square seem second to none, knowing most things about NYC and how to get there. The hotel is in a good spot, on Broadway and W 31st Street so you can walk to the subway in about a minute or if you go the other way onto 5th avenue, the empire state building is literally a five minute walk away. However, the hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired. The smell of Little Korea filled the back room I was staying in, the room was so small you could touch all four walls at once and the air conditioner didn't work which meant there were some HOT, restless nights. However, it should be noted that this is a quiet, safe hotel in a good neighbourhood for a low price.	
Aug 13 2006 	Good Value	My wife and stayed here over Memorial Day weekend, and despite an interesting trek from Penn Station to the hotel at 11:00 p.m. past the well populated steps outside the St. Francis of Assisi Church, our stay was without incident. The staff was helpful upon arrival, although we didn't need them much during our stay. We had a clean room, a true queen size bed, and ample bathroom with a full bathtub. The room was on the first floor, so I had no experience with the vertical circulation, but even on the first floor it was very quiet. The AC worked flawlessly, and we had cable TV. The room was small, and the light fixtures were a bit odd for a hotel room, but we would definitely stay there again.	
Aug 2 2006	Best Hotel for the money	We stayed at the Herald square after reading reviews on this site and I must say it was exactly like they said, very clean and the bed was very comfy. that's about all the place has, but for $99 a night in midtown manhattan that's all you need. The Air conditioner could have been a little cooler being that it was 92 degrees those days, but i would have to say that was my only complaint. It was very safe also with a &quot;buzz in &quot; system at the front door. Would definately reccommend because you need all your extra cash for the $5 beers!	
Jul 26 2006 	Exactly what I was looking for	I didn't know what to expect from the Herald Square Hotel, and to be honest I was expecting the worst. I booked the cheapest room possible, with the shared bathroom, sight unseen (every photo on their website showed off their &quot;newly renovated&quot; rooms, not what I would be getting).My room ended up being the cheap hotel room of my dreams: everything I needed, and nothing more. Bed. Table. Tv. Safe. Clotheshangers. Air Conditioning. Enough floor space for my suitcase. And CLEAN.I'm at that point of being too old for a hostel, but too poor for a &quot;real&quot; hotel. Everywhere I go, I wonder why I can't just find a clean, safe, cheap room. Well, score one for me!The hallways and shared bathroom aren't air conditioned, which was a challenge in the heat wave while I was there. I didn't want to spend any time in that bathroom, and ended up buying a mirror so I could do my hair and makeup in my room. While the shared bathroom was the only one on the floor, I never even ran into anyone else coming in or out of it. It's relatively clean (needs remodelling), and the shower stall is big enough that you never have to experience that horrible moment of accidently brushing up against the wall.Location-wise, I couldn't imagine a better place to be. I was able to walk to most of the places I needed to go throughout my stay. The Empire State Building really is right around the corner. I easily grabbed a bus to get uptown or down to the village. And as a single woman walking alone at night, I felt completely safe around the hotel. Financially, I had already hit my breaking point by paying the $80 per night. I'm not a rich girl. But I would recommend splurging the extra few bucks to upgrade if you plan on spending any time in your room. I was able to peek into a few other rooms, and they were beautiful.The pub across the street has amazing food for reasonable prices. Breakfast is easy to grab closeby too, and there's a drugstore around the corner.The staff was always friendly and keen to chat in the elevator. The maid service is great, and very on top of things (I'd switch my sign over to &quot;please make up room&quot;, leave and come back within an hour, and it would be done).The laundry area is very clean, and I was impressed with the free detergent provided. Little touches like that -- and the 24 hour free coffee in the lobby -- make a huge difference to me. The clientele was surprisingly classy. Lots of young couples, families with teenagers, and a number of guests from overseas. No questionable characters.Yes, there were quirks. I jumped a foot the first time I heard my neighbour's door close, but thankfully we kept similar (yet inconsistant) schedules. I slept soundly through the night with earplugs. The layout of the floor is confusing, and frustrating when you first get off the elevator with an armload of baggage. The workers sometimes kept the elevator door open for a length of time, so you either had to wait or climb stairs. All of this was minor, though, and no more annoying than things I've experienced at major chain hotels.I look forward to staying at the Herald Square again on my next trip to NYC.	
Jul 18 2006	Great budget hotel in N.Y.C	My mother and I stayed at the Herald Square hotel for 2nights and highly enjoyed our experience. This is a a budget hotel that is possibly as clean/ comfortable as many of the over priced 4*-5* hotels in the big apple. The location is great with loads of restaurants/pubs and shoppping areas to choose from. Don't forget to check out the Empire State Building just around the corner from the hotel.	
Jul 6 2006	A comfy stay in Manhattan	It was easy to fall for the Herald Squares charm during our recent visit. My wife and I splurged on one of the $179 rooms for three nights in late June and we werent disappointed. Our extra-clean room was very recently updated including a cushy queen bed with comforter, a bright bathroom, and flat screen TV. Our ground floor room was in a small, private niche adjacent to the lobby and guest laundry area. We were concerned about noise, but our stay was amazingly quiet (I dont think we had neighbors). Except for a few of the usual hotel bumps-in-the-night and a sometimes noisy air conditioner, we slept peacefully. At check in, the desk staff (who were always friendly  ie, they booked our ride back to JFK) were honest, saying youll have one of our newest rooms, but it really doesnt have a view. They werent kidding  our window faced another building. But we didnt care  no street noise = great sleep. If we wanted a view, we strolled out the front door to 5th Ave. The hotel building itself is tucked away (if thats possible in Manhattan) between 5th Ave and Broadway on 31st. We walked to the hotel after midnight on a couple nights and felt safe (the Hotel Wolcott is across the narrow street). 31st has a fraction of the 5th Ave crowd after dark, but the stroll to the hotel front door is so short youre practically there once you turn the corner. Several subway stops nearby  since we like to walk, we enjoyed the central location - great for a quick shower and change of clothes between events in the City. We liked Speedys just up the street on Broadway for quick breakfasts.If Im forced to list some very picky negatives  no tissues in room; could have used a snack vending machine; and heavy rain pounded the outside of the AC unit one night giving us a private Lord of the Dance 2:00 am performance (a small plastic hood above the unit would solve this  hint, hint Herald Square). But overall, our experience was excellent. Im not sure about the other rooms (some of the reviewers had different experiences), but we enjoyed the unique, non McHotel feel. Well stay here again, and may even request the same room.	
Jul 5 2006	Our favourite hotel in New York	My husband and I LOVE this hotel. Spotless, comfortable, very helpful staff and wonderfully central. We have stayed here every year for the past four years and cannot see the logic of forking out $300+ for a similar room in &quot;boutique&quot; or &quot;chain&quot; hotel. It may not have a sumptous bar where you can spend upwards of $20 on a cocktail but the money you will save here will more than make up for it during your NY stay.	
Jun 30 2006	Great deal great location	I highly recommend this hotel. In the summer, they turn off the AC while you are gone from the room, and it can take a long time for the room to cool off again, but otherwise the rooms are very good for the price. Bear in mind that ALL New York hotel rooms are smaller than in other cities. Our room was very, very clean, and large enough.The staff was very friendly, but they did make one small mistake with my reservation. So I would triple check the status of your reservation. I tried to double-check the status of my reservation and was told that all was well... that I didn't need to check on it again. But they wrote down the wrong start date of my reservation anyway. No problems resulted from this error on their part, but I WOULD triple-check your reservation dates.31st Street is a fairly grungy side street, but it is safe and right in the heart of the city. It is close to subway stations that will take you anyplace in town, and there are some very cheap places to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner nearby. I loved Speedy's on Herald Square, just a block away, but the American Burger shop and O'Reilly's Irish Pub around Herald Square were also good for cheap, tasty meals. If you are going to New York for the gay pride parade, this is an ideal place to stay. You can just walk 1/2 block down to Fifth Avenue to watch the parade, and then when you get tired or hot, you can just pop back into the hotel to rest &amp; cool off a while. The parade crowds are smaller around 31st Street, too, so you can see the parade better.There are nice little sitting and eating areas off the entry lobby of the hotel, which is nice to have, and they actually have a laundry room in the hotel which you can use! This is great!There are some places you can stay which are cheaper, but you might have to share a bathroom with the entire floor, or have a far less comfortable room, so if you can afford the Herald Square Hotel, it is your best buy in New York for the money.	
Jun 27 2006 	Great as long as your neighbors aren't loud	I booked a room online for this hotel after reading many online reviews of it. The hotel web site said that only singles were available with shared baths, but because I had a 6am flight out of JFK, I thought I would be fine for that brief time. When I checked in, they gave me a room with a private bath for the same price, which was nice. The room safe is great, especially for a budget hotel. Since I was travelling with a laptop, the safe was important for me since I didn't want to lug it around with me. The room was very clean, including the bathroom. It was very small, but I imagine most people aren't hanging out in their hotels in NYC much until they want to sleep.Ah, sleep...what I didn't get when I stayed at Herald Square. I didn't plan on getting much because of my early flight, but I didn't get any at all, thanks to a guest in a nearby room who was apparently using his room for some ...this review has to be family friendly, so let's call it audible alternative adult entertainment. Very unpleasant for me. I knew I wouldn't get much sleep, but I did want to get some shuteye and wasn't able to.Without the noise from the neighbors, this hotel would've been great. However, I'm hesitant to wholeheartedly recommend it because I'm not sure if the hotel, being so affordable, is more susceptible to being used for such rendezvous. If you must stay in this price range, it's probably great since it was so clean. But I don't wish my experience on anyone.	
Jun 23 2006	Great !!! Very good condtions!!	Very good location , the room are very correct for this category..Don't hesiate to stay here, it's enough confortable for a trip in NYC	
Jun 8 2006	Not a great experience...	Let's start from the good sides: it was fairly clean... Even though I must say in my room there was always a BAD BAD SMELL of... I don't know what!... all the time...The other outstanding positive side is the location. I mean, the area is not one of the best in Manhattan but at least it's close to the Empire, to the 5th Avenue and to the subway.The rest of the review is completely NEGATIVE!The staff wasn't friendly at all but instead definitely unpleasant.The room was one of the worst I stayed in and had such a small window (not on the street but overlooking a kind of ... &quot;well&quot; inside the building) we could never understand if it was good or bad weather!With the only exception of the entrance (very deceiving!!!) and the hall, the hotel as a whole looked more like a jail or a hospital than a decent place to stay...Sincerely... I wouldn't advise it to a friend!	
May 20 2006	Charming and affordable in the heart of the big apple	I chose the Herald Square Hotel in NY for a 2 night stay after reading the reviews here. I was not disappointed. Upon arrival, the friendly receptionist told me she had given me a larger room (#500) than my allocated one. The room wasn't massive, but perfectly adequate with private bathroom, window, in room safe and a VERY comfortable bed!The bathroom was a little small, but again, perfectly adequate and fine for my needs - I think many travellers are &quot;spoilt&quot; by bigger than necessary facilities.The hotel itself is very centrally located, and I don't think you will find better value for the location (round the corner from Macys, Empre State Building, Koreatown, Penn Station, 15 min walk to Times Sq etc). All the staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful throughout my stay. The old Time Life posters dotted all around the place are fascinating and amusing - adding to the charm.The Herald Square is the sort of place you want to keep a secret, but at the same time want to share with everyone. I'll be going back whenever I'm in NY again.	
May 12 2006	Amazing experience at the Herald Square	We've just returned from a three day trip to New York, and we stayed at the Herald Square Hotel for three nights. For anyone who's tried to customize a trip to New York City, you'd know how nerve wrecking it is to find a decent, relatively inexpensive hotel to stay in. We searched one hotel after another, only to read reviews about rats, cockroaches, and muddy water. I had almost given up when i came upon someone's recommendation for the Herald Square Hotel on tripadvisor. We were dubious at first, considering the room we booked only costed $99 for a double bed. We were pleasantly surprised. The bathroom was immaculate with all the necessary fixtures for a comfortable stay. The toilet looked especially hygenic with the blue antibacterial solution. And the bed. They definitely weren't lying when they said their bed was four star hotel quality. It was so comfortable, i fell asleep within minutes every night. Granted, the room was a little bit small at first sight, but what's the need of big rooms when you're out and about New York city all day long? The hotel was also conveniently located minutes to the 34th Street station and the Empire State Building, which allowed us to get around Manhattan in the shortest time possible. All in all, i can't wait to stay there again when i visit New York City.	
May 11 2006	a breathe of fressh air. no smoking and refreshing at the herald square hotel	my stay at the herald square was very refreshing . the room were excellent. from the quality of decor, to the fresh air, and comfortable amenities. it was better then most higher price hotels. i am a very healthy vegitarian and appreciate how serious they are about no smoking and thier triple filtered water. as a healthly person, it is hard to find a place that considers fresh air and clean water. The quality of the beds and mattress are super comfortable. i saved enough money their to see 2 extra broadway shows.everything about the herald square is of high quality except the price of a room. it is truly a new york gift..i highly recommend it for your stay in ny.. don	
May 9 2006	Best buy!!!!!	The Herald Square HotelTrip advisor member, London UK.We have just returned from a week at the Herald Square Hotel. The hotel is excellent compared to the rates, the bed was absolutely comfortable after all the bustling about in New York. The sheets were changed every day as were the towels, the bathroom small but clean as well. The ice and coffee machine down in the lobby were also very wonderful gestures from the hotel. Its also located in clean street compared to some of the neighbouring budget hotels. The Dunkin Doughnut cafe at the top of the road is a great spot for breakfast less than $5 for a ham and cheese begal with coffee.Miss that, thinking of it now!!!!!Would stay here again when ever I go back to New York. Highly Recommend this Hotel!!!	
May 4 2006	The Herald Square Hotel All this and Free coffee	We've stayed at The Herald Square Hotel twice before over the last four years. Every time is different experience . . . newer, better, more value and now Free Coffee. The room we had was wonderful, great comfortable bed, 4 fluffy pillows and a comforter, an amazing bathroom, Flat screen TV, a CD player AM/FM clock radio and free wi-fi, for the price, I don't know how they do it. The new guest laundry really came in handy; we packed less so we had more room to bring home NEW stuff.They have a bigger Lobby this time and it is bright and very comfy with those big chairs, plus their pride and joy is there, the Bronze statue of &quot;Winged Life&quot;, the Hotels mascot.The staff seems to be happy working there, with all the Cherubs around, and we always feel as if they're really glad to see us. They were helpful with &quot;what to see and do&quot;. We met and spoke with Mr. Puchall and he really loves the Herald Square Hotel with its history of &quot;Life Magazine&quot; and all and we now have our very own &quot;Winged Life&quot; key chain. This latest experience was the best, and it always seems to get better every time ...can't wait to come back and see what they do next time!	
Apr 7 2006	Not a great experience	After reading the other reviews of the hotel, I was expecting a small room, which for the price wasn't a problem. However, the room I was in had a window that was so small that even at noon there was barely any light in the room. The cleaners were also overly aggressive with the use of bleach - the whole room smelled of it, to the extent that I got a sore throat. Some of the staff were friendly and helpful, but there were some who were just really unpleasant. I don't really recognise the hotel from the positive reviews that are on here.	
Apr 5 2006	Exceeds expectations of budget travelers	We stayed in the Herald Square Hotel last week. This is our review:Duration of stay:7 nights.Acommodation:Double bed, private bathroom.Price:US$99 + tax per night, per room.When youre travelling on a budget, there are really three concerns:One, cleanliness:Bed: Great fluffy bed (Just like 5 star hotels), always smelled like fresh laundry.Carpet: Really clean, was vacuumed every day.Bathroom: Cleaned every day, nice blue stuff in the toilet made it look hygenic.Furniture: Found a bit of dust in the upper part of closet, no biggie.Two, safety:Hotel: Yes, people are buzzed in, so that provides a sense of security.Room: Has indoor locking thingie. Theres an in-room safe, electronic and big. This was a huge plus, since we were worried about the purchases we were going to make, and my laptop, not to mention our limited money.Three, location:Exellent, two blocks away from the Empire State Building, four blocks from Madison Square Garden, one block from Macys, walkable distance to Times Square, two subway stations nearby, you can get anywhere from here. Great stores on 34th street.So, in conclusion, this hotel complied with everything we needed for our stay.Now, wed like to mention a few other things to consider:View: None. There was a tiny window that overlooked a dark alley.Closet: Enough space to fit clothes and stuff for two people.Furniture: Ugly, but what difference does it make, right?TV: Just 14 channels, but who stays and watches TV in NYC?Appearance: Overall, ugly. Its kind of an industrial building, and they would benefit from a decorator.Staff: Not friendly and just limited themselves to do their job.Heating: They turned it on in the evening, and when the pipes started to get warm, they produced a horrible clanking noise which kept us up a couple of nights.Take advantage of:The tons of brochures in the lobby, they have some good disccounts and promotions!New York Pass, buy it online, it saves time and money and you get entrance everywhere.Metro Card, $24 for unlimited rides for seven days. Its worth it.Speedys, great diner, good prices, great food. As you walk out of the hotel, turn right, and then turn right again. In the following corner, cross the street, there it is.As another review says: If youre thinking about it, do it.	
Mar 20 2006	Greeat Little Hotel	This hotel is ina great location and fab for the price. the rooms are smallish but have everything you need, big bed, shower, tv and air cond. lovely staff and you even get a free herald square keyring when you check out. great touch. THE ROOMS WERE CLEAN AND YOU ARE ONLY 5-10 MINS TO EMPIRE STATE BUILDIN. WOULD DEF STAY AGAIN ESPECAILLY FOR THE PRICE	
Mar 14 2006	What a location staff are wonderful	I can say nothing but positive things about this hotel. Was over in New York for my brothers wedding in September 2005, and enjoyed my time up in Westchester. I needed somewhere close to everywhere in Manhattan after the wedding for my family and I ( including 3 children). Saw this hotel on the Lonely Planet guide for New York as a good budget hotel. Checked it out again on Trip Advisor, and decided I had seen enough to go ahead and book. The only negative I had about the whole experience was the fact that I couldn't book for 5 on the internet website. I sent a quick mail to them, and they said, don't worry about it, book for 4 and send us a note. Therefore negative becomes positive as staff were helpful and my worries were dealt with. We then arrived at the hotel on the Sunday evening, Sept 25th. The staff welcomed us. The glass panels at reception look daunting, but at least they are safety conscious. The rooms are fairly basic, but had everything we needed. TV for the kids in the evening time when we were exhausted after lots of shopping and sightseeing, bathroom, beds were fine and AC. The pictures on the website do not give this hotel's location enough credit. You are about 1 minutes walk from the Empire State Building. Macy's, Madisson Square Garden etc are right beside you. Brilliant. I just want to finish up by complementing the staff, even though it will not be enough of a complement. On our last day, I think check out time is 12 noon. My shopaholic other half decided she wanted one last look and spend in Macys before we headed home. All went well except she had to go back to another department to get a tag to scan an item she was buying. Whislt heading to the department, she started looking at more items, got lost, and I couldn't find her and my daughter and son. My daughter and I walked around and couldn't find them. I couldn't believe there was no PA system, so I didn't find them until 1pm. I went back to the hotel, apologised for the late check out. They could not have been kinder as they realised I had got a shock. &quot;Take your time&quot; was the answer I was give. Wonderful, at a brilliant price for Manhattan. Stay there if you are on a budget, want to be treated with respect, and are looking for prime location. A+	
Mar 6 2006	Much better than expected	I booked this Hotel not expecting much given the price for this central location. We were pleasantly suprised with our Queen room. We originally only booked 3 nights (just in case it was awful), but immediately extended it to 6 after our first night. Yes the room is very small and the hotel doesn't offer much service (ie Porters &amp; Concierge). However, at around $100 per night it represents good value for those seeking a central base to explore Manhattan as you are very close to the subway and the Empire State Building. Our room had a very comfortable bed and it was kept very clean. A word of warning though. I made the mistake of using the room phone to ring a friend on a cell phone in New York. This 4 minute call cost me $38. So take my advice make sure you use a calling card!!	
Mar 6 2006	Budget hotel in a good location	This hotel is situated about 1 block from the Empire State Building and is a great stop-over for budget minded travellers.We stayed for 4 nights in December 2003 and had 2 twin rooms with private bathrooms. The rooms are basic - they have 2 beds, a telephone, TV and safe which is really all we needed for our trip as we had gone to NY to explore the city, not the bedrooms.They were clean enough and warm and the staff were welcoming and helpful enough - and yes as stated in other reviews, they are behind glass screens at the reception desk ?!?!?Small hotel but good location to use as base to explore the city and is within easy walking distance of subway stations, as well as ESB, Macy's etc.I would give this hotel a 7/10 for overall score and would stop there again	
Feb 27 2006	our NYC home away from home	We found the Herald Square Hotel on tripadvisor(-) while looking for budget hotels in NYC. We were really nervous about any hotel that only charges $99 per night, but we figured if it was awful we could always check out and go to one of the more expensive familiar hotels we always stay at. We were thrilled to find that Herald Square Hotel is the real deal -- our rooms were immaculately clean, smelled fresh (it's a no smoking hotel!), and the beds were as comfortable as the heavenly beds so widely touted by the Westin chain. We had beautiful clean white sheets and overstuffed down comforters in our rooms and had the best nights' sleep I've ever gotten in NYC. The location is great, we felt safe and comfortable, and it was just like having our own little haven in the middle of the city. It's not luxurious or decadent, but I've paid three times that much for a room not much better. I can't recommend it highly enough, what a great find! Thank you tripadvisor.com and thank you Herald Square Hotel. We'll never stay anywhere else in NYC.	
Feb 10 2006	If you are thinking about it do it!!	I booked this hotel for a budget vacation over Thanksgiving. I was nervous as heck, not sure what we were getting into. My advice: Read all the reviews on here carefully and they will tell you pretty much everything you need to know about it. If you are considering a budget hotel, then this is an excellent choice for you. As mentioned in many reviews, the location is perfect for first time visitors who want to see it all in a few days. Main subway line is very close. (ps: I found a site online where you can enter your starting point and destination, and it will tell you exactly what subway line to take, and where to get off. It saved us tons of time. I highly recommend you do it before you go if it is your first time. We would have been a mess without it. I just printed them out and carried them with us.)Anyway, we were there to see the parade, etc over Thanksgiving, so with Macy's being so close it was perfect. There is adequate food close by, but no exceptional restaurants. But that's what cabs are for! There is a d. donuts right down the street, and a great 24 hr. bodega with groceries and hot breakfast/lunch/dinner right across 5th. ave. The staff is courteous, not overly friendly but never rude. I checked on our reservations twice before arriving and we checked-in in a very short time with no problems.We had a room with private bathroom. The rooms are very small but well cleaned every night. The bed is adequately comfortable. Bathroom is tiny but clean. I also used one of the common bathroom/showers down the hall a couple of times, and they were clean. They are bigger and have more shower space than the in-room bathrooms. I never saw anyone else use them over the 5 days we were there. Do not stay here if you want a classic NYC skyline view out the window, as there really isn't any. But again, it's a budget hotel, and great if you are just needing a place to shower/sleep. Internet access in the lobby is handy (cost a few $$) There is a very authentic Irish pub on 31st right across Broadway--great food, cold beer, and very friendly wait staff. We walked to Times Square a couple of times (with a 5 yr old child.) The neighborhood just south on Broadway is a little rough, but there's no reason to walk that way anyway. Overall, I highly recommend and would stay again if on a budget. Thanks NYC for a great trip. I was pleasantly surprised at the friendliness of the city. The MTA staff were especially helpful and friendly and we appreciate it. (sorry so long!)	
Feb 8 2006	Perfect location friendly staff	My husband &amp; I were in New York for our first time back in September. We stayed 7 nights at the Herald Square. After reading several reviews, we were expecting an extremely tiny room. Although there was no dresser for your clothes &amp; the closet was tiny, the room size was decent. The king size bed was so comfortable! The view from our room was nothing - we opened the shades to a brick wall, but we weren't in our room much. This hotel is in walking distance to a lot of attractions - 10 mins to Empire State Building, 20 mins to Times Square. We even walked to the United Nations &amp; Ground Zero. On our arrival day, we were expecting to store our bags because we knew we were early, but luckily they had a room for us to check in. There was no laundry room in this hotel, but there's a hotel 2 mins from here that does have one - we 'borrowed' it one morning. The front desk gave us directions to one that was about 6 mins away, but when we got there - it was closed, even though they should have been open for 2 hours already. So we just walked into the other hotel &amp; used their laundry facility. We were there during their high season, so no discount on hotel rates. Even though we paid rack for 7 nights, it was definitely worth it. Would stay there again in a heartbeat!!	
Feb 2 2006	good location	location is the best thing here. The hotel is perfectly adequate for a few days and was quite busy with a varied crowd from business types to students. Clean enough place and would stay here again.	
Jan 30 2006	Brill !!!	We stayed at Herald Square Hotel at very short notice as another hotel had let us down. We were worried about the standard because the price was cheap but we needn't have worried. The room was clean, with private bathroom, TV, very comfy bed and room safe. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and the location was great (if I put my head out of the window and looked up I was looking at the Empire State building) but it was also very quiet at night considering it's busy location - would stay there again.	
Jan 22 2006	Exceeded expectations for the budget traveller	We stayed at the Herald Square Hotel for a week in November 2005. We did not have high expectations before we arrived as we knew the hotel was at the budget end of spectrum. We were given a recently renovated room. When we saw the room we were pleasantly suprised. It was well fitted out, the bed was excellent, the bathroom was small but clean and nice. The room also had good heating, air conditioning and a flat screen T.V.The hotel does not have any bells and whistles, but the staff are polite and the location is excellent in Mid-Town. The room exceeded our expectations, especially for the price. We spent one night at the nearby Gershwin Hotel and thought that the Herald Square was better value (it was cheaper when we stayed) and the room much nicer. I would be more than happy to stay at the Herald Square again.	
Jan 19 2006	great value highly recommended	This hotel is great value, right in the heart of New York, 5 mins from Madison Sq Garden, Empire State,and subway station. Its clean, safe and the price is the best in the city, particularly for such a central location. The room we had wasn't as small as we were led to expect from some of the reviews - plenty of room for 2 people and bags with a very comfortable bed and large bathroom. Dont expect a luxury stayi.e. no free coffee, showercaps or shampoo - but do expect a hotel with value and comfort. I highly recommend and would definitely stay here again even in preference to a more swish hotel, due to its great location.	
Jan 14 2006	Loved the Herald Sq. Hotel!	On a budget? Stay here! Extreemly clean, very helpful staff, very safe location, and right off Broadway! The budget price allowed us to enjoy so many more sights in NYC! The beds were SO comfy! We weren't looking for high class, just a clean safe place to rest our weary bodies, and this was it! Close quarters, but plenty big enough. Bring your own shampoo, and if you're a tourist, we highly recommend the New York Pass, get it at Planet Hollywood. This hotel has character! Not much street noise either.	
Jan 11 2006	We Love NYC and the Herald Square Hotel!	Myself and three friends stayed at the Herald Square Hotel for three nights the first of December and we have only great things to say about it! It was the first time any of us had visited New York City so we wanted to see and do as much as possible in our four days, so we were not in our room very much but the time spent there was perfect for four women on a shopping/site seeing excursion. Actually this was not our first choice for a hotel (it wasn't even suggested by the travel agent or in any travel info we had received), but since almost everything else was booked for this time of year we booked it as soon as we located it on the internet. We were afraid that only paying $189.00/night we would end up being in a less than desirable hotel, but this was not the case at all. Our room was a perfect size for the four of us and all our luggage and shopping bags. The bathroom was just a good size but it was without a vanity so there was no place to keep our toiletries. This will definitely be the place to stay for us when we are lucky enough to return to NYC.Very friendly staff (so friendly we treated them with candy from home each day), awesome beds - so comfy we didn't want to get up mornings, lots of clean towels and hot water too. Our window opened for fresh air at night and we had no problem with noise - we actually couldn't believe we were in New York City!We didn't get to watch much TV but loved being able to check the weather station each morning when getting ready.There was even a safe available in each room.The elevators were a tad slow but we spent our time browsing the huge assortment of tourist brochures they had available. We also appreciated the small lounge area with telephones and internet hook up.We took advantage of the lockers for our luggage since we arrived at 7am on a Sunday morning. The staff helped us lock up our luggage until later in the day when our room was available.We loved being around the corner from Macy's and the Manhattan Mall. We walked almost everywhere we wanted to go (Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, 5th Avenue, etc.) but after leaving the Broadway shows at night we easily caught a cab for only $2 each (including the tip). We were even around the corner from one of the designated stops for the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour.We certainly recommend the Herald Square Hotel to anyone looking for a very reasonably priced, clean and friendly hotel right in Manhattan.	
Jan 10 2006	Served its purpose	I stayed here for 3 nights in Sept 2003. I had a single room with out a bathroom. There was barely enough room for the bed and the tiny sink. There was a TV at the foot of the bed, but it was so big that the shelf it was on came out about 3ft from the wall. The was a &quot;Sonic Rat Trap&quot; in the room. I've stayed in hotels before with mouse trap and such, but this was huge and I was on the 2nd foor!!!The night porter knocked on my door one evening and ask to borrow some shampoo. I didn't like that at all, I told him that I had none.Having said that, the hotel was cheap and it served its purpose. I had no trouble sleeping. There was a sitting area near reception that had pay as you go internet. From the rest of the reviews here, and my experience, you seem to be better off if you get a bigger room.	
Jan 5 2006	Times Square on a Budget	Since moving to Washington, DC over 10 years ago (and being a native New Yorker for most of my life); I look forward (with great anticipation) to my annual Christmas trip to The Big Apple. My girlfriend and I do the entire tourist thing; reliving old days. Rockerfeller Center; the Christmas Tree; Times Square (boy have they cleaned that up), The Palm, Santa at Macys and the list goes on. Two years ago we discovered The Herald Squareand after 3 or 4 stays its become home for both of us during the holidays. This year a few extra surprises awaited; we were used to the comfortable beds and the finely appointed bathrooms; but a widescreen TV and DVD player in the room were absolute bonuses. We walked everywhere; nothing was too far away. The Herald Square is a great choice, when you want to save your money for the other things that matter.	
Dec 21 2005	Halfway House or Hotel?	I booked a &quot;small single with bathroom,&quot; and thought I was prepared for a minimal room. But it was a cell, really. The tiny window looked out on an air shaft. The room was unbearably hot and the air quality was terrible. Thankfully there was an air conditioner; otherwise, I simply could not have survived in there. I should say that I paid $90 the week before Christmas -- a time when rooms in other hotels are either unavailable or inflated in price. And I would imagine that the double rooms are more bearable. But the hotel felt more like a half-way house than a hotel, and it's not an experience I would wish to repeat.	
Nov 20 2005	Great for the budget traveler	Over the last 15 years we've stayed in many Theater District hotels, and we've seen it all. We've stayed in 1) just-the-basics hotels with surly staff and tiny rooms, 2) overpriced boutique hotels with surly staff, tiny rooms and designer knobs on the faucets, 3) amenity-laden hotels with nice rooms and friendly staff, but as soon as the owners figure out how treasured the place is, the rates go up, and 4) dives. That brings us to the doorstep of Harold Square Hotel. Thanks to the positive reviews at TripAdvisor, we decided to give Herald Square a try. We were not disappointed. Yes, a glass wall greets you and you have to be to buzzed into the bare-bones lobby. Yes, you may share a midday elevator with a 50-something businessman and his young bubble-gum-snapping escort. (Why are stereotypes always true?) Yes, you have to walk a ways to get to Broadway shows.However, the staff is responsive. The hotel is clean. Our bed was comfortable. The bathroom is gigantic by NYC standards. We enjoyed our visit, and you can't beat the price. We will stay here again.	
Nov 15 2005	Great Hotel For The Price	A Family of 4 in one nyc hotel room no problem.The room was very clean, as was the bathroom, there were plenty of fresh towels, very nice staff, and a spacious room!!I'm not talking suite size but plenty of room for 4 people ( 2 adults and 2 teenage girls) and our bags and purchases.The only minor problem was with the water in the shower that would suddenly stop flowing for a minute but if you were patient it would go right back on. A minor inconvience in this otherwise gem of a hotel.I thought it was such a good find I booked a stay in December with friends for a shopping weekend.	
Nov 14 2005	How many times in one night can your sleep be ruined????	Got back to the hotel around midnight. Just wanted to get some sleep before a day of shopping. I turn in but my boyfriend wanted to read and had the overhead lights on above the bed. However, these lights buzzed so loud, and the lights were only about 4 inches above the pillow on the wall which also served as the headboard, that I couldnt stand the noise and he turned them off. As I tried to sleep again I noticed an even louder buzzing, like I had my head on top of a Boeing 747. I wondered if maybe I was sleeping on top of some kind of generator room. It turned out that the street light of the hotel was attached to the wall right outside our front window. The humming and buzzing were so loud, I swear I could feel the walls vibrate. Of course the light was shining in our room from the sign. All it needed was to be blinking to give us that seedy hotel room from a 50's B movie affect.Managed to fall asleep after I untangled myself from the non fitted bed sheet only to be awakened around 2:30 by a bunch of girls coming in the room across ours, followed by a party. Why the guests had to bang on the door I'll never know. A knock would have sufficed - it's not like no one in the room would hear since it's about the size of a closet. But bang away they did, each guest as they showed up through the hour. Clanging beer bottled and loud talking about who threw up in the limo and who was gonna punch who out....it was at this point I plugged my ears with tissue. What I couldnt figure out is why the person at the front desk would let all these people in at 2:30 in the AM.Mercifully the party left but returned an hour later with more people than before. After the party wound down, I FINALLY fell asleep again only to be woken up at around 5AM by the sound of the heat being turned on for some inexplicable reason. I could hear all the radiators throught the building clanging and banging as they were turned on, which made no sense since it was about 65 degrees outside.At this point I threw in the towel and just stayed awake. I was beat tired the rest of the day and my Sunday in NYC was ruined. How do you operate a hotel like this? The bed sheets weren't fitted and entwined your legs the minute you moved around, the window was unable to be opened or closed, the bathroom had a small ledge under the door that I must have bumped into ten times, the walls were paper thin....people always say on the forum &quot;what's the big deal if it's a cheap hotel, who stays in their room anyway?&quot; but I'm so sorry I didnt spend the extra money for a nicer hotel, because I only had one weekend in NYC, and with no sleep, I wasnt able to do what I wanted to do that Sunday. Thanks for nothing Herald Square.	
Oct 28 2005	Great value. Nice Staff.	Considering New york city hotel prices, the Herald Square hotel can't be beat. I was a little shocked at the half painted hallways and just how bare the rooms were, but I really dont think there is any grounds for complaint given the price. The furnishings are shabby but adequate. The room was quite bare, but clean. I did not suspect bugs or rodents (and I'm a total nutter about those things, If theres a bug in the room, I can feel it in me bones, aaarr). As a clean freak, I had no complaints. Our room was on the second floor overlooking the sidewalk, which was very noisy and had no view, plus we were under the awnings and had no natural light. But then again we did not come to New York to spend time in a hotel room, so who cares?When checking out, the very nice man at the front desk acknowledged that we got one of the poorer rooms in the hotel and promised to take care of us the next time we stay. It was nice of him to say that, he didnt have to, as we did not complain. I would stay here again. Just dont expect anything over basic and you wont be dissapointed.	
Oct 21 2005 	Excellent value Great Location	The great thing is that once you have read that the rooms are really small, you are prepared. And the rooms were really small. But at USD 100 per night, I got a nice clean room, with AC and an attached bath. For a single guy, who is not going to practice salsa in his room, this is an excellent value. A block from MACY's, it is conveniently located to some of the best restaurants. Subway is a minute's walk. Laundry is a block away. A must stay for the budget minded, who would rather spend on the attractions outside !!	
Oct 20 2005	very nice and comfortable!	Great price, excellent value! Great Location-2 blocks from the empire state building, a short walk to Penn station and Madison Square Garden. staff was very friendly, room was very clean and neat. I would definitely stay here again!	
Oct 16 2005	Great value great location	My wife and I stayed there 3 nights. We were in one of the newly renovated rooms. Great bed, nice bathroom, very good facilities. The only disappointment was the view. It was of a back alley. However, compared to the prices of other hotels, paying $148/night at the Herald Square was well worth it even if there was no view. Plus the location is great-about 2 blocks from the subway, and 4 blocks from Times Square. I would stay there again in a heatbeat.	
Oct 7 2005	Very good value for money	We knew we were taking a risk, booking a budget hotel in Central Manhattan, but we were pleasantly surprised. The room is cosy without being pokey - adequate room for a couple and two suitcases. The room came with Sky, so I could watch both Premiership Football and Baseball. The bathroom was tiny, but private, clean and with fresh towels daily. The air con was slightly noisy, but the room was sheltered from the noises of the street and dark enough to sleep plenty. Of my three trips to NYC this was the best value hotel accomodation I've had. Next time we come back I think we'll probably go back; it's 3 blocks from Macys, Empire State Building and Penn Station, and reasonably priced.	
Oct 7 2005	Fabulous - no complaints at all!!!!!	My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and have absolutely no complaints at all. The staff on the front desk were helpful, friendly and efficient. Security is fantastic, guests are buzzed in at the front door to the lobby. Internet kiosk and vending machines in lobby along with tons of tourist information - very convenient.Our room was well lit, fairly spacious, modern and came with the comfiest of beds and a flat screen TV (a lot nicer than the Beacon Hotel where we have previously stayed in NY).The location of the hotel was excellent, 3-4 minutes from Penn Station and Madisson Square Gardens, 5 minutes from Herald Square shopping centre and 3-4 minutes to Subway Stations and Postal Office.Would definitely stay here again!!	
Oct 3 2005	Wonderful	This hotel is perfect for those of us who really don't want to spend $2000 a night. A hotel is where you sleep, not where you live, so the darkeness was fine. The window had a nice view of some old buildings that I managed to get a good sketch of. I'd stay here again. It was in the center of Manhatten and ideal for walking and seeing the sights. The staff are very friendly.	
Sep 27 2005	Nice Hotel	I Stayed at this hotel from Sept 13-15th on vacation in N.Y. I found myroom to be good size for N.Y. It was very clean and everything worked.My only complaint was when I made my reservation I asked for a smokingroom when I arrived I found out they had gone smoke-free as of Aug. 1st.I would of liked to have been notified of this so I could have made otherarrangements. But it was fine since I was out most of the time anyway.Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for affordable rates.	
Sep 19 2005	Barely OK	My advice would be don't get the cheapest rooms, unless you are totally prepared for a tiny, extremely dark room - a cell, really. The cold tap in my room didn't work, and they didn't fix it. The batteries on the TV remote ran out, and I eventually replaced them myself. The window was so grimy you couldn't see out properly. The shared bathroom was inexplicably out of action for a whole day and we had to go to a different floor for a shower. I asked if I could pay more and upgrade to a larger room with bath, but the staff were not helpful and apparently no room was available the whole week we stayed. I was told to ask every morning if the situation had changed - I don't think it would have been too much for them to take a note of my request and inform me if a room became available. Each day I went to ask, there was a queue of people with minor complaints and it seemed to me the staff were not that interested in helping - but for the price, I guess that's not too surprising.On the positive side, the rooms were clean and the hotel was quiet. The price was excellent. Subway access is extremely good. It's an easy walk from Penn Station if you are coming from Newark Airport.I would say that there are better budget choices to be had. The Garment district is quite dull, compared to other Manhattan areas, and unless you are mad keen on shopping, or want to go up the ESB every day, you can probably find a better location. There were quite a few homelss people sleeping rough on the street (including one couple right outside the hotel who had their own double mattress and bedding!), and although we didn't feel at all unsafe, it was a bit depressing to encounter these poor souls each night and morning.	
Sep 12 2005	Girls weekend in NYCity	We wanted to be close to everything but our mothers were wary of the city. My mom heard about the hotel from a friend and insisted that we book there. It was a good choice for us. We were able to walk everywhere without getting on public transportation..the room was very clean and bright. We felt comfortable and safe. The staff answered all our questions and helped us with directions. I would recommend it to people in their twenties who are looking for a decent, safe, and very reasonably priced room in expensive NYC. I even got a care package (what my mom calls it) from the front desk since I'd forgotten my toothbrush. Definitely would return....	
Sep 1 2005	location is everything	we have just returned from staying in this little gem of a hotel in new york. we were there for 4 nights and i have to say that if you want a central hotel near to time square, macys and the 34th shopping area then this is the one for you. the rooms are very clean and yes they are not huge, but for all the time you spend in them, they are perfect for what we needed. the hotel was safe and very quiet at night which was also an advantage. the central location is a real plus and the staff where very helpful when we arrived, theuy even gave my husband the choice of two rooms.overall herald square is great and a budget place to stay so if you want to stay in a cheaper hotel in a great area...stay here!!!	
Aug 31 2005	I suspected rodents!!	Didnt cost a lot so didnt expect a lot. I draw the line at rodents in the rooms. Had some chocolate in a bag and it was fairly well nibbled by the time I left. Also the view from my room was just plain hideous (although Im sure those at the front of the hotel experience better). The bed-cover way pretty shabby too and also looked like it had been attacked by some small mammal. I am pretty well conditioned to living in squalor so I didnt complain but would not go back.	
Aug 26 2005 	Have stayed here 3 times looking foward to the 4th.	After reading many reviews from other users on this site, I decided to give this hotel a try. I arrived expecting to find a small but comfortable and clean room. This is exactly what I found, and then some. The room was extremely clean, had a safe in the room, and was very quiet. The staff at the front desk is very nice, and helpfull, and even allowed me check in at 10am, 5 hours before regular check in, at no additional charge( I wouldn't expect this all the time, but I guess I got lucky and they had my room ready early). The location of the hotel is great, and close to everything you need. Several subway stations are within walking distance, as is the HUGE Macy's. One of the highlights to any of my trips to New York is a venture to the top of the Empire State Building, and you guessed it, it's only a stones throw away!. Literally about a 3-4 minute walk. Lot's of pizza joints all over, as well as some decent Bars/Pubs. Several deli type stores dot the corners and are along the streets, with a great selection of drinks, and things to snack on. There is also a Dwayne Reed Pharmacy about a block and a half away. You are also right in the heart of what i am now calling &quot;Little Korea&quot;, so if you enjoy Korean food, you're in big time luck. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant on site, which many people might find a bad thing, but really people, YOU'RE in NYC!! get out and find some of the great food they have there. The bottom line is this. If you are someone that needs to be pampered, and waited on hand and foot, then this hotel *might not* be for you. If you are looking for a cheap, and clean room in the middle of everything, this hotel is definatly for you. This hotel doesn't offer all the amenities that other ones do, like shampoo and a toothbrush, but honestly, who doesn't travel with these things? I will definitely be staying here again and again. Who could pass up a sweet room in Downtown Manhattan for $90 a night?	
Aug 10 2005	Great Deal!	We stayed at the Herald Square while visiting New York in July. The hotel was just as many reviewers had said; it has great, comfortable beds and clean rooms! Everything worked well, from the air conditioning to the shower. Bringing your own shampoo and hairdryer is a very small price to pay for such a clean and quiet room. And on the other side of that glass in the lobby are wonderful, helpful people. We asked one of them a question about Life magazine and he have us a good story and a couple of Life 'cherub' keychains. I highly recommend this place!	
Aug 8 2005	Great Price 	Some friends and I stayed here for the week of the fourth. The room was small, but comfortably accommodated four women &amp; all of our belongings. There was a lot of construction going on outside, but the hotel itself was clean. The room was clean and was kept clean every day. The location was convenient for our daily outings. The staff was friendly and very helpful with giving directions. The beds and pillows were comfortable. It was very quiet at night. We did have to leave a deposit for the iron, but it was returned at the end of our stay. We plan to stay here on our return visits.	
Aug 1 2005 	Will be staying again.	Stayed at the Herald Square for the first time in March. Was somewhat concerned about the appearance of the lobby and reservation desk being behind glass. I had not been to NY in years, thought this might be something new regarding safety. My daughter and I were in NYC to explore the NYU option on her prospective college list. After a long day of non-stop walking around Washington Square, it was a pleasure to rest on such comfortable beds! Our room was small, but very clean, and we felt safe. I'll stay at the Herald again in the future to visit my daughter at NYU, especially now that our family is on an extemely tight budget!	
Jul 27 2005	On an island	I don't know what the rest of the hotel is like, but I got to stay in one of the newly refurbished first floor rooms(a manager recommended it). The decor was &quot;island like&quot; enhanced by a shuttered window that gave the impression of being far away from the hustle and bustle of the city outside. I returned from shopping and sank into a feather covered bed that made it possible for me to nap so long that I almost missed dinner with my friends whom I hadn't seen in years. And this from someone who has trouble sleeping!The bathroom had all the necessary amenities and the LCD screen in the room just put the crowning touch on the reasonably priced accomodations. I don't think you can find better value in the city. I certainly plan to return on my next visit from Arizona. Thank you Heral Square	
Jul 7 2005	Best value in NY	I came back from a four night stay at the Herald Square a couple of weeks ago and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. During a slight mix up with payment procedures the staff were lovely and couldn't have been more helpful during the holiday. Although the hotel is basic, it's incredibly clean - the towels and bedding are changed every day - and things that you'd often pay extra for (safe, air con etc.) are free. The location couldn't be better - smack bang between Broadway and 5th Ave and about 5 mins from Times Square. I felt safe and looked after the whole time and wouldn't hesitate to book the Herald Square for future trips to the Big Apple.	
Jul 1 2005	Great ValueGreat Location	The Herald Square Hotel is smack in the middle of mid-town between Broadway and Fifth Avenue so gets top marks for location.The public areas are undeniably basic - linoleum rather than carpet for example, but the rooms are spotless and boast a safe as well as a TV,and the staff are friendly and helpful. There is a range of rooms and its well worth booking one with a private bathroom. I have stayed in this hotel twice now and wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else when I'm in New York - it must be the best value in the whole city.	
Jun 16 2005	Best Cheap Place to Stay in NYC	Herald Sq. Hotel is my favourite place to stay when I travel to NYC. I've been there at least a dozen times and it can't be beat. The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean, and the location is fantastic. I have never encountered a rodent (as stated in the previous review), and doubt that there are any... the place is way too clean and the staff is way too diligent.	
Jun 15 2005	Remembering the Herald Square	I think we've finally found a hotel that meets all our needs for NYC. It was close enough to the city that we could walk to most of our destinations, the room wasn't overly large, but fit our criteria. The bathroom was a little cramped, but enough to shower and everything. The staff was friendly and accomidating. All and all a great stay and will definatly be staying there again. Nice clean affordable rooms, you can't go wrong at the Herald Square Hotel.	
Apr 19 2005	A Fine Bargain Stay	We thought that overall this was a perfectly fine stay for the resonable rate of $134 a night. The queen bed was wonderful, with a big fluffy white comforter and springy new pillows. The bathroom was clean and stocked with enough towels and washcloths. When we first checked into our room, we discovered that the in-room safe was broken (we needed it for my travel partner's laptop). The staff at the front desk gave us a new room, which I thought was very nice since they weren't obligated to do so. The new room was identical but in mirror image, and the safe functioned as it should. There was a hissy radiator that worried my partner, but all radiators hiss, and I slept on that side since it's not an issue for me. It didn't keep him awake. We'd been warned of possible construction noise outside on Saturday morning, but when we came rolling in at 3:00 AM, we fell fully asleep that we must have missed any particularly severe noise. The late-night desk clerk gets extra points -- we were starving after a night out and I vexed him for any names of all-night food places that deliver. He tried very hard to find the list that the day clerks keep, couldn't find it but looked up an all night pizza place for me in the phone book. (OK, Pizza Hut, but he tried). In the lobby they have an internet pod, $1 for 5 minutes if I remember correctly. This was very helpful to me. The lobby itself is roomy and has tables and chairs for guests on their way in or out. I saw a large family with a ton of luggage making good use of them. This hotel is not ritzy by any measure, but is very much like the small family owned hotels I stay at in Europe. All in all, a great value for your travel dollar.	
Apr 6 2005	Considering the price--	For $159.00 (including taxes!) we got a clean, quiet room with a confortable bed and a spotless bathroom. The staff was very helpful and the location (within an easy walk, with bags, from Penn Station).However, if one is looking for any more than a place to leave your bags and spend the night, you will be disappointed as there are no &quot;amenities&quot;.Frankly I'd much rather spend the money I'm saving on amenities of my own choosing!	
Mar 20 2005	Wildlife Warning	I booked this hotel from its own Internet site. I had also read the reviews on Travel Advisor and thought, eh, for the cheap price/good location I can hack it. The bullet proof glass and people in the lobby were sort of scary but I still had hope that the room would be clean. I opened the door and there he was running from the bathroom to under the bed. A rat, mouse, or perhaps someone's gerbil. I went downstairs and checked right out. The staff was helpful and friendly about this so perhaps someone else had this happen.	
Mar 18 2005	Value for money	I stayed in a tiny single room. It was clean, well serviced and all the staff were helpful and efficient. Location is convenient, although immediate surrounds are not very attractive.The main thing is that it was very cheap. I have stayed at some terrible cheap places in New York over the years, but this place was okay and, at least for a single, excellent value for money.	
Mar 7 2005	Girls weekend	febuary 7 2005 we spent a girls weekend in new york,first time in new york. we really ejoyed our room, it was very nice, staff were really nice. I will stay again when i visit ny again. It is close to alot things. I really recommend this hotel.	
Feb 8 2005	The Herold Square Hotel As good as it can be...	And getting better all the time! This is a place that is worth staying at, if only for the historical context and archieve it contains. Life magazine historical covers all over the place. I'm enervated by the continual effort being made to upgrade and modernize the facility. The staff is first rate, and frankly, I've stayed in hotels all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and find the staff here to be as friendly and attentive as any, any where else. Additionally, the central NYC location is a big plus. Combined with the reasonable cost of a night's stay, its an unbeatable experience. The room was immaculate, the bathroom spotless, the bed comfortable, and the flat panel TV a real plus. I can't think of a single reason to not stay there, and I will every time I'm in NYC. 	
Feb 3 2005	good price great location and that's all!	when my friend and i arrived at the hotel i almost fainted! the lobby is a total disaster but i guess this is because of refurbishment works. once we got to the room we felt much better (despite the orrible curtains, carpet and decoration!). the room was clean, confortable bed and powerful shower. Regarding the staff, i am afraid they are very rude and not always helpful. this hotel is perfect if you are really tight and on a budget. personally i will not stay there again.	
Feb 1 2005 	Know A Few Things......	Arrived at the Herald Square Hotel during the snow storm on the 23rd of January. First impression from the outside is nice, but upon entering I felt as if I was at a bus station. There is a ton of construction going on in the street which makes you feel you are in a low level industrial zone. The cashier is sitting behind a bullet proof glass, personal details and money must be slid underneath glass. The key to your room is slid back to you as if you are purchasing a seat on a train. This is a clean hotel, the bed is good, the tv works, no stains in the bathroom. The hotel staff were good natured and helpful which is a big plus too.But this is certainly nothing above budget travel. There is a hostel type of feel to the place. The lobby area is a bit worn, the main elevator is a disgrace and needs to be spruced up and sped up. The lobby has a coke machine, an internet site which is affordable, and a place to sit and read up front........but the carpet was rolled up for whatever reason adding to the drab condition. There are oversized lockers in the lobby that you can store your belongings in after you check out for the day, if you are going to be picked up at the hotel later on for a late flight. But that adds to the hostel type of feeling to the place, which is fine, but not what everyone is looking for in life.This is not a place a business person wants to have a meeting with clients, even if you insist that you are merely traveling alone and dont need to impress yourself. Your biz partners will think you have no sense or have no money to invest.It is a hotel for strictly budget minded folks, that is fine, but I expected a bit more.If as someone said here you can go to one of the internet sites and find a deal on a more upscale hotel, one should aim for that. While I thought the hotel is perfect for those looking to save money, next time i will spend either the 60 or so more dollars an evening or look around for something else.For instance, to say a hotel is clean is not enough, it is supposed to be clean isnt it? A bed is supposed to be somewhat comfortable. Why should n.y.c. have a different set of rules than any other place? I can get a good affordable room in europe and other biz places in the states for an affordable price but in much nicer condition overall.Lastly, I have stayed at better hotels in n.y.c that cost more but were worth it.	
Jan 26 2005	Fine for the price	We arrived in the middle of a blizzard so the hotel lobby was very wet, and some building work was going on at the time. However, the room was warm and clean and the bed was very comfy, its worth paying the extra few dollors for a queen size bed. The location was ideal and the hotel was worth it for the price but its not the sort of place to go if your looking for luxury- enjoy New York!!	
Jan 6 2005	Definitely Budget	On our first trip to NYC in September 2004 we stayed at the Herald Square the first few nights. I must say my first impression was not a good one. Granted we checked in on a Saturday night so it was probably full, but I heard the clerk whisper to her co-worker &quot;I wish we had a better room to give them.&quot; Once I saw it I wished they did too! The room was tiny, barely had enough room for our two suitcases and to get around the full size bed. I am not a picky person, Motel 6 is usually just fine for me! I had to have them change the sheets but the bathroom was clean and smelled strongly of bleach. The next day we awoke to loud construction next door, which we barely heard over the fan/AC unit which was loud itself! But the next day the staff was very happy to move us to a different room which was bigger and I was a lot happier there. Like everyone says the hotel's dark and old and not cozy, but after a long day of walking I always welcomed the bed and really it was fine. It's very convenient to the subway and on the same block as the empire state building. A few days into our stay we moved on to the second place we had reserved, the Belvedere Hotel which we had booked through priceline and gotten for the SAME PRICE. Ohhhh what a world of difference....the room was wonderful, great location right by Times Square. So my advice? Go Priceline! You can get a MUCH better hotel for the same price as the Herald Square!!!	
Dec 12 2004	the facts!	we are recently home from our first visit to NYC as a guest at the Herald square hotel. After reading the many mixed reviews on different websites, we had mixed feelings about what to expect so, these are the facts as we found them as of 3rd December 2004The outside of the hotel is quite pretty but, there are building works at both the side and infront of the hotel. As far as the noise, we stayed over the weekend until mid-week. No noise at weekend but, distant building sounds and banging from about 7.30am, I looked at it like this, if you are staying with the intention of lying in bed in the mornings, your on the wrong type of holiday! and if there wasn't this noise there is always the beeping cabs, and police sirens!...thats the thrill of being mid town NYC.The staff were really helpful, there was a slight problem with my booking, which they straight away accepted as their mistake and put right. Very helpful when asking about directions, places to eat and arranging cabs and exchanging T.cheques too.The lobby,lifts and landings will not blow you away with the New york style and for that matter nor will the rooms. They were however, clean basic, safe and had really really comfortable beds, which given that you will never in your life feel so exhuasted at the end of a day, is a true bonus!Some of the bad things i had read post visit were, the bullet proof glass and the being &quot;buzzed in&quot; through the doors. Well why is this a big deal??...i assume the glass is there for the safety of the hotels staff!? and as for being buzzed in, well it keeps the unwanted out?!...to have a grand reception area costs the guest more to stay there, doesn't it? and afterall, you dont sleep in the reception!The rooms were dirty?, well, we had a smoking room and yes it was a little dated and could have benifitted from a new set of curtains but, the bathroom was clean, clean beds everyday and fresh towels. Basic but, what do you want, at the end of the day, if you spend any more time in your room than for sleeping then there is something really wrong!.Yes the hotel is quite dark, in respect of natural light, what can i say, the building is really old! Over all the hotel is in a FANTASTIC location and is at a give away price for New York. If you want the &quot;fairytale&quot; then pay the extra and go somewhere else! but, to be honest when there are so many fab things to spend your cash on, quite frankly you would have to be bonkers!.As the hotel says &quot;Great budget hotel&quot; and it really is!	
Nov 29 2004	Great value great location	My husband and I visited NYC for the first time this September. A friend recommended the Herald, as a cheap place with a great location. Around the block from the Empire and Flatiron buildings, and handy for little coffee shops, the recently painted exterior of this hotel looks like classic New York. Inside ain't so great, but the lobby (as the rest of the hotel) is clean and bright.This definitely feels like a safe hotel, as you need to be buzzed in by staff after hours.Don't expect luxury. This is a budget hotel and you get what you pay for. The green decor (even with the lovely Life magazine covers) was far from modern, even though our room had just been refurbished. The air-conditioner was too noisy to use much and the TV worked only sporadically. But on the flip-side, our queen-sized room was ample, and the shower and bath much appreciated after long days traipsing city streets. Worth paying for the queen-sized rather than the double - it's only a few bucks more.After difficulties finding a record of our booking when checking in, we had no problems with the staff and the room was always kept spick and span.The verdict? Great price and great location. You get what you pay for, and this hotel doesn't cost much. A clean, well-located hotel with no expensive extras was just what we hoped for, even though the rooms don't look very pretty. Stayed here for six nights and will do so again next trip to the city.	
Nov 20 2004	no brainer	I live in south beach fl. and love visiting ny for my friends and shopping. I stay a the herald square hotel, because it is affordable, has a central location. I like the staff and the choice of rooms and prices. I love that there are different room to fit my budget and have been excited about the continue upgrading of the hotel. It's a great deal and a no brainer if you are visiting ny.. Lisa	
Nov 14 2004	First Time in NYC - Loved the Herald Square Hotel!	Thank you so much to the Herald Square Hotel for making my husband and I feel so welcomed in New York City! This was our first time in the Big Apple and I must say the staff certainly knew the &quot;art&quot; of treating people. We enjoyed seeing all that New York had to offer and never feel lost as the staff provided us with everything we needed to get around. The hotel also provided a lot of history, in part to all the wonderful Time Life pictures &amp; magazine covers within the hallways. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants great service, a great nights sleep, and a great price!	
Nov 11 2004	Happy at the Herald Square Hotel	We found hotel on the web.Most of the reviews were good,a few not so good.We wanted to see for ourselves.The hotel is 111 years old ,so we asked for their newest rooms.We entered room 9 on the ground floor ,a double with a brand new bathroom.A great bed and a flat screen tv.Very clean and quiet,a tad small but served us well.We walked the hallways to view the collection of early Life magazines,a clean wellkept building.Staff is friendly and helpfull.The staff seems to be constantly cleaning,painting ect.Spoke to other guest from all over the globe,all seemed happy with their rooms.You cannot compare to a brand new holiday inn.A lot of history and charm here.We would recommend the 9th ,8th ,front of the hotel as well as the ground floor rooms to first timers.These are the rooms we had a chance to peek into on our hallway tour.We disagree with the negative reviews we read on the web.We will stay here again. Cheers	
Nov 8 2004	Do not stay here	Stayed here in July of 2004 and the place is dark, the room was very small with one very small window that looked out to another building. The place should be demolished. It feels like you are staying in an asylum, steel doors, cement hallways. A homeless shelter would be better than this. The hallways are creepy, stark and dirty. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Stayed one night and went immediately to another hotel. One good thing, the staff was very kind and helpful.	
Nov 6 2004	Now this place is a true **** hole	Well, what can I say, the place looked great on the internet, then upon arrival.... OH MY GOD.... where do I start the story.After having to be buzzed in the door and then standing on the opposite side of bullet proof glass where the staff was just WAY more nasty than need to be, we got a &quot;maintenance person&quot; to get us into our room. (Apparentely they were having some sort of key problem).The hallways were filty and filled with mattress and box springs with frames and dresser drawers (jsn't that a fire hazard), I can't even begin to explain what the hallways smelled like!!! The room itself was very small, not cleaned to well, the furnishings old and broken, the curtains were OH MY GOD... dingy, stained, ripped, you didn't even want to touch them. The windows did not even open!!! There was hair all over the bathroom floor (gross); and the shower head was rusted to the point where it hardly even worked. My god... there wasn't even a toilet paper holder. The carpet didn't even fit the floor, looks like they just threw it down on the floor and said &quot;Well, that's ok&quot;. On the topic of the carpet, it was stained beyond what carpet should be.They advertised free HBO on their web advertisement, I guess the TV's didn't read that. The television in our room only worked when it wanted to. We did call to have it repaired, the guy came up and said &quot;OH well&quot;. That should tell you a bit about their customer service.Don't make the same mistake that we did. STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS **** HOLE. There is a very nice place called the Wolcott across the street, this is our suggestion. I am requesting a refund from the hotel, and should it not work, will refute the charge with my bank. At a rate of $149.00 per night, a true rip off!!!!Former Unhappy Herald Square Guests	
Oct 11 2004	Okay	I just returned from a 5 night stay in room 219. The room was small, but adequately sized, with a queen sized bed. Bathroom and closet were both large. Clean and basic. Major complaint would be that the one window faced an enclosed airshaft with VERY little natural light. Even in bright mid-day the room was very dark. Major construction across the street meant a lot of early morning noise, except on sunday. Would never pay this much ($129) for a room here again unless I was unsuccessful on priceline for up to this amount as I was this time.	
Oct 5 2004	Good clean cheap excellent location	Spent 4 nights at the herald in August 04 staying in room 10, the room was small but clean with on suite and air con. Because the hotel is located pretty much in the centre of Manhatten, it's ideal for anything an everything you want to do(eating out/Theatre/sightseeing).Staff are very poilte and helpfull, and I think it's one of the few hotels where you can smoke in your room.	
Aug 18 2004	LIKED IT.	I normall stay at The Wolcott across the street,had seen Herald Square on my previous visits so decided to give it a go. The staff are really nice and helpful,the hotel is very clean.The rooms reflect the price you pay,you have heat (I VISIT IN WINTER), a bathroom and a bed,what more do you want? I take a travel kettle to have a cuppa when I wake up, but plenty of nearby places to get food and drink, a stones throw from Empire State Building. Would use this hotel again.	
Aug 15 2004	Herald the Herald Square Hotel	I am a regular repeat guest at the Herald Square Hotel.I have tried their smallest,cheapest rooms ,no views but very clean and everything works.My regular choice rooms are their queen sized doubles which are usually sold out.One must book far in advance.The staff always tries its best when and if a problem arises.Management is always available to be spoken to, they have always been fair and honest with me.I share my review with others because affordable hotels in NYC are a becoming hard to find and this one is a gem.	
Aug 12 2004	worst room ever	the room was small and faced an enclosed air shaft...when I asked for another room the service given had to be the worst I have ever experienced in any hotel or city I visited..I would advise to stay clear of this hotel...It made my NYC experience less than enjoyable	
Jun 30 2004	Good Budget choice Midtown but Noisy	We stayed at the Herald Square mid June 2004 in a Queen suite. The hotel staff were pleasant, friendly and helpful. The room was fine about standard size for a New York budget hotel. Maid service every day clean and efficient. The Herald is the former Life magazine building and as such has an interesting history. Between 31 and 34 streets are good midtown locations for subways etc but the streets around are very busy and crowded. BEWARE however if you are looking for a quiet hotel. After 3 or 4 days you generally adjust to the volume of noise in New York, however currently next door to the Herald Square hotel there is a building site being cleared for construction. We had been in New York 10 days before moving to this hotel and felt we had adjusted to the noise of the city, however even we found this particular spot VERY noisy. Check with the hotel before booking about this if you plan to stay more than one night, construction carries on late and starts early. Without the construction I would give the hotel 3.5 stars. There are no ironing boards, hairdryers, tea or coffee facilities in the room. You can obtain irons, hairdryers from the front desk for $20 deposit which we thought wasn't good customer service. We would stay here again if the construction had finished. If you require a taxi to the airport go in a yellow cab and do not use the service that one or two of the porters at the hotel will try and get you to use. This is a private company and although they say the charge is about $50 the driver will dispute this at the airport and request nearer to $100 because of toll charges, tips and service fee. Needless to say we told him where to go when we got to the airport, gave him $60 and left with our luggage, some people however may not want this type of problem at the holiday end. A yellow cabs fee to the aiport is fixed by local law.	
Jun 21 2004	For the budget traveler	Due to a last minute business trip to attend a trade show at the Jacob Javits Convention center, I stayed at the Herald Square Hotel in a room with two double beds at $140 plus tax. Every other hotel in NYC was either sold out or wanted $260-$375 plus tax. I could have stayed in Jersey for less, but didn't want the hassle of a morning commute into the city. The room was clean but my only choice was a smoking room and I'm a non-smoker. This is in a great location, within walking distance of Penn Station and the PATH station, right near Macy's. Like the other reviewers, you need to ask yourself how much time will you spend inside your room. The less time you spend in the hotel, the more you will appreciate its value. Parking is $21 per day, just around the corner; compare this to $40.00 at some of the mid-town hotels. Lots of Korean restaurants nearby for the adventurous or those on the Atkins diet; try the Korean BBQ!! The staff was very professional and courteous. 	
Jun 8 2004	Quality budget hotel!	I went to NYC just last weekend with my 2 friends and stayed at the Herald Square.The location isn't as good as it was said to be, nothing much around the block and it takes around 25 - 35 minutes to walk to Times Square.The subway stations are at least 4 blocks away, which is quite a walk considering the size of Manhattan.But the hotel itself was quite something. It's clean, spacious, well-equipped and comfortable.If you expect a nice view then that's one of the few things they don't have. Otherwise, you can expect to find all necessities there, a tv, a comfy bed, a very clean bathroom w/ bathtub, an in-room safe, a large closet and lots of lights.of course, this is a budget hotel, the staff can't be as polite as the ones in the Plaza, but their advices are useful and they are very efficient in helping guests.i would have given this hotel a 4.5 if i could, but a 4 is more like it considering the location isn't as good as ppl say	
Jun 3 2004	Do Not Herald THIS Square!!	Horrible from start to finish. Just horrible. If Elvis were alive today, he would perform &quot;In The Ghetto&quot; live via satellite from this locale. Good luck!	
May 5 2004	Like the Herald Square	Family memeber and myself have stayed at the Herald Square a number of times (but not in the past two years). I have to say that the place was very good value for money, clean, secure, well located...what more do you want. I'd also recommend the Portland Square Hotel (it's been a while since I stayed there, but on last inspection on the outside it looked ok). Please don't stay in these places if your expectations are 4 star.	
Mar 29 2004	Not my thing!	I spent an evening here in March 2004. Originally I'd scheduled a 3-day stay here before my vacations plans changed, and when I walked through the halls for the first time, I was glad I was leaving the next day! The place is intimidating - a reception desk sheilded with bullet-proof glass, grimy tile floors, dirty walls (or so they seemed). To be fair, the room was clean and newly painted...it just wasn't a place to relax after a long day of sightseeing.The staff was actually friendly for a cheap hotel in New York.It's okay if you plan to spend one night in NYC, but if you're staying longer and THAT short on funds, either get a chain hotel or a hostel.	
Mar 21 2004	A Good Alternative to the Homeless Shelter or a Cardboard Box	Out of curiosity I went to tripadvisor to hear peoples comments on the Herald Square Hotel. Several years ago we went to New York around Christmas ( the most beautiful time to be in New York City ) and did not wish to pay $200.00 a night plus 20% tax. The Herald Square looked decent online. How bad could it be? Well the location was good ( alot of Korean businesses and restaurants in the area ). Not the perfect location but fairly central. I've never been to a hotel before where the clerk had to buzz the door to unlock it so we could enter the lobby. The front desk is behind bullet proof plexiglass. Since our room was not ready you can store your bags in lockers (like the kind in a bus terminal) This is definitely not the Plaza. Upon my wife and I entering the room I knew we were going to have a problem. We were told the bed was going to be a &quot;French Double&quot; ...... we are both big people and had to sleep sideways!!! It did get really hot at night and since the window did not open we had no choice but to turn on the airconditioner in the window during the winter. You had to take a step up to enter the bathroom like on a cruise ship. Bathroom fixtures were certainly dated. --- To this day, my wife and I whenever rating a hotel always say &quot; We'll it's not as bad as the Herald Square&quot;! I travel alot and this was the very worst! It sounds like the European clients are happy with the hotel, yet the Americans are not. We paid about $80.00 a night plus tax. For a little more stay at one of the Best Westerns where they have to maintain chain standards.	
Jan 7 2004	If its a great location that your looking for!	Stayed at the Herald Sqaure in Jan 2003.We were slightly disappointed when we arrived.The web site was a bit generous in its description.The location was excellent to say the least.The fact that there is no comfortable reception are makes it feel a bit cold on arrival.The rooms were verging on tiny.They were clean &amp; very warm however.Would pass on the name of hotel to friends , but would be very clear on what they can expect.Others might not have been as complacent. Location is 5 star , hotel is debatable!	
Jan 5 2004	Not too Bad Not too Great	Mixed feelings about the Herald Square Hotel. On the plus side, the location is central, the front desk staff is very friendly, and the price is hard to beat. (Including taxes and fees, I paid $98 per night for a single room with bath.) The room was worn, but clean. On the down side: the room was an absolute inferno, and there was no way to open the window. There was incessant noise from the ice machine in the hallway (perhaps guests were trying to douse themselves with the cubes to cool off from the room heat?), so it won't be pleasant if you're a light sleeper. And the last morning I was there, one of the hotel's maintenance workers whistled so loud in the hallway, I thought my TV turned itself on to the Andy Griffith show or one of the guests checking in was Uncle Remus from &quot;Song of the South.&quot; All in all, if you just need a place to crash for one or two nights while you tour the city, it would be a good deal. But note to management, please quiet your symphonic janitor before sunrise.	
Dec 16 2003	Excellent location	Stayed here from 3rd - 7th December. Room small but clean, noisy central heating pipes but cosy inside from the snow so we didn't mind the noise. Perfect location and friendly staff. Would definitely stay their again	
Dec 15 2003	Would stay here again	Stayed here for 4 nights 4-7 December. Room small but clean, staff helpful &amp; friendly. Bed comfortable and bathroom fine. Handy location - this was our third visit to NY, first at this hotel as recommended by friends. Would certainly stay there again.Trevor &amp; Jessean Phillips	
Nov 13 2003	Herald the Herald Square Hotel	This is more than just a Hotel with great prices and location, it a museum! .... The Original Life Magazine lives here... Pictures, Art work, History cover the walls of the rooms and hallways. This is more than a great place to stay it's an experience. There is a room for everyone here. Clean, Safe, And the staff is Friendly and oh so helpful. My Friends recommended it and they were RIGHT!! BRAVO!!	
Sep 26 2003	The Price Is Right!!	Great budget place to stay in New York. The central location is excellent, close to Empire State, Madison Square Garden, 10 mins. to Times Square. The rooms are clean, the staff was friendly and the security of having the front desk buzz you in was great. If you are looking for views or room service, this is not the place to stay. You could pay way more money and stay somewhere else, but when you're in NYC, how much time do you really spend in your hotel?	
Sep 12 2003	Yikes!	After reading reviews of this hotel on another website and visiting the actual hotel website, we decided to try the Herald Sqare in November 02. We are returning to New York this November, BUT NOT AT THE HERALD SQUARE. We booked a room for four, but upon arrival were given a room for three (after the ride on the very small, very scary elevator). We were given a new room on the first floor. This room had a black out window, the mattresses sagged in the middle and we were kept awake at night by the loud heating unit and commotion in the hall way all night. Pay a little extra and try the Red Roof or Comfort Inn just a few blocks up!	
Sep 4 2003	Nasty hotel great city	We stayed at the Herald Square Hotel for only one night, thank god, in June 2003. I saw the hotel online and thought it looked pretty from the outside so I went with it. Boy, was I wrong. The hotel was disgusting. The lobby was dirty and the front desk people barely spoke English. Our hallways on our floor reeked of B.O., so bad that we actually had to hold our noses. Our room was for 3 people so we had one full size bed and one single bed. The bed was just a little bit smaller than the room, and the single bed was in a miniscule room connecting to the bigger room with no door. The sheets on the bed were gross, as were the pillows. I slept in as many clothes as possible so I didn't have to rub up against the sheets. The bathroom was so small that I almost got stuck in it, and I'm not a big person. We didn't shower since we only stayed one night and left early the next morning to go home. I didn't even look in the shower for fear of being even more disgusted. The whole place was filthy and smelled either of B.O. or mothballs and people were smoking in the hallway. Despite this nasty hotel, I had a great time in NYC. We went sight-seeing for over 12 hours in one day and were completely exhausted by the time we got back to the hotel. The hotel is very close to Times Square (about 10 blocks away) which is very convenient. We tried walking everywhere to save money but by midday we were too tired. All in all, had a fun time but I will never stay at this hotel again, or recommend it to anyone. Someone said its good for students on a budget, which we are, but spend the extra money and go somewhere else.	
Jul 26 2003	affordable and friendly	Business brings me to NYC every month for 3-4 days.I found the Herald Square Hotel while walking on 31st street. It is hard to just walk past this place, lots of eye candy and a story to tell. I asked to see a room and was very impressed with their prices and rooms. It has been my&quot; pied a terre &quot;since 2001. Always affordable, clean and friendly. Ask for the 9th floor
