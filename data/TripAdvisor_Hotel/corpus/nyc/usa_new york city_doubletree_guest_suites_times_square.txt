	For the money you can find a better hotel with better service"	The location is great! But the service was awful! The rooms were large for New York standards.	
	Best Hotel and Best Location	The positive reviews of this hotel are for real. My take on the negative reviews is that there are some folks you can't please no matter what. I have stayed at this hotel twice and after having stayed at numerous other hotels in NYC, I have to say that this one of the best and is by far my favorite. It is really more like a small apartment in the heart of Times Square. I never had to spend the big bucks in a restaurant since we had a small kitchenette and brought in buffet food from a store nearby. As a very satisfied Hilton Hhonors Gold member, we got a free breakfast every morning, making this a terrific deal. This is now the ONLY hotel I will ever consider when visiting NYC.	
Nov 26 2009 	Perfect location-Perfect Hotel	Stayed here from Nov 19-23. Hotel is right in Times square and everything you want and need is right out side the doors. The lobby and check in is on the 3rd floor. Everybody we talked to was very friendly and help full if you had any questions. We stayed in room 3211 which was a suite with a pull out bed. My friend could not believe the size of the room as he was in NY earlier in the year and he said just the living room area was bigger than the room he had in the other hotel. If you are traveling in a party and don't want to be cramped then this is the place to stay. Outside noise was never a problem and never caused me to lose sleep. Elevators were fast and never had to wait that long to get one. Just watch the doors as they close fast. The only thing i found wrong was that the TV programs were not in High definition. My friend used the weight room every day and loved it. I went and looked at it and it had everything you needed for a good work out. This will be the only place i look to stay when i return to NYC.	
Nov 25 2009 	Great Value	Every time I stay here I am amazed at the size of the room you get for the price and location. The Doubletree offers you a two room suite in the heart of Times Square for half the price of most other hotel's single rooms. The Hotel offers very few other amenities, but you are in Times Square, and 10 minute walk in any direction from literally hundreds of restaurants, bars and night clubs, so why do you need any hotel amenities other than a large, clean room? If you are taking the kids to the city, this is definitely the place to stay.	
Nov 24 2009 	Great location clean comfy rooms	We stayed 4 nights at this hotel in November. Rooms were spacious and comfortably held us 3 girls and all our luggage plus what we bought while we were there! Check in was quick, easy and friendly considering we arrived at midnight. The girl gave us a choice of rooms and we went for one with a view of times square. We were only on the 9th floor so the view wasn't great and we also couldn't see the ground due to a ledge/balcony below our window but this didn't affect our stay in any way. The warm welcome cookies were a nice touch on arrival. The sofa bed in our room was not particularly comfortable but all 3 of us fitted easily into the one double bed which was extremely comfy. The room was kept very clean and had a nice sized bathroom, which you could access from the bedroom and living area. We also had 2 tvs, a fridge, microwave and coffee machine. The guys at the bell desk were very helpful and kept our cases for the day once we had checked out so thanks to Miguel and Jordan for their service. The hotel is in a great location so it is easy to reach everything from there. We found the nightlife in the surrounding area to be a bit too touristy - a bit like going out on a Saturday night in Leicester Sq or Picadilly when you live in London. We found the West Village area on our last day and wished we had found it sooner as it looked like a better night out could be had there with less posey people around. We booked the Sex and the City tour with Viator.com which is well worth doing if you are a fan of the show but try to do it early in your stay as the guide pointed out loads of sights and gave us special offer discounts which we were unable to visit or use as it was our last day there. Also, try to go to Carmine's - an italian restaurant which does really great food near to the hotel. They serve everything in big family portions so you just get the one starter and main dish and everyone shares. The 3 of us ate for around $60 and there was so much food left over it could have fed another 3 people. I'm not sure of the exact address but the concierge will be able to tell you at the hotel. Don't let the concierge tell you you won't get a table though. That's what they told us so we just got dressed up and went in. They asked us to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes when a table would be available so it wasn't a problem that we hadn't booked. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good location at a reasonable price. It's not luxury but it is clean, spacious and comfortable with good service, which is all you really need for a short break.	
Nov 21 2009 	Great Staff Makes a Great Visit	Trip starts at the front door with Marco and Charlie M. When you get to Front Desk Danny , Michael, Carla, Demarris, and Jenny will take great care of you. Great security system in place	
Nov 19 2009 	An Unexpected Gem in Times Square	Walking around in the hustle and bustle of Times Square can be daunting, but as soon as you arrive in the third floor lobby of the Doubletree, it is serenely calm. It is the rooms, however, that really make this an exceptional value in New York. The suites are spacious and have been recently renovated. Mine had two double beds and a flat screen TV in the bedroom. There was a sizable, separate sitting room with sofa, table, chairs and TV. This room also had a wet bar, microwave oven and refrigerator. The sizable bathroom had two sinks and opened into either room. Comfy beds and bedding, too. Another plus -- if you arrive by train or bus to Penn Station, Grand Central Station, or the Port Authority terminal, the Doubletree is a manageable walk if you aren't carrying too much luggage. I would gladly stay here again.	
Nov 18 2009 	SUPERLATIVE	We had booked another hotel for the weekend, but upon checking Hotwire.com the day before our planned New York trip we saw a 4-star Times Square all suite hotel posted for $148. It was obvious without much research that this was The Doubletree Guest Suites. Needless to say, we hastily cancelled our previous reservation and booked this immediately. We were impressed with the entire experience. We were greeted warmly by the front desk staff who put us into a 36th floor suite with spectacular cityscape views. The suite was spacious and beautiful with nice, well maintained furnichings, abundant lamps and warm lighting, elegant window treatments, and a great bed with luxury linens. The suite was pristinely kept with thoughtful touches at every turn. There was a huge, amenity laden bathroom with double vanity and entrances from both the bedroom and the living room. I had forgotten to pack shaving cream and a quick phone call had my request delivered within 5 minutes. There is a spacious wetbar with microwave, small refrigerator and coffee maker. We experienced absolutely no noise from the street or from adjacent hotel neigbors. It's readily apparent that the staff at this hotel is unifomly service and hospitality oriented. All public areas, including elevators, appear to be newly renovated. All in all, an outstanding hotel experience. Highly recommended!	
Nov 16 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised by the Doubletree	We just came back from a one night stay at the Doubletree. What can I say - it was a great stay! As others have reported, the rooms are large, two-roomed suites. We had a king on the 42nd floor with an amazing view of Time's Square all the way up to Central Park. Room was clean, comfortable and I could easily seeing spending a long weekend here. Loved having a mircro and mini fridge as well.My son had dinner at Ginger, the hotel's restaurant, and he enjoyed his steak. It wasn't a NY steakhouse but, the decor was nice and we didn't have to compete with noise, as we did at the other restaurants we dined at.Also really liked the reception/bar area. Found the hotel to have very good security in place.We'll definitely be back.	
Nov 16 2009 	Magic.	Well what can i say that has not already been said, stunning view from the 34th Floor of Timeas Square, and i nice spacious suite that was perfect. The staff were fantastic especially Andrew at the ground reception, he took care of items i had left for friends to collect with great care and attention. Will be back that is for sure, go on treat yourself...stay here, you will not be dissapointed.One tip however IF you are calling home, use your mobile i was £62 in calls, and i can honeslty say did not make too many calls, seems a little overpriced to call international.	
Nov 15 2009 	Absolutely amazing Hotel	Ive just come back from a 6 day break staying at this Hotel - as I went with two friend we chose this Hotel as it had a separate bedroom and a sofa bed in the front room - the rooms were very spacious and the King size bed was extremely comfortable, there were two flat screen tvs in the rooms. THe bathroom was very spacious and included a bath - also, we had a sink, fridge and coffee facilities in the lounge which came in really handy so two peopke could get ready to go out at one and not worry about waiting for the bathroom to use the mirror/bruch teeth etcWe stayed on the 21st floor and the view from our room was amazing, we looked out onto all the neon lights of Times Square - we all couldnt stop looking out and were hypnotised by them!Although it says you can have wireless broadband for a small cost, we had a free connection if you just wanted to check your emailsAll in all I cannot fault this Hotel - the location could not be beat - you walk out of the door and right onto the lights and madness of Broadway!	
Nov 10 2009 	fantastic locationcouldn't have asked for more	Really had a fantastic time in this hotel. It is so close to everything. Perfect for those girly shopping trips. The staff were excellent and so willing to help at any time. Daniel in reception was so good to us and Charlie and his colleague went to great lenghts to get us a hugh taxi to Newark airport in friday eveving rush hour traffic. Any time we called housekeeping they were so obliging. The only thing that was slightly off was the systenm with the channels on the tv. where they show all pay per view channels only but do not advise you that you can get music channels without having to pay for them. Cannot say another bad word about the hotel, Even though it was in times square there was no noise fron outside, the rooms were spacious and it was very reasonably priced cosidering location. I woiuld definitely stay there when I return to the big apple. Thanks to all the staff for the help, couldn't ask for more	
Nov 10 2009 	Beautiful hotel disappointing customer service	We reserved this hotel using Hotwire and requested two rooms that would accommodate 8 adults altogether. Two days before arrival, I called the hotel to confirm that we would have double beds in both rooms and was told that I could make such a request at check in... but not before. Naturally, upon check in we were told that all of the double bed rooms had been spoken for and our party of 8 would need to settle for two rooms that each had a king sized bed and a pull out couch. Not exactly what we were expecting (or paying for)... for 8 adults. To add insult to injury, the pull out beds in this hotel were barely passable as &quot;sleeping accommodations.&quot; The mattress was a mere 4 inches thick and fraught with squeaky springs that jabbed through the linens. Fast forward to our check on on Sunday when we requested to speak with the day manager (Carla Ortiz) who was very much &quot;on script&quot; and repeatedly informed us that we had intentionally selected our accommodations. When we explained the Hotwire reservation system to Ms. Ortiz (which doesn't include the option to select the number of beds, only to indicate the number of people in your party) she stated that we should have called ahead to request double beds. When that argument didn't work in her favor, she looked at her Hilton script and pointed her finger at Hotwire. Evidently, the Hilton hotel chain thinks that it is completely appropriate for their guests to sleep on a pull out bed... and thinks that giving out chocolate chip cookies is a replacement for actual customer service.	
Nov 9 2009 	Great location! Excellent hotel staff especially Michael!	Excellent stay. The room was very spacious with a small living room, microwave and fridge. And clean and quiet, too. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating, especially Michael. Each night, after returning from a long day of touring - Michael welcomed us with a warm smile and delicious cookie! The location is perfect.... right across the street from the half price tickets to broadway, close to Rockefeller Center, 15 minutes walking to Central Park. The Duck boat tour is exactlly 5 steps outside the door. Getting to the hotel is very easy. We took the express bus from Manhattan. It stops first at Grand Central and then Port Authority (42nd and Eighth). Get off at the second stop and walk to Times Square. The hotel is on the left side of the big Coke sign. Double Tree hotel in Times Square is at the top of my list for New York hotel recommendations. I look forward to staying here again.PS: There is a TGIF restaurant and electronic shop next door. Look up at the surveillance camera and call someone you know on the cell phone! www.earthcam.com/	
Nov 9 2009 	Excellent Hotel!	We were very pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Service was excellent, right from our arrival at the hotel to check-out. We have been to NYC quite often but this was our first time staying in Times Square. Location of the hotel was great and noise was minimal. The rooms were a little tired and may be in need of renovations but all in all, we were very happy with our decision to stay here.	
Nov 8 2009 	Best value in NYC!	Four friends in one hotel room. This was the only place in town where we could all fit comfortably and stay within our budget. Having a fridge, coffee maker and sitting area in addition to two double beds was very convenient and the location was central to all of our sight-seeing. No amenities like one would expect in an all-suites hotel (like free-WiFi or continental breakfast) but the ability to cram 4 of us in a room for the same price as one room with a double bed in the W would have cost was totally worth it.	
Nov 5 2009 	Every Stay is like Going Back Home!	I have stayed in dozens of hotels in New York City and, by far, this hotel offers the MAXIMUM in service. When they say they want to be a 10, THEY MEAN IT. I get points at the Hyatt and the Starwood Hotels (Westin) but their service doesn't come close to the Doubletree so I have chosen to stay here when I travel to the city for business. I feel comfortable, I feel secure, every request I have had has been granted - there is no reason to stay anywhere else! Marcos, their number one bell hop ALWAYS welcomes me back. Hanna, the sweet and beautiful hostess at the restaurant makes me feel as if I am the only customer in the place. I cannot say enough about these fine people. To be remembered and treated so kindly everytime I return is a RARE GEM for a large hotel.	
Nov 1 2009 	Fabulous hotel location and holiday	I travelled to New York with my two teenage children in October half term, and chose The Doubletree Guestsuites because we wanted somewhere central. I wasn't disappointed one bit. The location couldn't have been better. We were right in the middle of Times Square where it really didn't sleep. However, the hotel rooms are all located on high floors and the heavy drapes helped to shield out noise and lights so it didn't affect our sleep when we finally decided to lay our heads down. What was also so great about the locations was that we were able to walk to see a show in the evening, walk to a range of restaurants includng TGI Fridays and Planet Hollywood, walk to Macy's, Fith Avenue and most of the good shopping areas without exhausting ourselves or getting blisters. The hotel was even in walking distance to the Empire State Building, Rockerfellers and Central Park. I would definitely advise people staying at the hotel to walk to your locations as much as possible, as you soon get to find your way around and you also see so much more. Besides, the traffic is so hectic, that often enough, it is probably quicker to walk than take a cab. The only times we needed to grab a a taxi was when it absolutely poured down and when we needed to get to the harbour to get a boat to take us on a tour. For those wanting to sightsee, I would recommend both Rockerfellers observation deck, as well as Empire State Building. We went to Rockerfellers in the daytime and Empire at night. It didn't close until 2am so we went at midnight. Brilliant choice - no queues and lit up New York at night was breath-taking. When we got out, we were offered a limosine ride back to the hotel for a mere $20. Needless to say, we accepted and it was great. I would also recommend the Circle Line cruise, which takes you down the Hudson, where you can see Manhattan Island, as well as the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge and many other main attractions. I bought a New York Pass which I used to get into most of the attractions. I haven't worked out yet if I managed to save money, but it probably saved us a little time from queueing. Although, in all honestly, we never experienced any major long queues anywhere. For those who love to shop, there is great variety. There are the top class stores but if you search, you will also find some reasonable priced discount stores. There is something for everyone but I wouldn't say you would be able to find anything cheaper than you can in England. I loved Macys most. The same goes for eating out. I didn't think it was particularly cheap but probably what you would expect to pay in most restaurants in London. Alcoholic drinks, I found were overpriced. I remember paying anything from $16-$22 for a double Baileys. And when I thought about buying a bottle in, I was horrified to find that the hotel could supply a bottle for $110. One of the great things about the hotel, other than the location, excellent room, facilities and service, was that we were allowed to bring in our own food and drink. This was particularly useful as my two teenagers were able to nip out late at night and bring in a MacDonalds from next door when they felt peckish. There were even mornings, when they fancied MacDonalds pancakes for breakfast. The room had both a fridge and a microwave, which meant if you do want to cater for yourself a little to save money, you can. It certainly helped me out with my two teenagers who constantly wanted to snack. All in all, we had a wonderful time. If you are thinking about going, do so. It really is a fantastic place to visit. Oh and if you go to Central Park, I would definitely recommend the little bicycle cab rides which will take you on an hour guided tour. We had a fantastic time, the guide was hilarious and showed us so many landmarks and could tell us about practically every location within the park which had been the scene for numerous films and TV shows. It cost about $80 for the guide but he really did earn it and it was great fun and Central Park in Autumn was truly stunning. The three of us loved New York. Both of my children want to move there. I wouldn't go that far but I am planning on going back in a couple of years, but I'd like to make my next visit at Christmas time.	
Nov 1 2009 	Great hotel	Wow! This was my 7th trip to Times Square in 3 years. I'd never stayed at the Doubletree before, as we're members of another chain's rewards program. But, at the last minute I had the opportunity to travel to NYC and booked what was really the only reasonably priced room in the area.Upon arrival at 10 am, I was delighted to find a room available. When we got to the room, I was blown away by the view, overlooking Times Square, not to mention the size of the room, it was huge for NYC standards. I was a bit concerned since we were located by the elevators, but because of a hallway leading from our door to the bedroom, elevator noise was not a factor.I would definately recommend this hotel to friends, as well as stay there again of the opportunity presented itself.	
Nov 1 2009 	Friendly and helpful staff spacious rooms great location	I have just returned from my second visit to New York City with 3 friends. I could highly recommend this hotel to other travellers. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome by all the staff esp Daniel. Our suite was more than adequate with a fridge, microwave etc etc. The cleaning and house keeping staff were very helpful and nice. Room was spotless when we arrived and it was serviced every day.The only criticism that I have is that when you switch on the tv, the entertainment package comes on automatically which you have to pay for if you use-we weren't aware of that and ended up buying a music package that we didn't want.I will def return to this hotel and would highly recommend it to fellow travellers.PS The welcome cookies were delicious- thanks Daniel :-)	
Oct 31 2009	Best location in the heart of NY	This was my first time in NY. I researched online for over a month before I decided to stay at the Doubletree in Times Square. I don't regret it. Although pricey you just can't beat the location. The double decker red tour bus was right across the street from the hotel. Also, there is a fairly new Walgreens along with a Metro station within easy walking distance. The location is excellent. The room was clean and service was great. I would recommend the suite style room for any family. We stayed in a suite with sofa-bed and two double beds in a separate room. It was a very comfortable room, and as I understand roomy but by NY standards.	
Oct 30 2009 	Recommended family hotel in the best location	Clean, safe and excellent location. I'd recommend Doubletree for families, since the rooms are big, have a fridge and the location is so good. Whenever travelling with family we return here.	
Oct 28 2009 	Truly outstanding - but avoid the concierge!!!	The hotel was excellent in virtually every way - but I'd advise anyone to give the concierge a miss.The rooms are huge by NY standards, and ours was pretty much silent (we were on a low floor facing Times Square which I would guess would be the noisiest part of the hotel).The location is perfect if you want the bustle of the square, but it is pretty vibrant around the hotel, particularly late at night so think about this.The employees of the hotel are truly outstanding. We were asked &quot;is there anything we can do to make your stay more enjoyable?&quot;, on a number of occasions. There wasn't. The breakfast buffet is comprehensive and we skipped lunch most days - the team in the restaurant were really friendly and I have to single out Steve, who was on the egg stand one morning. My wife ordered waffles, and Steve was talking her into having two. I mentioned that it was her birthday - and Steve's face immediately lit up and wished her a happy birthday. He then dashed off through a door to reappear moments later clutching a bag with a couple of tins of Doubletree cookies - and told my wife that the entire team at the hotel wished her a happy birthday. A truly lovely gesture from an outstanding ambassador for the hotel.The bell-hop team were excellent as well (we do tend to leave NY with more luggage than we arrive with)...Now the bad bit - the hotel appears to have &quot;outsourced&quot; its concierge to a third party company called Continental Guest Services whose team was very poor. Firstly, the Mexican restaurant which they &quot;booked&quot; for us didn't have a table when we arrived, and then told us that they didn't in fact accept reservations. We were offered the chance to wait for a table but declined.On the day of our departure, we booked a car to Newark airport - and paid $114. While one of the team arranged this, we couldn't help but overhear a female member of the team, telling a more junior member of the team how to sell theatre tickets to unsuspecting guests. The &quot;tips of the trade&quot; made me think that I would never, ever buy tickets from a hotel concierge again, and immediately made me think we'd been ripped off.One of my buddies told me that this was way over the odds, and arranged an alternative at 1/3 less than this. The booking confirmation arranged by the hotel concierge stated that the booking could be cancelled with more than two hours' notice but team initially claimed that all sales were final and non-refundable. After some prompting from me, and a debate with the woman mentioned above, they agreed to refund my money.So...., all in all an excellent hotel. Great rooms and brilliant staff who all want to &quot;go the extra mile&quot;. But my tip would be to avoid the concierge like the plague, and my tip for the hotel management would be get rid of the outsourced concierge company and employ people more in tune with the rest of their staff.	
Oct 26 2009 	ALL LEVELS OF SERVICE EXCEPTIONAL	From our arrival to our check out we received exceptional service from everyone at Doubletree. Freindly and accomodating staff. Clean and comfortable room with a beautiful view. The cookies were a delicious treat. We had a wonderful 7 day vacation in the heart of New York!	
Oct 26 2009 	Check-in was great concierge desk was not very pleasant	Daniel provided us with wonderful check in service which was a great way to introduce and welcome us to NYC. However, the concierge desk was a very unplesant experience. Wrong directions, addresses, and a general lack of knowledge the city. Their main focus is selling bus tours.	
Oct 26 2009 	WOW - This hotel is awesome!!!	I am a seasoned business traveler with very high expectations. THe only reason I booked the doubletree was because it was the only mid-town hotel I could find that offered true Suites (a total closed off bedroom from the living area). When I booked I noticed it was rated as a 3 1/2 star hotel, so my expectations were not very high. What a great surprise, I was driving into the city and they gave me perfect driving instructions, I pulled up handed over my keys and the car was taking by the valet ($35 per night if you pick up the car from the garage at the end of your trip) and the baggage was handled by the Bell Hop. The lobby is very nice and the Front desk staff amazing (Daniel - who loves Spain BTW) check us in he was professional freindly funny and super accomondating to our needs. I think for business or pleasure this is an awesome spot. I would recomend a higher floor to be removed from the Times Squre buzz.	
Oct 26 2009 	Daniel was AWESOME!	Daniel at the front desk was extremely helpful with &quot;concierge&quot; type advice - he helped us get our priority tickets to visit the Empire State Building , recommended shows, touristy activities, and wonderful restaurants. Employees like Daniel are invaluable to me as an infrequent traveler, and he was especially wonderful. Thank you, Doubletree and Daniel, for making our trip even more wonderful and efficient!	
Oct 25 2009 	Simply outstanding!	My family and I (2 adults &amp; 2 boys 11 and 7) stayed at the Doubletree in October. We arrived by taxi from the airport (which was so efficient and organised) and were thrilled when we pulled up right in the middle of Times Square. Check in was speedy and we were delighted with the warm cookies we received. Our room was on the 14th floor and we had a view to Times Square. The room was clean, comfortable and had all the ammenties that a family of 4 required for a comfortable stay including a small refrigerator and a microwave. It was a shame that wifi was not included, however we didn't really have time to sit at the computer anyway.The location of the hotel is brilliant. Right on the corner of 7th and 47th streets with the TKTS booth outside and a subway station next door. The hop on/off bus tours start right across the street as well. Times Square is an area where you feel completely safe at all hours of the day and night. There is a security check at the elevators to further ensure your safety as well. While there are some great restaurant in Times Square I would recommend not eating there as it can be quite expensive ($90 for breakfast was a shock!). However, Rays pizza on 48th was amazing! The kids liked the hot dog vendours and just like any other city it is always best to eat where the locals eat. New York is an amazing city and when my husband and I (yes no kids next time) return in 2010 we will definitely stay here again.	
Oct 24 2009 	Great hotel-near everything	This hotel is right on Times Square. The Broadway discount center is right across the street. Subway and West Side Story theater are both next door. Breakfast buffet was great! Lights of Times Square can be seen out the window. Room very clean and housekeeping very friendly. Walking distance to Broadway theaters and many good restaurants.	
Oct 23 2009	Doubletree Guest Suites is the best Hotel in Times Square	As a long time Hilton Honors member (Diamond VIP), this hotel is awesome. Since I am a Diamond VIP, I was checked into my room by the doorman on the first floor, which meant I did not have to stand in a line. My suite was on the 29th floor and had commanding views of all the neon that Times Square is world famous for. Even though there is much hustle and bustle with noise on the street, I could not here anything in the suite. It is great to be able to stretch out with this much space. The breakfast buffet is one of the best that I have encountered. I found employees in the hotel to be very customer-service oriented. Location is central to all of New York's great tourist attractions. I would defintely stay at this hotel again.	
Oct 23 2009 	Great midtown location. A bit expensive.	We stayed Oct 16-19 at the Doubletree Times Square. The woman at check-in was very accommodating and gave us a King suite on the 31st floor. Warm cookies for all at check-in. Even though you are in the center of all the NYC action, the lobby is on floor 3, away from the noise and traffic of Times Square.The room was clean, spacious (for NYC) and large windows gave our kids a perfect view overlooking M&amp;M World to the north. Elevators were fast and we never had to wait long for one, no matter what time of day. The location is very convenient to most theaters and Rockefeller Center.Overall I give it high marks, but we will probably look for something less expensive next time. We spent most of our time exploring the city, and would be fine with staying in a hotel with less amenities in order to save some money.	
Oct 22 2009 	Priceless views of Times Square--terrific tourist hotel	I just returned from NYC for a business trip and stayed at the Sheraton Manhattan and the Doubletree Suites. I was in 2901, which is a corner King Suite with commanding views of Times Square (exactly where the ball comes down). All 01 rooms, i.e. 2701, 2801,2901, etc are CORNER suites with a view directly south from the living room of where the ball drops each New Year's Eve. Being a corner you have another view of the north side of Time Square from the other corner of the living room as well as from the bedroom. The views really were amazing and are MUCH nicer than anything I've had (even very high end suites at either the Westin, the Marriott Marquis or the W--all in the same neighborhood). The view is really off the hook and if a view is important to you, I would hightly recommend the Doubletree.The location is very busy as it is directly in Times Square but the suite was fairly spacious. The suite was clean there was a 42 inch LG LCD in the living room but there was an old tube style TV in the bedroom--sort of an odd combination in my view.Checkin is a breeze if you are a Hilton Diamond guest as they literally handed me my key in the lower lobby. This VIP checkin and treatment is only for Hilton Diamond members but if you are this is a real nice benefit. I did not deal with the &quot;regular&quot; front desk so can't comment on anything there.This hotel is not nearly as hip or trendy as the W across the street but it is very solid and a good value--again with astonishing views of Time Square. The area is VERY busy (24 hours per day) but the windows provide a high level of sound insulation and the blinds are nearly black out for sleeping.If you want to stay in Times Square and want a little more room than the other offerings I would highly recommend the Doubletree.	
Oct 21 2009 	Wonderful location spacious suites but annoying lapses in quality	We've stayed at this hotel on average twice per year since before it became a Doubletree Guest Suites; originally, it was an Embassy Suites hotel. The primary attractions are its location and that all rooms are suites with two televisions, a large bathroom, and a modified wet bar that includes a fridge and microwave. (If one of us wants to nap, for example, it's possible to do so without being disturbed.) There is plenty of storage room, work space, and outlets to recharge computer, camera, and iPod batteries, etc. Despite a supposed upgrading of the rooms, the furniture and decor look dated and a bit worn. There are new HD flat panel televisions in the living rooms, but the signal is standard definition, widened to fit the 16:9 ratio screen, which makes everything rather distorted-looking. The in-room wi-fi was frustratingly slow this most recent visit, and the hotel was having intermittent Internet connection problems during our stay, something we never experienced during previous visits. The redecoration of the main lobby is not to our liking -- we think it looks hideous -- and a bar with flat screens has been installed in it, but since that's not where we sleep, we were willing to overlook this lapse of taste. One thing we found annoying is that guests would put their room service trays outside on the floor of the hallway, and they would sit there literally for hours, often overnight, before being retrieved by housekeeping. We'll most likely continue to stay here, but we're open to finding another hotel that offers similar amenities without slipping in quality.	
Oct 20 2009 	Great Hotel Great location	Before i booked this hotel, i read countless reviews on trip advisor. This was the reason i chose this one. I can't fault the hotel in anyway whatsover!Location - amazing! Right in the centre of times square, very close to 5th av, the rockerfeller centre and much more! This is a busy location and you will get plenty of sirens from the cops throughout the night - this is why we were here , for the hustle and bustle! saying that though - you will get plenty of sleep as its well soundproofed. we were on floor 20.check in/check out - very quick - nice cookies, staff always helpful. ( one was a bit grumpy but i can live wiith that)lifts - great - never had to wait and they are very fastwe didn't try the restaurant but the bar is well overpriced but good service.rooms - very very clean, spacious and well laid out. room service is overpriced and don't use the phone. $25 for a 5 minute call home!!!!!!Security staff very friendly and helpful.all in all, i have never had such a trouble free stay in any hotel , anywhere! we chose a king suite with times square view - well worth it.	
Oct 17 2009 	Start spreading the news...	Doubletree on Broadway...finally, after all of the renovations, the lobby and restaurant are open for prime time business. Located in the heart of Broadway, the Doubletree is a great place to stay for business or fun! Hilton standards (especially the Doubletree warm cookies) makes it a place to stay, albeit a bit pricey. The gym is &quot;cozy,&quot; but has free weights (dumbells), machine, and cardio equipment - makes it a good place to burn off the calories from eating all of the cuisine available in NYC. IF fortunate enough to have a room adjacent to Broadway, the heavy curtains ensure that the lights of Broadway do not keep you up at night. Other than the occasional siren, street noise is minimal (if on higher floors). The restaurant is also a bit &quot;cozy&quot; for the size of the property, but the breakfast buffet is great!Be aware that when you arrive at the property, enter the hotel where security will ask if you are checking in (why else would I be walking with my suitcase right?). Enter the lobby and walk to the elevator where you enter the real lobby to check in and recieve your warm chocolate chip cookie! Staff is great and as all realtor say, its all about three things, &quot;location, location, location.&quot;	
Oct 16 2009 	Large room in Theater District	We used Hilton Honors points to stay free in a king suite. We typically stay at Bryant Park but free is free. The time square location of this property is convenient to the Theater District. Just walk out of the door and 1/2 price Tickets booth is in front of you. Now with the pedistrian areas on times square you can walk around and take photos with greater ease. The rooms are typical Doubletree suite rooms nothing special. We were traveling alone and obviously had adequate space. Small families could easily stay in these rooms without to much trouble. The tile on the shower wall was cracked in several locations and one of the light switches was barely hanging on the wall. Internet access was 12.95 for 24hrs. Which is bad but not terrible; although should be free. Checkin was easy and they give you warm cookies. The doorman is another issue. He was standing there in his nice uniform looking professional but that is what he did...stood there. Everyone arriving and leaving the hotel had to deal with their luggage and hailing a cab on their own. If you are going to have a doorman and there were actually two of them, have them interact with the guest and offer great customer service. They are your first contact that individuals have with the property. To bad these guys are just wearing a costume.	
Oct 15 2009 	Our service upon arrival from Daniel was friendly inviting -- a nice start to our stay!	Clean room and comfortable bed!!! Front door service was quick and friendly -- I had a taxi in no time and they held the door and placed my luggage in the taxi for me. Staff was helpful in finding the perfect restaurant and location for our dinner.	
Oct 14 2009 	If we could have only stayed longer!!! October is a great time to stay at DGS in Times Square.	My mom and I celebrated our birthdays in Times Square and had a wonderful experience. We enjoyed two plays, good food, all the surrounding 'not to miss' sites, shopping, etc...all within walking distance to the DSG hotel. There is so much transportation to pick from, you are best to not rent a car as it costs quite a lot of money to park in garages. The subways were definitely an adventure and thank goodness for all the nice people who are so kind to help you figure out which one to take and what direction. The taxis are constantly pouncing on their horns, just like in the movies! I would not really recommend Times Square for small children....there is quite a bit of hustle-bustle there. One of our highlights was Michael who greeted us when we arrived the first night all tuckered out and then each following night when we came back from our daily excursions. He always gave us a wave and a big smile and asked how our day went. Michael answered all our questions and gave us tips when we told him our plans for the next outing. He laughed when we told him we took the rickshaw to the Empire State Building and back instead of riding the taxi (Mom is 80!) Michael even yelled out Happy Birthday to us! He went above and beyond every day. DGS is very fortunate to have such a gentleman serving the public. Add to this, our room was clean and fresh every day. The maids were very friendly and pleasant with us in the hallways. The gentleman at the street level was also kind. He would ask for room ID key cards to ensure only guests were entering the hotel which made us feel safe. I don't want to forget about the concierge desk which was ready with answers, maps, offers to make ticket or restaurant arrangement, etc. All in all, there is not one bad thing to say. We had a very enjoyable time in Times Square. Thank you again Michael for your smile and your charming ways.	
Oct 14 2009 	Very nice accomodations and location still steep price though...	We were in the City just for one night to see two Broadway plays. We chose this hotel because it's smack-dab in the middle of Times Square and easy to walk right to both theatres. This was our first time staying at Doubletree (Hilton) Suites, and we were pleasantly surprised. A very nice/sophisticated hotel lobby, pleasant people at the desk and a nice big (for NYC) room, even though it looks kinda &quot;Times Square&quot; grimey from outside. Don't let the appearance deter you. The rooms appeared to be newly updated, they we very clean, and comfortable - and free WiFi. Will likely stay here again!	
Oct 13 2009 	Great Experience!	You know what they say about LOCATION....This is a fantastic starting point to see all the sights of NYC. The staff here excels at service and are very knowledgeable. Everyone was friendly from the doormen to housekeeping and the tasty warm cookies at registration were an added bonus! The suite is spacious, clean and my parents loved the luxurious king mattress. I even found the pull out sofa to be comfortable. Subway stations are nearby and again, the staff was tops. I will stay here again in the future.	
Oct 12 2009 	Can't imagine staying anywhere else....	I just returned from my 3rd NYC trip. Each time we stayed at DoubleTree Guest Suites. The first time was by chance - the next 2 times by choice. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable, and, of course, the location is great. However, the best part about the DoubleTree is the excellent treatment we receive each time by the entire staff. EVERYONE from lobby security, to desk staff, to concierge, to housekeeping, to restaurant staff.....combined to make our visit in NYC pleasant.  Specifically, Daniel at the desk was so helpful when helping us arrange for boarding passes. The breakfast hostess on Oct. 9th, 10th, 11th (I don't recall her name) was very kind in clearing up a discrepancy in our breakfast package. The waitstaff was attentive and accomodating. The concierge staff was so patient and helpful with each and every request. Every employee that we passed in the hallway or elevator greeted us with friendliness and respect. Requests we made for extra blankets and missing wash cloths were filled in a timely manner. I typically find that the spirit of good service is alive and well in NYC. However, the DoubleTree sets the standard. The person(s) responsible for service training here deserve a raise! This may sound corny, but the level of customer service received here is inspiring. Although there are other, less expensive places to stay in Times Square, it is a great value.	
Oct 12 2009 	The Perfect Hotel for New York City!	This amazing hotel is right smack in the middle of Times Square! With great decor, amazing rooms, and spectacular views... this is the only hotel I will stay in when I visit NYC! I love the staff! Great staff who are willing to assist guests who are new to NYC! AMAZING FITNESS CENTER!	
Oct 9 2009 	Girls weekend best place to stay	As a first time visitor this is a perfect hotel easy walk (across the street) from the grayline bus tour, the Lion King (2 blocks), and Carmines (&lt; block from Lion King). Everything was right there. We even had a craving for Chinese at 1100pm and the fromt desk directed us to a nice litte Chinese Restaurant Pearls a block away. With room having fridge and microwave we got water at market a few blocks away and carried our own water. One thing I found out later to see Ground Zero in 2009 Sept you need to go up into the 3rd floor of McDonalds to see the actual site due to the curtains around the sites. Hotel was great location to be near all the Broadway shows and have room for 4 to stay in 1 room and have a great view! Just get the king premium view to get a good view. You can request high floors but to actually get one you need to get the premium view when you book accoording to several others in the elevators. There were no other hotels as close to time square/on time square. We could see the ball from our room. But could not hear any noise while in our rooms. It was perfect not a thing I would have asked to be changed.	
Oct 8 2009 	Ahhhh-tum in NYC	This must be the most perfect time to visit NYC; not too hot, not too cool, bright clear sunny skies and the location of the Doubletree was perfect for our brief 2 day visit. We were able to &quot;bar hop&quot; through Central Park, enjoyed a wonderful &quot;Conversation&quot; at MoMA, and did a really touristy thing by taking the Duck Tour (which conveniently picks up practically outside the front door of the hotel). If Broadway shows are on your &quot;gotta do's&quot;, then you are within walking distance of a dozen of the best NY has to offer. Restaurants! Wine Bars! Shopping! All I can say is Go! Enjoy!	
Oct 8 2009 	Fantastic stay! Love the Doubletree Times Square	I've stayed in this hotel twice in the past year and I have absolutely loved it each time. First of all, the location is fantastic - right in the middle of Times Square! The rooms are large and spacious, especially for NYC standards. Everything was clean and lovely. The views from the room are also amazing. I will continue to stay at the Doubletree Times Square when I visit NYC. I highly recommend this hotel!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great hotel Great location	I have been to NYC alot.......and have stayed at various hotels - this was by far the BEST. People were great. Location was right in the middle of Times Square and we had a room that overlooked Times Square.......I couldn't of asked for a better expereience.	
Oct 8 2009 	In the heart of the action!	You are in the heart of the Broadway district at this hotel. Right across the street from the discount theater tickets booth. We didn't need to take a cab anywhere; we felt we were close enough to walk to all our destinations. The food is pretty expensive nearby, but we did find a diner that locals got to about 6 blocks away. We had a room up high; the view was great. Be aware, the bright lights are lit all night long and shine in to the room...the price you pay for a great view. The room was clean and comfortable. We didn't eat the hotel but greatly enjoyed the warm chocolate chip cookies available anytime of the day. We would definately return to this hotel on future visits.	
Oct 8 2009 	Smack dab in the middle of the action yet above it all.	My boyfriend and I went on a birthday trip to NYC this past August. He'd never been to New York, and I had wanted to show him the frenzy and lights and endlessly peopled spectacle of TImes Square. The Doubletree Guest Suites is on the corner of 47th St. &amp; where Broadway and 6th Ave split, about a half a block away form where the ball drops on New Year's, so it was a perfect fit for the location, plus I got a HELL of a deal on Priceline for the hotel and round trip air, so that made the decision super easy. The first thing I want to point out is that the hotel entrance to the street level &quot;1st lobby&quot; is right next to a subway station, so anytime we were coming from uptown we'd just hop out and be right at the entrance to the hotel, which was so nice after long days of exploring the Met, walking around Central Park, etc. The second thing I want to make very clear is that we were treated so well by all of the staff that it really should've been the first thing I said. The Concierge was fantastic, the staff at the check in/out counter were all friendly and helpful, and the room was kept beautifully. It was a beautiful place to come back to at night or take a break from the CRUSHING heat and humidity of NYC in late August (I will never do that again, but it was fun...just sweaty, somewhat irritable fun at times). The AC was pumping, the bed was soft and warm, and there was a tv in the bedroom as well as the livingroom area. Fridge and microwave, the safe worked, plenty of closet &amp; drawer space, and the bathroom was really nice with ample room for two people getting ready together. I never felt crowded. Well, except for when we left the hotel, hahaha...the view from our windows was gorgeous and we could see all the way to Central Park through this small swath of clear space between sky scrapers. I want to say we were on the 32nd floor, and only heard the street if we opened the windows. Which, by the way, is a really nice feature that many hotels seem to neglect these days: windows that open.Also, the warm cookie at check in was a nice touch :) Oh, and the free internet in the &quot;2nd lobby&quot; (you have to get int hrough the street level and then take an elevator to the check-in lobby on the 3rd floor) was also helpful...I was kinda bummed that the daily rate for using internet in your room was like $12, but MEH, we'd just go to the lobby.	
Oct 8 2009 	Broadway Lights and Good Times	Myself, Mother, Sister and 10 year old Daughter stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. Never visiting the BIG city I only prepared for this trip by view of the trip boards and friends reviews. I booked with Double Tree based on the location as I wanted to take in the New York lights and hustle and bustle ( this is the hotel for that) as well as the suite accomodations and rate. All of these preferences were provided. We arrived at the hotel at 11:00 which was around check out time, though was greeted by the doorman and directed to check in our luggage and asked to check back within the next two hours which we did and was taken to our room and given a brief review of room accomodation and close by eateries and conveniences. Hotel staff was always accomodating. The room was very clean and toiletries were replenished every day! The room was very quiet, even though it looked out on Broadway. I cannot wait to go back!!! The only downside was that the front lounge area was small which did not leave any enviroment for lounging which we looked for on two nights as we did have some rainy evenings, as well as it did not have a pool.	
Oct 7 2009 	Doubletree is Great Hotel!	This is my third stay at the Doubletree and I highly recommend it if you are looking for proximity to Times Square, the theatre district, subways, and a large, quiet space to get away from it all. We stayed at Doubletree Times Square from 9/26 - 10/4. Room was #3506, was fresh, appeared to be recently updated and had two extremely comfortable doubles and a pull out couch. Checked in early. Room was quiet and housekeeping service excellent. Refrigerator and microwave excellent addition. Bathroom was spacious and had double sinks. Concierge and security were friendly and helpful. Lack of free internet and absence of flat screen in bedroom was noticed but not missed as we spent so little time in the room. Also, as Hilton Honors member, we were given free buffet breakfast, which I cannot imagine paying $24.95 per person for, especially since the wait staff could best be described as surly and inattentive. Otherwise, the buffet included chef prepared omelets, french toast, and waffles as well as excellent variety of other breakfast items and was absolutely a great way to start the morning.	
Oct 6 2009 	Wonderful location and hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of September. The rooms are lovely and big and its great having a seperate lounge area. We were on the 21st floor and it was incredibly quiet even though it was right on Times Square. We managed to check in early which was handy. The staff were very helpful and the welcome cookie was delicious. Have stayed in quite a few hotels in NY but this was certainly in the best location and had the biggest space. Would not hesitate to stay there again.	
Oct 5 2009 	Loved location of hotel	I travelled with two sisters &amp; two nieces for a long weekend for my first visit to the Big Apple. After being out in the hustle &amp; bustle of Times Square the hotel is an oasis of calm &amp; quiet. The staff are all very friendly &amp; accomodating. Loved the cookies at check-in &amp; the delicious martinis in lobby bar. Our room was on 41st floor offering a great view of the M&amp;M billboard etc. The rooms are definitely a good size for females getting ready for theatre, shopping etc. We had no problem getting taxis whenever we required them. I would stay at hotel on a return visit.	
Oct 3 2009 	Huge rooms in the heart of the City	Spent one night here for a quick girl's getaway. Couldn't beat the location -- directly across the street from the TKTS booth, which we definitely utilized. Right in the middle of Times Square so really convenient to Theaters &amp; restaurants. We stayed on 29th floor &amp; had a partial view of Times Square. The rooms were HUGE by NYC standards so well worth the price for both space &amp; location. Very clean &amp; modern accommodations. I would definitely stay here again.	
Oct 1 2009 	Amazing Hotel Experience	I traveled w/six friends to celebrate our 40th birthdays and when researching where to stay, I relied heavily on the reviews here to make my decision. I was not disappointed! We had two suites for the 7 of us and had some minor problems w/ one of the rooms (ie the refrigerator did not work) but the problems were fixed in a timely manner. At check in we asked for adjoining rooms w/double beds (we had king size beds next door to each other) and were able to change rooms 2 days into our trip. Every request we had was promply addressed. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful! (Diana is a wonderful asset - she deserves a raise for helping me as much as she did!!!) We did not use the consierge or eat at the restaurant so I can't comment about them, but the location of this hotel is AWESOME! Theaters and so many other attractions are so closeby that we were able to drop off packages on our way to the next attraction. TImes Square is a hoot with lots of shops. A subway stop is just steps from the front door and the bus stops close to the door or right across the street depending on direction. Broadway is closed across from the hotel which decreases car traffic however the area outside the front door can become congested w/foot traffic...I loved it but it's not for everyone. The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable (king size more so than the double). I'm trying hard to find something negative to say and the only thing I can say is I wish the internet would have been free in the suites (there are two places in the hotel to get free access though) and free coffee in the lobby also would have been nice...but that's it folks...everything else is A+. Oh and did I mention how wonderful Diana is at the front desk?? Will definitely stay here again!	
Sep 29 2009 	Couldn't ask for more	My friend and I spent 4 nights at this hotel for a fashion week girls trip and were completely satisfied. Pros:Super Comfy BedsGreat Service (concierge, front desk, maid service)Fantastic Location (right near the subway station and in Times Square)Very Clean and New Looking RoomsQuiet (we were on the 37th floor)Beautiful LobbyExcellent Security (they checked for our room key each night)Cons:Location is congested, but very centralized	
Sep 28 2009 	Would love to go back!	Excellent hotel, large room with nice new furnishings, wonderful location for seeing the sights, other guests all very friendly, great martinis in lobby bar! Concierge was very helpful as was reception staff.	
Sep 26 2009 	Expensive smart Central Clean super-efficient	We stayed in this very clean, super efficient hotel. We had a premium king on the 42nd floor and there was a sofabed in the luvingroom which was very comfortAble. Security aS good, location was great. Drawbacks: Super Douper expensive even booking 10 months in advance.	
Sep 24 2009 	best service at double tree metropolitan on lexington avenue	Hi, I just want to say that the the double tree hotel on lexington ave and 51st was great. They treated us great. the service was just on point. Their staff, bell boys, receptionists were very kind and helpful. even the cleaning ladies were friendly and accomodating. When i asked for extra towels they supplied them right away. I def want to recommend this hotel for any future travelers. Their service made our trip more enjoyable.	
Sep 21 2009 	Good staff great location	Stayed here while attending the USOpen. Clean and comfortable accommodations with friendly staff. Can't beat the location in the center of Times Square, close to everything.Looked online for tickets to Wicked for Friday night, best seats were so-so at $130 a piece. We saw the hotel Concierge and she used a broker and got us great seats for the same show for just $50 more.	
Sep 21 2009 	Terrific Large Room!	I stayed at this hotel with my wife, mother-in-law, and two children - ages 1 &amp; 3. The rooms have been renovated within the last year, and ours was fantastic!...very large for a New York hotel. All of the furnishings and surfaces seemed practically new. The beds were great, and the fold-out sofa bed was even okay. It's the perfect size for a family of 4 or more. The bedroom is a separate room that can be closed off from the rest of the room, and the best part is the bathroom - which had a large double sink, and 2 doors - one connected to the bedroom, and one connected to the living room. Plus there is a 3rd sink in the wetbar! It's a great setup! The staff and service was great. The business center still needs updating. The location is great for tourist activities - there's a subway access point almost directly outside the front door. The TKTS booth is directly across the street. My only complaint about the location is that it's on a very crowded corner in Times Square. So coming and going often involves navigating through a dense crowd of people. If you need a large room in New York, this is a great choice!	
Sep 16 2009 	Wonderful hotel perfect location!	Stayed here for five nights. As first time New York visitors, we were thrilled with the location. We were able to walk most anywhere, or to take the subway which was right at the corner! The suites were perfect for a five night stay, nice to have some extra room! The hotel was very clean, felt very safe,and the staff was extremely helpful with everything. Our room was on 39th floor with a city view. Amazing!	
Sep 16 2009 	Location and space can't be beat	I concur with the other reviews - good room size, comfortable bed and pillow, and dark curtains that blacked out the neon signs. The pull out couch had very dirty cushions, but the bed portion was fine. The bathroom was fine, not super clean, but sufficient. Good AC. The brunch was nice but expensive.	
Sep 14 2009 	Great hotel in NYC	Just came back from this years US Open, this is our third year staying at the Times Square Doubletree hotel.THe location can't be beat for convenience, all of the staff were very friendly and helpfull, the rooms are spacious and very clean, prices are surprisingly reasonable for NYC and such a great location.Overall would highly recommend this hotel and we will stay again next year	
Sep 11 2009 	Again a great stay	This was our second stay at the Doubletree. I was in NYC on business and my two teenage daughters went along (the hotel is a great base for the kids to explore the city from, however I wouldn't recommend turning teenage girls loose in Times Square but mine are well acquainted with the city). The room, the staff, the check in, all were perfect. We always feel safe there, the staff in the first floor lobby is discreet however they are very observant of people coming and going. The location, of course, is perfect. A subway station is literally 20 steps from the front door.I left positive comments on the survey card upon check out, and the manager called me the following week to thank me. I have never had that happen at any hotel previously! I recommend this hotel highly and will certainly return again.	
Sep 10 2009 	Excellent hotel the staff is incredible	This was the second time I stayed at this hotel while in New York and it was great again. The rooms are all nice sized and recently decorated. The hotel is exceptionally clean. It is right in the middle of mid-town so you are close to everything. If you are going to be going to broadway shows you can walk from the hotel. Everyone there is so nice. My friend got really sick and needed to go to the hospital. I called the front desk, they got a cab for us, came up to the room to escort us down, told the cab where to go. They were great. They called the room several times to check on her. I really appreciated their concern and help.	
Sep 9 2009 	Great room awkward entrance at night	We stayed for 2 nights and had a great time here. Having two rooms helps when traveling with infants - we put the baby and pack and play in the bedroom at night, and hung out in the family room. The room was clean, check in was easy, and all was good. We stayed in Times Square because a conference was nearby. There lot a lot of people on the sidewalks outside, with the hotel across from the Tixs Center. One strange thing was that the lobby was on the 3rd floor, that you take elevators to get to. I came in later at night, and the secuity people almost did not let me in because my name was not on the reservation. Also, could have used more towels, though the help was awesome in taking a big bag of birthday party trash.	
Sep 9 2009 	A Place to recommend for any New York visit	Stayed in the Doubletree at Times Square for 6 nights with as a family with 2 teenage sons in August 2009. We arrived early but were given a room straight away. We had a suite with a king size bed and a sofa bed for the boys. This provided us with excellent accommadation for any family staying in NYC. The location is in a prime postion in Time Square. I have read previous reviews and have to agree that the sound proofing of the hotel is excellent considering the prime location in the heart of NYC. We recommend the buffet breakfast. Plenty to choose from and the waiters were very friendly. In fact the last day we were given 2 tins of Doubletree Cookies by Steve a cook we spoke to a few times over breakfast. It was a really nice and that summed up the hotel staff. Every member of staff so helpful and kind. Tip for you - There is free wireless internet at the hotel reception and bar area.I recommend this hotel for a family stay in New York. I did look at other hotel but was very happy we choose the Doubletree Guest Suite in Time Square.	
Sep 9 2009	Sweet Summer Deal not sweet for us	We decided on the Sweet Summer Deal for our trip to NYC with our granddaughters. The information on the web site did not state if the children(age 12) would need to order from the children's menu, so I called the hotel to ask. I was told that they could order anything from the regular menu. On our first night the waiter told us that the S S Deal required that the children order from the children's menu. I explained that I was told that the children could order from the regular menu. The waiter said he was sorry, but that was the rule for that special. I went downstairs and spoke with the manager. He also told me that the deal required the children to order from the children's menu. I pointed out that the rules did not make that clear, so I had called the hotel before making reservations. The manager then agreed contact the restaurant and tell them that the children could order from the regular menu. I'm not sure if the food we received was a result of going to the management, but our rolls were too hard to cut with a knife and the smoked salmon salads consisted of a small thin piece of smoked salmon with two little greens on top. We went to another restaurant later that evening for dinner. We decided that we would not eat lunch or dinner there for the remainder of our stay. The bottom line is we paid more than the basic cost of the room for the SS deal, thinking that the girl's lunches and dinner would be included. Because of our experience the first night, we had our meals elsewhere. We did not get what we paid for. I wrote a review to Doubletree, but they have not bothered to reply. The hotel was fine, and the breakfast buffet was fine, the lunch and dinner deal was a waste of money.	
Sep 9 2009 	I loved this place	I will not stay anywhere else when I go back but here. Loved the beds, pillow and the LOCATION. It was perfect and the door man is so nice.	
Sep 7 2009 	Awesome experience! You'll LOVE it!	Just got back from a weekend stay at the Doubletree. We are a family of five and had plenty of space. We were able to check into our room at 1:30 pm. All of the staff from front desk to bell service to restaurant servers and bartenders and to security were top notch. Fantastic location - right in the heart of the action....but quiet and very comfortable when you are inside your room. We enjoyed a suite on the 42nd floor. Fantastic view! We would definitely stay here again!!!	
Sep 6 2009 	Great All the way around	My twenty-something daughters and I just spend a week in New York in late August and had a fantastic time. Staying at the Doubletree was perfect. The location was great - there were crowds of people, but the minute we walked through the doors tranquility and cold air hit us like a pleasant breeze. Our room was great - it was clean and quiet and cool. Service was great - the night time cookies were the best ever.	
Sep 6 2009 	Fantastic location suiteprice 	We stayed at the doubletree for 7 nights at the end of August.It was our first trip to NYC with our 9 month old. Cant say enough good things about the doubletree-from the moment we arrived the concierge were very helpful to the cookies at check in which my sugar loving husband appreciated! We had a lovely suite on the 20th floor-plenty of space-seperate living room-with a mini kitchenette-fridge and microwave. A tip when travelling with babies-we brought a kettle with us so we could have cool boiled water for the baby's bottles. We had a very nice seperate bedroom so its an ideal set up when travelling with children. The location is perfect-in the middle of it all but yet nice and quiet in the hotel. We were able to get free wireless on our floor-not sure about the higher levels..All the staff were very helpful to us and room was kept very clean..We booked this trip 5 months beforehand and got a better deal per night so maybe good to book ahead of time..to sum up we would highly recommend the doubletree whether with children or just if you want an extra bit of space for all those shopping bags!!	
Sep 5 2009 	Too Expensive	The location of this hotel is perfect. The staff is excellent (everyone, including Daniel). The rooms are nice. But the cost is way too high given room rate and extra charges for internet.	
Sep 5 2009 	location is spot on	stayed 4 nights on our second visit to the big apple.awful check in-rooms not ready etc, eventually got our key 2.5 hours after arrival and after complaining!rooms are spacious, but it is a suite hotel so you would expect this.decor a little tired, everything else average.nothing special but then you dont go to NYC to sit in your room the whole time!would recommend pureply for the location but the service leaves a lot to be desired im afraid.	
Sep 3 2009 	Best location in Midtown	We have stayed here several times and this was a special occassion...my wife's 50th Birthday. Jennie and Diana (front desk) were great and really came through to give us a special room and treat for the occassion. It has great views of midtown, in the heart of Times Square, yet quiet when you need a little &quot;downtime&quot;. Staff is great, made us feel like &quot;family&quot;....so good my wife still thinks she's &quot;49&quot;!!!	
Sep 1 2009 	Dealing with the front desk staff was a pleasure; Daniel Damaris Jenny and Stanley are great assets to this hotel!	Friends and I stay at this hotel every year and we are all Hilton Honors Members. We could not accomplish anything dealing directly with HHonors prior to our trip. Once we got to NYC and explained our dilemma to Daniel at the front desk, he immediatly without any hesitation told us what to do to be able to use our points for this stay. He saved us $350 dollars and was happy to do it! This pattern of excellent service was evident all weekend! Jenny gave us her &quot;10&quot; pins just for fun.... Stanley in security laughed with us everytime we asked him to take our photos... and we cannot forget Damaris! It all started with Daniel - Hilton should know these employees definitely have the companies best interest at heart! We hope they are there when we return next year!	
Sep 1 2009 	Great Location Super Comfy Beds Great Staff = Great Stay	Just returned on Saturday stayed for 6 nights, we have been here before it was over 10 years ago and decided to book here again as we needed a suite for my family. We had 2 rooms, 1 Twin bedded suite and 1 King suite on the 38th floor.Ill keep this as brief as possible: We had a fantastic stay and everything went very smoothly I would definitely stay here again if I return to NYC in the future.Liked Checked in at 1.30pm. 1 of our rooms was ready immediately which was a bonus Warm Cookies on check-in (Of course) also available when needed ? Fabulous views  Our room of Broadway - My families of Duffy Square (Upper Times Square) Beds were extremely comfy I slept soundly every night which is great for me as Im a light sleeper with a seriously bad back No noise Mini Fridge  Essential for a nice cold drink after you return from a hard day of sightseeing Never saw our maid, rooms were sorted by 4pm every day 2 Mirrors one in bathroom and one sink/Mirror unit outside the bathroom allowed me to get ready whilst my OH showered  Great idea ! Breakfast Buffet fabulous but very expensive  Best location - In the heart of Times Square, open the door to busy crowds but as soon as you shut the door ahh peace and quiet Subway (Local) stop right outside, Tours and TKTS also within a matter of feet Staff were great especially the bar staff  sorry guys/gals I cant remember your names Spacious Suite (By NYC standards)Disliked - a few niggles really We checked in early Second room wasnt ready (fair enough) when told would it would be ready within an hour it was over 2 hours  Just be straight and say over 2 hours I could have done some serious shopping in those 2 hours !! I thought our room was fine, my family thought their room was a little dated Wardrobe (Closet) Very small and dated, not enough hanging space or hangers for 2 people for 6 nights  although there were plenty of drawers Air con a bit noisy &amp; dated but cooled down the room quicklyInitially I was going to stay at the Affinia Dumont because of the better price and Tripadvisor rating however Im glad I stuck with the Doubletree its just in the thick of it and thats where we wanted to be - Plenty of bars/eating places nearby. We didnt wait more than 20 mins for a table and regardless what the locals say we didnt have one bad meal whenever we ate nearby whether it be breakfast, lunch, snacks or dinner. (Also whenever we dined further a field I must add)Just to add - the check-out letter you get under the door states there are no late check-out requests however we were advised to call the front desk at 8am on our final day and we were given an extra hour on both our rooms which was greatly appreciated  Thanks all	
Aug 30 2009 	Beautiful people	We did this trip more for the kids. Beautiful people Jenny at the front desk what a smile when she welcomed us. Danny and Michael the night Divas, I asked for cookies and with no problem we got them along with stories. I can't believe Jimmy the doorman is still there, he remember us from a few years ago. Thank god also for Antonio when we checked out he reminded us by saying I hope nothing was left behind in your safe or closet. That's went I remembered leaving some valuables in the safe. Doubletree home away from home. Thank you guys.	
Aug 27 2009 	Great location superb price/quality ratio	We have spent 6 days in NY in this hotel. Great location and excellent service. The personnel is very friendly and helpful. Daniel in the reception had great idea about the hamburgers :-) Next time in NY again in Doubletree.	
Aug 23 2009 	Excellent Hotel in Fantastic Location with Exemplary Service	My wife, teenage daughter and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square August 20 -24. We were greeted quickly by a valet who ensured our car was parked quickly and then were greeted at the reception desk by Michael whose professionalism and wonderful attitude are very worthy of commendation and recognition. Since we were unfamiliar with this property and the room layout and locations, we let him select our room. We could not have been more pleased. The corner suite on the 18th floor was fantastic. The room and bathroom were very clean and housekeeping did a wonderful job making-up the room quickly when we went out rather early each morning. I could not speak more for the overall hotel staff; everyone we met was very helpful. In fact, returning late from the theatre on Saturday eve, we were very thirsty and asked a woman at the front desk if there was anyplace we could purchase water. She offered to have it sent up to our room. I'm so sorry I didn't get her name, but I know the manager reads these posts and I hope she is recognized. (By the way, the fact that the manager reads these posts shows itself a commitment to exemplary customer service.) The security at the hotel was fantastic. You had to show a room key before you could gain access. We always felt very safe and secure. The location was incredible - central to everything! I highly recommend this property and would not hesitate to stay again.	
Aug 18 2009 	Great location	The Doubletree in Times Square is in the perfect location. It is right across the street from the new pedestrian only area of Times Square and the TIX location where you can get discounted Broadway tickets. The room we had had a partial times Square view and was in very good condition. All the rooms are two rooms our room had two double beds and a very large pull out couch in the other room, a good size bathroom a small kitchen area with a sink, microwave, fridge and coffee maker. The rooms were very quiet and comfortable which is nice after walking the city all day. The staff were very helpful especially the bellman and the valet for parking the car. Getting to the hotel was a chore due to the traffic in the city but once you get there the staff takes care of the rest. Parking was $35.00 a day in the garage across the street. The parking garage was very well run. Everything seemd to cost twice as much as in Florida. Prices did get cheaper the farther away from Times Square that you got and the choices are endless.	
Aug 18 2009 	Great place staff and location!	We stayed here August 13 &amp; 14, 2009. From the moment we were greeted at the door by the security guard, to the receptionist on the 3rd floor everyone was very professional. Our only knock, we arrived at 11:00 a.m. and was told our room would be ready by 1:00 p.m. . We came back then, we have a 6 year old and he wanted to rest and the room was not ready, they kept pushing back 30 minutes. We went to restaurant, host sat us down brought us great, warm cookies and water, shortly after Diana from reception came and got us. Our room was ready by 2:00 and it was a great room, corner, looking south on Broadway. Room was very clean and comfortable. Though it was a non-smoking floor (only the 13th is for smoking) the room had the smell of smoke. We called and they said they would switch us our spray the room. We stayed and it turned out o.k. Highly recommend this place. Right in the middle of Time Square and everyone was very nice.	
Aug 18 2009	This hotel has it all!	We have just returned from our fourth visit to New York City in 2 1/2 years, and our third consecutive stay at the Doubletree Times Square. I cannot say enough about how much we have enjoyed our stays there. Everything about the hotel suited our needs perfectly. Accomodations: We had a two room suite with two double beds .The room was large enough to comfortably accomodate our family of four adults. The room appeared to be newly renovated, was very clean, and was well maintained by the housekeeping staff.Location: This hotel is ideally located for shopping, dining,and especially for the theater and subway access. The theaters are all within a few blocks of the hotel and the subway entrance is just out the door and around the corner.Hotel Staff : The staff is as friendly and accomodating as you will find anywhere, from the general manager on down. Doris, Yaniv, and Daniel, at the front desk are terrific, as are all the others.I highly recommend this hotel, and will be staying there on our future trips to NYC.	
Aug 17 2009 	Huge room great location and free cookies	Spent 3 nights at the Doubletree Suites in Times Square with husband and 2 kids (2 &amp; 5.) Booked 2 nights with points and paid for 1 night at a AAA rate. Got a 2-room king bed suite on a premium floor (actually the top 43rd floor). Kids slept on the sofa bed which was actually quite comfy for them, and we had the bed in a separate room. Shared bathroom with access from both rooms. Tremendous amount of space for NYC &amp; heart of times square location. Really enjoyed our stay and everyone slept great. And couldn't beat what we paid.Check-in on Thursday was a chaos but the hotel handled it well. Arrived at the hotel around 4pm to find the lobby full and a long line to check in. Apparently the hotel had a large group taking up the top/premium floors that weren't expected to check out until 6pm, so they didn't have many room available for checkin. As an incentive to get us to come back later to check in and get our room, they offered us a free upgrade to a premium floor (24th floor and up I believe) (versus the $5/night upgrade I'd pre-requested) plus breakfast for the 4 of us for each night of our stay. Breakfast buffet was $80/day for 2 adults/2 children so that was the real clincher for us. We took the offer and checked our bags until after dinner when we were able to check in for real (did have to wait in line again) and get our rooms (and free cookies). The hotel did offer water, fruit, juices and cookies to everyone waiting in the lobby for rooms so that was nice of them.We had 2 reservations given the nature of our stay (points + paid) and they were able to link them together at checkin so we didn't have to switch rooms. It did create a hiccup with the free breakfast on the 2nd day, but we were able to get them to adjust their records easily. I had a $50 coupon towards food and beverages that I got from their website which is good during a reward stay, but we ended up not using it since the breakfasts were covered, and it didn't apply to tips. But it would have been handy if we hadn't gotten the free breakfasts.Check out on Sunday morning wasn't bad but the hotel had given everyone checking out a note that checkout was supposed to be hectic and no late checkout requests would be honored. There was a running race going on when we left that meant we had to walk to 6th avenue to get a taxi, but it wasn't too bad otherwise. We never had problems getting a taxi during our stay, though if heading uptown it may be better to walk to 6th to get a taxi since the drivers have to go so far out of the way to turn back north around times square.	
Aug 16 2009 	Superb New York hotel and great base for everything	Syated here in mid August with my wife and 3 teenagers. The hotel is on Times Sq (many claim to be, this one is right in the middle). The entrance from the street looks a bit odd and has a security guard. However, the reception is on the 3rd floor and from that point onwards the hotel looks like part of the Hilton group it belongs to. We were on the 25th floor, which is the lowest guest floor. Our rooms were excellent, each with a bedroom with 2 double beds and a separate lounge with a double sofa bed. We had 2 of these which were interlinked, making it a huge footprint. The rooms were very quiet, well equipped and large.We were give a free breakfast each day, which was buffet style and comprehensive. The staff were superb. The concierge booked trips for us at very reasonable prices and the front desk even offered to print out our boarding cards at the end of our stay.Given the location, right on Times Square, the hotel was very reasonable and provided a great base to see all of the Ney York attrwactions from.	
Aug 10 2009 	Excellent Hotel/location	I choose this place after reading reviews, this is the first review a have ever written. The Doubletree TS was perfect, quiet, clean, suite type rooms. Peaceful in the room then walk out the door into the most exciting city in the world!! Never a dull moment. Staff friendly, concierge very helpful. If you can't have fun or enjoy yourself here, then stay home.	
Aug 10 2009 	5 Stars for Convenience	This hotel was a great choice and is perfectly situated for touring the city &amp; seeing Broadway shows. The rooms are large and comfortable when compared to a typical Times Square hotel but, the Doubletree itself felt more secure than some of the obscenely large hotels in the area. This was most evident when the surly night-shift doorman checked guests for their room keys before allowing them access to the street-level elevators. Throughout our stay I was surprised that I never had to wait much more than 15 seconds for an elevator after calling for one. The 3rd level lobby elevators take you to your floor where you will find a mere 13 guest rooms each, a luxury in itself.Our 33rd floor room was very quiet and was what the hotel referred to as an allergy &quot;Pure&quot; room. These rooms have a large, portable HEPA air cleaner and the white-noise it generated while powered-on only added to a good nights sleep. The Hilton &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; bedding in these rooms also have special mattress and pillow encasements to help reduce dustmite and feather down allergens. All of the allergy-pure rooms are located on the 33rd floor so they're sure to have great views. One disappointment with our room was that it's 2 flatscreen HDTV's did not receive a HD signal... but, who goes to Times Square to watch TV?Our room was also one of the &quot;Times Square View&quot; rooms that ended with the room number &quot;03.&quot; This room really overlooked Father Duffy Square, which is part of what most people refer to as Times Square.(see photos) The best thing about the Duffy Square view room is that it has a 180° view of the city and is entirely surrounded with a curved wall of windows. The room is slightly smaller as a result of this layout but provides one of the most panoramic and romantic views available in Times Square. This room is perfect for couples or a small family and was very reasonably priced when I booked it JUST LESS than one month in advance through the Doubletree website. I guess they were trying to sell-off unused rooms because just a few days after getting my very low rate, the hotel was sold out. Don't forget that Doubletree offers a 10% discount if you have AAA.Note: The &quot;real&quot; Times Square view rooms end with the room number &quot;01&quot; but, have less windows. For New Year's Eve and the ball drop, this room cannot be beat.We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant but I did stop by after hours to check it out. It was nicely decorated and appeared to have a fairly big spread for breakfast. For lunch or dinner I suggest heading west to the 300 block of 46th Street, just west of 8th Avenue. There are a couple dozen nice, &quot;real&quot; New York City restaurants to choose from. The hotel's business center was easy to use and had no waiting line. For a $12 fee I used the center to print boarding passes, prepay checked baggage, and upgrade our seats in advance of the flight home... all of which would have cost at least $100 more at the airport.The car service we used to and from the airport provided curbside service at the hotel's front door. The doorman assisted us each time even clearing a us path through the crowd to our car when departing. Adjacent the hotel's entrance you'll find an enclosed Wachovia Bank ATM as well as an entrance to a subway station. There's a convenience store about 6 storefronts north of the hotel on 7th Ave., and the Times Square Information Center is 2 doors south.Overall, I'd have to say that the front desk staff and lobby baggage handlers were very helpful and friendly. The concierge was just average, and who cares if the young man working at the lobby's bar was less than interested in serving beverages. This is one of the few hotels in Times Square that provides an in-room refrigerator (and microwave), and it's nice to have a refreshment in your room while enjoying the view. This is NOT one of New York's trendiest or most luxurious places to stay but it is clean, secure, nicely appointed and reasonably priced. If the hotels in Times Square were rewarded stars for convenience, this one would surely get 5.	
Aug 10 2009 	A great view in a comfortable hotel. Good for families with young kids.	We went to NYC for a long weekend with our kids, ages 2 and 4. From experience, we've realized that &quot;suites&quot; hotels work best for us because we can put the kids to bed early in the bedroom, close the door, and watch TV or read in the &quot;living room.&quot; The hotel worked perfectly for our stay. Times Square is mayhem and it was fun to be in the middle of it. The hotel staff was friendly and the concierge answered our questions about how to get tickets for Broadway shows. The hotel restaurant was empty when we got there but we ate at 6pm with the kids, so perhaps that's no surprise. The food was good and the waiter accommodated our picky eaters.	
Aug 9 2009 	Excellent Times Square Location Large Rooms - Good Hotel	Our June 2009 stay at the Doubletree Times Square was the 2nd time I've stayed there - but for a variety reasons, it will probably be my last. While the Doubletree Times Square is in a fantastic Times Square Location - right across from the TKTS booth - it's just become too crazy of a location for my tastes - Especially with all of the Grayline Bus Tour Hawkers swarming people as they are walking down the sidewalks (Grayline Tours solicting there must be new in recent years as I don't remember this). This just leads to the sidewalks getting backed up and causing more mass confusion. Perhaps since I've been to NYC a number of times in the last 10 years, I'm now more open to staying off Times Square - however - still would like to be in the Theatre District - but more near Hell's Kitchen, etc. Anyways, if you are not one for being thrown into throngs of people as soon as you exit your hotel - I do not recommend staying here - but I do have to say that the Doubletree's room size is very large compared to other NYC hotels. Tons of space which we liked since we were in NYC for 8 nights. Another downside we experienced was due to the fact that we used Hilton points for our stay and this was the first time we ever experienced with a Hilton property/Marriott property trying to put us in a sub-standard room just because we used points (and a lot of points at that). The front desk treated us like we were country bumpkins and put us in a pretty crummy room - and acted like we were suppose to be grateful - well after us giving pushback they relented and moved us to the room that we expected when we booked - telling us the whole time that the problem was that we booked our room though the Hilton Honors line and not though the hotel directly, blah, blah, blah. Basically, I agree with many of the other reviewers that the Front Desk staff was off putting and I don't care if it's NYC or not - the bottom line is that NYC Tourism is suffering like everywhere else in the US and they are not booking all of their rooms (which was definitely the case while we were there) so they may want to take some customer service lessons from Disney, Publix, etc. However, the other staff members we ran into, the restaurant staff, engineers, bellmen, housekeeping, etc. were awesome, so that offset our snooty check-in staff. We basically ate in the hotel restaurant every day since we had free breakfast due to hubby's Hilton Honors status and we found it very good with lots of variety - but not sure if we would have eatten there often if our breakfast wasn't free since it was approx. $ 25.00 per person for breakfast - which is a standard price at NYC hotels - we would have eaten at delis or at PAX. Would I stay here again? Perhaps if the room was free - like it was this time - or it would have to be a bargain compared to other hotels . Oh, other complaint is that it didn't have free internet access in the room - could have free access in the business center or lobby. However, this is like many of the other NYC hotels - which is another NYC tourism issue.	
Aug 5 2009 	Family friendly hotel in the heart of Times Square	We recently returned from a stay at the Doubletree Time Square in New York City. We searched at length to find a hotel that could accomodate a family of 5 (3 small children) in NYC. The Doubletree was one of the few that could. The location in Time Square was central to many attractions so that was good, however, the streets (sidewalks) in Time Square were super crowded so that was a drawback. Once you get a bit out of the heart of the madness it is much easier to navigate with small children or a stroller. (I had to make my ten year old hold my hand because the crowds were so thick there was no other way to stay together.) The hotel was fine. The staff was nice enough but certainly not top notch. They did their job and were polite. One morning at breakfast the manager stopped by our table to inquire as to our satisfaction with the hotel- that was a nice touch. The cookies on check in are DELICIOUS... that is definitely a bonus. The area is safe- I went out walking with my five year old at midnight one night to do a little souvenier shopping when neither of us could sleep- Time Square if full of tourtists well into the wee hours of the morning and all the lights make it seem like mid-day even when it is the middle of the night. I get weireded out about places being unsafe VERY easily so going out at midnight with a five year old is not the norm for me... it was THAT safe. The room was okay- again, nothing special. This isn't the Ritz or Four Seasons. It was clean... the carpet wasn't gross... the bedsheets were fine. The plug for the tub was broken so it would fill the tub even if you were just taking a shower (it was always in the down position) so we had to lift it up and lay it on its side for the tub to drain. Certainly the maids would have noticed that and should have had it serviced... but they would just knock it back down in there and we'd pull it back up when we got back to the room to shower that night.... like I said- not top notch service but this wasn't a deal breaker for us. We had a Time Square view room which was very cool and very entertaining for the little ones. The windows open out about six inches and have no screen... this was a concern to me but the kids were good about not playing with the windows so it turned out fine. we were on the 24th floor right by the elevator. We heard no elevator noise at all and only once heard some loud guests getting off the elevator on our floor at about 3am one morning. Other than an occassional siren- we couldn't hear the chaos of Time Square with the windows closed and the curtains drawn. The room was a suite but still small- very small &quot;living room&quot; area with pull out couch, a separate room with a king bed and a small bathroom. All in all, I would probably stay here again... it was fine. The price is right for the accomodations and the fact that they will take a party of 5 in one room.	
Aug 3 2009 	Excellent location	This hotel has the best location in NYC. There is even a subway station next to the hotel lobby, which made it very easy to stop and drop shopping bags at your room and continue with more shopping!!!Also, the separate living area with a sleeper sofa is very convenient.I would have preferred if the vanity section of the bathroom were separate, to allow for more people to get ready at the same time, but you can't ask for everything.The rates were very affordable, and the location in a huge city like NY is #1 priority.	
Jul 31 2009 	Hard to find similar hotel in NYC	I visit NYC every 6 months and have stayed in so many different hotels by now. We booked Doubletree Guest Suites this time to celebrate a birthday and this hotel just beats them all! Having so much space in a hotel room in New York is a rare sight. Service was excellent. The location is unbeatable. Can't wait to go back.	
Jul 28 2009 	Good hotel--Nice Location	We recently stayed at this Doubletree while on our first trip to NYC. We have two teenagers, ages 14 and 17. The hotel is nice, clean with spacious rooms. We were glad to have the extra &quot;living area&quot; with a pull-out sofa so that each child could sleep separately. Toiletries were nice and a small refrigerator and coffee-maker are in-room as well.The staff was very friendly. The concierge staff was just o.k. and seemed to know less about some things that were going on than we did. But they were very pleasant. One of the concierge staff was very helpful about the plays currently running and had seen many of them. The location is definitely prime. Close to subways and in the thick of Times Square. We were on the 38th floor so did not hear any street noise at all. Seemed very safe. During the evening they were fairly good about asking for proof of your key before you could get on the elevator from ground floor to the lobby.There is a little deli/store around the corner on 47th street where you can get hot breakfast sandwiches, bagels, juice etc at all hours. They were very friendly there as well. Nice for budget breakfasts and snacks.The Doubletree chocolate chip cookies were great as always. We managed to get a fairly good rate and were very happy with our choice.	
Jul 24 2009 	We will definitely stay here again!	I researched at least 80 hotels before choosing this one. It was also recommended by a friend. I am very picky about hotels and this one passed the test. The location is perfect--right in the heart of Times Square. You walk out the door to the hustle and bustle of the city, but inside you can't hear a sound. The rooms are clean and spacious and have an additional mirror and sink outside the bathroom for ease of multiple people getting ready at once. There are two refrigerators (one stocked and expensive and one empty which is certainly handy). At night you must show your room key to security which is a good idea although I never felt unsafe there. My search for hotels is over when I return to the city. We will definitely stay here again.	
Jul 23 2009 	Our Regular Hotel in NYC	We have stayed here three times now and looking forward to staying here many more times in the future now that we will have a son going to college in NYC. This place never disappoints. Great room, great, friendly service, clean, safe, helpful concierge. What more could you ask for? We love the location as it is part of the heartbeat of the city, close to theaters, subways, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. I have stayed at other places in NYC and now will only stay here. It is like a home away from home.	
Jul 23 2009 	Recent remodel makes this a much better hotel	I stayed at the Doubletree Times Square during a recent business trip. I needed to stay in Times Square to be close to my meetings. If you are in the same boat, or if you want to experience the hustle of Times Square, then this is a great place. If your business is outside of Times Square, then you may want to stay away. The recent remodel is a welcome change. The rooms are fresh, but the staff is still a bit off putting. I guess you have to consider that this hotel is positioned right in the heart of TS, where things move fast. If you want a slow-paced atmosphere---this is not it. Arriving at the hotel is now made more hectic thanks to the shut-down of traffic on Broadway. While this is great for pedestrians, it makes getting to businesses in the area difficult. While the street in front of the hotel is open, the increased traffic there because of the Broadway closure tends to clog things up---especially if you are trying to arrive around 5pm or depart around 8am. The door men here are great at getting people in and out of cabs--and almost as tough---across the sidewalk full of people. The new workout room is nice, with great new machines--but it would be better on a floor with a view outside. Instead, you overlook the lobby--which has also been redone in a Jetson's sort of motif. Having stayed at many of the hotels in the area, I'd rank this one in the Top 5 thanks to the new rooms and the relative price.	
Jul 21 2009 	A quality hotel and excellent cookie!!	My wife and I stayed in the Doubletree for 6 days on our recent trip to NYC.From the moment you check-in to the moment you leave, they treat you very well.The welcome hot choc chip cookie is amazing.Our room was on the 32nd floor and had amazing views of times square all the way to the hudson river. We watched the 4th July fireworks through the floor to ceiling windows - excellent vantage point.The room is well equipped with a microwave, fridge, coffe-maker, mini bar (very expensive) Plasma tv, wi-fi , sofa bed and work desk and phone and safe. The bedroom also has a big tv and ample storage space and one of the most comfortable beds ever.The bathroom is also a good size.As you are so high up there is very little disturbance from below.All in, a great base for seeing the great sights of NYC.	
Jul 20 2009 	Great Location Great Rooms Great Cookies!!	My husband and I just returned from New York and I would highly recommend this hotel to you! The location is perfect! Literally in the heart of all the action!! It was a little daunting getting out of the car with our luggage...but nothing that a little teamwork couldn't get us through:-) The hotel room is great: A proper living room/den with a pull out sofa, a mini fridge, a TV in the den and bedroom, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was a bathtub style with a shower head, and Wolfgang Puck coffee/coffee-maker in the room which was very good. The windows actually can open a little bit. The elevators are fast. And DoubleTree cookies are always a great bedtime snack! The noise from the street din't bother us in our room.The hotel is located directly across from the TKTS booth - but we were really happy that we had bought our tickets ahead of time because the line up were massively long especially in the hot sun. The Diamond street is just up 47th street!!! M&amp;M's, Hershey's, Toys'R'Us are just a few of exciting stores to see in Times Square.They say that you have to pay for the internet from your room and you can access their free WIFI in the lobby. We were on the 34th floor and easily - and happily - received great reception to the WIFI from our room.This hotel also happened to be priced better than most of the other options out there. The front desk told me that they are almost always sold out.The hotel is on top of a subway station and minutes walk from other subway routes. We found it really easy and SAFE to get around New York by metro. The commuters are happy to help direct you if you need assistance. (Although when we asked one transit worker which train to take to somewhere she replied with &quot;I don't know...I have never been there!!&quot; But honestly, buy a metro pass and go! Someone mentioned to us that they love the spa there. I personally don't have any experience with it.There is a huge presence of police and paramedics in Time Square. The hotel is on top of the West Side Story Production and just minutes away from the other theatres. We went to Citi Field (the old Shae Stadium) to see a Paul McCartney concert. We saw Billy Elliott and God of Carnage Broadway shows.We ate at Norma's, Ruby Foos, Basta Pasta, Carnegie Deli, Stage Deli and Nobu...and we thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend each one of these restaurants.	
Jul 19 2009 	Don't think I'll stay there again if I don't have to.	This is a hotel with a superb location if the hustle and bustle of NYC is what you're looking for. Unfortunately, the service is very unpredictable and not standardized. I found the lower the person in the rank, the more friendly they were. The front desk people or anyone working in the lobby area, forget it. They couldn't be more cold and impersonable. The restaurant servers, the cleaning ladies, were more real and friendly in sincere ways. I was also surprised how bad the internet service was in our room, very-very low in speed, for both downloading and uploading, and that's if it was working at all. I had made a complaint, the outsourced internet company tried to fix to no avail, so I insisted that they reimbursed the charges and they did. Beware of the Business Center, it charged usage by the minute, and again with the very slow internet connection, I ended up paying too much just to purchase a museum ticket online. We stayed for 6 nights, and wished that we could've checked out much earlier!	
Jul 19 2009 	Great hotel great location great value!	The hotel is spacious by New York standards. Our family of five (including three teenagers) slept comfortably on the two double beds and sleeper sofa fitted with Doubletree's comfy bedding and pillows. The rooms have a small refrigerator and microwave, but you do not go to NYC to stay in the room. You go to see the sites and the hotel excels here as well. It is smack in the middle of all the action in Times Square steps away from the TKTS booth (purchase discounted, same day tickets to Broadway shows) with several subway stations justs a few feet away. I recommend the Edison Cafe (about a block and a half away on 47th street) for breakfast. Since you are in the middle of all the action it tends to be wall to wall people especially on weekends but you do not go to NYC if you do not like crowds. Overall, a great value especially if you book well ahead of your trip. Check the hotel's website for internet specials.	
Jul 19 2009 	Gem of a location close to everthing	After struggling with the travel agent to find a single room in NY for 2 adults and 3 kids, at a reasonable price, we located this hotel. Fantastic location walking distance to everything, central park, empire state building, and of course Broadway.Staff very friendly, and hotel clean as a whistle. Rooms were a bit on the cramped side when the roll away was out but ended up only sleeping in the room as there was so much to do and see.Would recommend joining the Hilton honors rewards program it is free and i earnt enough points in for free night.	
Jul 17 2009 	Drivers Beware!	The hotel was roomy enough for us and quite comfortable. We never waited for an elevator and any staff member that we encountered was helpful and friendly. It was convenient to the subway and there are tons of places to eat. I personally wouldn't stay in the location again I don't think, just because I couldn't stand the crowds around Times Square. But that has nothing to do with the hotel. We ate at the restaurant once which was really good but expensive. My biggest complaint was in trying to find either the self parking (no mention of location on the site) or valet (the site tells you to pull up to the loading dock on 47th St which doesn't appear to exist. It also says don't pull up in front of the hotel). After a trying time in driving around the city twice, I called the hotel and found out that the self parking was a non-descript garage down the street that said 24 hour parking. Okay, how was I to know that? The valet parking was available in front of the hotel, where the site tells you not to stop. Well, between the taxicabs loitering in front of the hotel and the few cars waiting there to load/unload there was no place for us to stop anyway. We traveled the streets again and ended up at the self parking garage, which was fine. Perhaps if staying there and driving, you might want to call the hotel first to find out what the latest parking instructions are.	
Jul 16 2009 	Large comfortable rooms	My wife and I and our ten-year old daughter stayed here on May 29-June 2, 2009. My 70+ yr old parents stayed next door. The rooms are large and comfortable and with the adjoining suites our daughter could roam through 4 rooms. It was quiet despite the Times Square location (we were on the 24th floor). We visited the restaurant for the breakfast buffet each morning. It would have been rather pricey but Hilton Honors provided it for free. The staff there was extremely friendly and our daughter looked forward to her freshly made pancakes each morning. The hotel is adjacent to one subway stop and several more are within a block. The staff was able to provide directions and suggestions on several occassions. We had an excellent visit made more enjoyable by the quality of this Doubletree.	
Jul 15 2009 	Good in all respects	We are 2 English couples and we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of June at the start of our American holiday.Very central location with good security in the ground floor street level entrance lobby.The suite comprising bedroom and separate living room was clean and spacious with a nice sized bathroom and the maid service did a good cleaning job each day.We didn't eat in the hotel as there are far too many good and cheaper restaurants/diners within easy walking distance. The location on Broadway cannot be beat but that also means that the pavements outside the hotel get very busy especially in the evening.This was our 5th stay in New York and this was our cheapest hotel so far and gave far better value than the previous hotels that we have stayed in.We would stay here again without question.	
Jul 15 2009 	Best Hotel Stay Yet	July 8  July 13, 2009 we had a wonderful experience at this location. The staff was great! On our first night, there was a problem with the TV. We called maintenance and they came right away and replaced our TV with a new one. When the TV went out it left a smell, dying TV smell. We asked if it was possible to change rooms. They sprayed this room and we could have stayed but they had a bellman there in less than 10 minutes to move us to another room. They were very professional, kind and accommodating - no questions asked. The staff is to be commended. Throughout our stay the restaurant staff beginning with the hostess, waiters and food prep staff went out of their way to make each meal pleasant. We had breakfast there every morning. My son looked forward to going; it was a very warm and inviting atmosphere - that says a lot coming from an eleven year old. The food was great as well. Housekeeping did an outstanding job. Our room was cleaned expertly every day. We requested extra towels and they were left daily without an additional request. The room was spotless upon our return. The bellmen were very helpful and were always asking ways to assist the guest. The concierge ladies did their job. They however did not exhibit the same warmth as the other hotel staff. There was a gentleman there on Saturday who was very helpful and greeted and assisted us with the same kindness as the other staff. The ladies did their job and were efficient, but were not helpful. They answered your questions with yes, no and I don't know responses. They also had nothing available from the hotel highlighting daily events in the city as most hotels offer. I had already mapped out most of our trip so it was not a problem, but I guess I was looking for the inside scoop from someone who lived in the city and who had experience directing guest to less advertised places. Overall we would rate our stay as the best hotel experience to date. We travel frequently and have stayed in many grand and great hotels, but the service and staff at this location are superior. Thanks for making our vacation memorable.	
Jul 10 2009 	Surprisingly good	As with most TA reviewers concur, the extremely affordable Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square was a pleasant and welcome stay for part of our honeymoon. WE booked far enough in advance to get below $ 300 and received a room on a high floor that was clean and about average size for a midtown Manhattan hotel. Separate sleeping quarters with a very comfortable bed (that was welcome from all the walking) makes the Doubletree a BEST DEAL considering more upscale hotels in the area charging twice our rate.	
Jul 7 2009 	Perfect Central Location!	Located in the middle of Times Square, across from the TKTS bleachers. Ground floor features a very nice-sized welcome area with a guard who checks room keys before you proceed to 3rd floor. 3rd floor fatures check-in, bar with tvs, etc. We NEVER had to wait for an elevator. Three elevators lead from ground to 3rd floor, then upper floors accessible by at least 5 elevators. We had 28th floor with a nice view of times square. We walked to Emipre State Bldg/Macy's, to Lion King (across the street - HELLO!), subways are VERY convenient (went to WTC and Yankees Stadium), walked to FAO, 5th ave, Rockefeller Center, to Central Park, Radio City Music Hall, Daisy May's BBQ, etc.The room itself is a bit cramped for 6 people, as the fold-out sofa takes up a large chunk of the living room area when opened up. Service personnel VERY friendly and helpful! Room seemed either too hot or too cold - hard to find the balance at times. Free wi-fi was adequate.Very QUIET! Never heard the sounds of the city unless you opened the windows. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! McD's next door and easy access to stores, eateries, you name it.	
Jul 5 2009 	Perfect Location	I took 3 teenageers to the city for an overnight. We booked the Doulbletree on hotwire for 199/night. We were very happy with the large room (1 bedroom suite) which had a queen size bed in the bedroom and a queen size sofabed in the living room. The bathroom was huge. We had a great view of Times Square. All-in-all it was perfect.	
Jul 4 2009 	recommend recommend recommend!!!	I bid $200 on a 3 1/2 star hotel on hotwire.com, not knowing which hotel would be waiting for me at the other end of the &quot;send&quot; button. This was the hotel I received, I am thoroughly impressed with both hotwire and the Doubletree Suites. I had heard a lot about how small Manhattan hotel rooms are, since real estate is at such a premium in nyc. The Doubletree Suites are located smack dab in the middle of Times Square, and the room is well, a suite. We had a very comfortable king size bed, and the children slept on the pull out couch in the &quot;living room&quot; which was in excellent condition. The entire suite had been recently redecorated, and there were large, flat screen tv's in both the sitting area and the bedroom. There was also a mini fridge, a bar sink, an in-room safe, and the bathroom was spotless and very modern. We were lucky enough to get a corner suite on the 22nd floor, and we had amazing views from two vantage points. As for the cleanliness, this hotel room was immaculate. The sheets were crisp and new, and the room was cleaned to spotless condition both days we were there. The front line staff was uber-friendly, the concierge was likewise, and the guys at the baggage counter (bellhops?) watched our bags for the day after we checked out (for a nice tip of course).I could find absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel. Spacious, modern, clean, awesome location, friendly staff; the Doubletree had it all.Oh, the chandelier in the main reception could use dusting. There, I found something negative. This was an awesome experience.	
Jul 3 2009 	Not a great experience	Upon our arrival we were welcomed with warm cookies and upgraded to a king bedroom. The beds were comfortable and comparable to &quot;My Bed, Sofitel&quot;.The rugs were stained and old from the hallway to the bedroom. The bathroom was dirty, the paint was peeling, and the grout was old. Mildew covered all corners of the bathtub.We were charged $8.00 extra for a minibar that we haven't used before. The satff was rude.Overall not a good experience and I will not return.	
Jun 29 2009 	Great Hotel Made Even Better By Daniel!!	We had put off going to NY all these years because we heard the people in NY were rude and unfriendly - but we took a chance for 5 days on our way to Europe. Well, we decided to stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites based on their wonderful reviews - and hoped for the best. The very first person we encountered in NY - after our taxi driver - was Daniel at the front desk. He was charming, funny, welcoming, and we truly appreciated his AMAZING room upgrade to make my 50th birthday celebration even more wonderful. We are Hilton Gold VIP members - and are supposed to get a room upgrade when one is available - but often the &quot;true&quot; upgrades are saved for the &quot;diamond&quot; VIP members - and we are left to feel less like &quot;gold&quot; and more like &quot;tarnished brass.&quot; But Daniel set the tone for our entire trip. He made us feel like VALUED family members - and the hotel itself is clean, spacious, and a welcome respite from the noisy world of Times Square just outside their door. Do take advantage of the fantastic proximity to all of the world-class Broadway shows within walking distance from the hotel. And by the way, we LOVED all the New Yorkers we came in contact with - so - don't delay! It was a most enjoyable trip!	
Jun 27 2009 	I love this place	If you want to stay in Times Square or Midtown area, I highly recommend this hotel. You get a full suite, with a completely separate living room -- not the traditional &quot;NY suite&quot;, which is a slight larger room with a two foot mini-wall dividing the &quot;bedroom&quot; from the &quot;living room&quot;. Most people would be scared of the noise being right in Times Square, but I usually seem to get a high floor, and rare hear much street noise, if any at all.	
Jun 26 2009 	An okay room	The price and lack of amenities make this room hard for me to recommend highly. It is a nice room. It is clean and has a decent amount of room to move about. The sofabed is okay but not that great. The hotel gives out free cookies after lunch. It has wifi but not in the room. If you want it in the room it is 12.00 a day. They don't have a complimentary breakfast but Mcdonalds is two stores down. Around the corner is a little shop that does wonderful breakfast sandwiches fresh. It isn't crowded or expensive. (when coming out of the hotel make a right around the corner and go about 500 yards.) My family loved the breakfasts from there. The hotel's location is excellent and right in the middle of Times Square.	
Jun 26 2009 	GREAT HOTEL-GREAT SERVICE	This was our first stay at a Doubletree Hotel and it exceeded our expectations. We debarked from our cruise on Monday morning at 10am, and the hotel was a mere 8 miles from the Manhattan cruise terminal. Since we were early and we didn't call for early check in we had a little wait. As soon as a room was available we were speedily checked in. Ami at the front desk was very professional and courteous. We were offered complimentary breakfast for 2 for the duration of our stay, which we did not expect, but a great bonus nonetheless. Breakfast was good with a decent selection. The pastries were delicious! The room was spacious, clean and comfortable enough for 4 people. Housekeeping did a great job and there were always enough towels. There is a separate vanity/Kitchenette with coffee/tea maker and refridgerator and microwave and wetbar. The sitting area has a pullout bed, separate flat panel TV and desk.We did a city tour through Grayline Tours, and got our tickets in the hotel. The downtown tour buses pickup are very near the hotel, the uptown buses are about 1 block away (not too far). As for restuarants we ate at the Olive Garden which is in Times Square just opposite the hotel. This was the fastest sit down service we ever got!! The street vendors also sell good food at good prices and portions are large enough for two. One particular vendor sold Lebanese food on 42nd and 7th street, south of Broadway. Since it can rain at any time, its a good idea to have a poncho or umbrella handy. We did a lot of walking so comfortable shoes and a bottle of water were a must. Even if there are no kids in your party go and see the Toys R Us store. We had a great stay in New York City and we will definitely be staying at this hotel again when we plan our next visit to the big apple.	
Jun 24 2009 	Good location for first trip to NYC .. big rooms ... service could have been better	We were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was huge, with a bedroom and separate living area. Unfortunately it was RIGHT next ot the lifts (our door looked like one of the lifts). This wasn't a big deal though as you couldn't hear the lifts at all from the room. However the room became a problem when it started to stink of cigarette or cigar when we arrived back one night. This happened to us at two hotels in the US, what's that about !? We told reception and they acted shocked and gave us the key to another room, on the corner of the building which had a much nicer layout and therefore seemed even bigger. But when we went into the bedroom area the window was open and there was a packet of cigarettes on the windowsill, and someone had had a little lie down in the bed ! Back we went to reception where again, they were shocked. It was getting old at this point so we said they need to go and inspect the room before they give us the next key, which they did. We got another corner room on a higher floor which was perfect. The rooms have a kitchenette which was really useful, and the location is great you look down over times square (you can't hear anything though so you don't experience the downside of the location!). If we were to return though we would probably not stay in times square because its so busy and you get a bit sick of the salesmen all over the street.	
Jun 23 2009 	Great Hotel. Perfect Location.	Stayed here for 4 nights with girlfriends and we had no complaints. I recommend this hotel to anyone. Hotel is in the center of Times Square which made our stay even better. I definetly would stay here again. The room size was perfect. Beds very comfortable. Nice bathroom size. Thumbs up for Doubletree Times Square Suites.	
Jun 23 2009 	For Times Square I guess you cant beat the rate	Overall you are going to pay a lot for a hotel in NYC. Well in perspective this hotel might be a steal considering the prices of other hotels that look over Times Sq.Check-inThey were very helpful in that we had an extra room and they worked it our without charging us. (I think they were over booked so they were happy to do it.)The checkin was quick in the fact we were doing the room swap thing. RoomNice big rooms. I think they all have a living room area and also the bed room. More then enough room to spread around if you have a few people in the room. I also had a corner room so I'm sure it was slightly larger then othersBathroomNo problems here. Hot water was quick and I never ran out. Nothing special and nothing gross (which is a plus).TVI had a problem with the flat screen in the room and this is where they lost points for me. They wanted to send someone up to look at a TV that wouldn't turn on at 1:30 in the morning. The operator was just a jerk about it also. I did leave a note for the manager and never heard anything so I guess they really don't care that much. As for the TV's they were nice flat screens in both rooms.InternetThey had free wifi as far as I could tell but the connection sucked. I kept getting disconnected and got slow speeds. Same thing with my co worker on another floor.LocationVery good if you need to be in Times Sq. So remember there are always going to be crowds and its going to be loud. I was on the 29th floor and I could hear street noise sometimes. Also the curtains sucked so they didnt block out all the lights flashing. OverallI think its worth it if you want to be right in the middle of it there. Prices are higher but for the most part everyone was friendly at the desk and helpful except for that one jerk I got on the phone.	
Jun 22 2009 	Good location and room to relax.	We stayed at the Doubletree from June 12-19th. As a family with 3 kids we needed a room with some space. As things turned out our oldest couldn't go with us but the 18 and 15 year olds enjoyed themselves. They liked being in the middle of all the action and it was convienent to walk to so many places. We saw 3 shows while we were in town and all were easily reached from this hotel. There was a subway station right next to the hotel and several others close by. Having the McDonalds a few steps away was nice for when they got the munchies. It was nice having 2 TV's and 2 rooms. My daughter and I had separate mirrors in the mornings and my husband and son had separate sinks for shaving. Kept the conflict down. The first day we were there the bedroom TV didn't work but it was quickly replaced and we were given a free in-room movie. That night the tub didn't drain very well and we found ourselves standing in several inches of water during our showers. We called on Saturday morning and they spent 90 minutes on repairs but comped us the Sunday breakfast buffet ( 25$ per person) My husband wondered if he could find anything else that didn't work (Ha) The maid service was very good and Jimmy downstairs on the door was the best. Got an extra nice ride back to the airport due to Jimmy--so big shout out to him. Mid-week we recieved a fruit bowl and a tin of cookies. You don't get luxury but the service is good and the location is great especially with older kids. The crowds might be a little scary for very young children. If I were going back alone with my husband I might choose a hotel a little farther from Times Square and a little more romantic but with kids you can't beat the Doubletree.	
Jun 20 2009 	Great location comfortable bed but a little disappointed	My husband and I stayed here June 3-5, 2009 and were disappointed with several things. The room was much smaller than we anticipated, bathtub/shower had a lot of rust in it, and the furniture was aweful. Now the bed was VERY comfortable and I slept like a baby. We stayed here back in 2001 and we had a fabulous room and it was a great stay. I just think with this being a very busy hotel they are just letting the age of their rooms show. The location is fantastic and the view from our room had a 180 degree view of time square, but I just don't think we would stay here again. The housekeeping was lacking also. Happy Traveling!! :)	
Jun 19 2009 	Excellent location with average amenities	This hotel is right in the middle of the action. Times Square and all the hustle and bustle that goes with it is right out the front door! The hotel itself is ok. The staff is friendly and the amenities are average. The hotel rooms and common areas are a bit dated. We ate at the hotel restaurant only once during a 6 night stay. The food was unremarkable. If you dont care about such things, but want to be close to the action, you could do worse than this hotel.	
Jun 18 2009 	doubletree has action all around it	doubletree guest suites is one of the finest hotels in NYC. located just about 30 - 45 minutes from JFK airport, right in the heart of broadway. the entire locality is hustling and bustling with life and action. everything is like a block or 2 away from the hotel. shopping from the best brands to the best malls, restaurants of all types, broadway shows, times square .. you name it and its there. you get a panoramic view from the room as they are situated high above. the rooms are very spacious with a living room followed by the bed room. they provide in house entertainment like movies video games PS2 etc. since it is so centrally located you spend your entire day roaming NYC. i would recommend anyone staying in NYC that double tree is the place to be in. superb location, most curt staff, valet parking service, very confortable living.since the rooms are located quite high for us it was onthe 35th floor your right in the middle of action an yet away from the noise when you want to be.	
Jun 17 2009 	Centric hotel	This is my favorite hotel in the Times Square area for two reasons. The space and the centric location. It lacks a good service response, a nice accessible entrance, it is not that quiet unless you book a suite in the higher floors, and it is a little expensive, but the extra space is worth it.	
Jun 16 2009 	Fantastic view and wonderful room~ great hotel!!	When we first pulled up in front on the hotel in our taxi we were a little hesitant to get out as it was a busy Saturday afternoon and wondered what we had gotten ourselves into with the mobs of people everywhere! You enter into a small room with a guard at a podium who asks for your name on the check in list and sends you up to the 3rd floor. (at night you have to show your room key to the guard upon entering). When you get off on the 3rd floor there is a small bar with some snacks and a small lounge area and the check in counter. Everyone we encountered was very nice and helpful. We were told we were upgraded to a 'Conference Suite' and our Times Square view was granted. Our room was fantastic, it was on the 37th floor and a corner suite! We had a large bath (only negative ~one sink), nice sized bedroom with the most comfortable king size bed and a great view to look at over the nice desk. We had a dining room with a large wet bar and a coffee maker, fridge, microwave oven. The view was spectacular but the living room view was to die for. Our boys shared the pull out sofa bed which they said was very comfortable and they slept with the blinds open every night to take in everything. I also have to mention the room was pretty quiet too. As I type this sitting at the dining room table looking into our living room I see the '2009 and ball' that drop's for New Year's Eve. 360 views out of every window and and not into another building. We had paid for the breakfast included pkg which we were so glad we did because there really isn't a 'decent' breakfast place around that serves a full breakfast. The breakfast is a buffet with a large variety of food items.Everything is in walking distance, great restaurants, theater's and the 'tiks' booth across the street where you can stand in line to buy same day 1/2 price show tickets which we used twice! Also the hop off/on tour buses are also within walking distance.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience a true NY experience!	
Jun 14 2009 	girlfriend getaway	This hotel offers the best location and arrangement for a sisters or girlfriend get away in NYC. We were in the center of it all and had a 2 room suite to relax and visit in when we weren't out and about. We think it is the only suite hotel in Times Square, too!	
Jun 14 2009 	Best Times Square view you can get comfy spacious suite	This was my 10th visit to New York. I stayed here 30th May for 2 nights, and paid $250 per night (including tax) in advance to get the cheapest rate. I chose a King suite with a Times Square view. I really liked the room. The bedroom is separate so you can enjoy a quiet night without being disturbed by any noise from guests walking past the room. The sofa-bed was fairly comfortable, and the fridge was useful. The giant flat screen TV in the living room did not work properly. I am sure if I had reported it I could have got it fixed, but we did not spend much time in the room. Check in and out was very quick and easy, and the hotel stored our luggage on our last day. The bar in the lobby was small and always very quiet; but there are many bars around the hotel for a more lively experience. The best thing about the room was the view. We could see all of Times Square. I dont think any other hotel in the area could give you as great a view  one that is now even more interesting since Broadway has been shut off to traffic and you can sit on chairs right in the middle of Times Square! I have stayed at the Marriott Marquis in a Times Square view room, and it was not as spectacular and cost a lot more. The area is obviously very busy all the time from the moment you step out of the hotel, but you only had to go round the side of the hotel and there was space to stand without being disturbed, or on the new light up red stairs above the TKTS booth outside the hotel . From my experience the rates at this hotel are usually pretty high; but if you can get a great rate like I did I really recommend the Doubletree Times Square. The following weekend I stayed at The Hilton on 6th Avenue, which was also very nice and I have reviewed this hotel too.	
Jun 10 2009 	Greatest location and room size!	Located in the hub of Times Square the absolute best location! Our room was totally quiet with no street noise. Comfortable and roomy accomodations and the staff was so great! The cookies are the bomb! Not one negative to comment on. Thanks for a great stay.	
Jun 2 2009 	right on times square centre of everything	My Wife and 21year old daughter just spent 4 days of mayhem in Manhatten and in all honesty, I was dreading it, I really hate touristy stuff but my dear wife insisted we go. LOVED IT.....Great Place, Had an absolute ballAnyway the Doubletree hotel. 3 people in May 09 $600 a night excluding breakfast. Not bad for a room with one of the most iconic views in the world. (the one with the tickertape Wall street results and giant TV screens) I have paid a lot more for a lot worse.Clean, quite nice people, Really easy to deal with, A late check in no problem, maybe 5 minutes till we were in the lift. The room 1303 was a king suite, smoking, and had views both onto the square and up Broadway. Nice bedroom, lovely bathroom and a fine small lounge. Because we smoke, I tended to keep the lounge window open and the noise is amazing. Alarms screams, sirens, more sirens different sirens music, seriously NewYork do you really need emergency vehicles to scream at maximum volume at three in the morning. Did it matter, NO, if it had I would have shut the window. We slept the sleep of the dead due to extreme New York Exhaustion. If you want peace and quiet try Alaska.Breakfast was in a wee diner round the corner (We did not eat in the hotel) and was supremely New Yorkian in nature with massive portions. I dont think in the whole 4 days we had cause to talk to any of the hotel staff apart from the concierge on the last day. We got tickets for some shows from their booking people (Next to reception) and boy were they expensive. If you are able to plan things ahead, buy your tickets on the internet a few weeks in advance....much much cheaper. I dont care how good the show is, $200 for 2.5 hours of a broadway show is just too much particularily if there are several of you going.If you want to see a good broadway show then wait till it comes to a theatre near you.....For my wife and daughter, the fun was sight seeing and shopping and shows, for me it was museums, bars, archetecture, talking to everyone. I think the point is that no matter what you are after, You can get it in New York. Everyone had a great time and this hotel is perfectly placed to make it easy, Taxis to the door, 49th street Metro (The yellow R one) in the basement, (seriously) Red and Blue Bus tours across the road. and walking distance from more fun than should or actually is legal yet still safe at three in the morning (Well safe-ish)You will notice that this review doesn't say much about the hotel. Well thats because unlike many other hotels round the world they did not wreck my trip. They were easy, nice, simple and lots of other words that dont denote any ultimate highs or terrible lows and frankly in this city, thats the best kind of hotel you could ask for. You get the highs and lows out on the street, the hotel is for sleeping in and storing your stuff. Other stuff,A well stocked if a little pricey fridge and a spare empty fridge for the your own drinks and snacks, cool idea. (Pun intended)Internet..... Who the hell charges for internet these days.......No one except apparently cheapscate New York Hotels. $7.50 a day but totally worth it to find stuff in New York on google. I still think a con is a con though....Good security at night, you dont get past the front door without your key after about 8pm... Excellent idea in this area. Not sure what happens if you lose your key....Easy access to great food, great entertainment, great shopping Great bars and night clubs. Also available within easy walking distance is crap food, rubbish entertainment, expensive shopping for stupid people with too much money, Drink, drugs, rock and roll and well, an awful awful lot of fun. And the Doubletree guestrooms are perfectly placed for it all.	
May 31 2009 	Great location service as usual	As a Hilton Platinum VIP, I stay in many locations in NYC. I was defaulted to this location due to NYU graduation and was concerned I would be bothered with noise. What a surprise! This place is sound proof and has now become my first choice over the Hilton Garden for future trips to NYC. The front desk staff is the best, I was treated great.	
May 29 2009 	best hotel for kids !	I arrived at this hotel to be greeted with warm cookies! The staff were wonderful, friendly and efficient , I even got my meal free 1 evening because they were 10 mins late delivering it to the room! they even included more cookies for my 2 daughters to apologise for delay. the rooms are bright , spacious, sound proof,( v important when staying in times sq) I stayed on the 13th floor as it was a smoking floor but my views were still great and my room was cleaned and polished every day, I even received a note from the chambermaid one day to say thank you for the tips I was leaving! the area is great, tkts booth right outside, mcdonalds next door and toysrus 2 mins walk, subway entrance at the door of hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel for families but even for single travellers as no noise travels from room to room. I will def stay again, I got this hotel on hilton website and it was only $199 per night if booked few months in advance, fab price! security is great there as you have to go to the 3rd floor to get to the reception .great place!	
May 25 2009 	Fantastic place to stay with kids	I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to families traveling with children/teens. We have three kids (13, 9 and 6) and finding a hotel room with enough space for us all is a real challenge. The Doubletree had plenty of room, with two double beds in the separate bedroom and a large, comfy, pull out sofa. We stayed on the 16th floor and our room (which had a partial view of Times Square) was incredibly quiet.We found the staff very friendly and helpful. Our requests for extra towels etc were attended to quickly. No request seemed like too much trouble. In fact the front desk staff were very indulgent of my kids, helping to fit batteries to their new toys aquired at Toys R Us (just down the street.)The location is great for kids. Everything you need (including a subway station) is right out your front door. There are loads of great places to eat nearby. My kids' favourite was John's Pizzeria.We had a great time in NYC, and our stay at Doubletree totally enhanced our experience.	
May 22 2009 	Great Rooms Fantastic Location on Times Square	Doubletree Guest Suites on Times Square is a great place to stay. At the entrance to the hotel, there's a TKTS booth (where you can get tickets to shows on and off Broadway), Times Square visitors centre (you can get show tickets here too), Duffy's square which is great for people watching, the entrance to the 49th St subway station and the theatre where West Side Story is playing. You can easily walk to Central Park, 5th Ave shops, the Empire State Building and much more. We walked to the Winter Garden Theatre showing Mama Mia in less than 5 minutes. It sure beats staying further away and having to take the subway to all these places, especially if you have a group of 4 to 6 people (saves $2 per person per ride if you can walk.)The rooms are spacious and comfortable, good shower, large LCD TV and sufficient amenities for a comfortable stay. And despite its incredibly busy location, the hotel is very quiet. Go ahead, stay here!	
May 21 2009 	Highly recommended	2 other women and I stayed here for 4 nights in May. It is a great location and even though, very bustling right outside the door, the room was very quiet and comfortable. The 2 room suite was very spacious especially for NYC. The service could not be better from the front desk, concierge, bell desk to the maids - as good as I have received at 5 star hotels. The beds were very comfy but the sofa bed was not. The warm cookies were such a welcome treat and the mini bar was very convenient. The location is highly recommended for someone who wants to see the tourist spots.	
May 20 2009 	A fantastic stay	My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree suites Time square for our annual mother's day trip. Everything about this hotel was excellent. The service at check in was quick and easy. The cookies were to die for. The room was a two room suite. It was nicer than I had expected. The room was clean, the bed was excellent to sleep in and the shower had excellent water pressure and tempature control. The location was fantastic, right on time square. There a broadway theatre next door playing West Side Story. There loads of restraunts with in a couple of blocks and the subway entrance is right next door too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know who headed to NYC. My wife and I will stay there again next time we go to NYC.	
May 19 2009 	Excellent Value for money.	This hotel is in the ideal location for all sights ie, Rockerfella Centre, Fifth Ave in walking distance. Macy 's, Empire State Building, only one stop away on subway (yellow N).Grand Central Station only two stops away on subway (Green 6). Central Park walk in 15 minutes. Staten Island Ferry 5 minutes on Subway (Red 1) to South Ferry.This hotel is very comfortable, rooms are very large Living room with 32&quot; Plasma, plus separate bedroom with another tv, kitchen area with microwave, coffee maker with complimentry coffee, fridge. Massive king bed I got lost in.	
May 17 2009 	Exceptional!!!	Our stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites was from May 8 - 12th and was everything and more that we had hoped for. Yes, the cookies at check-in are warm and delicious!!!! Loved the idea of having to show your room key to gain access to the elevators in the evening. The lobby is located on the 3rd floor and then you must take another set of elevators to your floor but they are so quick there was virtually no wait . There were four of us in the suite and upon arrival we noticed only enough towels for three, called their &quot;careline&quot; and before we knew it a knock came to the door with an ample supply. We also received a call to make sure the towels arrived - such good service!! The room was very spacious, the beds heavenly!!! The kitchenette area has a sink, coffee maker, safe, microwave and mini-fridge. Loved having a separate sitting area.This hotel is the best choice if you want in Times Square!! Just across the street is the TKTS booth which has tiered seating above it - these provide a great area to sit, eat lunch and watch all the sites of Times Square. The Doubletree Guest Suites is the perfect place to stay expecially is you want to experience Times Square!! Can't wait to go back.	
May 12 2009 	Absolutely fantastic hotel lovely staff best location	Spent a week here at Easter. Had a one bedroom suite, 2 adults and three children. Reception area was bright and modern, staff could not be more helpful. The room was spacious, however the double beds were a bit on the small side. The room was on the 26th floor, looking out onto Times Square. It was spotless clean, and well equipped with a fridge, microwave. A useful addition would be a kettle instead of the coffee maker, but this is only a minor complaint. The location could not be better, it's right in the heart of Times square. We didn't use the bar or restaurant, as there was much better value to be found outside. We will defnitely stay here next time we go to NY.	
May 11 2009 	Wonderful Hotel...Great location!!!	Stayed here for a long weekend over Mother's Day. This was one of the best places we have stayed in the city. Extremely clean. Staff was more than helpful and friendly. Room was great size for myself, husband and 2 children. Had no problems with noise. We were on the 35th floor so I am sure that helps. Had room service one evening and it was fast and tasty. The location is what really put this hotel over the top. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do. If we needed to take a cab there were always plenty out front. This will be our hotel of choice from now on.	
May 10 2009 	Great Place!! LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! PLUS ++	Suite was PERFECT for Mother, daughter and aunt get-away!! Location is fantastic for theatres and dining! Staff is friendly, helpful, professional. Furnishings and amentities surpassed our expectations!! Will definitely return- as we think &quot;theatre get aways are going to be a part of our &quot;traditions!&quot;	
May 5 2009 	Excellent location great room!	This location is superb. Right in the heart of Times Sq. Walking distance to Rockefeller center and St. Patricks Cathedral. I did not have any problems with the noise but others may want to bring earplugs to sleep. The view of Times Sq. was awesome from the 16th floor. The curtains need to be closed at night to shut out all the bright lights. The room was ample and had a safe, a fridge, a mini bar fridge, microwave, coffee maker and bar sink. The elevators are fast and I never had to wait more than 30 seconds. The bar in the lobby is overpriced ($11 for a shot of Patron, $9 for a house Chardonnay) There is a security guard on the ground floor before the elevators that take you to the lobby floor. You need to show your key to go up. Cabs are plentiful and there are several subway stations within blocks. They have a decent fitness center.The big con is that you have to pay $12.95 per 24 hours for slow internet. That is a real rip off.	
May 5 2009 	Good value if you need a suite	Stayed here 4 nights on family trip without kids. Mom stayed on sofabed, and complained about thin matress. The second day I told reception, and they put an extra matress there. That solved the problem. This meant that the sofabed had to be unfolded the rest of the trip. This was no problem, since my brother stayed in another suite down the hall.Helpful concierge, reception staff etc etc. We did not have the breakfast, there's plenty of nice eateries around the block.Best hotel bed ever, very quiet on the 42nd floor, convenient for three people, good coffee included.	
May 5 2009 	Fabulous Place Fabulous Location	We arrived and were greeted by a very nice check-in attendant. From that moment everything went flawlessly. They assisted with tickets to the theater, recommended a couple of different places to eat, and best of all they had a &quot;pure room&quot;. Since I have asthma, it was a no brainer to try this place and we were not disappointed.We will be back.	
Apr 30 2009 	Excellent Location	We stayed here for 3 nights in April 2009. Couldn't have picked a better location. Right in the heart of Times Square and right next door to a subway station.Location:Being right in TS, the outside doors tend to get a little crowded, but nothing major. You have to get on an elevator to get to the lobby, then another elevator to get to your room. That become a little 'annoying' after a few trips.Lobby / Amenities / Staff:The lobby feels a little crowded and looks NOTHING like the pictures on Hilton's site. I didn't notice any construction, but maybe that is the goal... We didn't use the fitness center, but walked through and it was pretty small. The business center was very hot. I used it to print a few items and had some minor problems which were resolved fairly quickly.I used the pre-order feature which allows you to have items (extra towels, pillows, toothbrush, etc.) to order a dental care 'kit'. That wasn't in our room when we arrived, but I called down and they delivered it within 5 minutes.We ordered a cheese/cracker tray which was good, but VERY overpriced. Staff was outstanding overall. We had an issue with 2 employees (one front desk, one bell boy), but everyone else was extremely helpful and friendly.Room:We had some HHonors points, so I can't speak to the value, but we were on the 29th floor with a times square view. We were on the corner so we could so both ends of TS and the water from our room... It was outstanding!All of the corner rooms are right next to the elevator, but I didn't really notice once inside. I only heard them in the bathroom, but not at all in the living room or bedroom. The room (suite) was on the smaller side compared to other DoubleTree's I've stayed in, but probably very large when compared to other NYC hotels. The beds were extremely comfortable. We haven't slept that well in a long time. We couldn't really hear any noise from the ground level unless you opened the windows.Bathroom was half remodeled, but the shower was very old. Overall, we couldn't have imagined a better location and overall experience. Definitely recommended (Especially if you have HHonors points!)We had very low signal on the wireless internet in our room. I never brought this to the staff's attention, but it did get quite annoying (on again, off again).	
Apr 29 2009 	Great Location...worth the price!	We just returned from a 3 night stay. There were 5 of us so the suite suited us just fine as it has two doubles and a pull out couch. The location in Times Square is awesome!! Subway is right next door, lots to do right when you walk out the front, quiet when you need it as well. The room has a fridge and a microwave so we stocked up on drinks and snacks to save a bit. Lots of delis and other restaurants are right there as is the discount theater ticket booth. The staff was very friendly and helpful.	
Apr 25 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised!	We were pleasantly surprised how great this hotel was! Yes--it's in a BUSY location--so, it's not the easiest place to just pull your car up and unload your luggage. However, the bellstaff are very helpful and friendly. They do a great job considering the busy entrance!We had a room on the 33rd floor. It was a &quot;Pure&quot; room (clean air). And I have to say--it does make a difference! Room was spacious for our family of 4 and surprisingly very quiet! I never heard a toilet flush from another room, never heard a peep from neighbors and couldn't hear any traffic noise from outside. Very comfortable bed! And a very clean room!Great view from windows!! My son just loved sitting at the window and watching the sights!We never ate at the hotel, so I can't comment on that.But overall, a great stay! I would definitely stay here again!	
Apr 23 2009 	Right in the heart of NYC	A great location for our spring break stay. We had tickets to West Side Story and 9 to 5, and we were able to walk to all the shows. TKTS is right across the street. The entryway is right off the street and has security after 10:00 at night. The lobby is on the 3rd floor and the registration staff were pleasant and accomodating. The big plus is the warm, chocolate chip cookie given to each guest upon arrival.The rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping was excellent. Our suite had a large sitting room with a big screen TV. The bedroom had two double beds and plenty of big plump pillows. The thermostat was easily adjusted (which I find is not the case in most hotel rooms lately). The price is a little higher than some hotels in the city....but that's NYC. Would definitely stay here again.	
Apr 23 2009 	Superb Location - Very Decent Hotel	This is a standard large hotel, perfectly located. The hotel is right on Times Square, across the street from the discount ticket office, close to a subway line, and within walking distance of Broadway theatres and lots of restaurants.The staff were uniformly pleasant, but be advised that the staff is small for the size of the hotel, the lobby is tiny and is actually on the third floor (one set of elevators brings you up from the street on 7th Ave to the 3rd floor and you must transfer to another set of elevators to get to your room). We stayed in a suite with a king bed; the rooms are not large, but quite reasonable for New York. The two rooms, a bedroom and a sitting room with a pullout couch, were clean, with a small fridge, a pod coffeemaker that can brew two cups at a time (youll get two caf and one decaf pods a day), two TVs, a desk, plenty of drawer space but there is limited space for hanging clothes. The room was remarkably quiet (if there is traffic noise, check to make sure the windows are tightly closed!).We ate at the restaurant once and had the breakfast buffet; the price was typical for NYC, but they do omelettes, French toast, and pancakes to order which is a nice touch. Service was adequate, but not extraordinary.There were lots of families, many with elementary school aged children, and so the elevators were almost always busy, and sometimes noisy, but not obnoxiously so.BOTTOM LINE stay here for the superb location and because this is a decent hotel. If you are looking for luxury, then go elsewhere and pay more.	
Apr 15 2009 	Enjoyed our visit...the best beds we've ever slept on.	The location is perfect for enjoying all that Times Square and the Theater District has to offer. Being on the corner of 47th and 7th, you're literally in the heart of it all. Yes, the sidewalks can get quite congested, but it's Times Square. There are several subway stations in the area. Overall, the service was nice. Hot warm cookies at check-in were a plus. We had an issue with our safe and it took them only 5 or 10 minutes to have a serviceman at our door and the problem fixed. The rooms are all suites so they're plenty spacious which is really nice after a long day of hitting the sites. The bathroom amenities are top of the line Nutrogena products so no generic stuff. They even provided sunscreen. And there's a television in both the main room and the bedroom. And the beds....wow, the beds....Hilton rightly coined them their Sweet Dreams experience. If only all hotels had such wonderful beds and pillows. My wife and I had no trouble sleeping at all. We'll have no qualms about booking this place for our next visit.	
Apr 14 2009 	Great Location	We visited the Doubletree Guest Suites as part of a New York holiday to celebrate our wedding anniversary and used my husband's Hilton points. This got us a very good breakfast as part of the deal. The hotel is ideally situated for shows etc, even though it can be exceptionally busy on the sidewalk beside the hotel, making bringing luggage in etc. a bit difficult. However, our room was great, clean and comfortable. Only issue we had was the fact that during our stay there were weddings on every night which meant there was no access to the restaurant and nowhere in the hotel where you could get a coffee. The bar is pretty lifeless and unattractive but because of the location and all the places to go nearby it was not a major problem.	
Apr 13 2009 	Unexceptional service but beautifully furnished hotel	I had a special free breakfast or free parking rate. This very expensive all suite hotel is located in Times Square, so its location is ideal, but it's arguably the busiest place in Manhattan, so don't even plan on parking here (I tried and it gave me such a headache I parked in New Jersey and took the train to Manhattan). The free breakfast? - well, the cordial but relatively unfriendly hotel clerk did not even mention it (I had forgotten about it). I overslept and it was too late for breakfast anyways. The wireless and connected Internet does not work on high floors. Wireless internet is free in the 3rd floor lobby and 5th floor restaurant/lounge, though there is a hefty fee for &quot;using it&quot; in your suite, if you can manage to find a connection in your suite. The suite was beautifully furnished, a very comfortable bed, and Neutrogena toiletries. Overall, definitely too expensive for the price paid, but if money is no option, the location is ideal. The chocolate chip/walnut warm cookie given at check-in was definitely a nice touch, though.	
Apr 13 2009 	Best kept secret	I took a family group to NYC over Easter weekend and stayed here using Hilton points. The two beds and sleeper sofa easily accommodated our group of five. You could not get a better location for touring, nor could you find a nicer, more helpful staff. The most comfortable beds ever, and good food, too. The hotel is not fancy, with very modern decor, but it is quiet despite its proximity to Times Square, and was just perfect for our needs. We saw two shows, and took a tour with Onboard Tours, which was the highlight of our stay. Just wonderful. I will address in a separate review. Stay at the DGS. You will not regret it.	
Apr 12 2009 	Exellent view of Times Square Great Suite and Value	Upon arrival, the front desk had our reservation wrong but quickly corrected the problem. We really enjoyed the suite, having 2 tvs and a corner room (conference room) which gave multiple views. Good location. Rooms were clean. Enjoyed the cookies. We did not go to the restaurant. Be careful with the minibar, as it mischarged us and had to get the bill corrected. Overall, we would definitely stay here again.	
Apr 12 2009 	great hotel and location for family of four	We, family of four (kids ages 8 and 10), just got back from a five-day trip to New York City and it was absolutely wonderful! The Doubletree Suites are located right on Times Square, very busy area but close (walking distance) to theaters and other sightseeing. Very safe area, lots of police all around. We lucked out with a corner hotel room (#1203). King-size bed in bedroom, sleeper sofa in living room and eleven windows looking out on Times Square where there were nine tv screens to watch. The kids loved this and would just sit in front of the windows in awe. Other hotels in the area are the Marriott Marquis and Renaissance but the suites at Doubletree are l(much) ower priced. It was great to have a suite so after the kids went to bed the adults could stay up. Having tv's in both rooms was a nice touch; early riser kids can watch tv before the rest of the family has to wake up. I knew hotels in this area do not offer free breakfasts so I usually went down to McDonalds or Jamba Juice (across the street or next door) to pick up something to bring back to the room. Other times we went to deli's in side streets and ordered food downstairs at the counter before taking it upstairs to the 'dining' room. We had very good dinners on 9th Ave and 44th street, at Marseille (Michelin recommended) and Nizza (italian). Having dinner on Broadway/Times Square is not advised; it's just too crowded and hard to keep an eye on your kids while you order at the counter and carry a tray. The hotel was great and we felt very at home. Clean, quiet, wonderful beds, big and soft towels. Requests for extra blankets (it was cold and snowed one day) were immediately satisfied. Free cookies were a nice touch. Price and value match well. (Just don't eat at the hotel or order room service; very, very expensive even for New York standards but we knew this ahead of time through reviews.)	
Apr 8 2009 	Great location in very busy part of the City!	My wife and I spent a Saturday night here in Mar09 to celebrate our anniversary. The hotels location is perfect if you want to spend lots of time in Times Square/Theatre District. It is across street from the new TCKTS booth (cool design) and next to the theatre playing West Side Story.We found the service to be good and the room just awesome. Our room had a great view of the New Years ball. It was just delightful to watch the people and lights in the evening.One complaint, the couch in the living area was really bad. The cushions were way to small and kept sliding off the couch. Just wasn't very comfortable to sit on while we watched a movie on the big screen TV. I wish we had chosed to watch the movie in bed instead, but I thought it would be better on the bigger TV. None the less, the hotel was just wonderful.	
Apr 7 2009 	Spamtastic!	My first time in NY, I decided to stay at the Doubletree! The location is right in the middle of everything. Walking distance to anything you need, while in NY. The theatres are only a few blocks. The rooms were not small. I booked a king bed, and they are not lying when they call them &quot;dream beds&quot; I don't even sleep that good at home, like I did there! The lights are bright, but they have black out curtains, barely hear any kind of street noice. There are two TV's, a mini-bar, refreshment center (micro, fridge, coffee maker) and a safe. The coffee is wolf-gang puck! I couldn't drink enough of it. Also has tea, cups, ice bins (ice machine on the same floor) and mini bottles of shampoo, body lotion, facial scrub (room service gives you more each day) The towels are plush, unlike other reviews, the water pressure is awesome (did not turn hot and cold on me) All and all, it's a simple hotel for the busy life of NY. If you like fancy, then I don't recommend it, but if you like to kick your shoes off and feel at home, then doubletree is perfect!	
Apr 2 2009 	If you're in the city for theatre...cannot beat the location	This was my first time at the Doubletree Suites Times Square in NYC. To compare, I've stayed at the Waldorf, Plaza, Sheraton midtown/7th (forget which one...they're basically interchangeable), Marriott NE side, Marriott Marquis, some I forget...and even the Milford Plaza! I was in town for just 2 days-mostly shopping and theatre. I don't really like the Times Square area due to the crowds, but I wanted to be able to walk to all my theatres because I hate to try to find a cab after, especially if it's raining. So...Doubletree had a FABULOUS rate at $164. I opted for a $179 rate for a similar room, but with a view and on a higher floor. Turns out this was a waste as the view was nothing to speak of. All the hotels were offering great deals during this time. But Doubletree offered the rate, location, AND a 2 bedroom suite. I couldn't say no.I arrived early in the day and my room wasn't ready. I am a travel agent so I checked the day before to see if they were full, knowing I'd arrive early, and they weren't. My assumption is that they wanted to keep their guests on as few floors as possible, for housekeeping, safety, elevator use, and the fact that they were renovating. No worries. I stopped back and still no room. That's OK, still early. By early afternoon I was exhausted so I checked again, no room. I went to the restaurant for tea, but was told &quot;we'll have a server bring some out to you&quot;. The idea was to find a nice comfy place to sit and relax while I waited on my room. I was pretty offended and went to my old standby, the Marriott Marquis for tea instead. The Doubletree is on the corner of 7th, 47th, and Broadway..just at the corner of the new TKTS location. Bold splashy sign, but tiny entrance with doorman and security. Heated lights in the overhang above the entrance are a nice touch. Inside...you're usually asked to show your room key in the evening. Elevators up to 3rd floor are quick - you never wait more than a few seconds.The lobby is small, with a few seats, check in desk, bar (never open when I was in the lobby...which was a lot...don't know if it's closed for the renovation or ?), BUSY bellmen (mostly storing people's luggage for their room wait or for the day after check out), and a concierge desk.Restaurant is on another floor, with tasteless blood red walls in the hallway...which reminded me of The Shining . I'd heard poor reviews of the restaurant. The tea incident didn't help. Then we ordered room service one time and it sealed the deal. Bad. Really bad. If we weren't RAVENOUS...I'd say definitely inedible. Check in was quick and I was offered the required Doubletree cookie...which I declined. My daughter was joining me later that evening, and they said &quot;only one of you right now&quot;...and were only giving me one anyway so I didn't want her to not have one so I said no. They told me earlier I had a package with an amenity and they'd give me a coupon when my room was ready. I never got that either, and forgot to ask again.We had a room on the 41st floor facing...ummm...I have no idea. But you could see the river from the window in the hall near the elevators. The room was huge. HUGE! Living room with a pull out sofa (the cushions on the sofa are a hot mess...you can't even sit on the sofa without them slipping off), desk and chair, another chair, TV on a huge credenza that housed a mini bar. In this same room was a long kitchen bar with a sink, coffee maker with Wolfgang Puck coffee (we brought our own tea so I can't comment on the taste of the coffee), fridge...probably a microwave but I didn't see one. The fridge was cold too! Imagine. Those little fridges never seem to keep drinks cold. The bedroom had 2 double/queen (?) beds and the bedding was very comfortable. Tons of pillows. A large cabinet with an ironing board and iron, probably a TV, I never looked. The bathroom was very nice. Tub. Toilet. But a long (marble?) vanity with two sinks, hairdryer. The trash cans were divided into recyclable and rubbish sides. The windows in the rooms opened. The temperature control was easy and the room cooled/heated quickly when asked. There were a lot of families at the hotel, very few business people. The size of the rooms and location are, of course, the reason. But there is a 24 hour business center and I think 24 hour workout room. We didn't have time to visit these. Overall: Front desk personnel were adequate, lobby and bellmen were very nice, rude service waiter was extremely rude AND the food was bad, location great, room great, housekeeping was excellent!. It happened to be a great deal for this trip. But I'd definitely pay a lot more for the hotel, if I wanted to be in this area. BUT...I'm ALWAYS needing supper after theatre and, as I travel with my daughter, don't always like to stay out late to do that. We partake of a lot of room service breakfasts and suppers. So I probably wouldn't select the hotel again mostly due to that reason (as well as a couple of gruff staffers...I'm really big on service...I know this is not a price point where one can expect much...but good service is free). Still...all in all...a perfectly adequate hotel depending on your standards for these things. The room and location are fabulous.	
Mar 26 2009 	Great location; comfortable for a family	My family of five (2 adults plus 3 children) spent 4 nights at the Doubletree Guest Suites. You can't beat the location if you are sightseeing in Manhattan. We saw a couple of Broadway shows, and I was so glad that our hotel room was only a short walk away when we got out of the show late at night. The kids loved the impressive view of Times Square from our 10th floor room. We had a suite with King bed in a bedroom, and double sofa bed in a small living room area. The sofa bed wasn't (they never are) but the King bed was more comfortable than average. We had adequate space and were comfortable in the room. The front desk and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. There was a small mistake on the bill and the front desk clerk cleared it up immediately. Warm chocolate chip cookies upon check in and check out! I would definitely stay here again.	
Mar 25 2009 	Great Location if you want to be in the madness!	Stayed here for 4 nights with the husband on our first trip to NYC. Check-in was quick and we were upgraded to a corner room overlooking times square on the 28th floor. The room was great and we were pleased we paid a bit more to stay in a hotel with suites as it was good to relax on the sofa at the end of a tiring day seeing the sights. Hotel is in great location if you want to be in the thick of things and right opposite the half price theatre ticket booth (which now takes credit cards). We were in easy walking distance of all the main broadway shows, 5th av., central park, empire state and Madison square garden etc. Loads of eating options close by, but the dismal exchange rate makes everything expensive at the moment. The only negative we had was the concierge-not amazingly helpful and quite dismissive despite there being no-one at the desk behind us. A minor issue though and we would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends.P.S. Avenue Q is fantastic!	
Mar 21 2009 	Excellent Service	Stayed here for my second trip to NY.The check in was quick &amp; simple,efficient whilst still friendly.At our last hotel it was slow,indifferent &amp; we had to change room,so a big plus!Whilst there one of us was ill &amp; we asked for the cleaning staff NOT to disturb our companion confined to bed.What impressed us was that they knew the room hadn't been cleaned &amp; rang in the evening to see if we would like it doing then.Also,the concierge confirmed our flights for us &amp; checked us in...a welcome load off our minds when trying to do this from abroad.At all times staff were attentive,helpful,smiley...without being insincere sounding.What with this,the location &amp; quietness of the rooms,I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.Only slight niggle is that from the British perspective,a kettle,not a percolator &amp; some crockery would've been nice,We like our tea!!But this is the fault which made the whole stay perfect...very minor!!	
Mar 18 2009	Very average hotel fantastic service	My mom and I stayed her for an extended weekend trip to NYC. We are regularly in NYC and have stayed at many hotels in the theater district and around Times Square. This hotel is extremely average in all categories, except for service. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a conference suite by a very friendly gentleman at the desk. All the staff was incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome in their hotel. The room itself was very dated in decor, though they have upgraded the beds. The bathroom was large though, and the neutrogena ammenties were replaced every day. The windows offered a panoramic view of Times Square, and you could shut the lights out with the shades at night. We had a drink in the lobby bar one night -- the drinks were good, but very pricey. $14 per drink is a little steep, even for New York. The lobby bar is beautiful, but as a previous poster mentioned, it's not private or secluded -- it's right in the middle of the check in/out madness and next to the elevators. The elevators were faster than I expected, and we rarely had to wait very long for an elevator, even though we were on one of the higher floors. The wi-fi was TERRIBLE while we were there. It faded in and out, and often didn't work at all during half of the stay. At $12.95/day, I expected better. Overall, it's a pleasant enough stay at the right price, but had I paid the $3000 they were asking for New Year's Eve 2008, I would have been severely disappointed. However, it is not one of my favourite hotels in the area, and I don't know that I would return. The hotel is rather bland.	
Mar 16 2009 	Best hotel in times square	I stayed in this hotel march 3rd till march 6th 2009 I had a corner times square view room and have to say it was a great room with an amazing view.. The room was a good size with a living room a separate bedroom and bathroom it was very clean and bed was very comfy. Its in a great area right in Times square lots of food places and shops close by I would stay here again...	
Mar 10 2009 	Perfect for a Theater Stay	I was so pleasantly surprised by this property and will stay there again. Quite simply:Pros: Great room. I had a double suite on the 28th floor. You pay a little extra for this room, but it is totally worth it. Very up to date furnishings. Both rooms, the living and bedroom were large. The room was completely quiet and had a great heating cooling system. The bed as others have said was great. Enough plush towels and clean. There is a mini bar, ice machines on the floor and two TV's which came in handy with my teenager in tow. I have no complaints.The service was very pleasant from the Front Desk to the security at the entrance. No one is allowed to just wander into the hotel from the street. You must show your room key to security on the street level and then take an elevator to the lobby where the room elevators are found. The security guard was very helpful when I asked him how to get to the subway- I honestly didn't expect him to be so nice. Room service was prompt.The location was outstanding - right across from the discount Broadway ticket booth and only a few blocks from just about every theater, quite a few subway lines, and some nice restaurants on 8 and 9th Avenues(Hell's Kitchen) for pre-theater dinners. They have a concierge at the front desk from 8 am on. I wish I had known right away because I believe you can also purchase show tickets at her desk. Instead I had my husband order them from home on-line and could not pick up the tickets until 1/2 hour before the show at the theater. There is wi-fi in the room that worked with our i-touch.Cons: Nothing that would prevent me from staying here again. The lobby is nothing to speak of and didn't seem to have any windows. So, it is not the place to make a splash if meeting someone. The outside marquee is a little over done for my taste, but when I was looking for the hotel after a long walk, it was a welcome site. Room service charges were a little overdone. This is not a &quot;trendy&quot; hotel so if that is your goal, don't stay here. This is vanilla ice cream.	
Mar 6 2009 	Great location for New Years party- if that is what you are there for!	Stayed here many times. We got a very small room this time - but the view of Times Square was incredible. We looked right down to the stage. But, get ready. It is crazy - tons of security to get through to get pass baracades. After 5 pm you had to show a special badge to even get back to the hotel. Once you go out of the area you can't get back in if you are not staying within the cooridor. Many people had to stand for 6- 7 hours. Saw lots of them with little kids - which was crazy. - so if you are going to watch the ball drop - the Doubletree is a great hotel and good value considering the rates at that time in the city.	
Mar 5 2009 	great value for Times Square location!	This was my second stay at Doubletree. Check-in went smoothly and I had a king bed suite on the 31st floor. Only no looking down upon Times square this time. My $169 seniors rate only gave me a side view, but that's OK. The room was clean as was the bath and the bed was maybe the most comfortable I've ever experienced. The sitting room TV was a good size wide-screen model. What I don't like though is the menu you have to navigate to get to the TV channels. It would be nice to be able to immediately choose TV when the set comes on, but this is a minor quibble. I had asked for extra coffee when I made my reservation. And there was plenty awaiting me. Probably 10 extra coffee packets and creamers. Wireless Internet access, unlike last time, worked properly and I had a decent connection every time. (On my prior visit I was on the 17th floor and had to get a gadget from the front desk to get any connection at all.) The people at the concierge desk were always helpful and willing to answer questions. When I told the lady I liked British fare, she recommended a place just around the corner that served Cottage Pie and such. I tried the Bangers and Mash dish (sausages and mashed potatoes) and while it was tasty, the sausages were American, meaning totally wrong flavor. Another day I found a wonderful steak place that was also just around the corner. You were served cafeteria style, and got to watch your steak being broiled over an open flame. The meal was very good and was not too expensive.I found myself stuck in New York by a major snowstorm that hit just before the day I was to fly home. The reservations desk quickly extended my stay by a day , even moving a new reservation to a different room so I would not have to change rooms. All in all, I had a great stay and would book at Doubletree again if I could get a good rate.	
Mar 5 2009	Birthday Trip To NYC - Great Location	This hotel is in a great location . After months of looking and having stayed in DBT and Hiltons before I chose this hotel to spend my 65th Birthday with my family. As soon as the booking was made via telephone from UK. The problems started. Wrong charges, wrong allocation of people to rooms. Overchaging of $135. It took lots of emails and calls to US to sort out. So on my arrival I was already wary of what could happen. Then I met Doris on the Frount Desk who was the most patronising person in that role that i have ever met. After lots of sorting out we finally moved rooms the next day and thias was down to Dobrina Carrara AFO Manager showing Customer Care and skills that you would execpt from a chain such as Hilton.The rooms are large and very clean. Beds were bliss, although my daughter had to sleep on sofabed for 5 nights. Breakfast in Gingers was excellent and this was given FOC because of all the problems. All other staff that we came in contact with were very nice.I just wished when boking out that we had had Daniel to book us in. We wre still owed $79 and he sorted that out. He knew his job and more.I would go back if just a couple.	
Mar 3 2009 	Clean Modern Rooms Nice Stay	Stayed 2 nights on a Hotwire deal and paid $150pn inc. Check-in painless, suite on 38th floor was nicely refurbished, comfortable sofa bed, nice to have the 2 rooms, good size bathroom, we were expecting 2 double beds but they were just oversized singles (although very comfortable) so we utilised the sofa as well. Great location. As per other reports, we had the same problem with the wireless internet but persisted and it finally worked. I would recommend at the sort of price we paid but wouldn't want to pay rack rate.	
Mar 3 2009 	Great Spot For First Time Visit	Stayed 18th Feb - 22 nd Feb . First time in New York , 5 of us , my wife and I plus our 3 sons 20,18,10 . Very central easy walking distance to Central Park , 5th Avenue , Rockerfeller , Macys , Empire State etc . A few steps to the metro for longer trips . Great cookies on arrival and also given to us several other times through our stay , Staff very good and helpful . As it was our sons 18th they upgraded us to the top (43rd ) floor with a great skyline view. Very nice . Good tea/coffee making in room . Microwave and Fridge but no plates /cutlery etc . Breakfast expensive at $25 but we went to the Edison Hotel cafe down the street opposite and paid approx $4-$6 per person , excellent value . Also have a flight confirmation/check in machine in the lobby to check in online and print boarding cards which we did for our return journey with British Airways , I think most other airlines are also included . Had a great stay and would visit again	
Feb 28 2009 	Great for tourists and business travelers	I have been pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Having stayed at the Hilton Las Vegas last week, this is so much better. The room is big enough for a family and confortable enough for the business traveler. I logged right on my laptop without any internet issues at all. Bathroom amenities include a whole selection of Neutragena products! The shower/toilet area is a bit small, but the fabulous room location and views make it a non-issue. Highly recommended.	
Feb 28 2009 	This was a gift for the price	I don't think i will ever find this kind of rate in this hotel ever again, we paid a AAA rate of $162.15 and you are right on Times Square! I thought that maybe it was near Times Square but you are right in front of the big screen tv's!! Hotel was excellent, check in around 4:30pm was quick and smooth. The front desk clerk tells you were everything is, the welcome cookies were an awesome detail and they tasted really good. The bar is right in front of the front desk (3rd floor) , liked the chandeliers, they were sort of different. We had the 14th floor facing the side but for the price i could see too much! I imagine that those facing Times Square will probaby cost an arm and a leg...Our room was one king bed and you also have the small living room as you walk in with a sofa bed, desk, tv, a wet bar which under it has a small fridge, a small microwave and a safe. Where the tv was there's one of those expensive snacks and bottles of water that you don't touch unless you really need or have to. The bathroom is nice and very spacious. Room was very nice, clean and comfortable, you have few lamps and another tv. Two entrances to the bathroom, one thru the room and another one thru the living room. Every floor has an ice maker which we used, we always bring sodas and snacks especially when you have kids but on this trip they weren't with us. Overall experience was outstanding. Ended up going to eat to a Cuban restaurant (Havana Central) that was awesome!!! It was just around the corner and it was referred by one of the valet guys when we asked for a Spanish restaurant. There's also a comedy club right next to the restaurant and around the corner from the hotel. Parking was $35.00 plus tip since the car gets parked for you there so paying for valet at the hotel is not necessary if you don't mind walking 2 minutes to the parking garage (that's where they park them anyway) Internet is $9.95 in your room but at the hotel lobby is free, they disconnected my internet before check out time so i had to use it at the lobby. I would recommend the hotel any time and feel welcome to bring kids the only thing is that there is not pool but having Times Square in front of you and couple of tv's i don't think it's so necessary. You could still hear the sirens from the city but not biggie cause i was exhausted when i went to bed. Bed and pillows were sooo nice and comfortable!!!	
Feb 27 2009 	Great for families	We stayed here in June 2008. Two couples and two young kids (2 yo &amp; 9 month old) shared one room and it worked out great. The room was clean and plenty large enough for all of us to feel comfortable. There was an entrance to the bathroom from both the living room and the bedroom which was nice b/c the other couple was up earlier than us and didn't have to disturb us to get into the bathroom.We are not huge fans of the Times Square and prefer a less &quot;touristy&quot; New York experience, but with kids, you can't beat it. It has two separate rooms in the suite, with a door between. And there is plenty to do right outside your door.	
Feb 24 2009 	decent hotel experience	I stayed at the Doubletree hotel for a week in february. In general it is a decent place to stay, the room was pretty big ( bedroom + living room), clean, the bathroom also quite big. We booked a room on the 39th floor so the view was also pretty ok. The location was perfect. The only weak point was the service, we have booked a room with the internet, which didn't work at all during the entire week, we were always told to go down to the lobby to use the free wireless. It was pretty disappointing because we payed for the internet already...After many discussions we were offered breakfast instead which was a nice but pretty late gesture though. Also the concierge was a bit weird, we wanted to make reservations in a restaurant and were told to call the restaurant ourselves, after some discussions the concierge allegedly called the restaurant and booked a table but when we showed up at the restaurant they did not have any reservation under our name...(this being a concierge guy...the lady however was really helpful and adorable) Overall it was a good stay, which could have been even better with some minor adjustments. I would recommend the hotel for a NYC trip because the location is just outstanding!	
Feb 20 2009 	amazing location amazing staff amazing hotel!	We recently took my daughter and her friend on a weekend trip to Time Square to celebrate her 16th birthday. It was something she always dreamed of, and the trip was everything we imagined. We drove to New York from Virginia, and it was a nice drive. We never experienced any major traffic issues until we got closer to Time Square but even then it wasn't that bad. (i would do it again) Upon pulling in front of the hotel we were truely welcomed by Vinny. He was so helpful and funny, which made the stress of the traffic not noticeable. He assisted unloading our bags out of the car, and escorted us to the front desk. He was very helpful in explaining everything about the hotel. We did take advantage of the Valet parking, and it was well worth the money. Upon getting checked in, we were helped to our room by a bell boy. We had originally had reserved the queen suite, but at check in was upgraded to the king suite at no additional charge. The room was on the 17th floor and was amazing, although we had a side view from the window it was beautiful. The bed was the most comfortable bed ever!! The teenagers slept on the sofa bed, but slept like angels. The rooms are very comfortable, spacious, and well taken care of. Not only is this a beautiful hotel, it was affordable, and in a great location. Outside your doorway you will find the heart of Time Square, but yet at night you never hear any of the city sounds, and will sleep like a baby. I would recommend taking the bus tour, worth the money to see all of the sites of New York. For someone who has never traveled far from my hometown this was a big adventure. And i have to say it was well worth all the memories we experienced. I look forward to planning another trip to New York and plan on staying at Doubletree Time Square again! Also, dont forget the delicious cookies!	
Jan 29 2009 	Big Clean Excellent for Price	Travelling to NYC with 3 kids and wife in jan/2009. Excellent price to hold 5 people in the room. The room was big (above average for NYC), quiet (we stayed at 6th floor, the lowest one) and clean. It is located in front of the ticket booth in Times Square. If you are in NYC for shows or shopping, this is perfect. Just expect to see a lot of people as you step out of the hotel.The free internet service is available only at the lobby.	
Jan 27 2009 	Great Location Great Staff	We just returned from a four day mini vacation at the Doutbletree Suites, Times Square. Good this hotel through company website. Got a great rate. Stayed on the 15th floor very quite. The kids 11 and 9 were greeted by warm cookies. The front desk staff was excellent some of best most helpful customer service I have experienced at a hotel in a long time. The doorman was always pleasant and helpful. This was a two room suite, large bathroom great comfortable beds. TV in living area and one in the bedroom area. The engineering staff was great, the housekeeping staff was great, room cleaned very well every day. They even made sure I had extra coffee. The safe was a nice addition to the room (no charge) We did not eat at the hotel or in Times Square 2 block away at 8th and 9th Ave. had many excellent well priced non chain type places to eat. Close to everything we need to do. The Tour Bus, Subway, Grand Central Station, Rockerfeller Center, TKTS booth right across the street. We have no complaints at all about this hotel. We will return the next time we are in NYC! A great place to stay for families.	
Jan 24 2009 	Major problem with lack of internet access in rooms	Nice hotel but serious disadvantage was wireless that did not work in the rooms. They disabled the internet connections in the room and yet the wireless network was terrible. It took over 10 minutes just to pull up one page in the rooms. I was on the phone with the help desk extensively but still no improvement even after they reset the wireless on the floor. We had two computers and both had the same problem. We finally went down to the business center and were able to access the internet. However, we stayed for several days and needed the internet connection in our room. We found several business people in the business center complaining about the problems with wireless access in their room. They should either put the internet connection lines back in the rooms or fix their wireless network. Otherwise, this hotel does not work for anyone needing internet access.	
Jan 22 2009 	Excellent Trip	Rooms are very nicely decorated and very clean and large. Actually, this is 2 rooms since this is a suite. Bathroom is large and had entry from both rooms. Flat screen TV's in both rooms. Fridge and microwave in sitting room. Wolfgang Puck coffee maker in room. Although in Times Square, right in the middle of everything, we found the rooms to be very quiet. Rates are really good for NYC.The people that worked there were very pleasant. We went to a play on Broadway and only had to walk 2 blocks. Never used the restaurant in the hotel but we used the gym which was also very clean and up to date.We were very comfortable there and would go back again.	
Jan 21 2009 	Good experience	We stayed at the Doubletree Times Square from January 17-19 (MLK weekend). Our first confusion was finding out where to park. We called the hotel from the car and ended up valeting right in front of the hotel on Broadway. When we checked out, we went and got our car from the lot on 47th ourselves and saved $10 per night in parking charges. Check in was a breeze, very personable (especially for NYC!). We had a king premium room on the 39th floor for only $186 per night (AAA through the hotel website - they did not check my card). We loved the location, though be warned it is right in the heart of Times Square which, on the weekends, is a bit crazy! The room was great - plenty of room, comfortable beds, including the pull out. We could not figure out how to get the small refrigerator to work, but everything else was in good shape - obviously recently renovated. There are 2 flat screen TVs. Note that the kitchenette (really just a mini-fridge and microwave) has no utensils or plates, so pick up your own.	
Jan 19 2009 	Good value quality hotel	As per many trip reports we found this hotel very adequate. We drove in to NYC and drove up to the door to be greeted by the valet, dropped our cases off before dropping the car off down a few blocks.The reception is a bit odd in terms of layout and we found check in very slow, although staff were pleasant and helpful. The cookies were very nice on arrival.We were on the 24th floor and enjoyed comp wifi access. The suites were large with flatscreens, decent size lounge. The rooms were clean and functional. Shower not very powerful.Didnt eat in the hotel but had a look in, didnt look very glamoros with no windows and musical theme, cannot comment on the standard of food.Seems they are renovating on the 3rd floor near the business suite. We printed from the room and went to the suite but it was very clear how to pull the print job. However, we called the hotline from within the business suite and they assisted straight away.Security on the door checked our key cards after a certain time at night. They were also very helpful calling cabs.On the whole I would recommend this hotel for a first time visitor, a fantastic location to walk to most sights.	
Jan 17 2009 	Fantastic	We stayed at the Doubletree hotel in Times Square for my boyfriends 21st birthday and it is FANTASTIC!!!! the location is out of the world and the rooms of the hotel are gorgeous the beds are HUGE!!!! the bath room has to two doors into it, it is that big one into the lounge area and 1 into the bedroom. It really is great hotel with a superb location, and the view from the room is great looking over Times square at night with all the lights on really is something!We went up the Empire State Building which was an experience took us 3 and half hours to get up but it something you have got to do, you are there so you have got to go up it really is fantastic!The shopping on 5th Avenue is great, everything is just overtop and bloomingdales the sweets and chocolate floor in their is just like wow oh my gosh! I would DEFO recommend this hotel you cant beat the location it is just fantastic!!!!!!!	
Jan 14 2009 	Good location	Stayed on the 41st floor and it was very quiet. Could not hear the street noise at all.Likes:Complimentary internet 'cos of Gold Hilton Honors MembershipLarge room with sofa bedMini fridge and microwaveWarm cookies every eveningNear subway (47 St Subway - N,R,W line)Right in the heart of Times Square!Dislikes:Lousy breakfast policy - all members in the room should get the free breakfast, especially if we are Gold Hilton Honors Members. How silly if there are 4 members in the room and only 2 get the free breakfasts?!? I think Doubletree need to rethink their breakfast policy.Lousy service in the restaurant - understaffed	
Jan 8 2009 	Absolute bargain	Whether you like this hotel or not I guess depends on how much you pay. We got an upper floor one bedroom suite for just over $200 and I have to say it was an absolute bargain. It's a great location, right in Times Square where the subway lines all interconnect so you can go anywhere from outside the door. Our suite on the 29th floor overlooked the side street and though we could see some of the lights of Times Square it was incredibly quiet. No street noise at all. The bell boys in the street level lobby were really helpful. We got three seriously yummy warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in. The room was great for us and our two kids (aged 4 and 2) - the lounge had a pull-out sofa and the hotel supplied a cot (crib) for the little one. The bathroom was functional rather than glamorous and the shower was more of a drip than a downpour, but there was plenty of counter space and nice neutrogena toiletries. There was a door into the bathroom from both the bedroom and the lounge. Both rooms had flat screen TVs and there were real coathangers with hooks in the wardrobe. The bed was big and comfy with lots of pillows. When we checked out with our vast quantities of luggage the bell boys were helpful in getting us an oversize taxi. Quite frankly at the price we paid, what's not to like?	
Jan 6 2009	Great location very nice hotel post-remodel	Ive stayed at this hotel a few times for business and leisure and generally keep coming back for 1) the location and 2) the reasonably priced rates. Its a good combination for doing tourist (or in my case, business) activities and generally the rates are in the $200-$250 per room/night range which is quite reasonable given that every room is a suite. I am a Hilton Diamond member so get free breakfast and an upgrade of sorts, which are welcomed perks. Its nice that the lobby is above the ground floor as you dont need to worry about it being too crowded. Overall Id recommend it as my hotel of choice in the Times Square area, especially if traveling with 3-4 friends or family members, due the extra space.	
Jan 6 2009 	Nice Suite and Great Service	A suite was one of our requirements. This fits the bill. Our hours aren't always the same so it was a plus to be able to shut the bedroom door and watch TV without waking my wife.The service from everyone we encountered was very good. Hanna at the restaurant, Alex at the bar, AJ at the concierge desk, all the people at the reception desk, the maid for our room, and the two maintenance men that adjusted the temperature on our fridge were all outstanding.No request went unanswered! No problem ignored.We were there Dec 17-22, '08 to celebrate our 38th anniversary and just booked June 14-20, '09 to celebrate my wife's birthday.	
Jan 6 2009	Great Hotel for Family Visit--Book A Conference Suite	We stayed at the Doubletree Times Square starting new years day and had a great time.We have a family of 6 (4 kids) and had no problem fitting into the conference suite (bring sleeping bags for more than 2 kids.) There are two rooms and a large conference table that seats 6. It is a true suite since there is a door to the bedroom with a separate door from bedroom into the bathroom. We were on the 38th floor with an amazing view of Times Square. At $220/night it was a great deal for NYC. One night we just had 6 guests and takeout and ate in the suite at the conference table.I agree with other reviewers that the lobby is less than desirable, but who cares? Just outside the door are dozens of restaurants, bars, etc. that would charge less anyway for a drink. The location, while great is a nightmare if you arrive by car. Don't drive if you can avoid it, and if you do, don't arrive at night when people are going to the theaters. It took almost a hour to travel the last few blocks to the hotel. Also avoid Bond 45 restaurant on 45th Street unless you want a very mediocre meal for $$$$.	
Jan 3 2009	Misleading	We stayed at the doubletree from Dec. 26th - Jan.2 and it was not what we were expecting at all... First off we booked this stay on these specific dates because that's what date their website claimed there new lobby would finally be finished. Not only was it not finished, but the carpet was totally tore up and there was very loud drilling going on for the first 3 days we were there. It honestly looked like a construction zone. Not to mention that even when it does get finished its a VERY small lobby and you often find yourself trying to fight through people to get to the elevator. 2 out of the 3 times i ordered room service it was cold and didn't taste good at all. The one good thing i had was an outstanding pizza that might have been top 5 I've ever had in my life.Oh and if you want any soda's or anything like that you have to get them from the mini-bar because the entire hotel does not have 1 vending machine! You heard me right, not one! One can of coke costs $3.75, and if you don't feel like fighting the thousands of people on times square to get a coke then the mini-bar is your only option... Also the maid service had to be reminded dailey that the mini-bar needed re-stocked otherwise they didn't do it. Very annoying...The shower heads are pathetic. A normal shower that would usually take me 10 minuets took me at least 25. And its goes from boiling hot to ice cold without even adjusting the temperature.There were other little things here and there that happened to make me write this poor review but ill just leave it at what i wrote.One amazing thing about the hotel though is the beds!! I have never slept so good in my life. In Fact i slept so good on this bed i ordered one the day i got home from doubletree's website where you can purchase all beds and furniture the hotel uses.http://www.doubletreeathome.com/The security guard Brian downstairs was one of the nicest guy's you will ever meet. We would have been completely lost without him and we even wrote a letter to management about what a great job he did.	
Jan 1 2009 	OK stay	We just returned after a 5 night stay at Doubletree Times Square.We found that the website phots are misleading. The lobby looks absolutely nothing like the pics. Albeit they were working in the lobby but I still don't see it looking anything like the pics posted. We arrived early and was allowed to check-in around 12:00. When we asked for a room with a view we were told they didn't exist for the double rooms. I've since found that to be untrue.The furnishings in the rooms were not the greatest for the amount we paid per night. $657.00.I have stayed in much smaller and less clean places in NYC but would stay in the MIlford Plaza over the Doubletree next time.It's just as nice and less $ if you don't mind not being right on the square.I also didn't know anything about breakfast coupons until I read an eariler post. As a Hilton member, I feel I should have been told this. The cost at $25.00 per breakfast became alot of $ for 4 people.We go to NYC every Dec. but am not so sure I'll stay here again. The location is awesome though. I couldn't ask for a better one.Also, Shannon, one of the conceirge staff, as exceptionally friendly and helpful.	
Jan 1 2009 	Great suite right in the heart of Times Square	Spent a hectic 36 hours sightseeing in New York with the family whilst visiting the States and used the Guest Suites as a base for our Big Apple stay.We hade one suite with two rooms which was plenty for the five of us. Didn't use many of the hotel facilities and lobby was being refurbished whilst we were there but the rooms were good, great comfy beds and the location in Times Square was fantastic.Took in Central Park, Bloomingdales, FAO Schwartz, The Rockefeller (better views than Empire State), a Knicks game, Staten Island ferry, Wall Street, Century 21 etc whilst there - all with a good nights sleep at the guest suites.Don't miss the hot cookie on arrival!	
Jan 1 2009 	Unbelievable room in an unbelievable location!	My wife and I were booked into a room at this hotel by our cousin, for one night the Saturday before Christmas. What a room! It was a suite with an incredible view out the window, looking down onto TImes Square. The staff was friendly, efficient and top-notch, which was especially appreciated because we arrived late in the day and the lobby was under construction (in the midst of a huge renovation), conditions that usually lead to a long wait in line and abrupt service. In this case, however, everything was perfect.	
Dec 31 2008 	Doubletree Times Square Great Location	I've stayed here twicw with my wife. The location is perfect for shows, walking distance to attractions, etc.	
Dec 31 2008 	A Great Place to Stay	Our family of 5 stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square November 21st - 25th and loved it. The room accomodated the 5 of us perfectly, and we loved the location. Our kids were visiting New York for the first time and the Times Square location really wowed them. We liked the central location and walked most everywhere. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. The rooms were suprisingly quiet. Would highly recommend staying here, we felt like it was a good value for the money.	
Dec 29 2008 	Perfect location	Just returned from a one night stay at the Doubletree to see a show and NYC at Christmas. We were able to check in early and given a room that overlooked the M&amp;Ms store, my son's favorite place. We were a 15 minute walk to everything we wanted to do. Yes, the crowds are hard to navigate when you exit the hotel, especially when the theaters are starting and letting out, but that's the fun of Times Square, you just go with the flow! The lobby construction looks almost to be done, but it wasn't an inconvenience at all. The rooms are huge compared to NYC standards, separate bedroom, living room, big bathroom and wet bar in the living room. We will be staying at this hotel whenever we return, it's great for families. Also, if you are traveling with children, Mars 2112 is a really fun place to go to dinner. The food is so, so but the whole experience is &quot;out of this world.&quot;	
Dec 28 2008 	This was a great birthday Treat!	I booked this through &quot;cheaptickets.com&quot;. What a perfect location! I was in NYC to celebrate my birthday with friends (nov 14). I booked it the day before my birthday for less than $200 including tax!It faced the lights of Times Square which made me so happy I booked there. I really felt like I was in the middle of it all when I looked out the window. The room was HUGE for NY. Two rooms, one queen bed, one pullout couch and a bathroom which was bigger than the one I have at home!2 TV s and a mini-bar.Wow, what a good deal for the money.Granted it is not a 5-star hotel, but I really considered this a &quot;score&quot; for the money - and it was just a couple blocks from Winter Garden theater where I saw Mama Mia! Caroline's comedy club was next to the theater so I had a really nice birthday.Having the weather be 60 degrees was a bonus, but I can't guarantee that for you.I can say the hotel was great - also allowed late check-out.	
Dec 25 2008 	Loved the Doubletree Times Square	I booked a Hilton Honors stay at the Doubletree Times Square for Dec 13-17 and was pleasantly surprised! After reading some reviews on check in and potential rude employees I was a little concerned. No need to worry and this place is in the middle of everything you need to get to. Having never been to New York we found it very easy to navigate to our broadway shows and pick up the tour bus across the street.Also if you are an Hilton Honors member you receive 2 breakfast copupons for each night of your stay. At $25 per breakfast that definitely helps out. If we visit New York again I wouldn't hesitate to book at this Doubletree again.	
Dec 21 2008 	Great Choice	We stayed at the hotel from Dec 12-14 using Hilton Honors points. We arrived from Los Angeles at 7 AM and were very pleasantly surprised when they allowed us to check in early. We were given room 1202 which faced Times Square. We were very happy to get a room facing all the lights and sights of Broadway right beneath us.There were 3 of us staying so it really came in handy to have the suite with the family room and the pull out sofa. The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable and I was told that the sofabed was also comfortable. We also liked having a microwave and a fridge in the room for drinks and leftovers.We were somewhat low in the hotel on the 12th floor since I believe the hotel has 40+ floors but the noise below was manageable. We didn't have any problems sleeping. The heater in the room wasn't the type to set by degree and was tricky to find a medium between warm enough and too hot but once we did it was fine. The location of the hotel is the main reason why we chose this hotel and we were not disappointed. It is right across from the TKTS center and we used it one afternoon to get tickets. We saw a couple Brodway shows and it only took 5 minutes to walk to either of them because of the centralized location. We spent the remainder of our trip at a hotel a few blocks east and missed the location at Times Square. There is a subway entrance right beneath the hotel that we took downtown and the location is great because there is so much within walking distance including Rockefeller Center, Central Park, 5th Ave, and more. I was worried about the hotel lobby being renovated before the trip but it was no problem at all. You need to take an elevator from the ground floor to the lobby on the 3rd floor but it was no problem at all and added an extra sense of security. Overall we really enjoyed this hotel and location and when we come back to NYC we will stay here again. It's a great place.	
Dec 21 2008 	Perfect Times Square location	We are just finishing a one night stay at this hotel, which is the ultimate central location if you are visiting Times Square and the theatre distric. Hotels are booked and rates are up in this week before Christmas, but we scored a suite with two queen beds and a big pullout sofa in the living room for $332 including all taxes etc. The accomodations are much bigger, better and more comfortable than anything we have experienced in NYC in that price range. We would return here in a minute!	
Dec 17 2008 	Great location and everything else!	Although I prefer more exclusive properties, we decided to save a bit and go with Doubletree suite. We booked with Expedia and, upon arrival, got a free upgrade which was lovely. Location is simply great! Great, great, great! We walked all over the place but it was quite cold so often hurried back to relax and warm up. The room was very clean although the rest of the hotel was not kept as good but I do not expect that in such a huge place. Everything was in order in our room and the bed was perfect. Will probably stay there again - I am just too afraid of all those tiny rooms everyone is talking about when talking about NY hotels.	
Dec 15 2008 	Very pleased with Doubletree!	My wife and I stayed two nights in December and were very pleased with the entire stay. I asked for a high, quiet room and was booked on the 41st floor at the end of the hall-perfect! The rooms are true two room suites and are very clean. Could be considered slightly dated, but not enough to be a concern-especially at the price.This hotel is in an ideal location for Times Square and the lower part of mid-town. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and seemed interested in our satisfaction. We would definitely return.By the way, the lobby renovation was not bothersome in the least.	
Dec 10 2008 	Great location that's about it	The location is the best thing this property has to offer. We were aware of the lobby renovation prior to arrival so we expected that, not a big deal. We preordered a pack and play for the baby, when we checked in they assured us it was already in the room. When we got to the room (1:00 PM) it was not there. We called down they said they would bring it right up. By 5 Pm we still had not received it, called down to the front desk they told us it would be right up. We stopped by the front desk at 7PM because we still had not gotten it, they said it would be sent right up. At 9PM I went back down to the front desk and and told them we preordered it had been told several times it would be right up and that currently we had a 4 month old baby sleeping on the floor. Not once did anyone say they were sorry we had not received it. It was delivered about 5 minutes later by a very pissed employee. Every time we left the room and came back the keys did not work. Every single time. Which meant we had to go back down stairs to the front desk and wait in line to get new keys. We did not encounter one employee who smiled, not one. For the price we paid for our hotel room $509.00 plus tax fro 2 nights.)you would think they would be more accommodating.	
Dec 6 2008 	Spacious rooms in the heart of Times Square	When the hotel says they are right in the middle of Times Square, they aren't kidding. This makes everything you could possibly need well within a short walk, be it shopping, dining, or sightseeing.The rooms at this property are true suites; not the mini-suites you find at something like a Springhill Suites. The living room is significantly larger than the bedroom, and I found myself watching the plasma screen TV in that room and reserving the bedroom for sleep. The bathroom has an entrance just inside the front door to the room, and as you walk through the large bathroom, you can exit through another door into the bedroom. There is a small bar area in the suite...perfect if you are entertaining, though I didn't find it particularly useful. I did come in late, so the well-stocked mini-bar provided the usual snacks to take the edge off my hunger until breakfast the next morning.My review is only average because there is a lot of construction going on. Breakfast takes place in a big meeting room that can get loud as it fills up. The decor is a little dated, and the heating in the suite is a wall heater that has dual vents to share the heat between the two rooms; so one room is usually hotter than the other.Altogether though, this hotel usually has the best rates in this part of NYC, and is more than adequate for the business traveler.	
Dec 5 2008 	Spacious Rooms 	We spent Nov 21 - 24 at the Doubletree and would love to return on our next trip. On the day of arrival, we called early in the morning to request an early check-in and a room on a high floor if possible. When we arrived around 2 PM, our room was not quite ready so we had the hotel hold our luggage (complimentary). The staff at the baggage storage desk were excellent. They helped tag and secure our language all the while smiling and with great patience. Despite the bustle of the hotel, I felt reassured that our luggage was safe and well taken care of. At check-in, we received chocolate chip cookies with warm and gooey centers. Just how I like them! We had room 1504 and upon arrival were impressed with how clean and comfy everything looked. Our 2-room suite (one bedroom + one living room) was a luxurious amount of space for 4 adults in NYC. Two slept on the king bed and 2 more on the pull-out couch. There was also a fridge, microwave, and mini-bar -- which we promptly locked after reading that the bar could be &quot;touchy&quot; and accidentally charge you for items that you bumped. I appreciated having a 2nd sink in the living room area for drinking water. Also - the in-room coffee was surprisingly tasty. The bathroom had 2 separate entrances so you could enter either from the living room or bedroom. Our room had a partial view of Times Square but the amazing thing was that the room was INCREDIBLY QUIET, and we are light sleepers. Don't worry - blackout curtains easily hid the blinking and sometimes blinding lights of Times Square. I also liked that I could crack open a window if I wanted some fresh air, since most hotel windows are sealed tight. As for the lobby construction, there was zero noise and inconvenience, aside from the ladders and workers being in the lobby. The location of the hotel is great. It's close to a subway stop; TKTS booth across the street, and an array of restaurants within walking distance. Having never stayed in the heart of Times Sq, it was a different experience being in such a busy area. You walk out of the revolving door and it's a continuous stream of people walking either direction.Overall, this was a fabulous hotel for the $183 per night price we paid from Hotwire. The amount of space and location were phenomenal features, and I would highly recommend the DoubleTree!	
Dec 1 2008 	Great Location	We stayed at the Doubletree on times square for the second time in a year. The location cannot be beat, its right across the street from the TKTS outlet. and right in the heart of the theater district. The rooms are nothing to write home about. They are clean, roomy for 4 people, they have a microwave and small fridge that never got cold, and is equipped with a bedroom, bathroom and seperate small living room with a pull out bed, but the hotel itself is okay. they are going through some kind of renovation at this time the lobby area is sort of a mess, the hallways look like you are in a 2 star hotel, not at all like a Hilton, Hyatt or similar. but you come to NY or enjoy the city not the hotel. So all i'd like to say is the location can't be beat and the subway is across the street or right under the hotel depending if you are going uptown or downtown. Loved the city and the sites, hotel is also very acceptable.	
Nov 24 2008 	Conference Suites are Great	We stayed in one of the xx03 conference suites and had a dinner party with 11 people. It was perfect. There are two differenct conference suites. The 03 suites and the 01 suites. The 03 suites are bigger and have more windows that face north and west. They also have 2 full bathrooms with tub and showers (one off of the living room). You get a great view up 7th Ave and can see Central Park and when you look out the west facing windows you see the northern half of Times Square. The 01 suites face south and west and are smaller because they wrap arround one of the elevator shafts and only have 1 bathroom and not as many windows. However the south and west windows let you see all of Times Square. If a view of all of Times Square is top priority than go for the 01 suite. Some of the photos on the Tripadvisor web site are taken from one of the 01 suites. If space is a top priority (plus a second full bathroom) go with the 03 suite--the pictures on the hotel web site are the 03 suite. We have a lot of family in the area and decided to rent the conference suite because it has a table that seats 8 and thought it would be nice to invite family and order room service. Eventually we had 11 but the room has a second table in the bedroom on wheels that fits under the desk so we pulled this out and put it at the end of the conference table. The room service people were great and brought up extra chairs and tablecloths. We ran out and got our own appetizers and wine and beer because the room also has a refrigerator (small but held a lot of beer and cheese and dip), sink, and microwave. Family came at 6 and had appetizers in the living room (a little crowded for 11 but not uncomfortable) and then dinner at 7 in the dining room. Room service came right on time and the food was very good for room service in a hotel--steak, Mahi-Mahi, Salmon, a very large choice for a room service menu. They also have a separate catering department if we had wanted to go that route. What we look for in a hotel is a lot of space in the room. We have also stayed in the regular suites and they are quite comfortable but do not have a dining room table. Our family had a great time because there was no time rush like at most NYC restaurants and we could be as loud as we wanted--the rooms are well soundproofed in this hotel. After dinner some people stayed at the table and some went into the living room and turned on the TV. Very relaxing for dinner in NYC.We aren't the types that like to be fussed over at hotels so the fact that this hotel has a small lobby that was undergoing repairs didn't bother us. If lobby appearance is important to you this hotel isn't for you. The furniture in the room is very nice but not elegant (kind of like our home) which is great if you are bringing children. This was a great stay and the staff did a great job. Will have another dinner party again here sometime in the future. For what we wanted it was perfect. If you want an impressive lobby and elegant furniture this is not the place for you.	
Nov 22 2008 	Good Stay	I stayed at the Doubletree from November 11th through the 16th. My room was on the 22nd floor. It was extremely convenient to everything. I travel to NYC about twice a year to see theatre and I usually hunt for a good rate for a decent hotel. My favorite hotel used to be the Rhiga Royal, until it was bought out and swanked out of my price bracket to the NYC London. In July, I stayed at the Dream Hotel, which was trendy, but I got a super cheap rate, and didn't mind the small room. But, I digress.The Double Tree is a great location and tons of room. I loved having the separate living area, as I have friends who I meet up with and it's great having our own living area to chat, instead of in a hotel bar, restaurant, etc. The bedroom section was very comfortable. The bathroom was a little bit dated, but it was in fine working condition so it was no big deal that it didn't have the super deluxe new look...It also doesn't have the price tag associated with that look, either.I found having an empty refrigerator, instead of a mini-bar a blessing. I loaded up on my favorite beverages for my stay.The maid service was very attentive and always prompt with my requests. I frequently asked for more coffee and condiment packets with my room cleaning, and I always came back to a clean room and plenty of coffee to make for me and my friends.The location can not be beat for seeing the Theatre. Almost everything is within a 5 to 10 minute walk, except for Lincoln Center, which is a bit of a hike- about 20-25 minutes walk.The hotel lobby was still under construction, but aside from a few congested periods during my stay, it was barely an issue.So, the bottom line- would I stay here again?Absolutely, as long as the price is what I consider to be reasonable for NYC. I paid around $320 per night for a 2 room suite- which I consider high value, indeed. Of course, the economic downturn could be a part of why the room was so cheap, but It was a great deal.I never used their restaurants or room service. With some of my favorite restaurants nearby, why should I? Part of the excitement of NYC is the great choice of restaurants!	
Nov 18 2008	Heart of TImes Square!	Fabulous location and great for families. This 2-room suite was perfect for our family of 5. You enter from the livingroom which was nicely decorated and had a pull out queen sofa sleeper, large wall to wall window to view Times Square below. A large counter area with a small regriderator, micrwave and small sink and a small table to have meals. A small but adequate bathroom led the way towards the bedroom which had 2 queen beds, a large armoire with 32 in tv, large window to view Times Square and nicele decorated as well. The lobby was on something liike the 10th floor and check-in went well. There is little room out front of the busy hotel to park to check in so we had to circle block to unload our bags from the car. We came in from Long Island and after checking in, dropped the car at the rental as you do NOT need or want to drive in the city. Public transportation and walking is your best bet!!Lots to see and do. You can not do it all in just a few days so don't try to. Read up and pick your favorites...we were here for only 5 days and chose: Double decker bus tour, kids loved riding up top, New York Yankees game, Lion King musical, free ferry ride to Staten Island (which goes by the Statue of Liberty) walking tour of Times Square, NBC studios, beautiful old cathedrals/churches, street performers, great food and night life! The city that never sleeps!	
Nov 17 2008 	What I expected	I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites for one night with my two kids ages 7 and 9. The hotel was exactly what I expected it to be -a big hotel chain, larger sized rooms, busy Times Square location and clean ( minus a few hairs in the shower). The room consists of two rooms - one has a pullout sofa and the other has two beds. My 7 year old slept on the sofabed, I slept on one bed and my 9 year old slept in the other bed. I was traveling without my husband which was a good thing because the beds are not that big although they are comfortable. The location is 47th and 7th just on the outskirts of Time Square. You step out of the hotel and there are people everywhere and lights, lights, lights! Our room faced the back and was quiet of street noise but the walls are a little thin and the person next door was blasting the tv and I could hear it perfectly. I am very familiar with NYC and I picked this location mainly because I was traveling alone with the kids and we were going to see a show and I wanted a short walk back to the hotel. It was literally two blocks from our theater. If you are looking for a high end hotel this is not it. If you want a comfortable, spacious, reliable chain hotel in the theater district, its a good choice.	
Nov 15 2008	Perfect place for ladies shopping 	A group of 14 women stayed here on our recent trip to NYC. It was a wonderful place to stay! You can fit 5 adults in a suite. There are 2 sinks in the bathroom and one at the bar area. There is a separate fridge from the minibar. We all enjoyed the free cookies at check in, but even better was the service from everyone. Rhonda at the front desk was awesome! She was so patient getting all of us into rooms together (2 adjoining) and all so quickly. The bellmen even came up to weigh our luggage so that we would know what to take out before checking in at the airport! The lobby is under renovation, but no matter. The location could not be better nor the service. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! I plan to return. It was clean, safe, comfortable, and affordable.	
Nov 13 2008	No Surprises	No surprises. It's exactly like every Doubletree out there. Rooms were clean and beds comfortable. Its right in the middle of Times Square so for those that prefer that locale this would be a good option.for those that enjoy an authentic experince go to Queens and have a pint in one of the last few remaining Irish bars in Woodside	
Oct 31 2008 	Definitely stay here again	We stayed at this hotel Oct. 19th to 24th, we are 4 Irish ladies who went on a shopping trip.We booked a &quot;2 doubles 2 room suite&quot; and we had plenty of space (believe me we had lots of bags), but never felt like we were tripping over each other.There are 3 sinks and loads of mirror space, so no problems getting ready.Its smack bang in the middle of Times Square but we couldnt hear ANY noise from our room and the drapes must be blackout because it was so dark at night and the beds were comfortable so a good nights sleep was had by all (this is not always easy in NY). Other hotels we've stayed in had a lot of traffic noise. We were there during the renovations but it didnt inconvenience us in any way and we didnt hear noise from that either (yes it looks a bit unsightly but we dont spend much time hanging around lobbies, there's too much else to be doing! and we never encountered any queues at the desk) Front desk staff are really friendly and oh those cookies...! We didnt go to the bar/restaurant because why would you? there's so much on your doorstep..we saved a fortune in taxi fares because it's so central. The &quot;Evergreen&quot; diner around the corner is good for breakfast ($10 will get you breakfast and its served late, maybe all day). We will definitely be back to this hotel, in fact we've checked rates already for next year! the rates are so good at the moment for what you get. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend it....!	
Oct 29 2008 	Liked this Hotel	I stayed at this hotel with my husband in Oct 2005. Located on Times Square, it was like living in two worlds - outside it was like being in a madhouse, inside it was peaceful and clean. I am returning to the same hotel in November 2008 with my Mother as I know my way around from that point and know exactly how to find things without too much stress....it IS completely mad outside, but inside its like breathing a sigh of relief. Not the absolute best hotel I have ever stayed in, but very good for the money.	
Oct 26 2008 	Great Stay	Four of us booked our 4 night stay (Oct 21-25) in NY at the Doubletree Suites Times Square and then I read a couple of reviews and got concerned. However, we had a terrific stay. Our room was on the 42nd floor with a great view south. The only time we heard any noise was when we opened the windows. The beds were really comfortable- as were the pillows. The huge counter in the bathroom plus the mirror/sink /counter in the living room really worked for our group of 4. It was very clean.We called up for more coffee on our first morning and it was at the door within 3 minutes. Followed by a phone call from the front desk asking if we had received it yet. GREAT SERVICE. The concierge helped us with show ticket info on several occasions.The location really can't be beat. We arrived from the airport at 6:15pm- checked in- dumped our luggage in our room, went across the street and bought half price tickets to a show and were in our seats at the theater by 7pm. So that lovely warm chocolate chip cookie they give you on checkin was a life saver as we didn't get to eat until much later.Although the lobby is under construction right now- it wasn't a problem at all.We will definitely stay there again.	
Oct 25 2008 	Great (and quiet) view of Times Square	Excellent one night stay in October. On the 17th Floor with a view of Times Square. All the lights, signs, and people, but none of the noise. I was absolutely amazed at how quiet and dark the room was when we closed the curtains for bed. Room was nice - bed, bath, and living room with wet bar. Bed was very comfortable, but the linens were not fantastic. One note of caution: they are doing construction in the lobby and when we were there, it looked like a disaster area. You walk straight into a set of scaffolding when the elevator opens into the lobby and there are sheets of black cloth covers the walls by the room elevators. Turned out this didn't impact our short stay, but it was pretty jarring as our first exposure to the hotel.	
Oct 24 2008 	Best NYC Hotel!!!	IF YOU ARE GOING TO NYC  STAY AT THE TIMES SQUARE DOUBLETREE!!I am an extremely frequent traveler, and stay at hotels across the world (approx 7 nights a month). I was lucky enough to retire early, and travel mostly for pleasure. That said, I am always looking to get the most bang for my bucks! Honestly, this is one of the best hotels Ive stayed at, and there are three very specific reasons why+1 The Service was amazing. As soon as I stepped out of my Taxi (NY taxi ride is an experience to say the least) I was greeted by a doorman that managed to make me feel welcome and special. Not only was he friendly, professional, and helpful, his unique New York approach/feel was unforgettable. I entered the hotel and felt extra safe by the 2 level lobby and 24 hour security guard stationed before the elevator. (Please read remarks below about the lobby renovation) My check in was a perfect 10. The front desk staff understood my needs, and recommended the perfect suite for me. I had read a lot of reviews (as usual) and wanted to make sure I got the perfect room. All of them were great. Between the front desk and the concierge, I feel like I really understood what I was getting into and was able to plan the best possible trip. From that point on, everyone I encountered, whether I was riding the elevators or having a snack in restaurant was really [genuinely] friendly and helpful. I really felt like they were happy to go out of their way and help with whatever I needed. +2 Physically, the space I had in the suite was quite literally twice as large as other NYC hotels for the same price. Let me say that again, you get a full bed room AND a full living room for the same price that most other nyc hotels charge for just the bedroom. This was absolutely amazing! I cant believe that all these years I have been staying in the trendy closets some of hotels call rooms!!+3 Location Location Location!!! Right across from the half price broadway ticket both, the Doubletree is in the best location at the heart of nyc!-1 The only negative is that while I stayed the hotel was under renovations in the lobbys and restaurant. This meant that the lobby did not really have any place to sit. The restaurant was fully functioning. To be honest, this did not really bother me too much as I was out all day anyway In the suite, I could not hear or sense the renovation at all! The pictures of the new lobby look great, and I am looking forward to seeing it done!!!*** Overall, this hotel is truly a steal. Enjoy your visit, and make sure you stop by the front desk (aside for check in). The agents are awesome!! And a warm cookie is never far behind their great recommendations and their warm smile!	
Oct 13 2008 	Terrible Customer Service overwhelms nice rooms	If you like Times Square and want a 2-room suite this hotel should have a lot to offer.I certainly hoped so. But after 3 nights the terrible way they run the property has overwhelmed any nice feelings I ever had about it.I think it is one of these cases where the staff has learnt to have enormous contempt for their customers and it shows. I suspect that this must come from the management down. It manifested itself from the rude and off-hand way that we were greeted at the check-in desk.To the arbritrary and odd way they decided to cancel our room service order as they were too busy and not tell us about it keeping us waiting in our room for 2 hours. PS Also watch out. We were billed for two items from the minibar even though we did not open it.	
Oct 10 2008 	Great Experience!	Two girlfriends and I just returned from a three day trip to NYC. We stayed at the Doubletree, and our experience couldn't have been better. We arrived early but were allowed to check in and go to our room. The hotel lobby is under construction, but we had no problems at all. The staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 42nd floor (no special request or extra charge), and it was perfect for three women traveling together; we had two double beds in the bedroom and the pull-out sofa in the living room, plus three sinks. We heard no noise at all, and had no problems with our beds; they were extremely comfortable. We flew in and out of LaGuardia and had no problems with the doormen trying to get us to take a car instead of a taxi to the airport. The location of this hotel is perfect for Broadway shows and shopping. We are planning on staying here during future visits to NYC.	
Oct 7 2008 	Bed bugs as well . They told us same thing never had them before	Woke up aftr the first night and legs had welts on them, Found it odd, Next night found same problem, Called housekeeping they brought another matress for the pull out in our Suite. The last night OMG it was AWFUL , The bed was full of remnants fromt he bed bugs I called housekeeping, the one girl said she was sorry that the mattress they pulled from storage had not been preserved, She said she would tell her supervisor of our problem, The supervisor came later and said they have never had bed bugs and that it was just lint BS I took pictures of everything with a copy of that days newspaper etc, THey said we will deduct the breakfast from your bill, I said no that does not make up for what i endured, She said that is all we can do, Well I still have a bottle with those bug carcasses that i took pictures of, and I will be sending them in . But now i find out another family had the same problem and they were also todl this was the first time, I emailed them and they said the response the management posted to their complaint was PURE RUBBISH. She said one occurance was forgivable But two was not. And the second stay she kept the bug in a glass and they tried to tell her it was a beetle, They said NO WAY. So if anyone else had to endure this problem with the doubtree on Brodway in NYC please come forward. I do not feel I or anyone else should be paying their prices for a bed bug ridden Suite. The location was great and had it not been for the bed bugs it would of been well worth it, But it took two weeks to get rid of the welts on my body plus all the discomfort,, Don't let them lie to you or ruin your Stay In the BIG APPLE	
Oct 7 2008 	A pleasant experience despite misgivings	This was my 3rd trip to NYC in three years. The first trip we stayed at the Milford Plaza - nice, central location but very noisy at night and the room was tiny. Our next trip (in May 2008) I chose the Courtyard by Marriott - Midtown east. Excellent hotel, in a quiet business district about 7-8 blocks from Times Square. I was planning to stay there again because i feared the noise in Times Square but at the last moment checked rates and switched to the Doubletree because I didn't want to hear our teenager complain about the walking (LOL). Also, the Doubletree's rates were about $200 less for the whole trip (3 nights) than the Courtyard.The first requirement for us is a king size bed with a pull out sofa for our teenage son. The Courtyard has this as does the DoubleTree. Many hotel rooms in NYC are small, old and cramped. We got a two-room suite at the Doubletree for $300 a night. It was perfect!The rooms were very modern, large and clean. Down pillows, a refrigerator, microwave, granite counter tops, flat screen TVs. We lacked for nothing.My second requirement is that the room be quiet. In all the large cities I have visited traffic noise at night has kept me up. We've also experienced this in Rome, London and Sydney. I have learned through experience to stay on a high floor.When I booked the Doubletree, I had the option of paying a few more dollars for a high floor. We were on the 41st floor and it was great. The only noise we could hear was the occasional siren.Times Square is very central to everything in NYC. The location can't be beat. The down side is it very, very crowded at all hours of the day and night and maneuvering the crowds while going in and out of our hotel was a little daunting at times but manageable.My only complaint is when we were leaving this am, the doorman asked us if we needed a cab to the airport - we did. He then told us it would be $40 and tried to steer us towards a private car and driver. I said, 'No, it was only $32 from LGA on the way here' - knowing that there are a lot of 'faux taxis' out there that don't follow the NY Taxi Commission fare rates. The doorman said, 'well it all works out the same - $40' but he did point us to a yellow cab. The rate to the airport was, in fact, $32. I didn't appreciate the doorman's fib and the fact that he was steering us towards a private car. He could have explained our choices - private car $40 or taxi $32 and let us make that decision upfront.Other than that, excellent service and visit.	
Oct 2 2008 	It Works....	I was staying at the doubletree while on a business trip. The facility (lobby, entrance, and bar) is under heavy construction, which makes getting around difficult at times. Despite the construction the rooms were in nice shape. This hotel &quot;works&quot; for a business trip, but I am not sure I would go there with my family until the construction is complete.	
Sep 30 2008	Right in the Heart of Times Square/Broadway Theater District	This is a great, clean hotel right in the center of the action in Times Square and Broadway. It's a perfect stay for visitors, with everything right outside your door.There are 40+ floors, so street noise is not an issue. Instead, you'll get a SUITE, which is a rare thing in the Broadway area. Suites have a small fridge and a microwave and a separate living room from the bedroom, plus a TV in the bedroom and one in the living room.The lobby is currently undergoing renovations, but your stay shouldn't be affected. To get to the lobby, you enter on the street level and take the elevator to the lobby floor. So there really isn't much to the lobby anyway.We didn't eat in the hotel...why would anyone? There are tons of restaurants in Times Square and the neighboring Restaurant Row/Hell's Kitchen area. Take your pick.If you're looking for an awesome location, in the center of Manhattan, with a suite (plus Doubletree's fantastic chocolate chip cookies upon check in), this is the place for you.	
Sep 17 2008	Nice location and room BUT. . .	My husband and I stayed in a King's Suite at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square on the 22nd floor (an alleged upgrade). As Hilton Honors Gold members, we received complimentary continental breakfast offered daily at the Center Stage Cafe restaurant and wireless internet service in our suite. The hotel is located in the midst of Times Square - great location but like most hotels in Times Square, no hotel driveway or great magnificent lobby! The hotel is very accessible to subway.There were, however, some kinks associated with our stay. Although the internet service was free, the connection was terrible! It was intermittent! Very frustrating. The king-sized bed was very comfortable except that the airconditioning vent blew straight to our heads and could not be repositioned! Their minibar system in the room was so sensitive that even if you slightly touched any of the soda cans, you will be instantly charged for the item even if you didn't buy it! We were charged for 4 items when we only purchased 2. Their only restaurant, Center Stage Cafe, on the 5th floor was alright - nothing great. Their bar/lounge next to the restaurant was pathetic! We had our cocktails elsewhere - there are many other nearby local bars which were far better and worth the walk. Hotel lobby was being refurbished when we were there.Probably would not return to this hotel - too bad because we really liked the size of the suite!	
Sep 16 2008 	great stay	The staff at the double tree are welcoming and very helpful from check in to check out. Finding band-aids, getting extra blankets, and easy baggage storage on our last day.Room was great worked out with kids in tow. All in all a great stay.	
Sep 16 2008 	Would gladly stay here again	My husband and I stayed for the first time in New York City for 3 nights. This hotel was right in the action of Times Square, which we were not sure was a good idea. However we were pleasantly surprised with the Doubletree. The planned renovations did not start until the morning we were checking out. So we did not have issues with noise, dust etc. We were on the 35th floor and each night we slept very well. We never over heard other guests, traffic, staff etc. Great bed, 2 room suite, clean, huge bathroom and updated decor. Loved having a microwave, free room safe and wet bar. We were able to have &quot;dinner&quot; one night in our suite after shopping at Whole Foods. The hotel restaurant provided tableware for us without an issue. This hotel has the fastest elevators in town! We had a spectacular rate through the hotel website and got more than we paid for. If we ever return to New York and want to be in Times Sq., we would choose this hotel.	
Sep 7 2008 	Great for Girls' Getaway	If you're looking for a spacious room for a girls' getaway weekend, this is it. Two comfortable queen size beds, if you don't mind sharing. The sofa bed in the sitting room is not so good for older gals' backs. Two sinks on the vanity and one on the wet bar provided each person her own space. Situated right in the heart of things. Memorable!	
Aug 30 2008 	Good location for family stay	Stayed for a week with wife and three teenage daughters. Hotel was clean, quiet (we had an upper level room) . I thought it good value for money. One tip- when using the sofa bed follow the instructions exactly and don't remove any of the sofa cushions prior to folding it out or it won't be comfortable.Not stayed in any other NY hotels but would guess the rooms were larger than average.	
Aug 29 2008 	Really nice!	Three of us checked in for 4 nights on August 23. We had 2 double beds, sofa bed in living room, wet bar and large bathroom with double sinks. Very clean and good layout. The staff is excellent!. Everyone does their best to please you! At the corner of 7th Ave. and 47th St. you walk out of the hotel and the subway is right next door and that is great!	
Aug 27 2008 	Busy quiet crazy calm!	Yes, Yes, Yes!This hotel is great. Clean, quiet and next to all the chaos of NYC!The room which had two beds and a sofa bed was a decent size and fitted four adults. The sofa bed was a little soft but was better than sharing! Being on the 42nd floor, it was also very quiet.The bathroom was also good, the shower being really good and eased out those long hours of walking I did.The concierge was very helpful, we where able to book our bus tours and outlet store excursion there without any problems. They also offered theatre tickets, but you could find a tourist centre located very close to the hotel which offered a better variety of things to do.The laundry service was a little expensive considering what I had cleaned (underwear, etc).The breakfast was expensive, save your money and venture out to the many places located around the hotel.When you stepped out of the hotel you where welcomed by the frenzy that Times Square is, madness, but I loved every minute of it.Ideal location, ideal hotel, ideal holiday!	
Aug 26 2008	where the action is	Comfortable, clean hotel with warm choc chip cookies, great king size bed, and adjoining living space (smallish but manageable) with sofabed and large screen tv; located in the heart of Times Square;	
Aug 25 2008	Most convenient location	We were parents and adult sons staying here for three nights in August. We recommend this hotel if you want a central location, walking distance from many attractions and shopping and literally on top of a subway station. The hotel will work for you if you are happy with a large impersonal but clean and efficient experience at this type of location for a reasonable price..However, do not expect any form of personlised service. Do not expect the room staff to respond to written requests to leave enough non-decaff coffee sachets for the number in the party or to do anything else non-standard. Do not expect the concierge to give you any help which doesn't involve selling you something, and do not expect to have breakfast in the restaurant without queueing for at least 30 minutes with an inefficient system. Also be aware that the one downside of the location is that most of the time to enter or leave the building you have to fight your way through the hoards of people queueing for the theatre next door and when you get into the ground floor lobby you will be accosted by security guards before taking the first of two lifts to get to your room.	
Aug 22 2008 	Terrific hotel!!	We stayed at this hotel from August 8th until the 11th of 2008. It is very well located, at the heart of Times Square (corner of 7th Avenue and 47th St.). Broadway theaters are within sight (less than 2 minutes walking distance). Nice restaurants are in the vecinity (5 minutes walking). Also very nice stores close by (Swatch, Toys R´Us, 5th Avenue is just two blocks away!).The DoubleTree is in very good condition, no complaints about the room, halls, elevators, entrance, lobby and facilities. The bedrooms are big (by New York standards) and are equiped with a refrigerator (in addition to the minibar) a microwave, sink, coffee maker and a full sofa bed (very comfortable!). House keeping will bring you the kitchen utensils at your request.You can easily accomodate six persons on the two double beds and a sofa bedrooms. These rooms (the two double beds ones) don´t have a view to Times Square but to the adjacent street. If you want to have a nice view of Times Square you need to book a one king bedroom (high floor preferable).The bath room has double doors, so you can conveniently access it from the room or the living room. There is a flat tv in the living room with a game control for the kids (nintendo) and plenty of games to choose from the menu (USD6.95 per 60 minutes). This keeps the children entertained while in the room (so you can get a nap or relax). There is another flat tv in the bedroom (while my teenage daughter watched the Jonas Brothers, my other two small children were having fun with the video games).The service is very good. The staff will really strive to get you what you ordered, specially the ones at the front desk (the concierge was ok). My praise to the three dominican girls at the frontdesk, they were fabulous!! In spite of the absurd amount of people walking around Times Square, it is not hard to enter or leave the hotel. There is no noise at all in the hotel (bedrooms or lobby). The restaurant is not that good, in fact it is the reason I don´t give this hotel 5 points (just 4 points). It is ridiculously expensive..not worth it at all.	
Aug 14 2008 	Watch Out for Bedbugs!	My husband, daughter and I stayed here in 2007, and had a great time. This year ('08) we booked an 8 night stay and expected another good experience. Unfortunately, nearly half of our stay was ruined by the appearance of bedbugs and the aftermath--changing rooms, making reports for Housekeeping, Security, and Hotel Management, cleaning our clothing, etc! The staff did an admirable job in communicating with us and trying to correct the problem (or so we thought), and assured us that this was an incredibly rare occurrance. We were given a free night for a future stay, as well as other niceties for our trouble---we chalked up the bugs to an unfortunate aberration.Our daughter was subsequently invited to audition for a NYC dance company the first of August, so we decided to give the DoubleTree a second chance and book our two-night stay with them. MISTAKE. I couldn't believe it when, after a difficult day a traveling, missed connections, and lost baggage, my nervous daughter finally settled into bed and cried out, &quot;Oh, my G--, Mom! You're not going to believe this!&quot; I looked down, and there, in the sheets, was yet another bug! Despite the personable and well-meaning staff (especially Julia), I will NEVER stay in this hotel again--they obviously have some on-going issues they still need to address properly.	
Aug 10 2008 	I second that. Business travelers beware!! Ok for families though...	Our family visited in August 2008 for a 4 day stay. While we weren't in Manhattan on business, we had NO internet connection from our room. For a hotel in the middle of Times Square? Very frustrating, and an absolute travesty if you were there on business. Luckily we didn't absolutely require internet in our room so it wasn't the end of the world. Otherwise, the hotel accommodations were comfortable and the beds were very nice/soft. There was a microwave and a small fridge in our suite, which was very helpful with two small children. Our room was pretty small for a family of 4, but it was doable. We used the pullout bed in the living room so that helped a bit. We had a nice view from the 31st Floor, and the location could not be beat. We were able to see the recently released Broadway show Legally Blonde (very funny, BTW) directly next to the hotel... and you're about a 7 block walk from Central Park. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant and it appeared that not many others did either, as it was a dead zone. However, they did provide utensils and plates for meals that you had in your room... also nice for families.	
Aug 10 2008 	Good with Kids	I am torn about my review for this hotel. My husband and I stayed here with two kids, (11 and 13) for four nights at the beginning of August. We received a rate through the hotel website for 429.00 per night, which included breakfast for four at the hotel restaurant. For a two bedroom suite in New York, this was a great value, but the hotel itself was just okay. We received a corner room on the 29th floor that had a great view of Times Square, but the room itself was smaller than the rest of the rooms. There was a small fridge, microwave, in-room safe, and sink. We were able to buy drinks and snacks from a nearby Duane-Reade, which helped save some money since room service and in-room snack center were very expensive. The lobby and front desk staff were friendly, and we never encountered any long lines.  We ate lunch at the hotel restaurant our first day, and it was not very good. Like the rest of New York, it was pricey. The breakfast buffet, which was included in our rate, was very good. In addition to hot and cold buffet items, they had a cook-to-order station with eggs, waffles, pancakes, and french toast. The hot and cold buffets had a great variety of fresh fruit, oatmeal with a wide variety of mix-ins, and numerous other items.  The reason I am torn about my review is that, while I was not impressed with the hotel overall, I still felt that it was a good value for New York. Here were the problems: The bathroom was not completely clean upon check in. I called and no one ever made it up to finish cleaning. The iron in the room was broken, and when we tried to use it, water poured out all over the clothes. Again, I called about this and it was never replaced. The room itself was just okay, very plain and a little run down. The hotel has no rollaway beds available.  We did not have any problems with the internet--the hotel website states that there is a per day charge for access; however, we received the Hilton signal and it did not require a password or code. It was not terribly slow. The workout facility was decent-elliptical and treadmills with televisions, free weights and machines. It is open 24 hours, which is convenient.  Overall, it was a good value for the amount of space(although get a rate quote INCLUDING taxes, as they are very high in NYC--our 429.00 rate was much higher once taxes were added).	
Aug 10 2008	Great place to stay great location	We loved the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square. The location was convienient to all Broadway Shows. We could walk anywhere we wanted to. The suites are large and clean. We will definitely return !!!	
Aug 6 2008 	A Great Location and Nice Experience	Great Location - GREAT LOCCATIONFriendly StaffDefinitely a great place for/with kids or family.Large two room accommodations.	
Jul 31 2008 	business travelers beware	This is fine hotel unless you need a speedy internet (abysmally slow and their internet provider is atrocious--must have spent 4 hours to no avail), help from the front desk (they can't do anything with their computers to print out anything other than one receipt one way for a trip--tough if you need different receipts for different sources reimbursements), or a polite doorperson (who doesn't yell at you if you don't select the cab he wants even though he is highly enmeshed in a conversation with a friend and doesn't lift a finger to help you with luggage on the way out). On the plus side, the rooms are large and good for families. If I wasn;t travelling on business and I didn't need the internet, I might stay there if I wanted a middle-of-Times Square experience.	
Jul 31 2008 	Good overall experience	The staff is terrific, very nice and helpful. The lobby is on the second floor and is not pleasant especially when tour groups are coming or going. There are good features in the rooms - microwave, decent size half refrigerator, marble counters in bathroom and in the &quot;kitchen&quot; area. Kitchen has a small sink. There was enough room for 3 people. My biggest complaint was the hide-a-bed. It was a mystery how to open it up -- we had to call for help. It also was not very comfortable. But that is not a big deal. The location is great and there are small grocery stores close by. It's quite close to Rockefeller Center. Overall, we were pleased and our room was comfortable. The hotel entrance really is right in Times Square (the northern end).	
Jul 30 2008 	Best Holiday Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!	We arrived at the hotel on 8th of jan, a family of 5 and we stayed for a week. as we arrived at the hotel from our stretch limo the buzz of the streets totally shocked us. All we did all week was SHOP. it is the best place to shop ever specially in jan sales as everything is sooooo cheap!i would definately stay here again if i ever visit NYC again. Best stay ever!!	
Jul 28 2008 	Highly Recommended Hotel in Times Square	Searched high and low for several weeks for a reasonably priced hotel for a family of 5. Having lived in New York City, I balked at having to pay an average of $600 per night (for 2 rooms) so finding this option was great. Very clean room, plenty of space and everything WORKED. Check-in/check-out was super fast and being in the middle of Times Square was a bonus. Our room was on the 9th floor so not particularly high up and did not have a view of Times Square itself but was amazingly quiet. Also, there are plenty of eateries nearby to counteract the over priced hotel restaurant! I would recommend the Doubletree to anyone and will certainly plan to stay there on future visits.	
Jul 25 2008 	great hotel	stayed here for 3 nights with 3 teenagers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly (thanks 2 Yanni) original suite was not available when we arrived and we were asked if we would take a smaller room for one night then we were upgraded to our original size of suite but this time on the 43rd floor with 5 complimentary breakfasts for 3 days which was great. View of Times Square from the top of the hotel was fantastic. Great location, helpful staff, would definitely recommend	
Jul 21 2008	Clean and Compact	Nice and clean suite with good housekeeping service. Great location at the top of times square. Small and dangerous valet/taxi pull-up space. Small lobby area. Small hallways and suite. Small restaurant on 5th floor (windowless I think). Parking attendant cleaned out my car change.	
Jul 17 2008 	PERFECT with 2 KIDS!	My husband, 2 kids and I stayed at the Doubletree Times Square for 4 nights recently and LOVED IT! Have stayed in more &quot;posh&quot; hotels in NYC, but this was perfect with kids. We requested a Times Square view upon check-in, which they delivered happily (they also explained that corner rooms are smaller - we agreed we could live with that in order to have a view). Rooms ending in &quot;1, 2 or 3&quot; face Times Square. Our room was on the 15th floor (1503) and we hardly heard any street noise (other than the occasional siren). Staff was accommodating and friendly.The room was clean every day and bed was SO comfy. The kids loved having their &quot;own room&quot; with a TV. Don't know how comfy the sofa bed was - they didn't complain. The refrigerator in the room was convenient - we stocked it with drinks and snacks from Duane Reade pharmacy. On our way out each morning, we would just fill our backpack with our drinks and snacks. This kept the kids happy throughout the day and saved us some money. All in all, was a great experience and I would definitely stay at this hotel again.I also recommend taking the Grayline double decker buses. We bought a 2 day All Loops Pass online (cheaper). It was $160.00 for 2 days (4 people) which breaks down to $20.00 day per person - cheap! It's an easy and enjoyable way to see everything and get up and down the island. Hop on and off as many times as you want. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus, although sometimes pick up locations were a block off. We did the Uptown and Downtown Loops over and over again. When your feet get tired, hop on the next bus and ride for awhile. Don't lose the map they give you and you'll be in good shape! The tour guides vary greatly - some are more informative and interesting than others. The Night Tour guide had us laughing and singing all the way. We did not do the Brooklyn Loop, as the Night Loop tours Brooklyn (I would urge you to do the Night Loop - great fun). You can take the subway, but of course there's no view underground, and it can get really hot and crowded. The top of the bus is cool enough, and below it is air conditioned. I was concerned that the kids would not get to see everything in 5 days, but with the bus, we were able to see it all and have a great time doing it.Have fun and enjoy your trip!	
Jul 13 2008 	Perfect location great customer service	We only needed 1 night and got a great rate through AAA. Part of the deal is that you get a room on a higher floor. This is much needed because the hotel is in the middle of Times Square. We loved the location and the customer service was outstanding. The beds were very comfortable. The room was quiet. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!	
Jul 11 2008	Great Trip	My son and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites last week for 5 nights &amp; were very happy. The AARP rate was $250/night which seemed like a great rate to me for 2 rooms &amp; 2 TVS! The rooms were clean, bedding very comfy with plenty of fluffy pillows (not flat, foam ones) &amp; nice, big bath towels. Sofabed was tolerable for my son. Only negative was the slightly dingy shower &amp; lousy bathroom lighting. We were on the 38th floor so Times Square noise wasn't an issue. Service was very pleasant though we only dealt with the front desk. Great location for walking to theater &amp; hopping on a subway; got very tired of the mob scene in Times Square after the 3rd day or so but would definitely stay there again. Loved NYC!	
Jul 10 2008	Corner rooms smaller	If you like to be able to have a lot to do at night, then Times Square is the place to go- and Doubletree Guest Suites is a great location. This area felt fairly safe for a woman too. Don't expect to be wowed by the entrance and lobby though. Both are pretty bare bones. The bar area was also dead. The room was clean, the staff was nice, and the bed and pillows were really soft. Our corner room was smaller than our friend's room. Better views, but noticeably smaller. This and the Marriott Times Square are the most conveniently located hotels that I saw while in New York. I would definitely go back. Make sure you try to get a better rate than what they quote you.	
Jul 10 2008 	Wonderful despite...	We're a family of 4 with small kids and lots of luggage so the hotel room was a bit cramped. The bathroom door wouldn't lock and the pull-out bed was not a suprising discomfort. We didn't get the breakfast, nor did we eat in the hotel's restaurant. We were desperate enough to buy a $5 soda from the minibar! Oh, and the coffee bar downstairs had delicious muffins and croissants. The cleaning staff came late on our 2nd day and wanted to clean while we were there. I guess that's a good thing. The A/C was good and cold and the views were outstanding!! It would be fair to say that we had the best views around on the 18th floor. It was challenging to locate the hotel by car due to all the one-way streets, but the concierge was truly a gentlemen and helped us find our way. We didn't have any problems with check-in or check-out and we were asked for our room key a few times until they began to recognize us. We felt safe and secure and are sure we left with everything we brought. The bell captains were very accomodating, even storing and charging our scooter. I hope our tips were enough. Make sure you have enough towels and pillows and always ask for extra coffee, cups and sugar.All in all, with a decent room and price, this is the place to stay. Though, I heard staying around Wall St. is much cheaper, we wanted the action and lights of Times Square - and we got it in full force! We should have: brought umbrellas, our own totebags for souvenirs, foldable seats for the fireworks; and bought metro cards for the buses and subways, the double-decker tour bus pass and some groceries. We did: bring cash for tips; wear comfortable shoes; valet park our car and forgot about it for 4 days while we used every conceivable mode of transportation available in NYC; receive, from the hotel, 2 great kiddie backpacks filled with toys as well as the yummy cookies.Enjoy your vacations!	
Jul 8 2008 	Loved the Doubletree	Our family of four stayed here for 7 days and absolutely loved it. The location is the best. Within walking distance of tons of restaurants and shows and the subway is right next door. The best part is having two rooms and three beds (one is the fold out couch). This kept us from being too crowded. With a 13 and 20 year old, we needed some room. Also, two tv's were nice for downtime. One on ESPN and one on Food Network. The fridge came in very handy to keep extra water and cokes on hand. Bathroom is big and you can also use the mini bar area for someone to get ready in as it has a mirror and sink also. Times Square is constantly bustling with cars and people but in the rooms it is very quiet. They have soundproofed very nicely. We had a problem with our tv remotes twice and within 15 minutes they brought new ones. Towels were brought also with 15 minutes. Everyone was friendly and very eager to help. They check your key before allowing entry to the hotel which I liked for the added security. We will definitely stay here again when coming back to NYC. It is also central to everything in Manhattan and we were all over the city. Doubletree makes a great home base and is well worth the price. McDonalds is right next door so the kids could go down at midnight and get a snack and it was very convenient for a quick breakfast. I've heard NY has very small hotel rooms but that is not the case at Doubletree.	
Jul 5 2008 	Poor Service	Excellent location for those visiting NYC, however there were service issues. Agent at check in desk took a long time to as she put it- find us a great room- it was there standard room, with no special features ( view, corner etc). We were told it would be a 15 minute wait to take our bags to our room- the lobby was completley overwhelmed with carts of luggaget. It looked like baggage claim at JFK, not a 500/ night hotel! We carried ours up. Security was extremley lax- we were only asked for our room keys once. Bathroom tile was cracked, and the furnishings looked a bit outdated. When checking out, we asked for help, told they would be up in 5 minutes, after waiting 20, we carried our own bags (again). Improvements in staff service would greatly improve the quality of stay.	
Jul 1 2008	Trip of a Lifetime-Double Tree Times Square	3 CDN ladies just enjoyed 6 nights in NYC. Stayed at the Double Tree in Times Square. They did not have the room we booked with 2 doubles on our arrival so gave us a King, $50. off per night and complimentry buffet breakfast daily for our stay(that is $77. per day); Location is perfect-you can walk miles to so many attractions. Room was clean, great service and the only complaint is the pull out couch. It was NOT comfortable. But the rest of the trip made up for it. Our best day was when walking to Grand Central we made a wrong turn and ended up in Hells Kitchen. We met some elderly locals at coffee shop and that was a highlight of NYC. We did all the tourist spots, shopped, loved Chinatown and Little Italy and shopped some more! 3 major thunderstorms added to excitement! We saw 4 plays and that too was a highlight. Try the Hop on Hop Off bus-2 days is enough and then we travelled by cab. Inexpensive. Food was pricey but quantities just too large. One dish of anything will feed 3 ladies. Beware and don't over order. We felt very safe at all times and did not use the underground. Grab your girlfriends, bid adios to the men and fly off to NYC. You will not be sorry............	
Jun 29 2008 	I thought I'd get more for $500 a night	This was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed in, and it wasn't worth the money. Some disappointments included a room service tray with leftovers that sat outside my door for almost 12 hours even though I called for a pickup. I had to call again before it was removed. Oh, and when the room service was delivered the server felt compelled to comment upon how much food we had ordered. Tacky.A piece of molding was taped to the wall with masking tape in my $500-a-night room. There was a musty unpleasant smell in the ice machine room. To force their guests to buy cans of soda from the in-room minibar at $5.25 per can, there are no soda vending machines in the hotel. The remote control for the TV in the separate bedroom didn't work, and the TV wouldn't work without it. And lastly for the disappointments, there was a noticeable lack of security at the entrance, which is directly on Times Square and believe you me, there are some strange people on the streets in Time Square. I was never asked to show my room key. The good points for this hotel: my room was clean and neat, with good temperature control. There was a phone in the bathroom in case of emergencies, and the shower worked well. The street noise was muffled and wasn't noticeable from the 22nd floor. Which meant the hotel room was a nice respite from the chaos of a weekend in Times Square.Overall, this hotel was not worth $500 a night, and I woudn't stay here again.	
Jun 27 2008	Love Love Loved It!	I absolutely loved my stay at the Doubletree. I was there for three nights in a one bedroom suite. The bed was extremely comfortable (which is very important to me on vacation) . The room was clean and well maintained. And the view from the hotel window was amazing (it really helps if you love the city like I do). Also, the hotel is located in a convenient area for going to shows, etc. One of the hotel staff members knew that I was there to celebrate my birthday, so when I arrived in my room, there was a fruit and cheese tray waiting for me. Overall, very pleasant and calm stay in a busy city.	
Jun 26 2008 	Family of 4 LOVED the Doubletree Guest Suites	Our family of 4 recently enjoyed a great stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square. The room was large and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was also large and clean. We didn't notice any signs of disrepair or neglect of maintenance and our suite was always very clean. The location was wonderful and centrally located. We knew we would be arriving at the hotel early so we called the night before check in. They asked us to call the hotel when we were on our way so when we arrived, our room was ready. We were also allowed to check out at 1:00 on our departure date since we had a late flight.	
Jun 22 2008	Love the Doubletree Times Square	When traveling with a family, it is the only hotel that I have found that offers a suite in Times Square. We have 2 teenagers - boy and girl - so our son slept on the sofa bed (okay-typical sofa bed) my daughter had her own full/queen bed in the bedroom with us Worked fine as we stayed on a few nights, yet, much longer and the bed gets a little small for the 2 of us as we are use to a king at home. Nice large bathroom and there is as bar area in the living room which helped having an extra sink when getting ready in the morning. GREAT LOCATION. Staff seemed nice.	
Jun 14 2008 	Acceptable for Broadway	If you're going to see a Broadway show and want to be &quot;right there&quot; this is a good place to consider. However, if you're looking for anything other than your standard hotel stay, this is not the place.This hotel is very similar to a large convention center hotel - it's an assembly line process with too many people and too few staff to devote too much attention to guests. Odd are you'll have a decent amount of wait time if you want to check in at a peak time, have bags taken to your room, etc.The rooms themselves are fairly simple. They have &quot;modern&quot; hotel decor though it's got a very strong Ikea look to it. The bathrooms are adequate, though my tub looked like it could have used some a stronger dose of ajax cleaner. Some of the towel were old and a bit tough, while others were new and very soft.I'm sure the views from the room vary, but I had a good view of times square and could see down Broadway to Central Park. The hotel had wifi for a nominal fee. I got a strong signal and a good connection.Normally I don't eat at a hotel, but for some reason or another I had a free breakfast, so I decided to give it a shot. It was a breakfast buffet and the food was ok. (It's hard to mess up pancakes, muffins, fruit, and cereal). The service left much to be desired, but as I mentioned - this is an assembly line hotel.If you want to be close to Broadway and won't be doing much but sleeping in your room, this hotel will probably work just fine. If you want a nicer hotel, I'd consider some other choices.	
Jun 9 2008 	Rude and Careless	It appears our terrible recent experience at this hotel was shared by some more recent guests per these reviews. The positive is the location. The negatives are the rude staff (for example, we booked and paid for two rooms for a family of 6 four months ahead of time; because of flight delays we were late to check in and were kept waiting at midnight for almost 15 minutes after a 16 hour commute; only to be told our rooms had been given away, but to try again the next night ... !), and tired rooms. I could give another ten instances were the level of service was appalling (we were charged again on checking out even though we had paid before !!! and yet whenever our kids asked for a cookie at reception they were reminded that only 1 per guest per stay was the rule) but suffice to say - we have never experienced the contempt for customers we received here and will never, ever return.	
Jun 3 2008 	Great place to stay	We can't say enough about how wonderful our stay here was. From the doorman down on the street level all the way to the housekeepers and maintenance man. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and very helpful. The warm chocolate chip cookies didn't hurt either! Our room was on the 28th floor and a corner room overlooking Times Square. Even though we were directly across the elevators, the room was still very quite. The hotel is located where we would could get the subway, bus or a taxis without walking far. (Walking around this great city is another story!) We would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. The location is great, the employees are outstanding and the hotel itself is tops. Thank you for making our first stay to NYC fantastic. We will definitely be back.	
Jun 2 2008 	Brilliant central location for first visit to New York	Have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Doubletree. As we had been led to expect , hotel right in the heart of Times Square with all the crowds of people so no surprises! We were on the 42nd Floor with great views and virtually no street noise unless we opened the window! The suite was perfect for us holidaying with two teenagers (13 and 15yrs) - TV's in both living area and bedroom so no arguments! Doors to bathroom from bedroom and living area - with one child on sofabed in living area this meant less disturbance at night. Hotel location excellent - easy to visit Empire State Building, Maceys etc on foot and there is a subway station next door to hotel. Excellent diner round the corner (Evergreen) and great choice of restaurants in walking distance including Ruby Tuesdays and Joe's Broadway Grill on 46th St. Didn't use hotel restaurant. Pre-booked tickets on-line beforehand for Lion King (superb) and also for ESB and for 3 hour Manhattan island boat tour with Circle Line which we can thoroughly recommend. Also took Gray Line bus tours Uptown and Downtown - both guides on these tours gave interesting and funny commentaries and was great way to get a taste of all the different neighbourhoods. Grand Central Station worth a visit - look at the ceilings. No real problems with hotel - room was clean although some of the wooden furniture was a bit tatty. Only v. minor issues during our stay i.e. batteries flat in one TV remote and also reception forgot warm cookies when checking-in but both resolved straight away. Would definitely stay here again with family.	
May 30 2008 	Gets Worse Every Year	Check-in was unpleasant. The bathroom sink drained very slowly and the room was dirty. This place gets worse every year. We will not be back.	
May 30 2008 	CleanGood Value	Ok, So just got back from a five day break with the family to the Doubletrees Guest Suites Hotel in Times Square.First the negatives (Thankfully few):- Only one TV remote for two televisions - to be honest this was not enough of a problem for me to even bother the hotel management.Coffee making facilities, whilst potentially great, as others have mentioned the cardboard cups were a bit of a disappointment. Also on one day the milk appeared to be &quot;off&quot;.Did not try food - so cannot comment on this aspect of hotel. On the plus side - location is of course great; whilst we were there my girls (17 and 14) joined a large crowd to try to catch a glimpse of Usher at the MTV shop over the road and then on our last day there appeared to be some sort of TV show/audition for the lead in Legally Blonde which was in the theatre next door.Although we were in the heart of Times Square, our suite on the 22nd floor meant that there was little to disturb us by way of traffic noise etc. The drapes did a good job of keeping out the walls of neon just when you needed them to.I should also like to congratulate the hotel on its levels of cleanliness - the maids really do a good job and the rooms were spotless.( Whilst returning to the airport in a shuttle, we were taken to some of the other hotels used by International travellers and believe me I was glad to have chosen Doubletrees Guest Suites).	
May 27 2008 	Horrible	Upon checking in we were told we would have to wait until 4:30 or 5 for the room that was assigned to us (check-in is supposed to be at 3!)--unless we wanted to take a different (code for &quot;less desirable&quot; room.) We had paid extra for a room with a view of Times Square. The room itself was shabby and filthy. There were black hairs on the white sheets and on the bathroom floor. The bathroom does not have a fan so the entire suite smelled damp and musty. The people at the front desk are extremely rude and unhelpful. We have stayed here before and every year it gets worse. We will not stay here again.	
May 27 2008 	Another great stay!	This was our 3rd stay at the Doubletree Times Square and once again, we were very pleased. We booked a Triple A rate for $305 for the holiday week-end, which was not that bad I thought. The suites are large with a door seperating the living area and bedroom area, seperate bathroom doors leading to the LR and BR. Microwave and refrigerator. We were on the 25th floor and only heard one siren in the course of three days, not much of a view from our room this time, but that was okay. Staff could not be more accommodating, Concierge service outstanding. We were assisted in purchasing the Express Pass for the Empire State Bldg and it saved us at least 90 minutes in line. Hotel location is key here, with every theater within walking distance, subway station steps away, and plenty of eateries and shopping. Small diner called &quot;Evergreen&quot; around the corner for a reasonable breakfast. Hotel parking is also around the corner and is $35 self park and $45 valet, we were able to pull right up front to unload and load. The property is very busy and if there is a down side to the hotel, it would be you have to take one elevator from the street to the lobby, then another elevator from the lobby to your suite, so at busy times there was a short wait. In addition, if crowds bother you, then this location may be &quot;too busy&quot;, because hoards of people are in this area day and way into the night. Hold your children's hands tightly.	
May 23 2008 	Just what I needed after running the Boston Marathon	I ran the Boston marathon, woke up the next day, drove to New York and stayed at the Doubletree for 3 nights with my 3 children. It was perfect. Right in the heart of Times Square, everything you need within walking distance. (or barely walking...as I was recovering from the race) Starbucks, Greyline, Rays Pizza, M &amp; Ms store, St. Patrick's Cathedral...and much more. It felt safe and easy and it was comfortable with 2 rooms and 2 T.V.s. The best thing was that they allowed 5 people since it had 2 beds plus the pull-out sofa. Many hotels in New York limit you to 4 people so then you have to sneak one of your kids in...which is weird when you're paying almost $500 a night. Would definitely stay there again if I ever take my whole family to NY again...we had a great time.	
May 21 2008	Super location clean room nice staff	We were on the 31st floor in a room that had a double bedroom, a bathroom and a lounge area that had a small kitchenette. With double-glazed windows and being so high, the room was very quiet. The lounge had a sofa that was also a fold-away bed. I slept on this during our stay and it was not the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in, but bearable for a few days. Both the lounge and bedroom had large wide screen TVs.The Kitchenette was simply a small cabinet top with a microwave and a fridge that was the size of a 19inch television. There was no oven hobb. A slight irritation was caused by the kitchenette not having any crockery or cutley. We made use of the Kitchenette for breakfast in the morning, but we had to first go to the local 'Duane Reade' drugstore and buy some plastic cutley and paper plates. The room was decorated quite nicely and, including the bathroom, was clean. The major selling point of this hotel is its location; being right on Times Square. Super convenient for the theatres, shopping, subway and restaurants. We were even able to walk to Port Authority (5 blocks) when the time came to catch the bus to the airport and fly home. The hotel had a restaurant, but we found the food quite average but because of its location to so many alternatives this didn't really matter.I would be happy to stay at the Doubletree again. (You each get a quite delicious cookie when you first check in).	
May 20 2008 	Nice Theatre District property	Whether you are travelling alone or with kids, if you want to be in the heart of Manhattan action, look no further.A two-room suite with a kitchenette at this price in the centre of Manhattan doesn't easily get beaten.You are right on Times Square (which, for some people, may not be the ideal place to stay), within walking distance of most Broadway theatres and restaurants and within walking distance also of Fifth Avenue shopping, the MoMA, Time Warner Centre, Rockefeller Centre, the Empire State Building and Central Park. How do you better this?Our suite on one of the highest floors overlooked Times Square and Manhattan skyscrapers and we loved the view.The suite had a bedroom and a sitting/living room, with a television in each of them, a largish bathroom (two sinks), a kitchenette (with crockery and cutlery available if you wish), a Wolfgang Puck coffee maker with unlimited supplies of gourmet tea and coffee, Neutrogena toiletries, an in-room safe,iron and ironing board, a referigerated mini-bar and an additional empty referigerator for guest use. The hotel also has a very efficient laundry service. All the stuff you need to make your Manhattan stay comfortable.I would have been happier though had brighter colors been used in the suite interior. Dark colors do tend to make the suite less cheery than it could have been.The staff are exceptionally nice to you, at every level. Housekeeping could be better though. Use the Concierge's desk only for information but stay away from it for theatre bookings. Lots cheaper if you call Ticketmaster.If the Times Square action right outside is agreeable to you, this is an excellent option.	
May 15 2008 	Large space Great Location	Four ladies booked this hotel for a New York getaway staying for four days. The location was perfect for walking to most all of the attractions in the city. We appreciated the kitchenette, complete with sink and mirror, which doubled as a second place for applying makeup and fixing hair.The rooms were well appointed and more spacious than most others in other NYC hotels. The bedding was plush, pillows soft. The TV's were old style rather than flat screen. We did have a problem with noisey neighbors who had no respect for anyone trying to sleep, partying at all times of the night.The bath was large with good sound proofing, which was good since the pipes in our room clunked when water was on. The towels were large and thick. We did have a problem obtaining a cab one rainy morning. The doorman told us the other doorman, who evidently obtains cabs for guests, was not there at the moment and he would not help us. We hailed our own cab on a side street in the rain. Don't try to secure a cab yourself from the line of cabs in front of the hotel with an &quot;Off Duty&quot; sign. They will only respond when the doorman from the hotel hires them for a guest.The McDonald's next door was handy for a quick breakfast. The best bargain was the 72 hour Hop On and Off Grayline Tour Bus ticket that we obtained on the internet for $55.00. The pick-up site is only a block away.	
May 11 2008 	Great Location - Good Value	If you're looking to be in the hustle and bustle of NYC, you have to consider Times Square. This hotel is right in the middle of it and considering the size of most NYC hotel rooms, the Doubletree Suites is a great value. The NRW subway line is right next to the hotel entrance, so getting around by subway is a breeze. Being in the heart of Times Square guarantees you access to a taxi without much of a wait. There are plenty of restaurants just steps from the entrance of the hotel, from high-end steak houses to chain restaurants to McDonalds, it's all right there. Hotel staff were polite and accommodating. Service in the restaurant within the hotel and the hotel bar was slow and food was 'just okay'. French Onion Soup was odd and very salty, while the chicken quesadilla was actually quite good. Room was spacious. Separate bedroom and living area. Couch unfolds to a bed. Work desk is very nice. Room includes a small fridge which didn't get quite cold enough for dairy products, but good enough for what I needed. There's also a microwave and single-cup coffee maker which I bordered on over-using. I left a note for housekeeping to leave extra coffee (standard is two packs of regular and one of decaf) and I ended up with quite the stash of coffee packs!One error on the bill when I checked out which was quickly taken care of with a smile. I would stay here again if I needed to be in the midtown area.	
May 10 2008 	NY Weekend	The location is great if you want to be in a very busy area, and it's within walking distance of theaters, shopping, etc. We stayed the weekend (Fri-Sun) on the 24th floor (very quiet room, but poor view). The front desk staff was very courteous, quick to respond to requests and the bell staff stored our luggage until check-in and at check-out (one bell person was rude at check-out but he seemed to be having a bad day). Our room was not entirely clean - dirt on sheets, hair in the bathroom - so we had to request housekeeping clean the room again, which they did. The room size was adequate for 3 adults (considered large by NYC standards but this was our first visit so hard to judge), but lighting in the bedroom was below average and the bathroom lacked an exhaust fan. We plan to return to NYC next year but will probably not return to this hotel, mainly because we'd like to be on a less congested street and considering the costs ($459 + taxes per night) we can stay somewhere nicer for the same amount.	
May 5 2008 	Great location but sketchy service...	Went to NYC for a Girls Weekend. Decided to stay here for location even though much more pricey than other hotels.Check-in was great. Very helpful at the front desk and the concierge desk. Bell hops and restaurant staff pretty rude as we were not treated very nice. Breakfast buffett is a joke. Had to beg for silverware and they had run out of clean napkins. No one there yet had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Restaurant is drab and food is bad!! The beds are comfortable but the showers are dirty. Would probably stay somewhere else next time as way to busy area are too loud outside to sleep...	
May 1 2008 	Paid the price to enjoy Manhattan	We visited Manhattan this April and searched for an inexpensive place to stay. Tripadvisor reviews for inexpensive hotels were so terrible that I decided to go for a higher level hotel. Found great reviews for this hotel and decided to pay $400 per night for a family of 5.Turned out that it was a good deal - we got a clean, well-maintained and service-oriented place to stay, right in the middle of Manhattan, so we could stroll easily to most of the attractions we were there to see. We arrived very early to the hotel (much before official check-in time) and were given our room right away, plus a warm cookie as a welcome present (small gesture, but pretty effective).	
Apr 29 2008 	Great Place to stay with the family!!	We have stayed at the Doubletree Suites hotel several times with the kids. There are two rooms, so it's spacious and a bargain by New York standards. There's a great breakfast buffet that gets you off to a good start for the day. I love the location and it's wonderful to be right at Times Square!! My husband and I like to stay at the Waldorf when it's just us, but the Doubletree is great for Theatre and nightlife when taking kids (I say kids, but they are 24, 19, and 16!)	
Apr 28 2008 	Losing its Edge	I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Doubletree Times Square. The first 3 nights I was alone on business and my wife and two kids joined me for the 4th night. My first 2 hours at the hotel were miserable - wifi not working and after 30 minutes on the phone with tech support, was told that there was a problem with the local router and I should move to another section of the hotel. Wifi worked fine in room #2, but when I opened the fridge, there was a half eaten nacho plate from the previous occupant. Room service varied from fine (can't mess upa club sandwich) to lousy (cold - not even lukewarm- eggs and bacon). I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past year, and each time the service seems to drop a notch.	
Apr 27 2008 	Fantastic Hotel in the middle of everything!	We just returned from a short stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square and it could not have been any better! We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was terrific to have the extra space. We arrived at 10:00 am and our room happened to be ready even though check in isn't until 3:00 pm. Our luggage was delivered within 10 minutes. We booked the American Girl package and my daughter received a special bed, blanket and pillow for her American Girl doll. She was thrilled! The room had a microwave and small fridge which was nice to have when traveling with children. The staff, from the doorman, the guest services representative, concierge to housekeeping were friendly and helpful. We ate dinner one evening in the hotel restaurant and the food was very good. This hotel is right in the middle of Times Square and you can walk to just about everything. We will definitely be back! Check out the Evergreen Diner around the corner for a great breakfast!!	
Apr 23 2008	Great location Very nice staff!	Just returned home from mini-vacation with two young children. Doubletree Suites was a perfect spot for all the tourist attraction NYC has to offer especially if traveling with children. At check in, Damaris, our guest service agent was kind, helpful, and very knowledgable about the city. We arrived at 10am and our room was ready even though check in isnt until 3pm. It was nice after a long train ride to get up to our room and relax with our nice warm cookies. We had a corner Times Square view room on the 10th floor with a view that cant be beat. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. And quite a decent size for a NYC hotel room. One minor complaint would be the smell of smoke from all the guests smoking in the hallways near the elevators though this really isnt the hotel's fault. Overall, a great stay.	
Apr 22 2008 	Absolutely Fantastic	We stayed at this hotel for 4 days, and we absolutely loved it. The staff are very friendly and actually cared. They ALL went out of their way to make the stay enjoyable. There was no question or request that they did not take time for and honor it. They ALL went above and beyond. They view was excellent and the rooms were superb for a city. The breakfast is fantastic in the restaurant, and employees were very accomodating there also. Bellhops gave us directions and hints as to what to do for sightseeing. There is a concession at the concieriege for booking play tickets also. We saw Wicked and Young Frankenstein, both were sold out but they were able to get tickets. They were expensive for the service, but for Wicked we had center stage second row, they couldn't have been any better. FANTASTIC and eventhough it is an expensive hotel, it is worth it.	
Apr 21 2008 	In the heart of the action	We stayed in these suites for 4 nights with two children aged 12,11. The kids loved the location as they could watch the ever changing neon signs (especially the M&amp;M's one directly across the street. The accomodation was clean and adequate. The staff were pleasant and our plumbing problem was immediately attended to when pointed out. The hotel is particularly useful if you are interested in the shows as they are right in the heart of the theatre district. Most of the sights are within easy walking distance and you will be spoiled for choice for eating out especially breakfast. Try the Manhattan deli - fabulous selection and very reasonably priced. I can't really fault these suites and yes I would stay there again.	
Apr 15 2008	Central position	Decided to stay here as we were travelling with two teenagers. Times Square was a great position for the teenagers but too busy and crowded for me and my husband. It would have been really bad in the summer. Having said that, the hotel was fine and the staff helpful. Rollaways are not available which meant my husband had to sleep on the not very comfortable pull out couch.Had a two bedroom suite in the Eastgate Towers last year which overall I prefered.	
Apr 14 2008 	Great place to stay with children	Stayed there last week with the family (two children under 10), it was a great experience. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and serviced every day.We had complimentary breakfast included which was ok, though the eating area is not very inspiring.Over all I think this was exactly what we needed and having the two rooms made a big difference in the evening when the kids went to sleep.	
Apr 10 2008 	Great for families with teenagers.	We are a family with two older teenagers (girl and boy) who stayed for the first week in April 2008 at The Doubletree Guest Suites, Times Sq. - it was exactly what we needed. The location is so central, you can walk (if you're fit) everywhere.We booked directlly through hotel website as I found this much cheaper then Expedia etc. We had a 2 dble, 2 rm, large suite-sofabed highflyer because of anticipated noise - you really can't hear much on the 34th floor! - and the views were great. The room were average size with loads of storage. The decor was a little tired and worn, but perfectly acceptable. The two double beds seemed a little small to us, but the kids had them and we stayed on the kingsize sofa-bed which was comfy and worked out fine. This is the best solution for teenagers as you can shut the door on their mess as parents are more likely to keep the living area tidy! The &quot;kitchenette&quot; area was useful for refreshments and snacks. We stocked the fridge with juice, milk, fruit, biscuits and beers etc and didn't need to touch the expensive mini-bar, although we discovered too late you can ask for crockery/cutlery if you wanted to have cereal/bread etc. The extra sink is useful as an extra vanity area. The shower was powerful and the room spacious, a door to each room was useful for privacy. The room was thoroughly cleaned and beds made daily. The staff were friendly and helpful. The Concierge was not at all pushy as I have read and helpfully booked better helicopter flights for us than I had seen on the internet (Manhattan Helicopters only company licenced to fly OVER the city) Only thing we had against The Doubletree was the breakfast. This was not included in our tariff but we decided to try it one morning. Expensive and dull! $18 continental and $24 for cooked. Literally round the corner from the hotel, we found the Evergreen Diner. Friendly, fast service, lots of locals having breakfast, loads of choice, large portions and it cost an average of $5-6 each! We became regulars and didn't need to eat again till evening! Our whole experience of New York was great and The Doubletree was a welcome haven to come back to at the end of an exhausting day. Even our (seemingly) world weary teenagers found it all pretty cool especially the free warm cookies which they had the cheek to ask for daily!	
Apr 7 2008	Great for families	My husband, 12 year old and 8 year old followed up our DC trip with a three night stay in NYC. I was so nervous because of the bed bug epidemic in NY (if you don't know what I am talking about, check it out on the internet, you need to be informed.) My husband checked in ahead of us to check everything out and all was well. The room was clean overall, although showing its age in little ways that I found to be acceptable. I am picky so I will mention that I noticed that in the hallways you can tell that the vacuum doesn't make it to the edges (guess they would need an attachment)so it is a little dirtier there, but not horribly so. This was also true around the door jam that led from the bedroom into the bathroom--a little dusty. Otherwise very clean.Comfy beds. Slept great. This is NY so no free breakfast (buffet was around $24 or so I believe, not sure, didn't buy it) and parking was $35 a day with no access to car unless we wanted to pay more, but that is to be expected there. One nice security feature is that you walk past a man at a podium when you first go in to the elevators off of the street , who asks to see your key until he becomes familiar with you. The elevator stops at the lobby on the third floor so you need to then walk past the front desks to the next bank of elevators to proceed to the rooms. Great location. About 2 short blocks from the subway, could see the M &amp; M store from our window (kids loved that), close walk to the 3 story Toys R' Us, Hershey Store, etc.Expensive, but I think worth it. Friendly staff. Great cookies at check in!	
Mar 30 2008 	Great location; overall underwhelming	Hotel is in a great location. Dead in the middle of Times Square. Easy walks to the theatres and plenty of restaruants. If touring out of the area, convenient subway stops and plenty of taxis.Had a problem with reservations. Initially three of us going and had a king suite with sofa sleeper with Times Square view. Another daughter decided to go and I checked twice to make sure it was ok and was told it was. The week before the trip I called again to make triple sure and was told that they would not permit 4 in the room. After speaking to the manager, I was able to get reservations for a double with sofa sleeper. It made no sense to me to require the double beds instead of the king. The kids slept on the sofa anyway; we just had smaller beds to deal with. Very aggravating.Service is ok, nothing more. Rooms were cleaned well and were quiet and comfortable. Utilitarian but pretty expensive at $500+ a night with taxes.We wanted Times Square and were satisfied. If we come again, we will stay elsewhere though.	
Mar 25 2008	Great Location! Service is So so	Top notch location-you can not beat it. Rooms overlook Times Square, so you are in the heart of the action but block out the noise for some peace and quiet. Service is not anything special. They are really pushing certain tickets if you ask for help. Not too helpful about other things. Worth the money but could use some customer service lessons.	
Mar 20 2008	Beware concierge	The concierge is not a real concierge. They are there to sell you their products and tickets at a really high price. You can go across the street and buy Broadway tickets for 1/2 price or go tot the box office.	
Mar 18 2008 	Nice rooms	Big room, nice linens, very clean, great location, and affordable. Michael at the front desk was great! From the time we checked in to the time we check out we felt like we were a valued guest. Two Thumbs Up!Only negative and I mean the only.... typical problem with some hotels, drainage in the tub. They took care of it immediately!	
Mar 10 2008 	Well located great for families	Stayed over the weekend with a 4 year old and a friend, so the separate rooms worked out great. We did have to move rooms since the first one had a view of a wall (I guess if you use points you don't get a view!). Once we moved, we were on the 16th floor with great views. Bed was comfortable, rooms were clean and bathroom had been renovated. Very well located for any NYC activities. Staff was hit or miss on good service.	
Mar 10 2008 	Great for family group lots of room	Directly on Times Square, front door adjoins the front door to Legally Blonde. Right in the middle of the action, but crowds and pace on the sidewalks may be a bit intense for some, and particularly for anybody with a stroller or walking aid.Definitely worth upgrading to a package that includes the complimentary breakfast buffet. The buffet included fresh fruit, hot oatmeal, hot breakfast meats, omelettes and eggs made to order, pancakes and waffles to order, cold meat and cheese selection, smoked salmon, juices, breakfast pastries. Something for everyone, and open until 11:30 each morning. Our suite had two double beds plus living room and pull out couch. Decor very pleasant, kitchenette was helpful. Extra sink and large mirror in kitchenette area doubled as an extra vanity. Three women and all their stuff fit nicely, not crowded, very comfortable.The fitness center is under construction, temporary quarters are crowded but servicable. The business center had three computers and servicable printer, all worked well and was convenient.No complaints, great stay, will return if travelling with family. For a romantic holiday, go several blocks away from Times Square for a more calm and relaxing experience.	
Mar 7 2008 	Nice place	We stayed in a suite with two 6 month olds and three adults. The rooms were small, but very comfortable. The bathroom was huge! This location was convenient to restaurants and shopping. The babies loved the Hard Rock Cafe! I would stay here again.	
Mar 4 2008 	Falling Standards	Stayed again in Feb this year, we have stayed several times before but I think it will be the last time. Used to be our hotel of choice in NYC but the standards keep falling. Possibly the worst bit was a truly awful room service meal on Valentines night and the lack of any real desire to sort the problem. The size of the rooms are on the large side but there are better places in NYC for the same money. Sort yourselves out Doubletree.	
Mar 1 2008	Fantastic place to stay	My husband and myself, together with our 4 year old son stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites on 16th Feb 2008 for four nights to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday. Having never been to New York before, we wanted to be in the heart of Times Square and the Doubletree certainly is. We had a suite on the 9th floor and had a great view of Times Square and you couldn't hear any noise at night. My son slept on the double pull out sofa bed in the lounge which was more than adequate. Our bed was huge and very comfortable. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and when we needed more coffee for our room, housekeeping delivered it almost immediately. The fresh coffee machine came in very handy as while we were there is was quite cold, although on the Monday you didn't need a coat on! The Doubletree is within walking distance to Central Park, Empire State Building, Macy's and the Greyline Sightseeing Tour Bus Stop is opposite. There are plenty of places to eat and drink and some people say that eating and drinking in Times Square can be expensive. We found it very reasonable and around the corner there is an Bar/Restaurant called 'Lanagans' which the locals use and they make you feel very welcome, especially our 4 year old and the food is great there. We booked all our tickets to the Empire State, Statue of Liberty, Helicopter ride over Manhatten, Federal Reserve Bank, Hop on-hop off bus tour and a Broadway Show on-line before we travelled and are glad we did because you then have everything planned before your trip and everything went to plan. You cannot go wrong by staying at the Doubletree and we would definately stay there again.	
Feb 29 2008 	Excellent	Excellent Hotel with a great location in Times Square and within walking distance of all main attractions and shops. Perfect for a 1st time visit to New York.Suites were very clean and comfortable - rellay nice to have a lounge area after a longs days shopping and sight seeing. No breakfast at this hotel but there are loads of delis and diners to choose from....we particularly liked Evergreen which was just around the corner.The subway stop is right next door to the hotel so perfect when you want to venture a little further.All in all I would recommend this hotel and would definitley stay here when I visit New York again.	
Feb 29 2008 	Great Stay!	We stayed at the doubletree for Valentine's Day weekend and loved it. The room was clean, and big by NY standards. We live in NY now, but thought it might be fun to do a &quot;tourist thing.&quot; All in all, it was reasonably priced and had great views of Times Square and the Hudson River (I should mention, we were on the 31st floor).I would reccomend this hotel highly!	
Feb 26 2008 	Great Hotel in Wonderful City	My sister and I took our dream vacation to New York City and decided to stay smack dab in the middle of Times Square. The Doubletree Guest Suites is right in the center of everything. We got a one bedroom suite with a pull out sofa (okay, the sofa wasn't very comfortable) and a fantastic view of Times Square. We arrived at about 7:30 AM and check-in wasn't until 3:00 PM, but our room was ready! our intention was to have them hold our bags until check-in but they sent us right up to a room.The employees at the concierge desk were SO FRIENDLY and accomodating. They talked with us and showed an interest in what we were doing in New York and how we were enjoying our stay. They helped us with reservations for dinner, last minute Broadway tickets, directions for sightseeing, etc. I thought the noise from the street would bother me and night, but it was actually very quiet. We didn't use the hotel facilities, but there is a restaurant, gym and cafe that looked great. The doormen were kind, and although they say you are required to show your room key when entering, they didn't seem to enforce that rule too much.The rooms were clean and provided exactly what we needed, a place to crash after a day of sightseeing and exploring.	
Jan 31 2008 	Nice Time Square Suite	This is a great location and a great choice if you want to have a 2-room suite. I traveled with my teenage son and this was perfect for us. I used the bedroom and he took the pull out sofa in the living room. The bathroom is off the hallway so we did not disturb each other to use the toilet during the night. We had a Time Square view which was really cool. The only down side is that the sofa bed was really hard to open. Once the houskeeper showed us how to do it, no problem. Also, the upholstery &amp; carpet is starting to show some wear &amp; tear. This hotel is consistently sold out so I'm sure these rooms take a beating! The front desk &amp; coffee bar clerks are friendly and the door guy always checks your key. Another down side, it's pretty hard to get a taxi from here, the corner is an awkward spot, a couple times a taxi driver asked where I wanted to go, then said he was not availble! I learned to get in the taxi first, then tell them where to go! One more point, I also stayed at the Hotel Qt and at the Hilton Times Square. Both of those other properties are better for a couple or single person. Hotel Qt is perfect for under 30 party atmospere. The Hilton is very nice for a couple.Would stay again if visiting NYC with children.	
Jan 22 2008	Great Hotel Great Location	If you have never been to NYC, then the price of hotels in general may give you cardiac failure. This hotel is no exception. Over $350 for a room?!? This hotel is on Times Square, so if you want to go to the Theater, or anyplace else in the city, this hotel is well located. There is a subway stop under the hotel to take you anywhere. The hotel is clean and quiet, and large for NYC hotel rooms. Staff was helpful. No real complaints.	
Jan 21 2008 	Awesome! ONLY way to do Times Square.	This was a stay surrounding a long weekend to see a play and go shopping. It was amazing! Great service and a BEAUTIFUL view of Times Square. Go for the Square view, it is worth it tenfold. Comfy bed, great amenities...walk right out into the action of Broadway and everything else NY has to offer. The staff was courteous and the room service was delicious. Enjoy!!! We even decided to add a night and the staff was great enough to keep us in the same room, even though it was already booked. Thanks, Doubletree!	
Jan 18 2008	Accommodation	I went to New York with my 15 year old daughter for the first time in October 2007. We were originally allocated a king suite on arrival. While it had a lovely view, the sofa bed was unusable as the springs could be felt through the thin mattress. I complained to reception and was reallocated a room with double beds (as I had paid for) - but no view. Apparently the room type is not guaranteed if not booked directly with the hotel. The sofa bed was better than the first one but far short of the comfort of the bed. The result was that my daughter slept in my room. I found this extremely inconvenient and made the accommodation poor value for money - at around £300 ($600) per night I expected to be able to fully use both rooms as bedrooms and I could have saved a lot if I had been prepared to settle for a suite with both sleeping in one room. On check-out I reported that my daughter's MP3 player was missing. I followed up with an email complaint when I got home - but they did not even bother to reply.Good location but could have done better for the money. Safe was very awkward to use at it was at the bottom of a cupboard - but don't be tempted to leave valuables out! P.S. We still had a great holiday.	
Jan 14 2008 	Convenient rooms and location staff unfriendly	I travel to New York City one or two times a month with my family and it is very nice to have two rooms for the 4 of us. The hotel is convenient to many attractions in New York City and does have a restaurant on site. However, the breakfast buffet is not very good, but edible. The people at the front desk are not friendly bordering on downright nasty sometimes. One women at the front desk was downright rude. When I contacted double tree about it they did nothing, so my husband and I stay elsewhere when possible.Except for the staff and the breakfast, the rest is fine. However, when you pay $400 + a night I would like something better than fine.	
Jan 14 2008	Great location	We stayed here from Jan 9th- Jan13th 2008. A suprise trip for our daughter's 21st birthday. Asked for a room with a good view and got a 13th floor corner room.....not a good one, views over times square, but tiny room, only sofa bed and no armchair, very scruffy, bedside table on only one side of king(??) bed. Asked to change the next day and staff very accomodating, paid a bit more, but got a much bigger room on 30th floor, much more comfortable for the three of us. A superb location, fell out of bed to get coffee and doughnuts for breakfast from a large selection of places. Right near broadway for shows, subway next door, staff very helpful and friendly, room cleaned everyday and beds made up, fresh towels. Very quiet in rooms considering you are right in the hub of things, and great blackout curtains.We loved it!!Checked out at 12 noon and as we idn't have to leave for the airport 'till 3pm, they stored our luggage for us so we could do lunch and last minute shopping.Grabbed bags at 2.45, downstairs and doorman grabbed a cab, couldn't have been easier!	
Jan 12 2008 	Wonderful Christmas Holiday	We stayed here between 22nd December 2007 and 5th January 2008. We checked in at 9pm and it was really easy! We were given a corner suite overlooking Times Square on the 22nd floor. I must say, I wish we were higher. During the day, we could hear street noise and traffic. At night it was quieter, we only heard a few sirens or horns. The view was great! But the flashing signs in the windows did bug us a little, but at night the curtains blocked all of the light so sleeping was easy!The rooms are big for NY hotels. They have 2 rooms - sitting room with a couch, desk, chair and TV. Also a sink, microwave, mini bar, fridge and coffee maker. The coffee maker had take-away cups (like starbucks) so we made our morning coffee to go! The stay was great, housekeeping were wonderful and helpful and the front desk and concierge were great. HOWEVER do not book show tickets with them! We used broadwaybox.com and got 1/2 price tickets for Chicago and Hairspray. We had 3rd row for Chicago and 2nd row Mez, for Hairspray - Awesome seats at half the price! Concierge wanted to charge $152 per ticket and we got them for $62.New Years Eve was easier then we thought. We were at TGI Fridays a few doors down and left at 1am. Took around 1 hours to get back to our room. The staff were great and it was very well run!Christmas in New York is magical! Even though it didn't snow it was such a wonderful experience and the Doubletree was great!	
Jan 11 2008 	Excellent service at this Doubletree	Mr Flippitti and I stayed here from Dec 10-16, 2007. Our suite was on the 39th floor with excellent views. Our daughter flew up from DC to join us halfway through our stay. She slept on the pull-out sofa and found it very comfortable. There were extra pillows for the sofabed but we had to call the front desk to get an extra blanket. They delivered it within 20 minutes. The two-room suite also had a small fridge, coffeemaker and supplies (with styrofoam cups - yuck!) , a microwave and safe. The bedroom and living rm each had a big flat screen TV and enough drawer space to store your clothes for a long stay. The bathroom was also large with upgraded Neutrogena amenities and big fluffy towels which housekeeping always replenished. Breakfast was included in the rate which was nice because we don't like having to go out and forage for breakfast every morning. Breakfast included made-to-order eggs or omelets but the line was often pretty long. They also had lots of fresh fruit, pancakes, cereal and breads. Service was excellent and the restaurant staff was always friendly. We also ordered room-service breakfast one morning. It was delivered within 30 minutes, warm and our omelet orders were perfect!The concierge desk was very helpful, especially with restaurant recommendations and directions and helping us find our way around the subway system. Housekeeping cleaned our room every day, usually knocking at our door by 9AM. They always did an outstanding job replenishing our coffee supplies and making up the sofa bed. We also got turndown service (even the mints). We used the bellman downstairs to help us get a cab twice and both times, they delivered. The hotel entrance is on a corner and during the holidays, it's incredibly busy and congested so catching a cab out front is a lengthy process. We had a late night dinner at the hotel restaurant once when it was pouring rain and cold, our feet hurt from sightseeing and we just didn't want to go out and deal with the crowds. The dinner menu is limited and the food is pretty mediocre so I'd only eat there as a last resort.	
Jan 3 2008 	Great location.	Can't beat the location.Rooms are large enough for up to four persons and include not only a convenience bar, but also a fridge, microwave, coffee maker and security safe.Concierge service very helpful.Business center had only three computers, and I did find all three occupied one morning.No complaints.	
Jan 1 2008 	Great Location But Is It Worth It?	There is no doubt Christmas is the best time in New York, especially for this warm weather Texas couple. We wanted to stay on Times Square because of the central location, lights and just plain interest in doing so (first time). We knew the price would be high - $650 per night, high floor, Times Square view, but we also expected some value for the dollars spent. The good things: Excellent concierge service, especially for directions. Very central location - everything is easily in walking distance, including a great Irish pub just around the corner. Metro is right next door. Hotel is clean, with all suites (we had a problem - more below, our friends did not). The bad things: we left the hotel each day by mid morning and each day when we returned - late afternoon - the room was not made up. A daily call had to be made to remind the hotel we had been forgotten - even after late afternoon returns. When offered a room off of the elevator banks (I should have known better) DO NOT accept the offer, even if promises are made this is an excellent suite. It is not - more hallway than room, no room in the bedroom and no room in the second room - great view, but NO room to move around. One would think the elevator noise would be overpowering - it was not - didn't even hear it, thus our reason to stay in this room (foolish us). Yes, ask for the view on a high floor - it's worth it, but do not accept a suite behind the elevator banks. You will need to leave the room just to make up your mind. Prices are high in the lounge, but to be expected. Bring your own computer - $.50 a minute is a bit much in the business center. No need to eat at the hotel - just not worth the price or effort as there are way too many great eateries close-by. Also, forget the door man in front - too busy to get you a cab (don't know why, but that's not their thing). We did like the security and the resulting peace of mind. Would we stay again? Really, once you have stayed on Times Square there is really no reason to do it again. There are plenty of great hotels in Manhatten and it's so easy to get around, so why pay the price to stay on Times Square? Got to do it once, though, and if you want a suite (two rooms) the Doubletree is okay, albeit the value is just not there. Perhaps the W across the street has a better feel for how to take care of their customers - certainly having to ask the Doubletree front desk to clean the room each day - sometimes twice in a day - after some hard walking, sightseeing and shopping is not our idea of great service/value for the price paid.	
Dec 31 2007 	Excellent Hotel in Times Square	Stayed 7 nights in the Conference Suite on the 38th floor (Diamond Upgrade from a standard king bed) in the middle of Christmas season. Bed was very comfortable and sofa pull-out bed easily fit 2 people. The view of Times Square was amazing! The HHonors free breakfast buffet was better than any Hilton hotels I've been to. The staff was excellent! Included turn down service. Can't beat the location, walking distance to all of the Broadway shows and right next to the subway entrance. Loved NYC at Christmastime &amp; the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square gets 2 thumbs way up!	
Dec 28 2007 	The Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square was FABULOUS	We stayed at the Doubletree Guests suites last week and had a wonderful time. It is in the center of everything. Even with kids most sites are an easy walk. The rooms were immaculate and comfortable, and extremely large by New York standards. We had a room on the 32nd floor and had amazing views and actually left the curtains to the main bedroom open all night to enjoy the lights and sights of Times Square. The breakfast buffet was good, and all hotle staff was extremly helpful. We would recommend this to anyone staying in Manhattan, and definately plan to make this our #1 choice on our next trip to the City.	
Dec 21 2007 	Spectacular Location	Big room for New York standards. Close to everything (but can be a bit hectic getting there due to all the traffic in Times Sq.). Breakfast was included since I'm a Gold Hilton Honors Member. Pretty standard stuff, but nice since it is free. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Two room suite definitely helps you spread out a little especially after fighting the crowds just to get to the front door. Great for the first time visitor to NYC since everything most people want to see is within walking distance.	
Dec 7 2007 	Big rooms- Slightly tired rooms	Great hotel for a family who wants to be right in the heart of the action. For single travellers there are nicer hotels in the area. First room I was given looked like it had been well used, second room although smaller was a corner room and in much better decoration. Annoys me that you have to pay for Internet access- now staying at the Hilton Garden Express in Chelsea. Smaller room but great neighboorhood and no charge for Internet. Laundry costs in this hotel are also exhorbitant even by NY standards	
Dec 5 2007 	DOUBLETREE GUEST SUITES - GREAT SERVICE WITH A SMILE	The Doubletree was more than we could have hoped for. After making an 11th hour decision to travel to NYC for Thanksgiving, my children (ages 18 and 15) and I, with the help of this forum, selected the Doubletree as our home away from home. We booked less than 48 hours before our arrival at a rate of less than $400 per night. Check in was a breeze even though we arrived before 3pm. Our room (2907) had an amazing view of Times Square. The most appealing aspect of the hotel was location, location, location. The King bed was exceptionally comfortable and large enough for all 3 of us (we accidently fell asleep while watching a movie). The friendliness of the staff was a pleasant surprise. The doorman always greeted us by name and the concierge staff pulled off the unbelievable feat of procuring affordable orchestra level tickets( less than 4 hours before curtain) to one of the few Broadway Shows in production at that time.I unequivocally recommend this hotel for travelers that love being &quot;in the midst of it all.&quot;	
Dec 3 2007	Great time at Double Tree Times Square	My husband and I, with our two sons, aged 10 and 14 stayed here for 3 nights. Our suite was on the 37th floor with fantastic views over times square. The rooms were great and spacious, very large bathroom which was imaculate and lovely lounge area with a pull out sofa bed that my oldest son slept on. There was plenty of extra bedlinen and pillows available in the room. We did not have any problems with check-in, very polite and friendly staff, great warm chocolate chip cookies on arrival.The hotel is in a fantastic location so we never actually dined in the hotel restaurant. There are so many diners, restaurants and fast food places nearby that we were spoilt for choice. We went on the open top bus tours. You can buy tickets from right outside the front of the hotel. It was a great way to see all the sights and they pointed out places we would never have found by ourselves.We had a great time at the Double Tree Guest Suites in Times Square, and while we felt it was expensive we would definatly return and stay here again if we came back to New York.	
Dec 2 2007 	Poor value and poor response to complaints	I stayed here for 6 nights in September 2007 with my two sisters. We arrived very late in the day after a long flight from London. I had specified that we wanted two beds plus a sofa bed; however, the sofa bed was broken. We called the reception desk, but they didn't have any solution to offer. There wasn't even any bedding for the sofa bed in the room, so we had a very uncomfortable first night and were unable to unpack. The next morning, we were allocated a different room to which we moved ourselves. The very nice lady on reception offered us complimentary breakfast for our entire stay to make up for the bad start. We thought this was fair, and accepted. The breakfast is expensive and we had not planned to eat in the hotel otherwise. (By the way, with taxes, the cost of our stay was 4,102 USD). So, I was annoyed to find on departure that my credit card had been billed for breakfast for three for the first two days of our stay - another 135.77 USD. We probably wouldn't have spent that for the whole week! There was no one on reception when we left at 4 a.m., so I have been trying ever since to get a refund. It's been promised more than once, but still no show. Every mail I send seems to sit around for at least 2 weeks before I get another hopeless response. I just decided to stop wasting any more of my time and share my experience instead. I wouldn't use this hotel again, even though it's a good location. I feel it was very expensive for the standard of service we received, and I've been more than disappointed by the lacklustre response to my complaint.	
Nov 28 2007 	Mostly Good	My family and I stayed at Doubletree Time Square for 3 nights a few days ago. This was our 2nd stay at this property. Our first stay was in 2005. I must say that our first stay was a better one. Although I would still recommend the hotel, there are a few things that I would want others to be aware of. We asked for a Time Square View and we got one. We were given a corner room, which sounds great, but the room was much smaller than the typical 2 room suite. I would recommend that you stay away from the corner units if you are traveling with children and are hoping for the extra room. The view though was pretty good. The room we stayed in wasn't exactly the cleanest room. A few lights were out. I'm sure they just needed a light bulb. Some of the outlets did not work. The hair dryer did not work either. All of these things are just minor inconveniences, that could easily be corrected. The main negative was the lack of space in our room. This room would have been fine for 2 people, but we were traveling with 2 children and it was very tight quarters. Also, you lose the 2nd vanity in the corner rooms. Overall though, you can't beat the value.	
Nov 21 2007 	Excellent 4 Star Suite Hotel in Center of Times Square	My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square, NYC for two nites on Nov. 18th &amp; 19th. We picked this hotel because we were able to get an AARP rate of $254.00 compared to the $299 or higher rates of comparable nearby hotels such as the Marriott Marquis and the Renaissance. We had a king size bed in the bedroom and a sleeper sofa in the other room of the suite. The bed was very comfortable with a warm (down?) comforter in a duvet cover and plenty of pillows and soft sheets. As another reviewer wrote, you get what you see on the website. The bathroom has a single sink set in a very long counter, so there is plenty of room for all cosmetics, etc. and there is a large mirror above. it. There is a tub-shower with a shower curtain and the out-curving shower rod. The toliet is not in a separate room. There is plenty of hot water and water pressure. Everything was clean and the housekeeping service was perfect. The &quot;kitchen&quot; consists of a small refrigerator and a microwave and a &quot;bar type&quot; sink and a coffeemaker that dispenses into individual paper cups. We had no problems with leaking refrigerators or &quot;smelly&quot; shower curtains. There was plenty of hot water in the shower. We were on the 27th floor and heard no noise from outside. The airconditioning-heat worked well and was reasonably quiet. Our room did have a view of the Times Square billboards but I understand that some rooms do not. We came in on Sunday at about 1:30 pm and our suite was ready, but of course that will not always be the case. The people at the desk were courteous and quick. We did not use the concierge or room service. The three elevators run quickly and we had no waits. There is a convential TV in the bedroom and in the other room. We did not use the internet service in the room but did go to the business center where $5 is the minimum for internet service, plus $1 for each printed page. The buffet breadfast in the Center State restaurant is OK, with made to order omelets and pancakes, danish, some fresh fruit, etc. But at New York hotel prices of over $20 each, not a good value unless your room rates includes it or you are a high level of Hilton Honors and get it free. There is a 24 hour McDonalds next door to the hotel, perfect for breakfast to take back to your room. Another downpoint is that like many hotels in New York there are no vending machines and no shop, but there are newstands on the streets where you can get the New York Times and sodas at reasonable prices. Of course the &quot;convenience center&quot; in the room charges $3.50 for a soda. The big plus is the wonderful location near all the Broadway theatres so even if it is raining and cold, you can easily walk to the theatre. If you like New York Deli - walk to the Stage Deli at 53rd and 7th Ave - the hotel is at 48th st. &amp; broadway. The &quot;regular sandwiches&quot; and dessert portions will each feed two people and we think this is the best corned beef and pastrami anywhere. If you are sure the weather is going to be nice, you can get lower rates at hotels such as the Marriott Courtyards that are farther from Times Square. For comfort, cleanliness, and especially location, this is the place to stay if you are going to go to Broadway shows. We usually get tickets at a discount over the internet by going to the Playbill internet site where you can join the Playbill club for free and get discount tickets to many shows. Also the TKTS booth is across the street from the hotel.	
Nov 21 2007 	Great New York Hotel	We just got back from New York, and this hotel is an excellent find! Yes, it's pricey (but what &quot;decent&quot; hotel in NY isn't??)First of all, the location is right on Times Square. The subway is next to the hotel entrance, so getting around is a breeze. All guests entering the building must show their room key, which means they provide a high level of security. From the main entrance, you take an elevator to the third floor lobby to register. We had no delay checking in, and the reception agent was friendly and helpful. She even gave us extra home-baked chocolate chip cookies, which are a standard feature of Doubletree. YUM!Our suite was on the 35th floor. It was an &quot;upgraded&quot; suite due to my Hilton Honors points. That means we had complimentary internet access plus upgraded toiletries (by Neutregena) and a refrigerator and microwave oven. The living room had a sleeper sofa and the bedroom had a king bed.Excellent soundproofing... but if you want to open your windows, they DO open... a nice option for those who want some &quot;fresh&quot; air (I know, I know, it's New York air... but it's still OUTSIDE air instead of the recycled indoor stuff we breathe in all winter long)Nice selection of satellite channels (over 40), plus free HBO.Overall, a terrific hotel for New York visits, and I plan to return soon!	
Nov 19 2007 	Nice rooms located RIGHT ON TOP OF Times Square	Stayed 3 nights at this property on business in November. Definitely a good option in the area. Details...GOOD:--Rooms are very nice, and very large - suites in fact, at least on the 34th floor - Living room, large bathroom, nice bedroom--Bed was comfortable, had a variety of kinds of pillows--Living space had a nice office chair and modular desk to work at--Staff were all friendly and attentive--Location is, as in the title RIGHT ON TOP OF Times Square. Its right there. Walk out the door and you are there.BAD:--Have to take 2 elevator trips to the rooms, due to their security set up - 1 to enter the hotel lobby area, then a seperate one to the rooms--Be aware that many of the rooms, which face TS, will be hard to make dark at night. You can do all the usual tricks, but still, some of that neon will sneak through. Just be ready for that. The hotel does NOT have true black-out shades or anything like that.--Avoid the restaurant, which was mediocre at best and overpriced (like most of the food in that area).Overall good choice. Tends to be very pricey, even by the standards of the neighborhood - but you get what you pay for. If you need it really dark to sleep, you may want to look elsewhere. But otherwise, especially if the price is right, this is an excellent choice.	
Nov 16 2007 	Saved by the location	My Family and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square for 1 week in November 2007.The hotel is situated slam in the middle of Times Square, so the location is perfect.The price we had to pay was exorbitant (500 US$ per room per day!!!), but it was the New York marathon weekend and everything else was fully booked.Upon entering the hotel, you have to show the security guard your key. His is done for obvious reasons as the entrance is right on Times Square and anyone could just march in. You then enter the elevator which takes toy directly to the check in floor. After check in you take a different set of elevators that take you to the other floors.Check-in was smooth and fast and the staff were formally polite. Our rooms were spacious as all rooms of this hotel are 2-room suites. I understand that for New York this is a big plus. We were in the 36th floor so we also had great views.However the cleanliness of the rooms left a lot to be desired. There were crumbs on the desk surface, hairs in the bathtub, and a lot of old dust in all corners. The smoke detector was very dirty and, on a whole, the rooms (as well as the entire hotel) showed signs of very inadequate cleaning. I am a Diamond Honors member so we were given a floor with free WiFi internet, as well as complimentary breakfast, but that is where the perks ended.Breakfast was awful. The breakfast room is small and we had to wait in line for 10-15 to be seated. The whole area stinks of fried oil, the tables are dirty, the staff were bored and impolite, and the food was cold and oily. The only positive thing was that you could order eggs of pancakes to be prepared on the spot. We ate breakfast there only twice, as it was terrible.The concierge service is also very bad. Firstly they tried to sell us show tickets for 220 US$ saying it was sold out, and we walked next door to the theater and got them for 110 US$. Anytime we asked for information, they pressingly tried to sell us everything, even the Metro tickets!On the last day we asked the concierge to book a taxi to take us to the airport and they replied they could only book a private taxi for 180 US$ (as opposed to the normal 50-60$ for a normal taxi!!!).On the whole I would not recommend this hotel, even though the location is top.	
Nov 14 2007 	Supurb location Great view!	Location and great views are the draw of this Times Square hotel. I has a corner room (room numbers ending in &quot;03&quot; -- e.g. 2503 on the 25th floor, etc.) with stunning views directly down on Times Square to the east and north. What a treat! The hotel's entrance is at 7th Avenue and 47th Street, right in the middle of Times Square, so you couldn't possibly be in a better location if this scene is your thing. A warning -- crowds can be severe in this area, as can be traffic. Definitely leave the car at home. Public transit is close by and surprisingly easy to use, so you don't really need a car anyway.At $500. a night, I can't say this hotel is great value, but to be fair this is New York in late fall when all decent hotels anywhere in midtown were similarly expensive. Fortunately for me, work was paying. The lobby of this hotel is on the third floor, and is not a fun happening place like some hotels. Also, their bar and restaurant on the 5th floor was utterly dead and uninteresting when I briefly checked it out. But this is Times Square, so there is no shortage of bars, restaurants, and entertainment nearby! Try the Blue Fin across 7th Avenue, where for one overpriced drink you get to watch Theater goers stream by by the thousands. This is one of the best people-watching spots I've ever found! I also love &quot;Swing 46&quot;, a bar/restaurant/swing dancing club with a live band nearly every night on 46th street between 8th and 9th avenues.Staff at the Doubletree was friendly, if distant. I didn't get &quot;warmth&quot;, just competence.The room was very clean and well maintained. This is a two-room suite layout, with a small refrigerator and coffee maker in the outer room, but no microwave or other cooking implements. The bedroom was charming, and with its view would have been seriously romantic had my wife been able to come on this trip. Bottom Line: If you get a competitive rate, stay here for the view and location. You won't be disappointed.	
Nov 6 2007 	A Great Family Visit to NYC	We recently stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square during MEA weekend. This is when all of the schools close in Minnesota and everyone with kids flees to someplace else. The Doubletree was a great place to bring my kids. First, the rooms are all suites and are quite large, especially by New York standards. I'm a Hilton Hhonors Gold member, so breakfast in the hotel was free (otherwise, it would have been over $100 / day). The location is great for sightseeing as well. The hotel is in the heart of Times Square, a 5 minute walk to Rockefeller Center, three blocks from the subway, etc. Very close to everything with good transportation options.I would recommend this hotel for any tourist in NYC with or without kids.	
Nov 5 2007 	It really depends on what is important to you.	Noisy location, very pricey, no view, good sized rooms. Overpriced.	
Oct 18 2007 	Perfect for couple travelling with a teen!	Having read the reviews before going, I was skeptical, but we did not encounter any of the negatives I had read in other reviews. No stinky shower curtain, no defrosting fridge. The double elevator situation is odd, but never posed a problem. My wife and I took our fifteen year old niece on this trip so we were looking for a room like the Doubletree offers.We are Hilton Diamond members and were upgraded to a conference suite. It had a king in one room, a living area with sleeper sofa. And a conference/dining area with a table for 6. We tried and tried and could not get the sleeper sofa to unfold. We called for help, they said that in the conference suites the sofas don't unfold, so they brought up a roll-away twin bed, which was far more comfy than a sofa bed would have been. Times Square views were great and the black out curtains work perfectly. My wife and I prefer to stay downtown, and seldom spend much time in Times Square when we visit the city, but we figured since we were taking a teenager, why not? And it was perfect for her. She enjoyed the bright lights and hustle and bustle (she is from the country).Breakfast was included for us (Diamond Honor I guess) but it was not that great. The price is nearly $25 bucks, so if you have to pay for it, go somewhere else. If you get it free also, you might as well take advantage of it.	
Oct 18 2007 	Great if you love hustle and bustle	We just stayed here; me, my husband and our 6 year old daughter. Couple of quick points: (1) if you want to be centrally located, in the heart of the Times Square action, and near subways, buses, etc. this was a great pick. You step out of a very subdued entrance into the energy of the city right away so don't stay here if you don't want to be in the middle of the action (2) Room/suite was wonderful. Our daughter slept on the sofa bed and had her own tv and we had our own bedroom. Both rooms have access to the bathroom. Room was very quiet and clean with nice toiletries. (3) Hotel itself is nothing fancy; no grand lobby but has a low key bar and restaurant (which we didn't eat at). (4) staff was very helpful. Concieges were able to give us good input and front desk staff were nice (even gave us extra cookies when we misplaced the ones we were given at check-in). Fellow outside got us a taxi anytime we needed one.All in all, a wonderful experience. We used Hilton Honors points so I don't know the going rate and how it stacks up against other midtown hotels but if you want to be in this area and want the extra space of a suite, I highly recommend the Doubletree Suites.	
Oct 13 2007 	Best Hilton in NYC	Over the years we have stayed in most Manhattan Hilton facilities. This one is tops. Very functional suite. Can invite friends over for a drink before going out. Comfortable. Just the right size. Super location for night life and dining. Very quiet considering it's location. Friendly competent staff. Safe environment. Will return in the future.	
Oct 11 2007	Great Location	The location is right on 47th and Broadway. Convenient with the train stops. Walking distance to many theaters. We got the room ending in 01 and had a nice view. However, the 01 room is a little bit smaller but well worth it for the view of Times Square. Very near MTV studios, Toys R Us, and ESPN Zone.	
Oct 9 2007 	Fantastic Location Briliant Accomodation	Just back from a trip to New York. Stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites. Room was great size by New York standards, very clean and fantastic to have a view over Times Square. The location couldn't have been better for tours (right across the street) shopping on 5th Ave and Madison Ave. Would highly recommend the DoubleTree	
Sep 28 2007 	Great location slow elevators	We stayed at the Doubletree for 3 nights with our teenage children. The bedroom had 2 double beds and the LR had a sofa bed. Modern, clean and location can't be beat if you want to be right in the middle of Times Square. Subway station on the corner. The room had great darkening curtains. We were on an upper floor and we could see the people walking up and down Times Square from the window, which was very cool. (we're country folks) Our only problem was that Columbia University Law graduates were doing massive interviews throughout the hotel and the &quot;blue suits&quot; were squeezed into every elevator during the day. Check in was VERY SLOW...we waited in line for about an hour to check in...at least they handed out bottled water to everyone in line!	
Sep 14 2007	Great hotel	What a fantastic hotel, great location and super views over times square from our 28th floor.Super size suite but sofa bed not that big but okay for kids.No free wireless in room can pay ! gym was good and all hotel staff helpful. I liked the idea that everyone had to show room card to enter hotel felt very safe.Straight out door onto Times Square but in room no sound could be heard great peaceful nights. Super fast lifts.As another review stated we found fridge was defrosting when arrived and shower curtain was smelley! but only minor things.We would stay again.Great place for breakfast round the corner called &quot;Evergreens&quot; we went there every day. Also use underground trains to get around 2 dollars for any trip.	
Sep 11 2007 	Great hotel great location	Loved this hotel. Excellent location, very comfortable rooms, lots of space, perfect for business travel.Restaurant was so-so, but with so many alternatives within walking distance, it wasn't a problem.Service was great - a bit slow at times, but still very good.Would highly recommend &amp; would stay here again.	
Sep 10 2007 	Clean Hotel - No views - Lacks conviences	Very expensive hotel at $350 and not worth it. Other expenses will add up as well. This hotel has no parking in the building and no in/out . We were told there was parking so we rented a car. Valet parking $45/per day or $35/ per day for self parking. I tipped the bellman to bring my bags up only to have them brought up to the third floor lobby where I would check in. Another bellman would take your bags to your room from there to for another tip. Forget about bringing the cart with your bags in it up to the room, the bellman told me I would have to take it out it is against hotel policy -and unprofitable. Buffet breakfast for three $48 plus tip. The business lounge is a rip off $10 for 5 minutes (bring your own laptop). I was told NY had a bed bug problem - not in this hotel it was clean and comfortable. Overall the hotel lacked hospitality and I felt like I was nickle and dimed to death. My suggestion wait for lower rates and stay at the Waldorf for the same price.	
Sep 7 2007 	Great City..okay hotel	Having already been to NYC, my husband and I thought it would be fun to bring our 3 girls to NYC for a family vacation. When my husband and I went a few years ago we stayed at the Marriott Marquis which I will do again next time I go. Trying to save money we booked The Double Tree Suites this time. What they call a suite is tiny for five us although we were told we would be comfortable. We thought we could put our 9 and 12 year old daughters on the pull out couch to sleep...it was very uncomfortable! We ended up pulling the matress off of the pull out couch and put it on the floor for them to sleep. We were told we would get a suite with a view of Time Sqaure...what view?......I looked at an office building from my window for 5 days! Which was very disappointing since the view we had at The Marquis was fabulous...and my kids really missed out! Speaking of windows, they looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time! The room as a whole was okay, clean just smaller than expected. The staff was okay and prompt when asked for extra things such as pillows.	
Sep 6 2007 	Great HotelGreat location	IF you are looking for a great hotel that is in the middle of everything,look no further.This is an excellent location.Restaurants,theaters,etc are all in walking distance.I found all of the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The room was cleaned everyday and the warm chocolate chip cookie that we got on arrival was a nice surprise.	
Sep 2 2007	Great location. Some minor disappointments.	The location is great. Upon arrival I notified the front desk that the refridgerator was defrosting with water on the bottom and the armoir door hinge was broken. These items were never attended to during our six night stay. The toilet was slow flushing. Shower curtain was smelly.Conceirge gave us directions 5 or 6 blocks in the wrong direction and we almost missed our day trip. Later I notified the conceirge of the correct location they were unconcerned and did not write down the address. So I won't use them again. Ask a stranger on the street they are more than glad to help. We tipped housekeeping every day and very disappointed that the shower, toilet and floor were not cleaned every day in fact, maybe not cleaned at all during our stay. The shower curtain was replaced however. Maybe this is the standard in NY city but not something we are accustomed to in any other place even the bungalows on the beach in Mexico are cleaned every day.We are HiltonHonors Gold Members and were offered complimentary buffet breakfast each day of our stay which was adequate to start our day. Egg chef was great.	
Aug 30 2007 	Great Hotel For the price	Like many others, I booked our group using hotel wars. [--]It was all done by email and the rates and emails used were generic. We only need ten rooms but we still wanted a good rate. The Doubletree was awesome for location and I dont think that I will be lucky enough to get to go back at the price we got. In fairness, we did hear about this place from asianinbound.com or [--] which has some reviews for hotels that are &quot;tour friendly&quot; this hotel is not that tour friendly as is a hotel for real tourists who want to linger in the downtown hustle and bustle. The hotel was very well run and the front desk agent s and housekeeping almost always said hello each time. (which is a great sign). Loved it to the max.	
Aug 28 2007 	Exceeded My Expectations!	We booked the Hilton Doubletree on Times Square not expecting the highest level of service and room accomodation, but boy were we wrong! On arrival at the reception desk we were pleasantly greeted and were informed that our room was ready and due to us being a Hilton Honours Gold member were immediately offered a free full house breakfest for the duration of our stay! We were also delighted with our room which was located on the top floor (43rd). On setting up my laptop in the suite I was also given free wireless internet access due to my gold membership with hilton! The views from our room were great, overlooking times square and the room itself was well presented with a coffee machine, microwave, minibar and safe. Having stayed at the W Hotel on times square which is also supurb but now having stayed at the Doubletree Suites I will definately return here or another Doubletree establishment. The only issues we had was queuing for breakfast in the morning but as it was holiday season this was understandable. Overall would recommend to any family wanting to stay in new york.	
Aug 27 2007	Double the fun at Doubletree	It looked like this was going to be a bad review. It was my twin sister and I first time in New York.Our room was spacious, and the beds were heavely, but the room had a slight damp odor. When we came back we saw why. the air-conditioner had leaded in the room. They cleaned up the mess. We went out and came back again. Still an odor. Always speak up!We called the desk and they changed our room...to a room with a horrible view of an air condtioner unit. Complained, we were not paying this hotel price for such mess. They upgraded us to the conference suite! Nothing more to add. It was utterly amazing with a wrap around view of Times Square in this huge suite.It was a major plus for such a simple thing, but getting a freshly made warm chocolate chip cookie at check-in, or any time you requested, was such a treat.The only thing was the doorman/security and if he JUST saw you go in and out, he still insisted on seeing your hotel card to go in...they didn't even do that at the &quot;W&quot;.	
Aug 27 2007 	Better than a Hotel room if you are a family	We are a family of two adults and one child and stayed for 4 nights in August 2007. The big plus of this hotel is the location, right on the corner of 47th and Broadway. This area is always busy with people and traffic but once you are in your suite you can't hear the noise. The location allows you to enjoy all the evening delights of Broadway and the theater district without the need to use taxi's or walking a few blocks at night. On entry to the hotel, the lobby which is actually on the third floor is not overwhelming but it is clean. If you are wanting a contemporary boutique hotel with a wow factor lobby then this isn't the place for you. Check-in staff were very efficient and our bags were delivered promptly to our room. Another major point is having two rooms, one room had a sofa bed which is ok for kids, and a small kitchen area with a sink, microwave and fridge. There was also a mini bar in the TV unit. If you don't need to, try not to use the mini bar as it is very expensive. Take a 10 min walk to the corner of 8th Ave and 48th to a grocery store and stock up on drinks and snacks and fill up your empty fridge. There was also a safe in the room. In short the suites and well equipped, clean and welcoming.The bathroom was clean and bright and accessible from both rooms and both bedrooms had a fully working TV with numerous channels.You could probably get a better hotel room for the price in the same area but if there is more than two in your party then this is definately the better option.I booked a Times Square view room but I would describe it as a partial view at best. The hotel serves breakfast in the restaurant which is either buffet style full or continental which for convenience we had three out of four mornings. The hotel also has a bar but it's not what you would describe as a destination bar.Once inside our room we found it quiet, there was no night noise of people coming and going and we always felt safe.The hotel can arrange theatre tickets but beware, they quoted us between $145-$165 per ticket for Mary Poppins at the New Amsterdam theatre. A quick trip to the box office on 42nd street and we managed to obtain them for half that price. Try all other options first before using the hotel.In summary, a very good quality hotel for tourists who are coming to New York and want to be at the heart of the action.	
Aug 24 2007 	Perfect for families	The hotel is fantastic for the price and location. We had two Time Square view connecting rooms for 3 adults and 3 children, which gave us plenty of room. If I was only traveling with my husband I would stay at a more luxurious hotel around 5th and Park Ave. I couldn't have picked a better place being with children. We brought our nanny which gave us the flexibility to go out in the evening without the kids. We are platinum Hilton members so we got free breakfast for everyone each morning which was great. Check in was a breeze, the concierge was fabulous. We saw Legally Blonde which was playing next door. We took two girls ages 11 and 13. If you are conservative (which we are) this is not the show for girls that age! (too sexual) We enjoyed much better Beauty and the Beast. Across the street at the Marriott if you go to one of the top floors they have a restaurant which rotates with an absolutly fabulous view, we had cocktails up in the sky in the midst of a lightning storm which was amazing. Would stay there again .	
Aug 24 2007 	Great place to travel with teens!	This was our first trip to the Big Apple. The only thing we knew for sure was that we did NOT want to even attempt to drive in NYC, so we needed a location where all of the &quot;must sees&quot; were in walking distance. I scoured dozens of websites and visited TripAdvisor many times to check reviews, and kept coming back to this hotel. Initially I booked the room going thru AAA, but checked back with the hotel directly from time to time to see what their best direct rates were, and once their rate beat the AAA rate, I booked right through the hotel reservation desk. The rep was very helpful...she asked if we wanted a low or high room (we ended up on the 18th floor...just right.) She also told me that the best views would be a room facing north, looking out over the corner of Broadway and 47th, so that is where she placed us! I am telling you, this hotel is right smack in the middle of Times Square....you walk out the front door and you are in the action! We could really experience Times Square this way. We could easily walk to the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Macy's, Radio City Music Hall, NBC Studios, ABC studios, all of the Broadway show halls, Restaurant Row, St. Patrick's Cathedral, shopping on 5th Avenue, etc. The subway stop was right outside the front door, so we navigated this once to go down to Battery park (to catch the ferry to the Statue of LIberty and also to see Ground Zero, which is still a powerful sight after 5 years.) The beds are FABULOUS (if you are like me, that alone can make or break a hotel experience!) and since the rooms are all suites, there are 2 TV's (when you have teens who want to watch different shows, that is great!), a microwave, a fridge, and a safe. Of course, the rates are higher than what we are used to paying for up hotels here in North Dakota, but this is NYC so we knew that would be the case. If you are worried about safety, there are literally police on nearly every block....I never felt unsafe even when my daughter and I ventured out alone. The hotel room was also extremely quiet....none of the noise or lights from the street below were seen or heard once we closed the windows and drapes. I would highly recommend this hotel!	
Aug 23 2007 	Great Location	My hysband and 2 teen-aged sons stayed here for 3 nights. The location was great, better than the Hilton Times Square that we stayed at 2 years ago. The hotel was secure and clean. It was nice to have a suite and 2 TVs. There was a slight problem with our reservation and the hotel corrected it and threw in free buffet breakfast for the entire stay. We were very happy	
Aug 22 2007 	Great Place to Stay in NYC	Great place to stay in NYC. We were a family of 4 including two teenagers, who were in New York for their first time. The sofabed in the lounge was fine for them, while we grown ups enjoyed the privacy of our own bedroom with a very comfortable bed. I can't recognise some of the other reviews - the suite was very clean, modern and nice. I couldn't fault the maid service. The fridge was a great plus. The receptionists were delightful and very helpful, as was the concierge, directing us to the best place to buy i-pods. We had free local calls and wi fi which we found very useful. It wasn't cheap - which is why I wouldn't give it a 5 - but I was very happy in terms of value for money and would certainly go back.We used Grays open top bus tours based in Times Square and found them great and good value. We went on the downtown, uptown and night tours - all excellent. Although we HATE getting up in the morning, we managed to do so on the Sunday and used the subway across the street to travel down to catch the first ferry (8.30) to the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. No line/queue at all - even in August - and we walked straight on to the boat. When we got back we couldn't believe the length of the line/queue in Battery Park!! Cabs were cheap and easily available everywhere. Our highlight (sad to say, but maybe understandable after all the walking we did) was the 10 minute chinese massage available on Sat/Sun at the street markets on 6th and 7th. There was never a $20 better spent. Fantastic!!Before we went, I googled an internet site which gave me half price - and first class (3 rows from front in the stalls) - tickets to Les Miz which we all absolutely adored. The only problem is finding a table for a pre-theatre meal. My advice is to try to book in advance.	
Aug 21 2007 	Great Place	We just got back from a four day trip and stayed 2 nights at Doubletree Time Square. The check-in was no problem. We got there at 11:00 a.m and the room wasn't ready but then we didn't expect it to be so early. They checked all our luggage and away we went. We we got back in about 6:00 p.m. they sent our luggage up and of course we got 4 hot cookies to take with us. We stayed on the 18th floor, and although we didn't have a view we weren't in our room much anyways. The rooms are spacious and CLEAN. If there were bedbugs they must have been asleep on the comfortable beds and pillows. The entrance is busy but that's to be expected where it's located. Loved that they checked for room key everytime we tried to go up. My 18 year old son couldn't even get up once after he went sightseeing without a key. Check-out was fast and they held out bags while we finished in NYC. Would definately stay here again.	
Aug 20 2007 	Great central location if you want to be in the middle of it all!	I recently stayed at this Doubletree property for the second time, and I highly recommend it if you want to be in the middle of it all! My mom, who is a senior, accompanied me last year, but we were staying in a hotel closer to uptown. She had some trouble with all the walking so this year I booked us right in Times Square, and it was the perfect location for us! We had tickets to &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; which was right next door and also &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; which was basically right across the street. We also used the hop-on and off tour buses, which are good for 48 hours, as our &quot;public transportation&quot;, and they boarded right across the street too! We were pleasantly surprised with our room since we happened to get a corner room with two views overlooking Times Square, and we love the suite set-up! The bed was extremely comfortable, and we were not disturbed by any noise from below. (We were on the 27th floor.) We wished they sold the chocolate chip cookies there! Too bad you only get them at check-in! (Heck - those cookies alone almost make it solely worth staying there!) We also really appreciate that you have to produce your key card to access the hotel itself. I generally feel safe when traveling, but you can never take too many precautions either. And yes, you do sometimes have to work your way through the crowd to get into the hotel, but again, if you want to be in the center of it all, then this hotel is a perfect choice!	
Aug 17 2007 	Strange hotel - but plenty of room and good location	Our family of 5 stayed August 4-8th. Strangest, most unimposing and unattentive check in desk/lobby area I've ever seen for such a large hotel in such a location. Also, a very backed up concierge. Fortunately, we had done our own research and didn't need their assistance!Rooms were certainly spacious. Separate bedroom and living room with closing doors was nice. But, I agree with several other readers that the rooms were also rather dirty (bathrooms especially) and showing signs of wear.The location can't be beat if you want to be in the center of things with quick subway access and a &quot;hub&quot; for walking to many of the great places in NYC.I also agree with many reviews that the rooms are very soundproof.Overall, for the price, I really think this hotel needs to class it up in the rooms, cleanliness and helpfulness.	
Aug 14 2007 	Bed Bugs Galore	Stayed here for 3 days during the 1st week of Aug 2007, very noisy and extremely crowded, but good location.Shower curtain had mold and the smell was unbearable, it got replaced on 2nd day. Blood stains around toilet, but the worse thing was the bugs, our whole family got bitten and developed small infections on bite areas. Try to complain to on shift manager (Tito) but he had no time right now; security guard took some info but made us feel like we were the contributors to the problem. I have worked in the Health and Safety field for over 20 years and never seen such poor hygiene in any hotel. Service Hotel personnel was good and helpful at times. We had to discard our luggage to avoid bringing anything home. Warm cookies were a nice treat upon arrival.	
Aug 13 2007	Nicer than I expected	The biggest downside of ths hotel is the location. I will qualify that remark by stating that I am not a newbie to the city, so the appeal of TImes Square is lost on me. However, since the entrance to the hotel is on a very busy corner (47th and 7th), you often have to fight your way through crowds to get in or out of the hotel. That's a slight bit annoying. Having said that, though, the room was clean and large by New York City standards. I was traveling with two teenage girls, and we had more than enough room for all of us, even after they had been shopping for 4 consecutive days. I have stayed in no less than ten NYC hotels in roughly the same price range, and aside from that entrance issue, the Doubletree is one of the better hotels I have stayed in for $400/nt.	
Aug 10 2007 	Great stay in NYC	We had a great stay - the suite accomodated our family with plenty of room especially for NYC. Room was clean and in nice condition. Service was quick and responsive. Location in Times Square was excellent.	
Jul 31 2007 	Pricey but Roomy and Great Location	First of all, this hotel has real suites. I have been to other hotels where the name &quot;suite&quot; is used if there is a sofa/coffee table sitting area. Our suite had a separate, walled-in bedroom. I was traveling w/ my sister and her daughter. While looking for accommodations, I thought I would need two rooms because &quot;the girls,&quot; especially my 17 y.o. niece, would want privacy. As this was their first time to NY, I wanted a hotel right in the thick of it. In the theatre district during the high season ( July), it was difficult to find an acceptable 3-star hotel offering rooms under $200/nt. I was prepared to do one of two things: Get one decent-sized hotel room for 260/nt and tell them they would have to sacrifice privacy, or go down to a 2-star and rent two rooms.The Doubletree offered a compromise. It was almost $400/nt, but it was roomy. The sofa sleeper was comfortable. I can't vouch for every sofa in the hotel, but the one I slept on was great. It was big enough for 2 adults who don't mind getting cozy. Plus the cushions could make a bed for someone under 5 ft. When we closed the door to the bedroom, there was complete privacy for me and them. We each had our own t.v. I had the &quot;kitchen&quot; and they had the bath. Privacy was never a problem. Oh, and my sister wanted a smoking room. Some hotels are exclusively NON smoking. Our floor was a smoking floor, and you could tell, but I did not smell smoke anywhere else (and I am a non smoker). All in all, it fit the bill. It had location, quality, and lots of room.	
Jul 31 2007	Perfect family lodging for NY!	Two teen girls and two adults just spent a weekend at the Doubletree and it was fabulous! The views from our room overlooking Times Square were just gorgeous and we were centrally located to shopping and access via subway to the city. The proximity to play tickets and theaters couldn't have been any better, and the location was simply great for us. No bedbugs, in fact...the bedding was as comfortable as any I've slept on. We had enough sinks for everyone for teeth brushing, etc. The security was good and the folks who worked there were really friendly. I would rate this very high as a hotel for families who want nice convenient lodging and don't mind the bustle of Times Square. We felt the hotel was very well priced for Manhattan and provided every courtesy and amenity we needed.	
Jul 30 2007 	Don't stay here my room was small and dirty.	The only thing good about this hotel are the cookies and the location. The staff was friendly but my room was not that clean and it was on the small side. The windows in this place were so dirty you could hardly see a view. The business center was so expensive that it was ridiculous! I won't be staying here again even if it was free.	
Jul 30 2007 	Grat but no free internet as they said so	I stayed twice in this month and it has been a perfect room and very spacious and it suite looking through times sqaure, the first time I stayed I booked the Discover Downtown Package and stayed in room 2708 (looking to the screen that are on the Renaissance Hotel) and they gave me a gift card for Century 21 (a store and I never used it) coupond for a mall and many coupons.... I tought the internet was free (becuase other people had said so), but on my second stay I reserved the same room but as we checked in they asked us if we wanted a view and and if we wanted a high floor I said yes, they gave us room 3601 which was a big suite, i think it was called Conference suitre and it was bigger. And they gave us free wireless, beacse we were in executive floors. Yay!	
Jul 30 2007 	very pleased	We stay at the Doubletree from July 23-26. We were very impressed. Two adults and 3 children (6,8,9) stayed very comfortably in one room. We lucked into a room on the 42nd floor. Ocassionally we could hear other guests in the halls but we never heard the noise of Times Square. The two double beds were very comfortable. The sofa bed wasn't the greatest, but it was just a sofa bed. The little refrig and microwave were very handy for a lite bite to eat. Check in was painless. The entire process took less than 10 minutes. The concierege was well informed and always helpful.No real compliants, just a few minor issues: One tv remote did not work and never got fixed. We were only given decaf coffee in the room (although once requested, regular coffee was provided) and the nline to speak with the concierege did get long sometimes. Overall, we were very pleased and would not hesitate to return.	
Jul 29 2007 	Great Location Helpful Staff	The staff was very professional and helpful and the room was adequate for a suite hotel. Nothing special though.	
Jul 27 2007 	Great for the whole family	I had a quick trip to NY with 3 teenagers and the Doubletree was perfect. Two very comfortable double beds and a pull out sofa, in a suite, so there was enough privacy and space for us all. The hotel was pretty quiet for Times Square and the a/c worked great on a hot night. The kids loved being in Times Square. I usually prefer the East side, but this was a great location for going to a show at MSG.	
Jul 26 2007	happy at the Doubletree!	My husband and two sons stayed here last weekend and thought it was a GREAT oasis in the midst very busy (&amp; convenient!) TImes Square. They upgraded us when we got there to having a free breakfast buffet. The suite was very clean and comfortable and it was wonderful to have that extra room with children along. A great choice overall for a family trip! A reader from Madison, Misssissippi	
Jul 19 2007 	Excellent Stay - Will Go Back Again	We just returned from an extended weekend (6 days/5 nights) in NYC at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square. What a great location -- subway right outside our door -- easy access to Times Square activities, restaurants, theaters. Room located on high floor provided excellent view of the City. Overall check in/check out excellent -- staff friendly, polite and willing to help out whenever/wherever needed. Room clean, spacious for family of four. We were able to move with ease throughout the City from shopping along Fifth Avenue to attending a Yankees game in the Bronx, to visiting Lower Manhattan, Statue of Liberty and the South Street Seaport area to traveling throughout several other great Manhattan neighborhoods. We saw everything we wanted to see in NYC and then some -- we only had (2) planned activities and we let the rest &quot;just happen&quot; and found that we had more fun and actually got involved with more with the City and its inhabiitants. There was actually more going on than we could ever attend. Check as many websites and order a New York Travel Guide before you go to help give you an idea of what's going on while you're there. Everywhere we went ,people were great -- very willing to help us out when we looked &quot;lost&quot; trying to find the right subway train -- once you get on it a few times you start to get the hang of how the lines work. Highly recommend getting a car service to take you to/from the airport (cheap -- spent roughly $35 per way for a town car with Carmel Limousine -- they also offered us $6 coupons on each stay by going to [-]. It made getting to the hotel and out of the city so much easier. Can't wait to go back.	
Jul 13 2007 	i love doubletree- new york	Great suites, great staff, great location for theatres and shopping and the suites are perfect for families.	
Jul 12 2007 	Worst Experience Ever	My family and I traveled to New York for some business and fun. We have stayed in Time Square every year for the past 10 years but have never stayed at the Double Tree. The morning after the first night my son(7 years old) woke up and had about 300 bites from sleeping on the sofa in the room. When we contacted the hotel staff...they immediatly tried to get us to sign a waiver to release them from liability. They then changed rooms for us. The next day when my son was all swollen from the bites I contacted the hotel to find out what the source of the bites were, etc. The accused me of bringing my son to their hotel in this condition. I will never stay at a Hilton Property again.I will upload photos of his bites later.
