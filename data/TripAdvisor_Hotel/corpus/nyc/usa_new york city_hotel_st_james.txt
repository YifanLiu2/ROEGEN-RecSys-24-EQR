Nov 25 2009 	Good Value for money	Mt partner and I stayed at the St James Hotel for 8 nights in November 2009. Our room was on the ninth floor. (914). Room was big and very clean. We asked for a hairdryer and iron etc at reception and we kept them in the room the entire 8 nights and just handed them back when we left. This hotel is in a great location to use as a base to explore Manhattan! We also found the staff really friendly and helpful except the 'night guy' - he is grumpy bum! Anyhoo, the only complaints I would have considering the price range of the hotel is the room keys and the towels need updating - I found them to be old. Otherwise, for the price, this hotel was great. The hotel was always so busy - so that is a good indication of how many people are happy with the hotel. For food, drinks &amp; snacks - there are 24 hour deli's, cafe's at your door step. I would stay at this hotel again simply for the location and the price.	
Nov 21 2009 	Dirty rooms with street noise and cooking smells from the deli's downstairs	Checked into this hotel and didnt expect much for the price. But worse than expected! First room given was on the 2nd foor. Pokey awkward sized room. Horrible smell of cooking from the deli's downstairs. Asked to changed and was given the choice of 8th floor facing the noisy street, or 11th floor facing the opposite wall Opted for this one as it was the best of a bad bunch. All the rooms had smaller than average double beds. Both our feet were hanging off the end. Radiators propped up with chunks of wood! Air con very noisy and had pigeons on the windowsill the whole time. Would have checked out at this point but we had pre-paid in advance. The worst was the house keeping! Towels were dirty with stains on them, also so thin you could read a book through them. The sheets had previous occupants dark hairs on them. The bedcover and blanket were stained with every imaginable body fluid.Previous reviews comment on basic ammenities but this was downright dirty. On the last morning we stayed we ended up with bites on our face and necks presumably from the pillow. (only one lumpy one each). Front desk staff totally dis-interested. Either reading stuff on their computer or mobile phones! Concierge was about the best thing and its proximity to Times Square. There always appeared to be an argument going on re the charges every time you had to go to the desk to hand in your key or retrieve it. Indeed we were charged £30 on our credit card as soon as we checked in (although not told about it). This we were told was a security deposit in case we caused any damage to the room!! Couldnt beleive the cheek of it. Incidently still waiting for this to be refunded!! Never ever again!!Personally I would have been prepared to walk further and have a basic CLEAN room!	
Nov 20 2009	ENGAGEMENT / Friends Trip	So to keep things less obvious I was going to NYC to propose to my Now Fiance. We got a group of 4 to go. We needed something cheap and didn't really mind if it wasn't the Rolls Royce of hotels. The hotel is extremely clean, and service is wonderfull. We got a good rate a few months in advance of 89 a night and it was literally a block from times square. The lion King is on the same street and can be seen from the door of the hotel. IT IS ON A GOOD SIDE OF TOWN!!!! Dont let the price fool you about its location. Now as for the rooms. Be ready to have the bare necessities! The rooms are clean and there is good room for luggage and closet space. There isn't an ironing board so pack neatly and the higher the room, the lower the water pressure in the showers. If you are looking for somewhere clean, safe, friendly and efficient with a good price this is the hotel. The staff was very friendly and the experience actually made it a little more fun being you can sometimes get used to the &quot;Usual&quot; hotel amenities. There are lots of restaurants around the hotel, citi and bank of america, drug store, starbucks, and only a 3 minute walk to rockefeller center/subway station. I will return to this hotel whenever I go to NYC and I hope you will do the same. No need to waste money that you can spend on fine dining and top broadway which is right next door!	
Nov 15 2009 	i love new york !	We stayed at the Hotel St James in New York. (meant to write this review when we got back) from my 50th birthday celebration. The hotel and rooms are not fancy, there is no &quot;contiental breakfast&quot; but there was a Starbucks across the street and a Deli and Irish Pub/restuarant next door. It's very very close to Times Square and other places to go. We even went to a play at a historic playhouse on the same block. For the price I thought it was a good deal. Most people don't go to New York to sleep !	
Nov 5 2009 	Awesome location at a very affordable price!	My husband and I went to NYC for the first time to celebrate our 20th anniversary. We wanted to spend more money on the broadway shows and attractions and less on our hotel if it was possible. I read many reviews on Hotel St. James. The patrons gave it good reviews about location and reasonable rates so we went with it. We too were very pleased! Although, I can totally understand that if you expect to be pampered with extra ammenities, this is not the place for you. The elevator is very small. The rooms are adequate with a private bath. The staff was cordial. I got a little nervous when we observed a lady checking out of her room and arguing with the desk clerk about how her rate had changed during her stay. Ours, however, was prepaid though an on-line travel agency and we had no problem. Our rate was exceptional for being one block from Times Square! Outside of the hotel's front door are two 24-hour delis that had great breakfast foods, salads, sandwiches and snacks. All of the broadway shows are a short walk away. I definitely recommend this hotel if you just want a place to sleep at a great price and a great location!	
Nov 4 2009 	Great budget hotel	Positive.1) Great location yards from Times Square.2) Staff very friendly.3) Good rates considering location.4) Hotel and rooms very clean (tip the cleaners)5) Free wifi.Negative.1) Outside generators very noisy during night . We initially changed rooms due to the droning noise however our new room was also noisy.(A bit picky I know but if you value your sleep take ear plugs)2) Our room 415 had an adjoining door to 414 and we could hear every conversation, yawn and burp from next door, so again be aware of this.Apart from the above negative comments my wife and I enjoyed our time in New York and would recomend this hotel for persons on a budget. We may have just been a bit unlucky with our room because after reading previous comments about this hotel , on the whole I agree with them, however we would probably try another hotel next time .Make sure you visit the retail outlet about an hr from the city. You can get a bus from the Port Authority station.	
Nov 3 2009 	Housekeeping poor Front Desk great	I switched hotels after one night at Hotel St. James. If the rest of the hotel matched the reception and welcome I received at the Front Desk, I would've stayed the duration of my reservation, but even my cost-saving nature couldn't get comfortable with the poor level of cleanliness in my second floor room. The rooms are shabby and just superficially cleaned. When I arrived, the Front Desk was kind enough to give me the choice of three rooms, and I took the cleanest one, but even this one had a jogging suit sitting on the dresser that was left by the previous occupant. There's no safe in the room, and the Front Desk cannot guard more than passports in their secure drawer, so I walk around with all my cash and valuables, which is also not very safe in NYC. The keys are the old-fashioned ones, so an enterprising thief wouldn't have much of an obstacle getting into a room with anything of value. Travel advice always dictates pulling off the bed cover since the bedsheets below ought to be cleaner. I pulled off the cover and blanket and found human hairs on the bed sheets...various hairs types from all over the human body (hint, hint). I also found used hair elastics that the previous occupant forgot below the pillow. I called to the Front Desk to report this problem, but it registered no real concern and was told that bedding is only changed every two days. When I pointed out that I just checked in, they offered that I could change rooms. I'd already unpacked so they offered to send someone up from housekeeping. The man who appeared at my door didn't even stop eating his apple, and just handed me a couple of new sheets. It was clear he had no intention of changing the sheets for me, but I wanted to know what to do with the dirty sheets. Since he seemed to be a Spanish speaker, of course I tried communicate in Italian. &quot;The sheets are dirty. What should I do with them?&quot; To which he responded in mumbled English something I could not understand. So I took the dirty sheets off and left them in the hallway.I checked out at 8am the following morning and the Front Desk again was professional about the matter. Hotel policy dictates that I be charged another full day's lodging, which was fine and Expedia was helpful in recuperating the costs of the third day's lodging. If the hotel's ever renovated and the support staff improved, I still think the bones of this establishment could be sound (location and Front Desk), but until then I cannot recommend staying here.	
Nov 2 2009 	Please Read This Review!	Hi People I stayed here with my wife and 14yr old son for 4 nights, I read all the reviews before we went and I have to rate the hotel highly based on our experience. We were treated like respectable visitors from day 1. The staff answered any questions we had and throughout our stay were fabulous, at no time did we have cause to complain. We came to Manhattan to fulfill my wifes dream, that is walking through the city that never sleeps, a little bit of shopping and to see all the things that this fantastic place has to offer - were we at all dissapointed?...never!I could spend hours bigging this hotel up but I will avoid doing so because my last paragraph will sum it up for you.2 doors away is a deli - WOW!! pleassse go to the Cranberry we were up and out of bed for 6.30am each morning, Whilst my wife phoned her family I went down to get a couple of coffees and a juice, Britain could learn a lot from this place coz if is better than any cafe we have ever been to EVER!I am at the point of becoming too impartial with my praise of this hotel so let me hit you with the facts - Totally patient staff, help with whatever you want....I needed to use phone at reception AFTER checkout to see where our airport transfer was--no charge! I left my mobile phone in room and they arranged transportation back to UK..It cost me a few Dollars but they were fantastic with the service and honesty.If you need a honest and impartial review of this hotel pleeeease message us because it is great..... How far to Broadway 30 seconds... walking!!!!!	
Oct 24 2009 	A great Hotel and A great trip to New York city.	Went to New York City from Nova Scotia, with 3 girl friends for 1 week, we stayed at St James Hotel and loved it.  It was very small, 2 double beds, no dresser, only had a closet with 4 hangers, but for us country girls it was just great, we lived out of our siutcases, our room looked like a dorm room. We were not in our room for long, the place was very clean and kept clean every dayIt is am old hotel, and I loved that too , we stayed on the 12 floor so it was far from the street and noise. The Cranberry Buffet next door was a great place to eat it was open 24 hours, lots of choises, and very busy. We were so close to everything, check out the Today show at Rockerfeller center, Times Square is a 4-5 min walk. The 2 pubs on the street are good eating too. I have nothing bad to say about this place at all. We had a wonderful trip so much to do and see , We had the hop on and hop off tour which was a great deal. Take your own hair dryer, etc.  We left our key at the desk when we went out and had not problem with security or theft. I would definatly stay here again. Love this place Nova Scotia girls.	
Oct 22 2009 	Only thing it has going for it is the location	Good location two minutes from Times Square - basic - no frills rooms - one overlooked some offices - we could wave to each other and another overlooked the street with a botched repair to the glass so a lot of street noise.It was a real shock when we got there - like walking back in time but once you get used to it and use it only for sleeping you can live with it. Its probably one step up from a hostel (No disrespect to hostels)Found the reception staff to be ignorant to the point of being rude and not helpful at all - the excursion person is the one to speak to. Good Deli's next door + a couple of Irish Bars - walk across Times Square to 46th Street there's plenty of restuarants + a good bar down there.	
Oct 20 2009 	DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THE WHINGERS WERE ON ABOUT!	I am very OCD, so after reading the reviews was very worried about what St. James was going to be like. Well, I'm here to tell you not to worry. Complaints to be false:Bed bugs: Not true. We were there for 6 nights and I know for a fact that they changed our sheets twice. Towels were changed daily. No hair dryer or iron: Both available at the front desk upon request. Elevators tiny and slow: Smaller and a little slower than usual, but did the job just fine.Rude staff: The staff were friendly and always had a smile on their face. No ice machine, no fridge or microwave: You can buy cups of ice from the deli next door for 50cents. We ate at the deli everyday. The food is cooked fresh and is absolutely beautiful, plus the staff there are super friendly! The noise: With the noise, comes the city &amp; really thats what you're there for. Rooms being small: smaller than normal, but nothing as bad as what I had expected!Complaints to be true:Room key: is an actual key, and you have to drop it off at the front desk every time you go out (even if its to the deli next door). This did not bother us because it was better than us having to carry it around or losing it. Coming back in to pick up your key, you say your room number and thats it. They don't ask for a name or any ID. This would be my only complaint.Word of advice: Dont catch the hotel shuttle bus. A cab to JFK is $45. Shuttle bus is $43 (not including tips) St. James is the first pick up point, leaving an hour afterwards of picking up from at least 7 hotels around Times Square. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ST. JAMES. THE LOCATION IS SIMPLY AMAZING. I WOULD NEGLECT ANY OUTDATED REVIEWS, AS THE HOTEL IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING RENNOVATIONS. JUST REMEMBER, YOU GO TO NYC TO THE SEE THE CITY, NOT TO LIVE IN THE HOTEL.	
Oct 19 2009 	Fantastic - great experience	I stayed here for a week in October as a 30th birthday gift. I must say I was a bit concerned after reading some of the other reviews, but I cannot praise this hotel more highly. It is basic but the room I stayed in (505) was large and absolutely spotless. The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels and toilettries were replenished. As mentioned in other reviews it is a bit noisy at night time but hey, it is Times Square! Could not have been in a better location for all the attractions and after a long hard day of sight seeing there is no place better to stop than The Perfect Pint or O'Lunneys (both on West 45th). We ate breakfast every day at the Cranberry Cafe which is situated next door to the hotel. This was a highlight of the holiday as the food was great and the staff very friendly.We also found the staff at the Hotel St James to be very friendly and they took the time to say hello to us every day and ask us if we were enjoying our trip.If youare looking for a high end hotel where you can sleep in silence, then the Hotel St James may not be for you. However if you are looking for somewhere clean and comfortable to rest your weary head after a long day then this is perfect for you! We are coming back to NYC next October and will be staying here, no question! My advice would be to you would be to make this your choice if you are visiting.	
Oct 18 2009 	value for money	a block away from time square. Great location . Great little pub next door. Friendly staff.	
Oct 18 2009 	Excellent location - basic hotel but great!	We stayed here for 7 nights in Nov 07 - I couldnt believe how close we were to Times Square - central to everywhere and a great deli next door. Lovely but pricey italian restaurant across the road too! This is not an expensive hotel but the rooms are big - very clean - and have everything you need for a great stay in New York - if u r visiting new york you are not there to live in your bedroom so basic is all you need!	
Oct 14 2009 	Never again	The hotel is in a pretty location - near the theater, shopping, etc. but other than being relatively clean, it was a not so good experience. The room had a iron burn in the carpet (I guess the people couldn't find an ironing board so pressed their clothes on the floor), there was no ice machine (I always thought that was a staple at all hotels), and the water pressure was about as low as it could get without dripping.The elevator was small and made too many serious noises for me to feel comfortable in but when you are on the 7th floor . . . There was always a large garbage bag tied to the stairs in the hallway. I guess that was suppose to make up for the lack of adequate disposal receptacles in the room. I would rather pay a little more and have a few more amenities. I will not stay here again.	
Oct 13 2009 	Brilliant can't recommend it enough!!!	I have recently returned from a trip to New York and stayed in the St James. the reception staff were always friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is quite old but that just added to the charm, the rooms were an adequate size but not over large. Bathroom was a good size and always clean. The room was cleaned everyday and the towels changed daily too. Its location was brilliant and within minutes you were in the thick of Times Sqaure, but it was noisy. it has no bar or restuarant but there are plenty of places nearby to eat and drink, I would definately recommend it to anyone and stay there again.	
Oct 11 2009 	Do not be put off by other reviews	After i booked this hotel I then read some negative reviews on this site. I was very worried about staying at this hotel as people said there were bed bugs and rude staff. So I was pleasently surprised when I got there. The staff were all polite and helpful and the room was clean with fresh towels daily. Yes it was noisy at night but this hotel is right in the heart of times square what more could you ask for from a bargain hotel. You can walk to all the sights from this hotel but please beware of the people trying to get you to take free cds(they then chase you down the road for a donation). Please do not be put off by bad reviews for a bargain hotel it is great.	
Oct 11 2009	Terrible!!!	My Mam and I visited New York in November 2008 and stayed at the St James mainly due to the trip advisor reviews. It is without a doubt the worst hotel I've ever stayed in and if it wasn't for the location I'd have to say this hotel has no good qualities at all. But the location was great, only 2 minutes to Times Square. The room was dark and dirty with a door which barely locked so we never felt entirely safe. The elevator was terrible and took ages to arrive and the corridors were dirty and very dated. On a good note the Cranberry Deli next door was fantastic for breakfast. Do not stay here, there are much better hotels in the Times Square area for a similar price.	
Oct 9 2009 	Very Clean Super Cheap Times Square Hotel	Having to stay at cheap hotels for business is always interesting. The St James was a pleasant surprise. For just $150 a night, I had an amazing clean hotel room with a helpful and friendly staff. It is in the heart of Times Square and convenient to so many things. They had a printer and wireless was free. If you are traveling for a company that can't spend much accomodations, this place is awesome. Only bad part was the mattres was a little hard.	
Oct 9 2009 	What a disgusting place!!!! BEWARE - Credit card fraud	What can I say about this place - we checked into the lobby of the hotel and were given our room key. The room was DISGUSTING!!! It had roaches and was filthy and poky. The hallways looked like they had not been cleaned in years and I was scared to sit on the bed as the sheets were not clean. The pillows had stains on them like they had been used and not cleaned in years. We both got bitten by bugs from the place and were only there an hour whilst we sourced another hotel. We went back to the lobby straight away and checked straight out. HOWEVER, on our return home we have noticed that the hotel have charged our credit card for the entire stay and another nights stay as a deposit!!! On contacting the hotel they advised us they would look into it and get back to us. We are still waiting. we have had to file a fraudulent claim with the credit card company. I have been to New York on a few occassions and stayed at much better and cheaper places than this. The hotel we ended up staying in was cheaper, cleaner and friendlier.DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES STAY AT THIS HOTEL. IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO A COCKROACH!!!!	
Oct 8 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised	We made our reservations at the St. James months ago, and after reading recent reviews were very worried about what the hotel would be like. We were there 3 nights and would definitely go back! It is certainly nothing fancy, but the staff was friendly, the rooms were clean, our beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was newly remodeled. We saw no evidence of any bugs. The deli next door is cheap, with great food. Location couldn't be better. I agree leaving the key at the desk is weird, but we didn't have any problems with it. If you are enjoying NYC, you aren't at the hotel anyways. I'm guessing we were there for 5-6 hours a day because there is just so much to do. The hotel is in the process of remodeling so ask for rooms that are on the floors that have been updated.	
Oct 3 2009 	Do yourself a favor: DO NOT STAY HERE	For $200 a night, one would expect a clean room and hallways. When I killed a roach in my bathroom, when there was no hot water, when garbage bags were left in dirty hallways on threadbare carpets, when all the walls needed painting and in a week I saw no one even remotely cleaning the common areas, when there was no ice machine, no free Internet, no comfortable bed, then I had wished I had never stayed here. It was filthy. Do NOT stay here. It is not a hotel, but a flop house located well. Walls were paper thin and others woke me up with their conversations. There are dozens of hotels in the general area and cannot be as despicable as this one. I have travelled for thirty years and never killed a roach in my room before this nightmare.	
Oct 2 2009 	great location but basic hotel	the location is amazing it's pretty cheap for it's location.that's basicly it.the rest is midium at best.the rooms are very small and old.you only get one key, which u have to put at the front desk every time u leave, thus anyone can say your room number and enter your room, the don't really check the identety of the one that ask for the key - pretty scary.	
Sep 30 2009 	Value for money	Great location, on a relatively quiet street, half way between Times Square and 6th Ave. Subway station a block away!Rooms are comfortable, no frills, not particularly roomy, but more than enough since you spend so little time in the hotel anyway!No restaurant at the hotel, but with two excellent Delis right next door it doesn't matter much. Front desk attention is good but uneven: most employees are very friendly and helpful, a couple are a bit grumpy. Considering the price, excellent value for money. I recommend it .	
Sep 30 2009 	great location!	I was abit concerned after reading the reviews left by other people for this hotel, but i got a very pleasant suprise! we had a room with two double beds, with lots of room, there was lots of space to put clothes away. i spoke to a couple who had a very small room, so it maybe pot luck, but i asked for a room with two beds and we had a plenty of room. the room was cleaned every day and the bathroom was always spotless!the hotel was on A Side road about 1 min walk away from times square, great location on the doorstep and yet there was no noise! afew reviews said that the aircon was noisy, it was abit but hardly worth a moan! it was the cheapest hotel i could find in the most central location. it wasnt anything amazing to look at but it was clean! i would definatly stay here again!!	
Sep 29 2009 	Thank God I DID NOT cancel my reservation! Awesome Hotel!!	After reading the reviews on here, I contemplated cancelling my reservation several times. I was so worried and scared about bed bugs and the dirty cramped bathrooms.I am so glad that I DID NOT cancel. The hotel was awesome! There was absolutely nothing to worry about or even complain about.Checking in and out was a breeze. The staff at the reception area was friendly and helpful. Our room (1112) was HUGE. Lots of walking around space even with the 2 double beds. We had a room that faced away from the main street, so there was virtually no noise during the night. There was a TV with full cable, night tables,chairs, a telephone, shampoo/conditioner, soap, &amp; clean towels. We left a $4 tip every night ($1 from each of us). Our room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels and soaps.But the best part of this hotel was the location. Just one block away from Times Square! I was able to go there every night because it was just so convenient.The subway, Rockefeller center, and the theatre district was all within minutes of the hotel.The deli next door had awesome food and it was cheap too!Everything about our stay in NY was made perfect because we choose this hotel. I have no regrets and would definitely stay there again! If you are looking for a fancy hotel, with plush pillows and luxury robes and giant flat screen TVs, then stay elsewhere.... but if you want a clean room that is close to everything, Hotel St. James is the place for you.We paid $179/night as opposed to the $300-$400/night that other hotels in the area cost... with all the extra money saved, I bought myself a Gucci purse at the outlets! Well worth it!	
Sep 28 2009 	Great choice and great value	The St James was not disappointing at all.....not the Ritz, but very clean and comfortable, A great shower, plenty of clean towels daily, and great beds. Best of all was the location, we hardly needed to use taxis at all, just around the corner from the subway, a few steps aways from Times Square and Broadway.....PERFECT!The Cranbery Deli right next door had the most amazing food, we tried it the first morning for breakfast and didnt eat anywhere else day OR night for our entire stay. We will definately use the St James again if we go back to NYC	
Sep 28 2009 	What a little corker.....heres the real DEAL	I have come to realise that there are a lot of sad people out there who would and do complain about anything. Those morons who complain about handing over your key....get a life!! Right here we go ....if you want a hotel that is a whisper away from Times Square, that has friendly staff 24 hrs a day, that has clean towels daily, that is spotlessly clean and is affordable then this is place you should stay at. We we on the 12th floor and as previous visitors will tell you New York city is a genuine 24hr city with the noise level to go with it, so being on the 12th floor was so peaceful, and we made new friends with the pidgeons that sit on the windowsill!!The Deli next door is fabulous and you can get hot food and coffee from 6am -12 midnight.Simply put a good, clean,safe hotel at reasoanable prices. I will be staying here again	
Sep 24 2009 	Exactly what we wanted	I stayed here for an overnight with a friend on the recommendation of another friend and it worked out really well for us. The hotel is situated about a block from Times Square so the location couldn't be beat. We got a rather large room with two beds in it for about $150 a night. It was a last minute trip and the man I talked to when I booked was so friendly. And it was 6 am. Not a small feat. Upon arrival, the check-in was easier than expected and we even got an early check-in. 11 am, I believe it was. There was internet available in the lobby and lockers for us to store our things the next day while we shopped before leaving. The only downside was that you drop the key everytime you leave and I thought that was strange. I feel as if anyone could pick your key up upon returning to the hotel. Bathroom was clean and room was not bad for a NYC hotel room. Could use a bit of updating but all in all, it worked perfectly for what we needed. If you're in New York to shop, drink and explore, this is the place for you.	
Sep 23 2009 	ideally located	the hotel is ideally located within a few seconds walking distance from Times Square. The hotel itself is very basic but our double room was big enough, very clean both bedroom and bathroom. Rooms are cleaned everyday and towels were replaced. Don't expect much of a view from your room but keeping the blinds down takes that away! Hotel staff were ok but could learn to smile and chat a little more, beware of the lady that organises your trips, etc she is very abrupt and expensive! On our return to the airport we used a private company, Dial7.com they were alot cheaper arrived on time and a really friendly driver. Don't be put off from the reviews of the hotel, at the end of the day you only sleep and shower there! Would recommend for a budget hotel but in a fantastic location.	
Sep 23 2009 	Great for the money	We were a bit nervous about staying at the St. James after reading some of the reviews, but were pleasantly surprised with our rooms. They were just as large (and bathroom larger), than the Sheraton Towers that we had stayed at previously. The rooms were clean and you couldn't ask for a better location. The staff was very nice and the Cranberry Deli two doors down was a great place for tasty, cheap breakfasts. Would stay there again. Ask for a back room, though. Our room faced the street, so much noise and light during the night.	
Sep 21 2009 	Basic but great!	Just back from staying 4 nights at the st. james. After reading some of the reviews i was a bit worried but i have stayed in budget hotels before and this one was pretty similar. All we really wanted was for it to be clean and centrally located which it was. Sheets and towels were changed every day and the desk staff were very friendly and helpful. As it is just one block from times square it can be quite noisy at night, we were ther mid week and there is a lot of noise of trucks and deliveries in the early hours but after one night we got used to it. Being so close to everything make up for that though, we did a lot of shopping and could pop back to hotel to drop things off which was great. There is two delis and three irish bar/restaurants which area great and reasonibly priced. The food in the irish bars was lovely! If you are looking for something not to flash but in a good location this is the hotel for you, to be honest when your in NY all you use the room for is to sleep so you don't much else!	
Sep 20 2009 	We had the time of our life!	I was worried after we booked our trip and later I read some of the reviews posted after we booked. We had a great experience!!! Our room was very clean. It is a older hotel. But that did not bother us. We were there for the city not our room! The hotel is 1 block from Time Square. It is a great place to stay, it is centrally located. And 2 doors down we ate almost every meal at this deli. Prices were great! We definately would stay here again!!!! Thanks for everything!!!	
Sep 12 2009 	Would not recommend the St. James hotel	My friend and I stayed at the St. James hotel for 2 nights from 8th Sept to 10th Sept and when we came to the room, our key did not work for the lock of the door. They have a key to open the door and not a card.They had given us the wrong key to the door. When we got the right key for the door, it still didn't work and had to get maintainance up to fix the lock. When we got into the room, we realised that the hotel room window faced the main road leading to Time Square and was not double glazed for sound proofing. We could hear every truck/vehicle and emergency siren in the area of Manhattan. We was not informed of this when we checked in. A piece of the window was held in place by duck tape and got a draft through the window. Very unprofessional. Staff was not very friendly. I will not be staying at this hotel again. But if you are looking for something cheap and good location and nothing else, this is the place for you.	
Sep 12 2009 	Great Location	Fair enough this hotel is not the most glamorous hotel I've stayed in but we didn't want a luxury hotel we wanted a hotel that was cheap and cheerful and in a handy location. We arrived early in the morning and was greeted at the reception by a very friendly member of staff. Our room was facing away from the main road and was very quiet at night which was nice. The room was small but cosey, I liked the retro feel of the hotel, very old New York. The tv was old fashioned but why the hell does that matter? We hardly had time to watch tv as we were out all day. The bed was big and fairly comfy, but we were so tired at the end of each day we could have slept on a cactus. The room was cleaned every morning and we got fresh towels and soap every day. Was lovely to come back to a freshly made bed at the end of a busy day of exploring. We had to hand our key in every time we left for the day but at least that stopped us losing it. We couldn't believe how close we were to Times Square. Turn Right at the main door and after a 1 minute walk you're slap bang in the middle of Times Square! The deli right next door to the hotel was lovely, was great having breakfast with the New York buisness men and police men every morning, was a very authentic experience. The concierge was very helpful with booking theatre tickets, the hotel can also arrange for a minibus to collect you and take you to the airport for your flight home. If you want a nice cheap and simple hotel in a fab location this is it. We would defo go back there again. In fact we are next year :0)	
Aug 29 2009 	Only impressive aspect is the price.	Stayed here solely based on price as well as the ideal location, but in the future I'd spring for something a little more pricey based on my experience here. The rooms are opened with keys (not cards) which you have to leave at the front desk each time you exit the hotel. The beds were very uncomfortable and I found I got outside noise even though I was facing an alley (in a different Manhattan hotel, I faced 7th ave and had no noise issues). The TV got around 7 channels and all of them barely came in with the rabbit ears antenna. It wasn't an awful experience but the hotel had very few redeeming qualities.	
Aug 16 2009 	I wouldnt let my "DOG" stay in this Hotel	We were so excited when we arrived in NEW YORK but when we told the airport employee that we were staying in St. James hotel she changed our excitement real fast. She said&quot; oh Wow, please watch out for that hotel me and my family stayed there for fourth of July and got bit by bed bugs then she proceeded to show us the bits... as we arrived at this dreary hotel we finally proceeded to the room and was expectantly disappointed.... Rooms spelled like mildew.. No upgrades very very old... ancient colors and comforters.. Had no nightstand.. phone and lamp was on the floor... No hot water.... staff very unfriendly and not helpful... no security in this hotel.. still have keys instead of door cards....ANd you have to turn it in when you leave..... It was sto bad... we paid for that one night but didnt stay there...just so we can get OUT!!!!!! If you are use to a modern hotel and like comfort... DO Not STAY in THIS HOTEL.....	
Aug 13 2009 	It is all about location.	Don't know how I got such a tremendous rate here, but it was worth every penny. Probably half the cost of other hotels in the area. Right in the middle of everything Times Square. Plus, the Cranberry Deli is a great place for breakfast and snacks, and it only two doors down. For dinner, try the PERFECT PINT, just a couple more doors down towards PLANET HOLLYWOOD.Now, this is not a hotel for those who want luxurious rooms with thick towels, plush carpeting, and a big screen TV. Hair dryers , irons, and ironing boards are available at the front desk. No ice buckets or ice machine. However, it is a good, clean place to sleep with nice sized rooms. (Our group had 3 rooms on the seventh floor; 701 on the smallish side;707 and 714 large by any New York standards) Will definitely try to stay there every time we visit NYC, so that we can spend our $ on other things.	
Aug 13 2009 	Great Location but The rooms were simple and small	The location can't be beat. I though I wouldn't care about the amenities but I was mistaken once I got there. There was nothing to it. The room was so small I could barely move around in it. We asked our Concierge how to get to Battery Park on the subway and she told us the exact oppisite way. If she didn't know than she could have at least found someone else who knew. They also charged 20 cents a minute for internet usage. No services. If you are just interested in a bed than this is the place for you	
Aug 12 2009 	Great price great location--a definite revisit	My daughter, 8-year old granddaughter and I just stayed for four nights (6/27-7/1/09) If you're looking for a clean room, clean bathroom, great location and great price--this is the place. The staff was helpful (when needed), the room was adequate (no frills), but it suited all our needs. I will definitely stay again the next time I am in NYC (if they have any rooms available--they fill up fast).	
Aug 4 2009 	Convenientcleanfriendlyclose to Times Sq.	This was like traveling back in time, older hotel,desk clerk issuing real key,delicious deli next door,so friendly,inexpensive. I would return for sure.	
Jul 10 2009 	Great location VERY poor service	An absolutely brilliant location for the money but there was a certain old memeber of staff that was extremely unhelpful. We had an issue where a very expensive watch was lost and they refused to write a short note on their letterheaded paper to help with the insurance claim and when it came to leave and the taxi hadn't arrived he refused to let us use the phone to contact the driver.... even after we'd agreed to pay some money towards it!The rooms were ok. Very basic and outdated but clean enough apart from the HUGE disgusting insect that appeared to be dead and trapped in the bathroom light fitting.It's a shame though as some staff were quite nice and the rooms were ok but that one member of staff has ruined my perception of the whole hotel and therefore I wouldn't recommend a friend to stay there and would instead recommend the Milford Plaza.	
Jul 7 2009 	right location for the money	50 yards or 50 metres. from times square! 2 deli's next door serving all day if your on a budget was $2.50 for bacon /egg sandwich. rooms have no view whatsoever and are on the small side. paid $200 a night so not to bad.and you get your own bathroom. subway easy to use. if you dont know just ask one of the transit people really friendly. cabs cheap and fast!! you got to go one one hee hee. was out all day so back in and shower. rooms cleaned daily. nice mexican on 44th next street down. jug of margarita was $30 so dont remember going home!. new york varies between busy and very busy but its great. go on the white circle boat tours for a break. wear a coat. there is so much to do make sure you plan your trip so you know what your doing .	
Jul 6 2009 	Wonderful Location... Clean Great Price!	Just returned from our first trip to New York City. Friends stayed in New Jersey to save money and had to take a bus, etc. to reach NYC (took 1 hr) and cost $24. It is worth the difference to stay right in New York City, and what better location than St. James Hotel... just a few steps down the hill and you are in the middle of Times Square!!! Two blocks away from main Metro to all locations (Statue of Liberty, Central Park, etc.). Our room was large and very clean. We tipped $1 per person per day and it was worth it... lots of extra towels, etc. Cranberry Cafe was our favorite... lots of sitting area upstairs. Great prices for b'fast, lunch or supper. French Fries ($2.00) enough for 2 people and delicious!! Pancakes $3. Footlong subs for $5-6. Their salad and fruit bar by the pound was expensive. Great pizza, calzones, and stromboli. The night at Times Square comes alive around 9:00 PM (lots of people, the lights and video screens are amazing, and all the street vendors come out and get good prices). Around the corner is Toys R Us and they have a ferris wheel inside the store!!! Be sure to visit it. The store to the left of McDonalds on 6th Avenue you can get bags of ice. Missed not having ice at the hotel, but for the price of the room who cares! Be sure to search internet sites for best price (booked our room thru Expedia). Hotel ST. James is over half the price of what you will pay at locations in the same area. If you have to stay in luxury, then this is not the place for you. If you come to spend time seeing the sites and instead of spending extra money on hotel, then St. James is where you should stay!	
Jul 1 2009 	Super location	Mother/daughter trip.This was an awesome location and only a few steps from Times Square. Few amenities(no hairdryer or clock) but we knew this by previous reviews so we were prepared......Felt very safe!!!!Cafe next door was great with wonderful NY people. Started the day there with breakfast and ended there with a cold beer. Staff was friendly and helpful. Pubs only a few doors down....Would stay again and again.........	
Jun 25 2009 	Excellent location! Good price	We stayed here 2 nights...The hotel is in an ideal location just a block from times square...neatly tucked away its not noisy at all...The rooms r decently sized, comfy and clean. our rooms were cleaned both days and towels were changed. the staff is friendly and they have locker rooms to leave ur luggage after you check out...I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to NYC.	
Jun 14 2009 	Excellent location and value	My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on June 9th and 10th for our second visit to New York City in less than a year. While not everything was perfect, it was about half the price of most other hotels in the area. We don't go to New York for luxury, we go for the sights, the sounds and smells!! The location is excellent for theatre or shopping or dining. We have no complaints about this hotel whatsoever. Yes, the elevators are slow, but I kept telling myself that I was on vacation so what's the hurry??We requested a room with 2 double beds and that is what we got. The room was a little dated but the bathroom was brand new and spotless. Lots of towels and hot water. Not too many channels on the Tv but again we didn't go all the way to New York to watch TV. One thing we did love was the free Wi-fi. We both brought our laptops.We are already planning our return trip and will stay here again.	
May 21 2009 	Very good deal.	My daughter and I stayed here for 1 night recently and were very satisfied. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location on 45th b/t 6th and 7th Ave., .5 block to Times Square, no more than 2 blocks to the theaters, and surrounded by great dining choices including 2 Irish pubs only steps away.The hotel is older and small but the rooms are clean and sufficient if you are solely looking for a place to rest your head at night and clean up. Not much in terms of amenities but the staff was pleasant and again you cannot beat the location for the price.	
May 21 2009 	Basic clean great location	This is the first hotel I've stayed in that did not have a clock radio in the rooms. Also no ice maker. The room keys are old fashion brass tags that are turned in at the desk when leaving. My room was large with large dresser, desk and night stand. Large closet with removeable hangers. Bath had been re-modeled with new fixtures and the windows were new. Carpet and bedding were basic and relatively new. Cable TV was also basic and was knocked out totally one morning by a storm. Two deli's next door. The luggage storage were $5 lockers in the back room. I didn't use phone system, so can't comment. Bottom line it's good value for the dollar given it's NYC. I've stayed in worse for more money.	
May 7 2009 	Very good place to stay	The best location. Simple. Clean. Good hospitality. Very good for the money.	
Apr 27 2009	Excellent affordable hotel close to Times Square	Myself and my daughter stayed 6 nights at this gem of a hotel. The location is excellent, two steps literally to the right for the deli next door (another one next door to that one) for coffee ($1) ,excellent breakfast choice, the french toast is great. Turn left and you are on 6th avenue. Probably only 2 minutes to walk to Times Square, subways etc. Our room was large, we had two double beds, lovely spotlessly clean bathroom, with an abundance of clean thick white towels, replaced daily. The windows also open which is a bonus. Front desk staff very polite and friendly. Overall our stay was very enjoyable and would certainly recommend to others.	
Apr 13 2009 	Does what it says on the tin!	We stayed here in February. The rooms are fine - no frills but clean and adequate - decent size for New York.The corridors / stariwells were a bit dirty and run down but this didn't concern us at all. For the fractional amount of time you really spend in your room when on holiday in NY there were no issues at all. Location is great, slap bang in the heart of the action - and you can bet you are paying a fraction of what you would pay to stay in the countless other hotels in the vicinity.....A couple of times we had to wait for hot water, but we were on the 6th floor and it was very early in the morning (awake due to jet lag) but just left the shower going for 5 mins and it soon warmed up. Our room overlooked a central atrium which I owuld say was a bonus as it minimised noise.The Cranberry Deli next door but one is fantastic - great pancakes for breakfast.Would stay here again.	
Apr 6 2009 	Excellent value with minor reservations	I searched Trip Advisor, and having paid a great deal for average hotels in NY before, thought I would give St James a try. My friend and I found it a very convenient location - just 2 minutes from Times Square. The hotel lobby is clean and tidy, and the staff were usually very helpful and attentive. One of the two lifts was out of action during our stay and the lifts are very slow, so if you are on a low floor it's quicker to walk the stairs.The Double/Double room had been recently refurbished and was a decent size with a good bathroom. On arrival the room was very hot, so I cranked the radiator to the off position, and it stayed that way for our whole stay, the room temperature was fine like this.The housekeeping is erratic...I tipped most days, but I forget to leave a tip one day, and this resulted in no clean towels, toilet tissue or anything being left, just the minimum of cleaning was done - was this a coincidence or not?Overall I would certainly stay here again and consider it very good value for money.	
Mar 21 2009 	some pros some cons	Ok so we checked into the hotel late late at night. We were so tired and we explained that to the guy who was checking us in... but still he insisted on selling tickets to these tour buses. So after about 30 min we got to go to our room. IT WAS BLAZING HOT! So we went back down stairs and explained to the man how hot it was. It turns out that in the winter time they take out the air conditioners! He gave us keys to 3 other rooms for us to check out and see if they were a little bit cooler. NOPE! they were all steaming hot. So we went back to our room and opened the window and stuck it out. The lobby is very nice but once you walk into the elevator (which is very very slow) or go up the steps (which are so narrow that you cannot pass someone going the other sirection or someone will have to back up) the scenery changes. All 4 of the rooms that we saw were smaller than rooms on a cruise ship. They were clean but the house keeping has left an envelope that you are suppossed to leave money in everyday. Maybe its just us but I would rather leave the money after the job is done than before, but maybe thats just a southern thing. We decided just to keep our room clean ourselves and put up the do not disturb sign up when we left. I felt more comfortable doing that since we had money, laptops , cameras etc etc in the room. (there are no safes or lockboxes) When you leave the room you are required to leave your key. We did this most of the time and had no problem getting it back as we walked back through the door. The staff was far from friendly. No one ever greeted us or thanked us for our stay. DONT fall for the comedy club ticket scam. &quot;stand up ny&quot; &quot;dangerfields&quot; and &quot; HA'S&quot; were all horrible. As well as dirty. Not to mention &quot;stand up ny's&quot; manager was so rude that we left. Dont fall for the bus tours eaither. Everything is within walking distance pretty much and you can always take the subways. The cafe 2 doors down (cranberry) was excellent and so was O'Luneys Pub (about 4 doors down) Oh and ESPN Zone was very reasonably priced and delicious. Unfortunately we had to leave early because of a family death when we called to get our wake up call for 3am, the staff was rude and complained about it being so early. I dont see why it mattered they were awake anyways. But over all it was ok. The price was good and you get what you pay for i guess.	
Mar 6 2009 	As good as the top hotel fraction of the price	Loved every minute of it, Couldnt get a better location if i tried. walk out of the hotel door turn right and you got times square turn let 5th ave the best shopping street in the world. This was my 3rd visit to NY been twice before with my parents where we stayed in expensive hotels like the novotel, This hotel was just as good as that hotel if not better just a fraction of the price. Not massive rooms but its NY and its expected. Not the best view but even the best hotels in new york one side will get a fantastic veiw the unlucky ones get the bins but you still pay huge prices, this hotel is great location and fantastic price. its always great when in a big city having staff knowing lots of knowledge about the city helps so much. will be back asap	
Feb 26 2009 	Simply the best for value and convenience	We've been coming here for several years - right through the renovations. I think that says it all. Great value - great location. Clean and safe. There are no ice-makers, hair driers or coffee-makers - but the rooms are comfortable and quiet. There have been major improvements over the years, so don't be worried by older negative postings.Two tips:1 - phone and book (we saved 30% on the quoted Traveloc**y price).2 - i f you need theater tickets look here: www.broadwaybox.com	
Feb 24 2009 	Pretty Good Hotel	This hotel is so central. Staff are quiet helpful although there is a guy on reception at night so is quiet grumpy. Rooms are medium size. Hotel is clean and warm	
Feb 24 2009 	Location Location Location	I defy anyone to beat this for price vs. location.the rooms are spartan, but clean, warm and reasonably secure. I've stayed here twice and its very good value for money - the only time i was actually in the hotel was to drop my bags off and sleep. It did exactly what it was supposed to.	
Jan 24 2009 	Great location Cheap Accomodation for New York!	The hotel was about 150 metres from Times Square so the location is absolutely perfect for getting out and about easily. The hotel itself is fairly run down with the accomodation very much on the basic side. Our room had a stunning view of a blank wall, worn carpet everywhere and a door that rattled when the window was open but as we didn't go to New York to stay in the room, it was perfectly adequate for our needs. The hotel had a problem with their hot water system for 2 days while we were there, only a minor inconvenience really as we just had to wait a while longer than we would have liked, for hot water. The room lighting was energy saving which meant very low light levels.The hotel itself does not have any catering or bar facilities, no fridge/safe/tea or coffee making facilities or hairdryer(unless requested) in the room. However, the 24 hour Cranberry Cafe Deli (just 2 doors away) meets all needs and more. We used it every morning for breakfast and most evenings for coffee on the way back.The Reception staff were variable from totally uncommunicative to quite friendly, an interesting mix.	
Jan 22 2009 	Great Time in New York	Just came back from a great 4 days in New York. If the highlight of your trips is the luxury of the hotel coupled with great food and top service, then there are probably hotels in New York that would be a better match for your requirements...but for our requirements this hotel was perfect!The room (604) was large and clean. It was serviced everyday (they have an envelope in the room to put your housekeeper's tip in, but you get used to that in New York). The radiator did make some funny noises but not enough to keep anyone awake I wouldn't have thought and the shower was never piping hot but it was never freezing cold either. Outside the temperature was around -15 deg c whilst we were there, but it was never cold in the room.Location was important for us and this hotel scores 10/10 on that front. Times Square 2 mins walk away (if that), Macy's, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building, The Rock..all within 10 mins walk, Central Park, The Natural History Museum, The Dakota all within 15 mins tops. We only took the subway when we headed for the Bronx...for every other destination we walked, including The 'Stat Nisland' ferry right at the southern (downtown) tip of the island. So we wanted a good bed to rest our weary heads and legs and the St James didn't disappoint.No food at the hotel but a great deli (The Cranberry) only 2 doors away..it was fantastic...great food, and a great selection at pretty good prices too ($2.75 for a scrambled egg/bacon/toast combo e.g.) The street also had 2/3 Irish bars in it for those who like a drink without too far to stagger home :) If you prefer dealing with household names Fridays and MacDonalds were only 2 mins away in Times Square.Not usually one to go OTT but Times Square and the view from the Empire State observatory were totally awesome dude!Good shout from another reviewer about tickets for the comic strip from street sellers in Times Square...it was great..do it!When talking more concisely about cities and hotels, all you can say is whether you'd go back or not...and we definitely would to both New York AND the Hotel St James.If you're thinking of going..stop thinking and start doing...GO!	
Jan 21 2009 	It does exactly what is says on the "TIN"	Had read dif reports on this hotel, it really is a budget hotel, but the best tip that I could ever give anyone, which I had already picked up from a previous tripadvisor is to tip house keeping everyday, it really does work wonders.. Our room was kept immaculate, even our very p.j's set out and folded, enough clean towels left everyday and it just seemed that housekeeping went that little bit extra..Good: The location is superb, rite beside Toys r Us on Time Square, 5min walk to Macys, great bars and deli's next door that did wonderful breakfast.. Front desk staff are very friendly and the hotel does provide a seating area so you could carry food in and eat it.. IPoor: Is that I rang down to the reception and asked if we could have a room with a fridge, I was told that &quot;we are a no frills hotel, mam&quot;, which I found funny but oh so true. Our room was front facing and could be quite noisy, also the rooms are quite small and a little frayed around the edges.There are steps into the hotel and with heavy suitcases are very akward along with the front door that is very heavy and hard to push, this took some maneourving..All in all, would stay if I really had too, and was on a budget..	
Jan 14 2009	Great location	This hotel is in a great location and was cheap! The rooms are old fashioned but clean. The only problem was the door leading into the room next to us had a little gap round in so the people next door to us kept us up all night coz they were talking. They have internet access in the lobby for 2 dollars for about 5 minutes which was useful. Overall i would recommend this hotel. It is very cheap and it a nice pleasant hotel in a great location	
Jan 7 2009 	Loved the Hotel St. James	Went to NYC December 26-29, 2008 and stayed at the Hotel St. James. I had read the reviews and was a little apprehensive. However, the room was fine (no bed bugs or bugs of any kind), it was clean and the housekeeping staff as well as the other hotel staff were very nice. The price was reasonable (less than $200 per night) compared with the the other hotels nearby. The location being less than a block from Times Square was perfect. The Dunhill Cafe next door was very good and not too pricey- at least not when compared with some of the other places we ate i.e., Carnegie &amp; Roxy's Deli (you'll pay $16.95-19.95 for a cold sandwich). We were asked to leave our key at the front desk when we left, I only did it once. It was too much of a hassle when we returned - having to wait in line at the front desk . Overall we had a great time and would definitely stay at the St. James again.	
Jan 6 2009	Location Location Location	This hotel is very basic, but you don't go to NYC to sit in your hotel room. The location is fantastic. 100m from the centre of Times Square. Accommodation was clean and comfortable. Staff were great. We would definately stay there again!!!	
Jan 4 2009 	Love this place!!!	Great location first of all, walk for a min and your in times square!! Hotel was nice, the room was cool and had wireless internet in there so could use the net for free in my room and it was very easy to set up. Checking in and out was made very easy by the great and friendly staff.Had a bit of problems with the plumbing making funny noises during the night and the bathroom was very hot. The lift was also slow sometimes during busy periods. They are the only bad things i can say and they were not bad and didnt really effect us at all.They also had lockers there for $5 a day which means we could keep all our shopping and my laptop in there and not have to worry. Also we were never asked to leave our key at the front desk, very clean and our room was cleaned everyday. The hotel was perfect for me and this would be the only place i would want to stay if i come back to NYC. Which was also amazing!! If you go make sure you buy a ticket for the comedy clubs off people on the street in times square, $10 and 2 drink min but such a good time and cheap for an hour and a halfs worth of comedy.Oh and the deli's next door were cool to, bacon cheeseburger was very nice!!!	
Jan 3 2009	Oh What a week!	We just had a trip of a lifetime in NYC the week before Christmas. I really don't understand some of the people who write reviews. Do you go to NYC to stay in the hotel room? This is an absolutely perfect location. We love the theater, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Spectacular, Times Square,shopping, etc. When you walk out the door, you are right in the middle of it all.  The St. James couldn't have been more perfect. The room was quite adequate, cleaned daily, and NO BED BUGS. Most of the staff was quite helpful, but especially, our friend Joey. He made us feel quite at home. Next to the St. James is the Dunhill Cafe--best deal in town. The two of us went there daily for our breakfast for less the $5.00 Thanks for your hospitality. We'll be back next year!BgardnerMississippi	
Jan 1 2009 	Pal Joey	This was our second time to stay at the St. James. The location is FABULOUS. The staff was friendly and helpful for the most part. One of the staff, Joey, was especially kind and professional.We found the room to be clean and serviceable for our needs.We enjoyed the deli next door too. We visit NYC often and now would not stay anywhere else. Thanks St. James and Happy New Year!!!!!!	
Dec 30 2008 	Great value	This is not a luxury hotel - but it's great value for the location. It's so close to Rockefeller Plaza and Times Square, you're right in the middle of the action when you step out of the door. The rooms are a decent size (we travel around Europe regularly and just got back from Japan, so we thought they were a pretty normal size. Americans may find the rooms small I suppose.) Most of the staff at the desk were very friendly.... the only exception was when I had to pay to use the internet in the lobby, and the printer didn't work. The guy working at the desk told me that the particular computer I was using wasn't connected to the printer. Since I had just paid 50 cents to print, I complained that there was no sign or warning ahead of time.... the response from the guy behind the desk was &quot;Well what do you want me to do about it?!?&quot;. Not exactly what I expected to hear. So don't use the computer off to the side to print - it's not connected to the printer, and won't warn you, and will charge you money anyway.But the rest of the staff were great - I gave one of them our unused Radio City tour tickets because he was really nice and helpful. You can have a cheap and good breakfast next door at one of the two almost identical cafes. Overall it was very good value for money in a very overpriced city.	
Dec 30 2008 	Great Location - Great Value	Phew. After reading some of the reviews, to say that I was somewhat concerned when we arrived at the hotel would be an understatement. However, were greeted by a charming receptionist and given the keys to an (admittedly) upgraded room. It was large (in big city standards) with a good bathroom and plenty of hanging space. All very clean, and a waft of paint, so had clearly been recetly redecorated.A short (and I mean short) stroll down the road and arrived in Times Square, the buzzing atmosphere on the doorstep but the hotel tucked away in a quiet side street.As mentioned we were upgraded, so cannot speak of other rooms, but on our experience, recommended!	
Dec 28 2008 	perfect location i'll be back	After reading reviews about bed bugs we were a little cautious about what we may discover during our stay at St James. However we shouldn't have worried. We had a large clean room (1111) and clean bathroom and it was quiet. It was the perfect location for exploring NYC. We have stayed in New York before, but we will certainly return to St James next time. The added bonus is the great bar, Connelly's and the two deli's right next door. No need to be getting taxis to and fro at night. The hotel is within walking distance of some great restaurants, an italian in 44th st between 6th and 7th ave (called trapa dora or something similar) Carmines on 44th street between 7th and 8th ave and John's pizza just down from Carmines. St James is def more than the budget traveller would expect.....and the rooms are roasting!!!!	
Dec 27 2008 	Affordable and great location - Not impressed with service	This hotel was definitely not 5 star, however it was a relatively cheap roof over our head. We were located only metres from Times Square and paid hundreds of dollars less than any other motel in the area, however this was for a reason. The foyer was nice and new, with internet and concierge facilities, however the rooms were outdated and basic. We found a mouse or two in our room during the night, and had to do a mad clean, disposing of all rubbish which had not been emptied. My partner advised the front desk, who simply said &quot;sorry about that&quot;, but didnt offer to change rooms or help out. Also, we had to hand in our 1 room key each time we left the building, and ask for it when we returned, which was extremely annoying. We were never asked for ID and were given someone else's key a number of times, which was extremely bad security. The concierge and one of the night receptionsists were very pushy with trying to sell tours etc, which was obvious they were getting commissions from. Even after these problems, I would still recommend the hotel if nothing else is available in the price range.SAVING MONEYIf you have not booked in to see any shows or musicals, I would recommend a visit to the TKTS booth in Times Square on the day you wish to see a show, for heavily discounted tickets. You will also find lots of street vendors selling bus tours for the hop on hop off tours, which are great value. Just decide first which company you want to go through, as there are red and blue buses and only one company has a roof on the top deck (important in rainy whether).	
Dec 22 2008 	Great Location!!	This place was fine. I really do not understand some of the negative reviews. The place was clean, the staff including the front desk personnel, the concierge and the cleaning folks were very courteous and went out of their way to accomadate, ie early check-in and late check-out. The elevators are old but they work. The smaller of the two always stops at floor 2 no matter what. The best part of this place is the location to Times square, Radio city, Rockefeller center, St Patricks, and some great food etc. It is in the center of it all. There is subway accesss very close as well. The rooms were small and there is a lot osf street noise if you stay in front but what would you expect in NYC. We were not in the rooms very often anyway. Do not be afraid to stay here.	
Dec 18 2008 	big gaz	excellent cheap and cheerful in the heart of manhattan.very clean, staff very helpful, couldn't really fault it and will stay there next visit. thanks to all at hotel, merry christmas.	
Dec 17 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location!!!!	Do not listen to any of the bad reports about this hotel, I was very nervous after having read some of the reviews but I had no need to worry. Our room (701) was ample in size, it was perfectly clean, it certaintly DID NOT have bed bugs!!! The bathroom was very nice and absolutely spotless, there was plenty of closet space, there was no problem with the water in the shower! The towels and bedding were clean and fresh daily! The staff are very friendly and very hepful providing you are nice to them, if you have a rude attitude towards them (as I unfortunatly witnessed from a few guests staying there) then what do you expect! The location is absolutely brilliant, as other reviews say both delis below are great for breakfast or even lunch! Although I highly recommend Juniors, on 45th st but 1 block across past times square, that place was amazing!!! Excellent food and excellent prices! This was my 3rd visit to New York, I previously stayed at the Beacon (on the upper west side) and more recently the Wellington on 7th Ave, both of these Hotels have higher star ratings BUT when I go back next yr I will be staying at the St James, definately the best by far!!! and of course the best value for money!!!	
Dec 16 2008 	Decent hotel great location!!!	You are paying for the excellent location here in Midtown, within walking distance to everything touristy. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel rooms are fine, the bathrooms are renovated, the room was clean with good beds. Overall, budget minded travelers will be very pleased!!	
Dec 11 2008 	Great location for a great price!	We stopped in this hotel for 3 nights - from reading some of the previous reviews we were a little unsure of what to expect. Thankfully I can say from our experience that non of the problems that have been stated in other reviews were a issue for us. The hotel room was basic but clean. We have stopped in New York before and were aware of the exterior noises that can be a pain at night time - but our room (608) was really quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful but not in your face. The lifts were fine - we never waited more than a minute. When checking out of the hotel there are lockers that you can put your suitcases in if you have a later flight.The location is excellent. There is a great little deli next door called Dunhill and another deli next to that. There are 3 or 4 irish pubs on the same street which do food. Then at the bottom of the street is Times Square. In the opposite direction a few streets up is the Rockerfeller Center and Radio City music hall so you are never far away from the action.If you are expecting the Ritz then I wouldn't stay here - but if you want a decent place to get your head down that is close to everything the I would definatly recommend this hotel!	
Dec 10 2008 	Bargain find in a great location!	Considering it is tough to find a hotel for under $300 a night in NY, this was a real find, as it is well within walking distance of midtown attractions. Could not find a better location. It is older with a well-worn feel, but kept clean - the bathroom was spotless. Most NYC hotel rooms are the size of a closet, but our double with two beds actually had a sitting area - by NY standards it was very spacious. It advertises hair dryers available, so when I didn't see one in the bathroom I called the front desk. They are loaned out from there and I never had trouble getting one. Including all taxes, we stayed in NY for $252 a night! Not an easy accomplisment in a neighborhood where you actually WANT to stay!	
Dec 9 2008 	Cheap and cheerful	Stayed here for 6 nights over Thanksgiving, and it was a nice enough place. Room was big with 2 double beds and a decent sized bathroom too. No hairdryer, but we brought our own since hotel ones tend to be rubbish anyway. Lifts were slow, but since we only really used them once or twice a day, it wasn't too much of a bother. Room was very warm, not sure I'd stay there in the summer as there didn't seem to be an air-con unit. Great location for Times Square. Was a bit noisy at night as we had a room facing front street, but it didn't keep us awake. Deli's next door were very handy, and a couple of nearby pubs too. A bit bemused with the Irish Pub nearby(connelly's?), that states it serves breakfast all day. When we went in for breakfast, we were handed the dinner menu, and told they didn't serve bagels/pancakes etc.....Eh?? We did have one evening meal there which was very nice.I'd stay here again, although I will enquire about air-con if I visit next in the summer.	
Dec 8 2008 	I wouldn't recommend the St. James	The only thing good about this hotel is its location. Rooms are small, no amenities in the room, bedding didn't really fit the beds, towels are paper thin, water not real hot in the shower plus there was not a lot of water pressure coming out of the shower head. Beware - - there are no hair dryers in the room, nor shower caps, lotion, conditioner or iron.	
Dec 7 2008 	Great Choice	Just returned from 3 night stay at the St James,was a bit worried because of some of the reviews but they were unfounded as hotel was great. We stayed with our two grown up daughters and had two adjoining rooms on sixth floor. Fantastic location right on Times Sq, friendly staff ,very clean and great maid service, good internet service in lounge . Furnishing/ decoration a bit tatty in places but then you dont go to New York to spend time looking at that, no hair dryer or iron in room but you only have to ask at reception. Had no problem with noise at night or with the lifts although one is a bit slow. As mentioned in other reviews great delis next door , perfect for breakfast. Overall very happy with choice and would definately stay again	
Nov 28 2008 	fantastic location	we booked this hotel to celebrate our sons 21st birthday.After booking we were worried about going due to some bad reviews, particulary the one were a woman claims to have been bitten by bed bugs!Our worries were unfounded, the hotel was very homely, no it was not perfect, (carpets and tiles in bedroom a little tatty) but hey what do you expect for the price!We were initially given room 210 but did not sleep well due to a generater outside the window. Next morning we asked if we could change rooms and was told to ask later in the day as there were none available. When we asked in the afternoon we were given the choice of two rooms, and we chose 810 which was bigger.The only gripe about this hotel were the lifts, they took forever!The staff were pleasant, (the men more than the women!) but did not go out of their way to make conversation.The deli next door was great, friendly and good value.The hotel is in a prime location, times square is at the bottom of the street! If all you need is a comfy clean bed whilst you are in new york this hotel is a little gemMy daughter and i will be going back next year.	
Nov 26 2008 	convenient location	I loved the location. your out the door&gt;turn right&gt;and your in the heart of times square. We used the second deli next door twice a day, for the bagels! The lifts were slow, and when we arrived, I found there were no plugs! BUT..I found one near the window (far from a mirror,so it was useless). The bathroom was nice,the bed was comfortable. The staff were friendly. There was hardly any noise at night (only the occasional siren). Room service was good.The maids were friendly. Overall-didn't want to leave!	
Nov 26 2008 	perfect hotel in the heart of everything	Just returned from the st james hotel and was really happy with my choice!!!hotel right in the centre of everything.rooms comfortable and good bathroom,beds very comfortable,no hairdryer in rooms but if you ring down to reception they have one sent up to your room.its not a 5 star hotel but its comfortable,and very clean,clean towels every day.i would definatley return to this hotel and am wanting to return next year it is everything i wanted, there is a deli next door to the hotel called cranberry and the breakfasts are fantastic!!!the staff at st james are really nice and helpfull especially joey who was brilliant.	
Nov 19 2008 	Horrible stay in this poor quality hotel	We returned from NY some months ago, but bad memories from Hotel st James are still &quot;fresh&quot;. The quality level of the rooms is really low: no comfort, small space, no hangers in the tiny closet, broken mirror, broken forniture, noisy a/c, noise from the road, bad smell, from the window we could only see a wall and garbage (see pictures)... I cannot remember a single good thing about the room. And the rest of the structure is not better...Only one elevator available for 12 floors and it was so inefficient that it would take between 5 and 10 minutes to get it!The assistance from the staff or the managers is almost inexistent. I strongly suggest you not to get tempted by the price because, after experiencing this hotel, I would not stay there even for free! You could probably save money booking this hotel, but you also risk to ruin your trip.Even if you think you will only spend few hours at the hotel (for example just to sleep), they could really be uncomfortable hours...	
Nov 12 2008 	great hotel for the price close to everything!! staff is great!!!	we'll be back!!! they whole staff was wonderfully/very helpful/ great location/deli next door has everything all the theaters are so close.I want to thank everyone from the 1st time I called until we checked out/doesn't have any refrigerator and the tv is small but we didn't come to watch tv anyway	
Nov 11 2008 	FANTASTIC FIND	We booked our rooms at this hotel in January for this years marathon and as the year went by were more and more worried about some of the reviews we had seen. We need not have been. The rooms were a very good size, by far the biggest I have ever stayed in in New York and they were very clean. The situation is perfect right on Times Square. The two delis next door were perfect for breakfast and Connellys is perfect for a nightcap before bedtime. All in all well worth the money we paid and we will be staying here again next time we come.	
Nov 11 2008 	Super Location-Great Price	I arrived at Hotel St James, got my key and hurried to my room to see what kind of deal we had truly gotten. I was pleasantly surprised to find our hotel room large from what I hear the typical NY room would be. The bathroom was SUPER clean. That was especially important to me. This may be a 2 star hotel, but what an excellent place for the price. The staff were all very nice and helpful. It's located literally under a minute of walking to Times Square. The Dunhill Deli is open 24 hours and it's one door down from the hotels door. If you prefer drinks and don't want to walk far from that, then there is a pub that is only a few doors down as well. This is a perfect place to stay if you are looking to save money. It's a clean place to lay your head get some sleep and head out to many local attractions just walking distance away. I would definately come back and stay again, as well as recommend this hotel to anyone of my friends or family. Thanks! My sister and I enjoyed our stay!	
Nov 4 2008 	Can't beat the location!	Stayed for three nights at the Hotel St. James. We had a large room with two double beds at the back of the hotel. The room was very clean, with lots of towels, but little else in the way of amenities. Noise was never a problem. Times Square was less than a block away. We ate most of our meals in the two delis adjacent to the hotel. Avoid booking shows through the concierge. You'll get a better deal by walking 5 minutes to Times Square and getting tickets there. I wasn't expecting luxury and was very pleased with the hotel. It has lots of character and I would definitely stay there again.	
Nov 4 2008 	Just right	Ok, if you want the Marriott, stay at the Marriott. This is a nice little off-beat off-Broadway hotel in NYC ... but not far off Broadway. Times Square right at the end of the block! The hotel was clean and not run-down, the staff were fine. I've seen comments (complaints) about &quot;daily tips&quot; to the housekeeping staff - well, the first day, I put a 5 in the envelope; when we were packing up to check out, I discovered it still there.We (me, my wife, two four-year-olds) were here for the NYC Marathon, and were perfectly happy. Our room was roomy, the bathroom was clean and new, the windows could be opened (I like fresh air). Ok, it wasn't perfect; for instance, there was no nightstand. I mentioned it to the desk clerk, and he vaguely agreed that some of the rooms are missing some furniture items. Ok, I'd have liked him to at least act a little more concerned, but we found a way to make do. But really, that was it.Two places right next door to pick up breakfast/lunch/dinner, snacks, coffee, etc., two pub/restaurants a few doors down, a restaurant across the street next to Starbucks, all within steps of the front door. Walk to one corner, 6th Ave, you can see the Rockefeller Ctr and Central Park. The other corner, 7th, you could watch the ball drop. Brief walk to the Times Sq. subway station. All for a very reasonable rate. Maybe I have Motel 6 expectations, but it was exactly what we wanted and needed.	
Nov 1 2008 	a good hotel for the money I would stay here again	We visited New York last week for 4 days and wanted to spend our money on shopping, trips etc not on a hotel. I looked at reviews on this site and saw that some were fine and others negative. We took the chance knowing that we weren't fussed about luxury, space and dint mind it being basic.I have to say overall I was impressed. The room was basic but big enough for 2 with plenty of storage for clothes. the room was clean and maid service was daily. The hotel is in an ideal location. There are 2 delhi/cafes and 2 Irish pubs on the road. Times Sq is very close but not so close that noise is a problem. the only problem that we had was that the central heating was very noisy and it woke us up by bangiing and clinking early in the morning. We complained and were offered to change rooms but we decided not to as we couldnt be bothered to pack. After another night though we were fed up and after a couple of hours of calling reception at 2AM we were given a room to sleep in until we checked out in the morning. Yes we didn't sleep very well but they were friendly and offered us another room so we can't complain really.If you are only in NYC for a short time and you are not bothered about your hotel being swish then stay here and spend the money you save on doing something fun. I would stay here again but would be quicker to complain about the radiator and not put up with the noise!	
Oct 31 2008 	Central cheap and clean	Just returned from 5 nights at the St James - we chose to spend less on accomodation so we had more for shopping etc so we knew we would be getting basic accomodation. The hotel was clean, the bedroom and bathroom very clean, towels changed every day etc. Staff generally were not over friendly but one man helped us out a couple of times and was friendly and helpful. The position was excellent for Times Square and I would definately recommend the 2 deli's next door - good food at reasonable prices. Our room was at the front and it was noisy and particularly bad from the large truck which seemed to come in the early hours of the morning reversed and then kept the engine running for 30 minutes.Overall good value for money and I would use the hotel again.	
Oct 28 2008 	I was worried	After reading some of the reviews for this hotel i was very worried. When i arrived i was shocked, the hotel was lovely and clean, the staff were friendly, I would have no hesitation in going back there or to recommend it to anyone else . It was so central. Only negative thing i could say is the water wasn't always hot and some of the carpet in the hall way was worn.	
Oct 27 2008	Good Hotel	We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived the hotel as the reviews did not reflect the true hotel. We were staying on the 12th floor and there was no noise. Staff were very helpful and friendly and staff even took our bags to the hotel. Room were basic but very clean and were cleaned every day. Only complaint being no safety deposit box. Hotel was ideally located. I would have no problem recommending this hotel and I will definitely be staying there next year when we are going on our annual shopping trip to NYC	
Oct 24 2008 	No problems with this one	Just one block from Times Square this hotel couldn't be more central. Lovely entrance foyer with a variety of always-pleasant staff. Asked for name along with key on all bar one occasion.Room was adequate in size and cleaned daily to a high standard (remember and tip the housekeeper -they DO leave you an envelope as is the norm in NYC!) and the bathroom was very clean. Loads of fresh towels each day.We had a room fronting onto the street - it IS NOISY! - but then you can't go to the 'City that never sleeps' and then be surprised when you hear loads of acivity at 5am! Requesting a room to the rear might help but don't expect a view over Manhattan.Excellent locker sytem for your luggage if you need to use it on day of departure.Bar installation of double glazing, we couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough for what we paid.	
Oct 24 2008 	Okay hotel	If you wanna stay close to Times Square for approx. 200$ per night this hotel is okay. Many things could be improved, but you get what you pay for. A security box in the rooms is a must when the staff is giving the keys without any kind of identification. I would look for a good hostel next time in NY. The rooms is not better than a double bedroom at a good hostel.	
Oct 20 2008 	Security Bad Bad Bad	Just returned from a 3 day stay at the St James and so glad it was such a short stay.On arrival at hotel we were met by staff who watched as we struggled to get cases up the steps and into the foyer, check in was quick but not very welcoming and just about managed to direct us to the lifts with a shrug.Room nice and clean, bed linen, towels, etc all clean and tidy and freindly chambermaid, all OK so far.On turning on Air Conditioning unit I noticed this was not securely fastened and fitted in such a way as to prevent the main window from locking, this WINDOW leads out to a roof on 2nd floor, alongside this was a makeshift repair using Perspex/clear plastic (for USA readers) this was secured by just TWO small screws and gaps filled using tissue! SEE PICTURES ...Having brought this to the attention of the desk a supervisor arrived and assured us this was perfectly safe!! giving a 100% assurance that things would be safe :&gt;). Having a lot of Camera equipment I asked for the window to be secured. Along came guy who obviously did not want to be there and drawled &quot; whats the problem&quot; with a sigh, and then proceeds to screw down the window shut by drilling through the frame and slide which at the time suited me fine as we needed to be elsewhere but in hindsight this has to break so many regulations it's crazy ..Well the remaining time passed with no more problems apart from the staffs attitude which seemed to permeate right througfh the whole building ,only one member of staff at desk seemed happy to give answers and this was one of maybe Six or Seven people over three days!..my summary Pros good location to Times Square Cons Just about everything elseValue for money 3/10 This is a great shame as this is located ideally and with a very small effort from the owners/management paying attention to presentation this could be a nice reasonably priced hotel and a pleasure to stay in .footnote .: I believe this to be an honest opinion of my stay at this hotel and would add I've never been moved to write any thing like this before now..Hope this helps..Paul  Liverpool UK	
Oct 19 2008 	Cheap and Cheerful.	We have just returned from a four night stay at this hotel. I was terrified about what was awaiting us at the hotel having read some awful reviews. I am pleased to report that no bed bugs were found, lift never took any longer than a couple of minutes, hotel room was quiet, all staff very friendly and helpful and room, linen and towels were all clean. This is a budget hotel in a great location, luxury not to be expected but great for a room you are hardly in because you are busy in NYC.	
Oct 17 2008 	excellent location good price	Stayed here for 5 nights in September. It is only 2/3 minutes from Times Sq. It's nothing fancy but clean and great if all you want is somewhere comfortable to sleep. The staff were helpful and there's a great deli next door. Not big on facilities but who spends their time in their room in NYC??!!	
Oct 13 2008 	Reasonably Priced	Myself and my husband stayed at this hotel in September 2008. Its location is excellent - literally a 5 min walk and your in the middle of Times Square! The hotel is quite basic, but I beleive in what you pay for is what you get. Its one of the cheaper (if not the cheapest that you can get at this location). The room was small but clean, the bathroom was modern and clean. The maids came in every day and changed the beds and cleaned the bathroom leaving fresh towels every day!! (I read a story about the bed bugs that someone had left and was suprised at that considering the beds are changed constantly with fresh clean sheets. The view - well there was no view in our room as we were at the back of the hotel - therefore looked onto the back of a building but hey we were not there to hang about the hotel for long so this wasnt a probelm for us. We had our laptop with us and we got connected to the St James netwrok without a problem and the connection speed was excellent. You had to hand your key into reception every time you went out - as soon as they recognised you you were able to get your key no problem, otherwise if someone was on the desk that you hadnt met before they would always ask your name before giving the key. The staff were friendly, we had no problem whatsoever at this hotel and would definately recommend it to others, wouldnt hesitate about staying here again. Lovely deli next door and if you have to be out your room before you head to airport you can hire lockers in the hotel, excellent idea and you know your luggage is safe!! We had family that came to the hotel and there was never a problem with them coming and going. Overall great location, great price, clean - what else do you need in NYC?	
Oct 5 2008 	...	Just arrived back from this hotel, stayed 3 nights...room was clean and tidy and shower adequate. This hotel was central for every attraction..central park, empire state building, Grand Central, rockfellar and Time square was right around the corner. Subways were quick and handy to use. The deli next to the hotel did great food...The perfect pint barman Dave made you feel at home...	
Oct 5 2008 	Great location	I'd seen a few bad reviews on here after booking the hotel which made me a little concerned about what it was going to be like. When we got there though we were pleasantly surprised as it wasn't as bad as some reviews had made out.The hotel is in a great location and has everything that you need when it's your first time visiting the city - a clean bed and bathroom, since how much time do you need to spend in your hotel room when there is so much to see? The majority of the staff were friendly but a little relaxed in carrying out security checks. We were only asked a couple of times for our names when getting our room keys and on one occasion were given the wrong key. There also seems to be a well kept secret on making sure that your bedroom door is locked properly. We had to ask at reception after the first day as we came back to find the door unlocked after housekeeping had been in. Make sure that you check the latch on door handle is turned before you leave your room.Overall it wasn't too bad. It's in a great location and is perfect if you're just looking for somewhere clean to spend the night. I would definitely go again if we were travelling in a group again.	
Oct 4 2008 	Don't worry	I was really anxious about staying here because of the bad reviews, but I booked it because of the location and price. I needn't have worried.The hotel was spotlessly clean, and we had loads of fresh towels everyday. The lifts weren't slow when we were there, but you do have to press the button on each lift for them to come. One button does not call them both. There were no bed bugs, as per one poster, and the sheets were lovely and clean. We had air conditiioning and a lovely shower and bath. The room was bright and very spacious. We had two double beds and enough space to have done a barn dance in between them! True, you have to hand in your key, and be a bit nervous that they don't always ask your name on return, but just be careful about that and don't leave cash in your room. I asked before hand about safe deposit boxes and they confirmed that they do not have one but would look after passports, but not cash, behind the desk.There are luggage lockers to leave your suitcases at $5 for a large locker for a day. Bargain, we put in two huge cases and a rucksack. Location was spot on, just steps from Times Square, but the down side for us was that it was very, very noisey. We had road works outside and they drilled at 2 in the morning. I assume that this was a one off! Don't hesitate to stay here if you want a great location, a cheap price and spotlessly clean facilities.	
Sep 30 2008	Great Value for the Location	The Hotel St James is located absolutely brilliantly just off Times Square, and to be fair you couldnt get much of a better location than that! We were all first time visitors to New York so we were rarely in the hotel anyway. (Most of) the staff were very friendly and helped out with all queries quickly and without fuss. The security issue was a bit of a worry, we were only asked on a few occasions to provide ID to show we were staying there, but I have to say I never at any time felt unsafe, or that my key would be given out to a stranger. The &quot;Lift / Elevator&quot; issue was never a problem for me, it was always working fine and we were on the top floor! The rooms were always clean and of a good size. We had rooms overlooking the street right out to Times Square and unless you are a very very light sleeper, you would not be affected by the noise through the night. As mentioned in previous reviews, the Delis next door are extremely handy and very reasonably priced. I would have absolutely no hesitation in staying here again and recommending it to other visitors to New York City - especially if you are on a budget; very good value!	
Sep 28 2008 	what you expext for the price!	Its not the worst hotel you could stay at but basically you get what you pay for. We spent the month travelling America staying in various hotels. This was the worst - and the most expensive! but that is more to do with the price of New York hotels than anything.Plus points - the rooms are clean and you get plenty of towels etc, there is good internet access and great delis next door. The location is also fantastic. Lifts were a little slow but not too much of a problem and we had no problems with showers, hot water etc.Negatives - handing in your room key - how do they get away with this? There are no secuity checks at all! We were never told on check in to hand it in - so one night we were SHOUTED at by the guy at Reception for not handing it in - very embarrassing when there were a lot of people in the lobby. Another evening we shared a lift with a man and his 'friend' for the evening - i suppose this could happen at even the best of hotels but even so! Also our room was at the back which meant it was nice and quiet but we had absolutely no natural light at all so even in the middle of the day we had the light on - giving it a cell like quality!For those who really are on a budget then don't be put off, but if you can possibly manage to scrape together enough money to stay somewhere better then do - this hotel did ruin our stay in New York because we never felt safe there and i was always worried someone would have taken all our belongings when we got back. Although i accept you dont spend much time in your hotel, when you are on a long trip like we were you need to be able to feel comfortable in your room and we never did.	
Sep 24 2008	WARNING	Arrived at hotel from Las Vegas following my daughters wedding. There were 10 of us in the party being 4 families. On arrival at 8.30pm we were informed that the rooms had been doubled booked even though we had paid in advance for 4 nights. At 11.30pm the hotel had managed to find alternative accomodation at another hotel. On arrival at the new hotel we found that they only had two rooms available sleeping 4 in total. Six of us slept on the floor. The following day we returned to the St. James Hotel to be told that rooms would be made available later that day. We stayed at the St. James for the remainder of the stay. The hotel have refused to return the payment for the 2 rooms not provided. They have also refused to pay for the taxi fares transporting 10 people and luggage to and from the other hotel. They day we left a similar occurance occured with a family from Brazil. Be warned !!!!!!!!!	
Sep 23 2008 	Nothing Wrong with this Hotel!	I just can't believe the bad reviews regarding this hotel. My daughter and I stayed at the St James, for a week and we LOVED it!From stepping into the foyer we were greeted by very friendly and helpful reception staff. I didnt have a problem with handing in our key everytime we left, infact I would rather hand it in than lose it (which I'am sure people have done in the past). I have stayed at many hotels where you hand over your key and it has never been a problem.Our room was a good size, with large comfy beds plus well lit when lights were on. We had 8 bath towels and 3 face cloths, which I thought was more than generous! We also had a hairdyer. The room was kept generally clean but it wasn't 'dirty' for there to be a problem. The location of the hotel was excellent as I'am sure everyone who has stayed at the St James will confirm. The 2 deli's right next door came in handy when buying our fresh milk for our cups of tea.We chose this hotel because at the time, I counted more good reviews than bad ones, so I think that sums it up.If you require a hotel with immaculate cleaned rooms, safe deposit box's, irons, hairdryers etc then pay the 4 - 5 star hotel prices (there's plenty of them) The St James's is more than adequate for what you pay for. Can't wait to go back and would certainly stay there again.	
Sep 23 2008 	just a place to lay your head!	have been to new york a few times so kind of knew what to expect hotel wise. but was really dissapointed with the st james.staff are rude,crass and don't seem to really care about their customers whatsoever.the lifts are a standing joke with all the guests,as they seem to take a life time to get anywhere and are very very small.housekeepng staff threw away my wife's contraceptive pill hence now she is pregnant(hooray!)the rooms are very dated,bathroom is way too tiny.but hey this is new york and we only needed a bed .worst crime of all is that this hotel has NO ROOM SAFES OR SAFTEY DEPOSIT BOXES.and i had to carry all our cash,cards and passports around for 12 dayswould i stay here again? yes but only at a push and only because i love the city soooo much.please try the deli's next door and dont forget to put a tip in the karma cup.	
Sep 19 2008 	Never again	Just returned this week from a 4-night stay; not our 1st trip to NYC, so we knew standards were much lower, but this was an all-time low. Largest &amp; most serious complaint is there was NO security used with their handling of room keys. They asked that you leave key at desk each time you leave, and when you return, you simply walk up, state your room#, and you are handed a key. NO identification as belonging to that key is required; it could be given to anyone walking in off the street! When I complained of this the old gentleman told me &quot;he recognized us&quot;. We had never seen him before as he was not anywhere on duty when we checked in earlier. We stopped turning in our key as a result. Toilet was built right up against wall/door, could not sit properly for use. No hand towels ever; no kleenex ever; no iron; no hair dryers. When asked at desk for some of these items, took 24 hours to receive in room. Very poor lighting in room &amp; bath. Will not be returning to this hotel, nor would we recommend it to family or friends.	
Sep 15 2008 	A Dump	This is the worst hotel we have stayed in for 30 years and we have travelled extensively.Lumpy beds and pillows.barely acceptably clean,towels not fit for floorcloths and bathroom so small you had to sit on the loo sideways.The staff were surly,unhelpful and rude.The room cleaners work hard but a thankless task.The only good things were the delis next door.	
Sep 13 2008 	Perfect	My boyfriend and I's words when we were turning the door knob into our room at Hotel St James were pretty much 'ok here we go - who wants to look first'. Although past reviews on here shouted how great the location was, the bed bug comments and security issues were what bothered me most.On entering the room we found a clean room, if a little dark due to the window being at the back of the building into an alley. The bathroom was new and aside from a poor taste in paint colour, it all looked fine.The location was, indeed perfect, the deli's next door were a god send and anyone who goes to the trouble to moan about having to wait a mere 20-30 secs for a lift is v. fussy in my mind. There was only one older reception guy who asked our name when asking for our key on our return, everyone else was less bothered and only asked the room number.We had a very cheap deal through expedia for just £570 for 6 days and i think the hotel must be a favourite of expedia deals as the hotel was filled with English!I've now come to the conclusion that many reviews on here are from very fussy people - although i don't doubt those who had bedbug issues as maybe we were just lucky.So going on my own experience of the hotel the location was great, it was clean, concierge helpful and everything you could need for a decent city crash pad.	
Aug 31 2008 	Great location clean room nice staff	We are 4 German travellers and stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. First of all it´s right next to Times Square. Everything was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room smelled fresh, the bathroom was nice. The beds in the room were a little small for two persons each, but for us it was okay. I can recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to have a comfortable, convenient stay without any extras, but for a relatively good price.	
Aug 19 2008	Was pleased with hotel	We stayed there for a whole week and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the location and we didn't have any problems, I had read other opinions so I was cautious to look out for bed bugs, slow elevators,etc. The elevator was a bit slow but we never had to wait long. The room was clean much bigger than I thought it would be. It was quiet. I took my showers either late at night or early in the morning. I did speak to a woman who was on the 12th floor and she was complaining about not getting enough hot water. So maybe it was a peak time of usage not sure. The location was great!!! I would stay there again. The places next door had great food especially the 2 pizza slices and a drink for 5.95. If you are expecting luxury this isn't for you.	
Aug 19 2008 	It was great!	We stayed with 2 teenagers and we all loved it. The room was clean and spacious and the air conditioner worked great. The bathroom was a bit small but very clean. We stayed in several cities during this vacation and in many hotels and the beds in this one were among the most comfortable. We worried that it might be noisy but we slept like babies. The desk staff was really nice and there were 2 great delis right next door. Huge breakfast bagels for $2! We were within a block of Times Square and felt safe walking there and back even at 11:00 at night. We had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone staying in NYC.	
Aug 11 2008 	A Great stay in NYC... Even my picky teenager liked it !	My 13 year old daughter and I stayed here during a 4 day visit to NYC in mid July. I was worried about the hotel because of some negative reviews , but we found it to be an EXCELLENT place to stay for the location and price. Like most other reviews state it is not fancy but the room was very clean ( even smelled clean) and the bathroom was new. I was paranoid about bedbugs, but saw no signs after careful inspection.The days we were there were some of the hottest and humid of the summer, but the A/C in our room kept us cool at night. 2 woman traveling alone , I was a bit nervous but felt safe throughout our stay at the St James. We also loved the Dunhill and Cranberry Deli's next door.We ate breakfast at the Dunhill each day, and visited both for late night snacks before returning to the hotel at night. The front desk staff were very accommodating , however I would steer clear of the concierge ( or events desk) in the lobby that seem to be independent of the hotel. On two occasions we witnessed guests screaming at them because they had been ripped off in some way.Also when we were checking out the girl at the event desk followed us into the lockers trying to persuade us to pay 50.00 for a shuttle to the airport ( which visits many hotels and takes a couple of hours to get to JFK), she even went as far to lie to us saying the drive into Manhattan by taxi is flat rate of 45.00 plus toll($5.00) and tip, but going back to JFK you are on the meter and it will cost you upward to 75.00 on a Friday in traffic.In fact this is false , we drove back in a taxi for the same rate we came , and made the trip in record time. I would stay at the St James again and would not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends.Use the extra money you save to shop and enjoy the many wonderful attractions in NYC.	
Aug 11 2008 	Great Location	Great location right in the middle of Times Square, Two great delis next door open all hours do ace breakfasts. Two great pubs (bars) next to them to enjoy a beer even had the footy on (bonus). Hotel is clean but basic but you dont come to New York to sit in a room. Waited that long for a lift I had birthday but luckily we were only on the second floor hotel staff were weird &amp; had to interrogate them to get information out of. Overall would recommend this hotel for the money great value.	
Aug 10 2008	no problem with this hotel...	We stayed with much reluctance at the Hotel St James since some reviews are not so good. We were there two nights before our cruise and four nights after our cruise. Upon arriving I told the gentleman at the front desk that I wanted a nice room, as I would be reviewing on Trip Advisor, and wanted to give a good report. We had room #411 the first two nights,and although a bit small, it was VERY clean. I did my bed bug search since there was a recent post about them here, and glad to report,no problems.This room looked to have had some recent improvements. The bathroom was sparkling clean. We found the front desk crew to be very pleasant. Upon check out (July 26th), we told the lady we would be back after our cruise, and we hoped to have the same room, or one equally as nice. So, she made notes in her computer.We got back to the St James on Thursday, July 31st, and since we were early (check in is at 3pm), we had to wait a little while before our room was ready. The man on the front desk let us put our luggage in a room off the bar, so we did not have to use the rental lockers the hotel now provides. They have a very nice new room (I guess it will be the bar/lounge area once renovations are done) with comfy leather chairs and tables, and so we sat down and watched a little tv while waiting. Soon after the noon check out, our room was ready. They told us we could wait for room #411, or we could take another room that they thought we would like, so we went up to check it out, and it was a really BIG room (612). Very clean just like the first room, so we checked in and got settled. I think the air conditioner worked better in #411, but it was just fine for us. Our only complaint, and it was minor, was the fact that someone had put a wrong remote control in our room, and it did not work with our tv, and they could never seem to find the right one, nor did they ever get anyone to reprogram it to work with our tv. This was a little annoying since we were there for 4 nights, but not so much that we wanted to go down stairs and say, &quot;Please get me a working remote&quot; ! On both stays, the elevator was working just fine for us. The second elevator ( they use this as a service elevator), was a little smalller and warmer, so we always took the main elevator. Since we didnt have to go up that many floors, we didnt have that much trouble. Sometimes my hubby did take the stairs, but that was just his choice. I didnt mind leaving the key at the front desk, but it annoyed hubby. Sometimes he left it, and sometimes he didnt. Usually, if I was in the room, he would take it, but not leave it. If we left the hotel together, he left it grudingly. Once or twice, they asked us our name, when it was someone different on the desk. I did ask about this practice, and the man I asked, said he always asked for a name unless he knew us by sight. We were very happy with our stay, and for the money we spent, would do so again! I did take pictures on the room, but havent had a chance to load them let. Dot in Houston	
Aug 8 2008 	the pits	in a 8 the world week around the world holiday this hotel was buy far the worst, it desk staff at best were unhelpfull at worst rude there attatude plus the hotel general condition spoilt our stay in NY to be in the greatest city in the world and not be able to get hot water (a problem we didnt have anywhere else including russia china and cambodia) to have to pay to store luggage,(because of late flight )and then to be told ,when we didnt have the right money to get change at the deli down the road was the last straw. loved NY hated going back to motel paul @deb australia	
Aug 8 2008 	Good Place for this Price	The Hotel was very clean and the room was also very nice. Not to big but ok for this price. The location was increidible really just a few meters from Times Square. Just be carefully when we where there a few people were bestohlen. Take everthing value like money out of the room. Also don't use the phone we paid for 3 minutes International Call 24USD!!!!	
Aug 6 2008 	Value for money	Spent three nights at this hotel and generally got what we expected. One of the cheaper hotels in Manhattan and the quality reflects that. It was basic. A small room which was fine for the two of us for just three nights, given that we spent little room in the hotel. Importantly the room was clean, and the front desk staff very friendly. My only complaint was the lack of safety deposit box in the room, and added to this the fact that the front desk staff were insistant on returning keys to them whenever you left the hotel - as a result I was constantly nervous about leaving anything of value in the hotel room. That said we didn't experience any problems with this - other than a lack of piece of mind.Overall though, a nice little clean hotel with friendly staff. A great location right on Times Square. If you're looking for a cheap (by NY standards) hotel then this place is the place to stay.	
Aug 5 2008 	Excellent Value As Advertised	We stayed at the Hotel St. James July 27-July 30, 2008. As noted in many TripAdvisor reviews, the location is superb. Less than three minutes to the heart of Times Square. We arrived almost three hours prior to the stated check-in time, but the front desk staff made an effort to find an available room for us to check-in and drop off our luggage. Thank You! The lobby was bright and inviting. Certainly, the hallways could use a little updating, but we loved the old-style feeling of the hotel, right down to its real marble staircases. The room (312) was larger than expected and very clean, along with a new, shiny bathroom. We used a roll-away bed each night and there was more than enough room to manuever around it. It was pretty hot and humid during our stay, but the window air conditioner did keep the room more than comfortable. The A/C unit was a little noisy, but nothing that prevented us from a good night's rest.The Cranberry and Dunhill cafes next door were fantastic. Just about every food option you could ask for, and at prices that were extremely reasonable. Loved O'Lunney's Irish bar a few doors down, too. Truly, I'm not sure you could find a better value in the Times Square area. The staff were all pleasant and helpful, the rooms clean and sizeable, and you could get to anywhere in mid-town Manhattan in less than 10 minutes.	
Aug 5 2008	Fantastic	My Fiance and I stayed here for 7 nights in July. We found it to be absolutly fantastic.The Location is second to none. Out the front door, turn right and less then a minute later you are in Times Sq!!!The lobby is fantastic, though, having stayed in many hotels all over the world, I was a little shocked that the staff dont wear uniforms, this was soon forgotten when I reaslised how nice everyone was.OK, the elevator was a little slow but its a 12 storey hotel and only 2 lifts...... we were never waitng more then about 90 seconds. Our room, #808, was small but spotlessly clean. The bathroom was brand new. There was a daily maid service but for 3 days we just put the do not disturb sign up and collected towels from reception ourselves. We had so much shopping scattered all over the room and we literally didnt have a second to stop and pack it all away as there is too much to be doing in NYC then spending any time in a hotel room.The decor in the hallways was a little gruby in parts but who cares - you only see it on the way out in the mornings and the excitment of the day ahead is too much to be worrying about such things....... not as noticable on the way home after a few delish cocktails in Connolys pub, 3 doors down! ;-) The key issue is one of my only complaints........ its was day 4 before we were asked to leave it at reception on our way out......I think it must have been the/one of the owners as he was a little miffed when we told him we hadnt been asked before..... One night coming home, I mistakenly asked for #805 (see point about cocktails) and was given it no probs..... even though we were #808.....that and the lack of Safety deposit boxesin the rooms/lobby were my only complaint. we just locked everything away in one of the suitcases and NOTHING was touched in the room.All in all it was a very enjoyable stay and we would defo book Hotel St. James again!	
Aug 5 2008 	Very good location - good value	I stay at the St James with my husband and my 2 boys (7 &amp; 4 years) for 3 nights. This hotel is very good located and it was ok for 3 nights. The room was clean as wel as the bathroom. We do not have any trouble with the elevator. It is a good value	
Aug 5 2008 	4 Thumbs up for the St James	My three sons and I spent three nights at the St James. Our stay was as expected for a lower cost room in Manhatten one block away from Times Square. Certainly old and not very fancy accomodations but we found the room to be clean and suited our needs. Somewhere to stay and sleep after three days of seeing the sites both during the day and into the night. We really weren't in the room much. The airconditioner after it caught up worked just fine for the nights we stayed and cooled the room nicely. The two delis next door and two Irish Pubs just down the street satisfied our late night entertainment and the last 'one for the road' before retiring for the night. Great breakfast sandwiches at Dunhills. As for location, how can you ask for better just one block away from Times Suare.The counter people were great and most helpful when questions were asked. Overall a great stay for the money. I would go back without hesitation.	
Jul 29 2008 	Wonderful Hotel 	We were a little worried after reading some of the other reviews but Hotel St. James is fantastic!! The lobby is unbelievable and gives you a feeling of New York in days past. Our room (#903) was very large and clean. The bathroom was very nice and clean as well. The elevator worked with no problems and the staff was very friendly, especially Joey. We requested more pillows and had them in minutes. The location was fantastic. You are just steps away from Time Square and all of the other attractions. We were able to walk to our broadway show that is how great of a location this is. The deli next door is a gem. The food was wonderful and cheap! We ate most of our meals there and saved alot of money. I would stay at this hotel again and recommend it to all of my friends.	
Jul 27 2008 	Good location questionable security	My husband and I travel to New York City at least 3 or 4 weekends each year and try to stay at different places each time. The Hotel St. James looked impressive for the rates when we first arrived - nice lobby, friendly staff, late-night deli next door - but the room key situation instantly put us off. They ask you to return your room key every time you leave the hotel, but when you return and ask for your key, they rarely ask for ID to prove you are the registered guest. We tested it -- in 3 days, we entered and left more than 9 times, but were only asked for our name on two occasions. Never for photo ID. That was a big concern, although nothing happened and we had laptops etc in the room. The other bothersome issues included completely THREADBARE towels (2 of each, not even a bathmat) and the fact that the housekeeper left her cart outside our door all day every day, even though it was in a high-traffic hallway and next to the elevator. On the up side -- the staff was friendly. Decor was minimal and old-fashioned, but that doesn't bother us. Great air-conditioner, and super comfy double bed. Decent water pressure which is unusual in NYC. And although the location was a plus for Times Square, for our next trip we won't be staying at Hotel St. James, I'm afraid.	
Jul 23 2008	Thieves and Burglars rip off guests	Security is lacking at this hotel.Two guest rooms burglarized on the same night last week.July 16.Stay at your own risk.	
Jul 19 2008 	GREAT Location	This hotel was fine overall. My room (#1212) was very large with two double beds. The carpet was old but ok. The room was very clean. And NO bedbugs. Not fancy but fine for a trip where you won't spend much time in your room anyway. The bathroom was brand new and beautiful.A few minute walk to Times Square, theaters, Rock Center, Radio City Music Hall, 5th Avenue, etc. About a 15 minute walk to Central Park. Service at the front desk was just fine. And free Wireless Internet was included. Two delis a few feet from the hotel - great for a cheap breakfast. A bit pricey ($230 with taxes) but it was the middle of July and no other affordable hotel (in the area) was even available. Maybe some other rooms have problems; I don't know but my epxerience was just fine. Peter [--]	
Jul 19 2008 	excellent location very convenient	the hotel st james was in an excellent location, just off times square and very convinient to broadway, the hotel is basic and quite old fashioned the lift is very slow, the room was very clean and the housekeeping is very good, even though the website says hairdryers are provided they are not and neither are irons, there is no internet access in the rooms as stated but there are three computers downstairs that provide internet for a charge, the staff in general are very laidback, we were on the twelth floor which was very quiet, some other good advantages are the lockers for luggage downstairs which for five dollars store 2 large suitcases plus, handy for your last day, also there is a woman selling tickets for all the major sites during the day. overall a good place to stay on a budget, just dont expect any extras a bed and shower, tv is about all you get, but hey your in nw york, youll be too busy too notice	
Jul 19 2008 	Basic But Close to Everything	Me and my brother stayed for 6 nights at the end of June whilst not expecting the Ritz, i was happy with this hotel looked like a bar was being added at the end of the lobby, storage lockers available for $5 which is cheap when compared to UK prices, definitely go for a room in the back of the hotel although no view was quiet. I will probably look at this hotel again when i come back as it's cheap and who comes to New York to sit in the hotel room. Location is excellent close to everything and the Irish pubs along from the hotel are excellent and do good food.	
Jul 14 2008 	Not what I expected	While I expected a little less quality and comfort for the price, I did not expect an elevator that didn't work, a door that wouldn't open, a bathroom that wasn't clean, and a bill that was not correctly quoted several times. While the staff was fairly friendly, they sure seem to be running a small scam of sorts. While I was waiting for friends in the lobby, I heard 3 different people complaining that they were charged wrong. Guess what...when I got home, I realized I was as well. I called them and all they stated was &quot;Do you have a confirmation number for the quote?&quot; I advised them that they told me that they don't give confirmation numbers. They said then there is nothing they can do. Moral of the story...don't stay here. Just a warning.	
Jul 14 2008 	What a Gem!	We stayed here in June and loved it! Some of the reviews on here speak of grotty rooms etc but I did not see any evidence of that. However I didn't go expecting 5 staf quality! The reception is lovely with lots of wood and marble. They have 3 internet terminals too, which is 20 cents for a minute, very reasonable! The lifts seem to be a big issue with some reviews but I can't honestly say I found any problems with that aspect! There are 2 lifts, however you must press the button on each lift! The room we had was on the 4th floor overlooking the street. It was noisy. I did feel a bit like I was sleeping on the middle of the street. However, I was in New York City and I did get a good deal! Plus you get used to it pretty quickly and if not get a pair of ear plugs!! The room was fine, very clean and not shabby. The bathroom was spotless too!The location is superb! 5 minutes walk from Times Square. My overall opinion is that it's a great place, and very reasonably priced too! Why spend a fortune on accommodation in New York, the city that never sleeps?!Also, the Cranberry Deli (almost next to hotel) is so great! So cheap! Their pizza's are nice too. We got 4 huge slices and two drinks for $14.00! Brekkie is fab too! They have a hot food selection too, so you can grab a box, fill it and take it back to your room after a hard day sightseeing! Excellent!	
Jul 13 2008 	Location Location	We stayed at Hotel St James for 8 nights at the end of May and if Times Square is a priority for you this is a great location with a great price. The room was very basic, no frills, but clean. Reception not big on personality but like the room, got the job done. Noisy air con and rickerty lift but the price more than outways any negatives. At less than a block from Times Square and a great 24 hour delis either side, you can't ask for more.	
Jul 12 2008 	Basic hotel ideally located	The best thing about this hotel is its location, close to Times Square. The room was very basic and not particularly clean. We had problems twice with a blocked toilet in our bathroom. The second time we were merely offered a plunger, hence sorted it out ourselves. Staff were not friendly. Having said that, we were out and about all day and this was just somewhere to sleep. We didn't expect luxury and we certainly didn't get it. I wouldn't stay here again but it wasn't terrible and if you need somewhere cheap to stay and centrally located, this hotel does the job.	
Jul 12 2008 	Bed Bugs!!! Stay Away!!!!!!!!!!!	Ok its been 3 WEEKS since my husband and I stayed at St James Hotel in NYC and Im STILL suffering! We chose to stay there based on reviews from here and are both easy travellers and werent expecting much.However, we were expecting to have a clean room that wasnt infested by bed bugs!! After the first night I had a couple of red itchy bites which I assumed were from a mosquito. However by the end of the day I was covered literally from head to toe with lines of red lumps. I started searching through the sheets and mattress and discovered blood spots and shells, legs, etc from the bugs in the sheets!!! I then ripped the sheets off and looked along the edge of the mattress (where it sits into the bed frame) and saw HEAPS of them running in there!!! (FYI bed bugs are about the size of an apple seed and suck your blood in the early hours of the morning) Truly disgusting!Shocked we went downstairs and spoke to the front desk who moved us rooms and said they would see what they could do and speak to the owners. By this stage I was covered in over 130 red bites which had swelled up and become blister like, these then begin weeping and I had to dab them with a tissue throughout the day. It was awful! I had bites over my hands, all down my arms and back, down my legs and on my feet. They were extremely itchy and later become painful (my little finger swelled up twice its size!) I needed to see a pharmacist who prescribed a strong cream and oral tablets  which made me drowsy and unable to drink alcohol. I also had to wear long trousers and tops in 90F heat as the bites looked disgusting and it was quite embarrassing. It took 2 weeks for the itchiness, pain and swelling to go away. When we finally got to speak to the owners we were made wait for 30mins and then he basically started yelling at us and was so so rude. He said it wasnt his problem but he felt sorry for us !!! He said it was our choice to stay there and also wait to speak to him and we could have just left.. it was shocking I could not believe the way we were treated. When I asked what hed done to fix the problem he said how would I know hmmm which Im taking as nothing. We have stayed in hotels and hostels in over 30 countries throughout the world and this is the absolute worst we have ever been treated or experience weve had. Seriously STAY AWAY.I also received some new bites in the new room too so Im guessing they were in there also.So here I am 3 weeks later and although the pain and itchiness is gone I still have red/purple scarring where the bites were.. Im hoping that this will fade however I guess it will be months before its back to normal again.On top of all this, the rooms where hot, it took 15 mins to get hot water each morning and cleaning staff and management were fighting and yelling at the front desk.. it was an awful environment.So word of warning DONT stay here. Stay somewhere else seriously dont risk your holiday here. On our return to NYC we stayed at Hotel Stanford which is the same price and was 100% better.	
Jul 7 2008	better than expected	The hotel is old but nice. The common areas were very clean, the staff was nice, the room cleanliness was slightly better than mediochre. When we checked in the man at the desk saw that my husband was 6'4&quot; &amp; he upgraded us for free to a bigger bed. I recommend this hotel to couples or someone single looking to be close to Times Square. The elevator is s l o w ! We paid a great rate for our location. You are literally 3 minutes walking distance from the Square. We knew we werent paying for a view or a spectacular room, because we didnt anticipate staying IN the room too much. We were very happy with our experience &amp; would come back again. If you stay eat at the Cranberry deli 2 doors down, it is the best deal for your money for food!! GO YANKEES!!!	
Jul 1 2008	Spot on location	Like all other reviews, the location is spot on!!! Instead of lugging my shopping bags all over manhattan, i could pop by the hotel to drop some before continuing with more shopping!!!Service wise, was very happy that they upgraded us to a slightly bigger room. Other than that, it is only based on my expectation. Oh, there was one occasion when i returned to the hotel to head back up to my room. I was stopped by the reception, only to find out that i was not supposed to bring out the room keys. It would have helped if the reception person could have informed me politely. Room, emm... adequate! There is enough room for 2 (with all the shopping bags). Gives me good hot shower bath after a long day walk. and a very comfy bed.. Would have preferred if the tv is working better, there was literaly only one channel working. Btw - the elevator was working fine when we were there. All in all, happy with the hotel for the $$$ that i've paid for. Will i stay there again, DEFINITELY!!!	
Jun 27 2008 	OK for the price	I chose this hotel for two reasons - price and location. It's about the only affordable place left and the location is great for getting around. It's right off Times Square within easy walking of most theaters and just a block or two down from subways. And yes, the deli next door is very good and cheap.For the price, it's OK. I stayed in a room that had been redone. I think most rooms have been. It was reasonably clean and very quiet. The bathroom worked just fine. The elevators were slow, but working. I found the staff at the front desk to be very helpful except for one woman. They have a tendency to say &quot;Oh, we'll take care of that right away.&quot; and they don't. You have to just stand there until they do.I wasn't happy with the condition of the hallways. Really shabby and filthy. And the doors don't seem to shut or lock properly all the time. I can see why some guests say they don't feel safe. If they are still in the process of upgrading, they need to tackle this next.My biggest complaint is with the linens and towels. I'm sure they were washed, but boy, were they stained! If other hotels can find a laundry service that can get the stains out, then so could the St. James. I should not be able to see where previous guests were &quot;intimate&quot; nor should I be able to tell the color of the previous guest's make-up on the towels. It was hard to feel comfortable when I had to wonder if they had been washed or changed between guests. I stay in budget hotels all the time in New York and don't expect a lot, but clean linens is a big one for me.	
Jun 27 2008 	Very bad	I can't quite understand the good reviews this place is getting.Whilst I agree that the location is spot on that's about where it stops.When you enter the hotel you think this is going to be nice but as soon as you reach your floor you quickly see that the reception area is just a front. I have stayed in much nicer hostels. The room was in need of a total makeover, the second room which we were moved to was better but still not up to scratch.The security is a joke, you have to give your key in everytime you go out and when you return you just ask for the key to your room using the room number and you got the key, no second checks as to if you were really the person staying in that room. When we left the room to go out I double locked the room door so it couldn't be opened by slipping a credit card into it only to find after the room had been cleaned the room wasn't double locked again.The lifts were also a joke, one of the days neither were working but there weren't any signs on any of the lift doors, we waited 15 minutes before trying to use the narrow steep stairs carrying suitcases. Fornt desk promised to send some one up to help but that never happened. On a good day the lifts were slow and felt like they needed repair, they didn't feel safe.Due to the fact we had an evening flight we asked about storing our luggage and we were told $5 per bag. We left our luggage in their &quot;secure&quot; room but no note was made as to whos case was whos and when we returned to pick them up again security was rubbish, we could have picked up all the cases that were in there.So in all a good location and cheap but if you want to be sure your stuff is safe this isn't the place for you..	
Jun 26 2008 	You Get What You Pay For	Dollar for dollar this hotel is adequate. You are one block off of Times Square and have easy access to the entire city. Ten minutes of walking landed us at Central Park and ten more at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.However, the hotel's interior speaks of pre-Guliani Times Square. In other words, if you have ever seen those hotels pictured on Law and Order, where something shady went down - you have seen the Hotel St. James.The doors to the rooms were aluminum (rather than wooden), the carpet is old and worn, the walls are deeply gouged in places. There is no sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear every word spoken in the adjoining room and on a more disturbing level, every time the other room's occupants went to the rest room I heard that in vivid detail as well. Only one small elevator works; but it looks to have been recently updated. The hotel makes you remit your room key every time you leave the building; I was not comfortable with that. The night employee was less than professional and asked me to go next door and get him a cup of coffee; in the alternative he asked me to watch the front desk while he went next door. So there I was watching all the room keys people had given them while they went out . . . . not the image of security I usually choose. (but hey for $200, off Times Square, beggars can't be choosers)Also, they attempted to charge me for dialing '0' and being transferred to the 'concierge.' (they eventually took it off the bill)Don't expect free bag check, you must rent lockers in the back of the hotel if your flight gets in early or you are leaving late. Internet access is $2 for 10 minutes. If you are going to JFK don't take the shuttle, it leaves at inconvenient times and costs $5 less than just hiring a taxi (Taxis can only charge the standard $45 flat fee from Manhattan to JFK, plus a toll I think of about $5).There is a great deli next door which can easily provide a quality breakfast or lunch if you need it. The food and service at the deli were TOP notch, I apologize for forgetting the name of it.	
Jun 24 2008 	A potential health risk	The hotel has a fantastic location just seconds from Times Square. But that's where the positives end.During my stay one of my group got 2 severe electric shocks whilst using the shower. They couldn't have been static shocks since she got two shocks in quick succession, and her hand was still numb several days later. The must have been an earthign fault leading to 110V reaching the shower.My friend made a complaint and they were changed rooms. However we feared the safety of anyone else using the original room. What if a child or some one with a pace maker used it and got an electric shock, it could prove fatal. So we wanted to know they were going to get it investigated and sorted.We spoke to the owner whose initial repsonse was they would send the maid to test it. When we pushed how dangerous it was and that they were risking people's lives she offered us a free night next time we came. One of the receptionists agreed with us that it needed investigating properly but the owner refused to accept the risk. It was only as we were leaving she said she'd send a general maintenance man to check it out, not a professional electrician.Since returning to the UK my friend has reported the matter to the New York council for them to investigate.On another note the elevators were a fiasco. When we were checking out it took 45 minutes to get back to the ground floor. We eventuay discovered one of the elevators was out of order and the other wasn't exactly working properly. We got stuck on every floor and at one point the doors wouldn't open and some of my group started to panic.So as long as you don't take a shower and are happy using the stairs this is the perfect New York hotel.	
Jun 24 2008 	Pleasant surprise!	A very nice place to stay! Right in the middle of everything one needs in NYC: theatres, shops, delis ... Friendly staff, clean rooms, extra plus for the young lady in the lobby (helped to book theater tickets, shuttles). Only minus because of the poor quality of the TV. Definitely will use the same hotel when next time in the city!	
Jun 19 2008 	Great cheap place to stay.	I stayed here with my partner in May and am glad to say nothing went wrong!I have stayed in bigger more expensive hotels in NY and the only thing that was really missing from this hotel was the overpriced room service, However i heard that the Deli next door provide a room service deal for the hotel? Never tried it because like most ppl visiting new york for New york we weren't there much.The hotel room was big enough the bed was comfy the tv and air con worked as did the key.. Yep we had a key not a card. When we turned the shower on it made a loud noise but you pull a nozzle and it stops. It was cleaned daily with new towels everyday.We were 4 stories up and i think we used the stairs 2-3 times.. the lift Never took more than a minute and we were on the doorstep to times square...I honestly don't know what most ppl are complaining about unless they went to NY to stay in and admire the hotel all day.	
Jun 18 2008 	Great place to stay	Just returned from NYC yesterday. Stayed at the St James. Great place to stay. Great location! Rooms large, clean, cool, beds, pillows comfortable. Staff was helpful. Both delis next door were great. Had everything you would need at nearly any hour. There were four in our party and we all concur with this review. Will definitely reccomend to friends and family.	
Jun 14 2008 	Like NYC in the seventies..	The location is the only positive thing about the St James.My room was small, worn and dark. The view on the airshaft with garbage at the bottom reminded me of the 70s series that were filmed in Manhattan. The bathroom had prewar fixtures and was not clean. 2 Elevators, but one was broken during my whole stay...so we had to wait up to 10 minutes or take the stairs. The staff at the front desk was anything but friendly or helpful. The St James is not a hotel, rather a hostel. But what do you expect at the price in NYC?	
Jun 9 2008 	Very good location.	This is a great old hotel located close to Times Square. The hotel is clean and the bathrooms are updated. There are two good delis very close, one is right next door. Plenty of good bars also. NBC, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Grand Central Station are also very close. It is very close to several subway stations. The theater district is also very close.We were there in early June, during ninety degree weather. The window air conditioner proved to be a bit inadequate and loud but during cooler weather it would probably be fine.The rooms at the back of the hotel have windows which open to an air shaft so you don't get a view or much light, good if you are a late sleeper. The rooms at the front seemed to have windows facing the street. The building and neighborhood seemed safe. The front desk is attended twenty four hours a day and the staff was very friendly.This place is a good value, in a good location. If you're used to four or five star hotels you will be disappointed.G.G.	
Jun 5 2008 	Just PERFECT!!!!!	JUST PERFECT!!!!The hotel staff is just amazing! I've never seen such an awesome front desk staff. They address so many tasks and responsibilities at the same time, I think that they do a LOT. I work in the same field, and I found them extraordinary, loaded with work, but always smiling and helpful at all time. Good job guys!!!!About the property itself. It could not be in a better location. It is just so convenient, close to all major attractions. It might be a 1900 location... yes the decor is a bit off, but it suits the purpose. Nice, super clean and awesome location.If you want to eat, thousands of choices within a few blocks.We are going back in October to New York city, and we have already booked our room reservations.I hope this is helpful to future readers.Thank you Hotel St James.	
Jun 5 2008	Fair deal for the $$	My first trip to NYC last year and I was more than a little nervous about hotels. We were on a budget and I had read some pretty nightmarish stories about NY &quot;boutique&quot; hotels, It's been almost a year since we stayed here, but I have to say we were perfectly satisfied with our stay. The only problem we had was if you were sitting on the john and the next room flushed, it caused turbulence in my toilet, which under some circumstances could be unpleasant. We stayed on the first floor up so we didn't really use the lift except to arrive and leave with luggage and staff seemed fine, but didn't really need them for anything. If you want a clean place to sleep and shower, with a great central location, for what I think were very reasonable rates (I booked with my Entertainment Card), then this should suit you well. Have a great time in NYC - We did!!!	
Jun 3 2008 	Very Happy With Our Choice	I was a little worried that our hotel stay might be a disappointment because there were four adult women sharing one room. When we arrived we were all thrilled with our room (#402). It was very large and very clean. We had plenty of room for all of our luggage and the bathroom was well stocked with towels. There was never a problem with the shower, as we had plenty of hot water each day. The hotel staff was polite and helpful. We got a peek at the rooms across from ours and they both looked very nice with plenty of room. The Dunhill and Cranberry Deli right next door are great and inexpensive. The location was awesome. Only 1/2 a block to Times Square and a couple of blocks to Rockfeller Plaza and the subway station. Our room faced the street and that was a problem for us the first night. It was very noisey! But, we bought earplugs the next day and for the next 3 nights slept great! My daughter had to leave about 5 hours before the rest of our group and there was a shuttle that came to the hotel which she took for $19.00 with no problems. Our cab ride to and from LaGuardia was $34.00 plus tip. I would definitely stay at the St. James Hotel again. For the price and location you couldn't have asked for anything better. We had a very positive experience!	
Jun 1 2008 	Our second stay in the St.James	This was our second stay in the St. James and there have certainly been a few improvements since last November such as a concierge service in place, the replacement of one of the old very slow lifts and internet access at $5 for 25 mins (wi fi is free), with free printing facilities. We were a little anxious that we would be able to get one of the secure lockers, that are now used (cost $5) to store luggage after check out, but that didn't prove to be a problem. It was the availiabilty that concerned us not the cost, and when we voiced these concerns to the reception staff we were told that if no lockers were available we would be able to keep our room for an additional 2 hours at no extra cost - this would have taken us to 2pm and we were getting picked up at 3pm so would have been perfect for us had we required it. Apart from that it's the location and price of the St. James that are it's selling points, yes the decoration is a little outdated, the towels are small and the air con is noisy, but it is also very clean and there's always plenty of hot water (although sometimes it takes a while to get through the pipes.)We were a litte disappointed with our room, compared to our last stay, it was much smaller and darker (you don't stay in St. James for the views) and I'm sure the bed was smaller than an average queen, but it was no problem really and if we stay again I will ask about the room size on check in. It was this room that initially made me reluctant to score the hotel 4/5 but on thinking about it I should have asked to be moved as I'm pretty sure the hotel wasn't full and they would have obliged. Sometimes we just need to speak up! On arrival I noticed that one of the towels had make up marks on it, I took this down to reception and within 5 minutes all our towels had been replaced with a profuse apology. Personally we have always found all the St. James staff friendly and helpful and for the cost you really can't go wrong as long as you go expecting budget accomodation with no frills.	
Jun 1 2008 	St James Times Square	We were not disappointed by our choice of hotel, which was greatly helped by reading the reviews here. Our room was large, tastefully furnished and spotlessly clean. Front desk was helpful and efficient, the crazy lifts provided entertainment and I would probably stay there again. We had noisy neighbours who interrupted my beauty sleep on two occasion, but a quick visit to Duane Reade and the purchase of heavy duty earplugs and some Tylenol PM sorted out that little problem. Our shower was pretty pathetic, but nothing could really spoil our trip. A friend of ours also had a room there for a few days and her shower worked perfectly, so we just drew a short straw on showers. Try out the Dunhill and Cranberry delis next door to the hotel. Dunhill does super breakfast, and Cranberry does a mean piece of pizza when you have the late night munchies. Don't attempt to shop on 5th ave unless you are loaded - Century 21 and Macy's to name but two are a better choice. Don't miss the cute little Jefferson Market Garden which is in Greenwich Village. It is maintained and run by volunteers and is just gorgeous. Hard to believe you're in a city sitting in it admiring the plants and birds. Also worth a visit is beautiful, leafy Bryant Park. You can do Tai Chi and play petanque there if you are so inclined.If you have a sweet tooth or secretly believe you are five years old inside, visit the M&amp;Ms store in Times Square. Also don't miss the ferris wheel nearby in Toys R Us. OK, I will shut up now. You must go to New York, I'm telling you.	
May 29 2008 	Everything We Needed	Most everything I've read via this site was true about this hotel. That being said, it was just what we needed for our stay in the city! Central location to everything! Within walking distance to anything! We arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check-in and the staff were more than happy to give us the first available room. We used the working elevator to get to our room. It worked just fine. We had walked from Penn Station to the hotel so we freshened up after unpacking. Hangers were available in the closet to hang anything up. The bed was even comfortable for the very, very little time that we did sleep. We didn't have a 'view' of anything but a wall, but we didn't care either since the only time we spent in our room was for showering and sleeping. One thing you will need to pack is an alarm. I just used my cell phone for the time/alarm. There were plenty of outlets for charging our phones and using our hairdryer and hairstraightners. There was a TV in the room, but I couldn't tell you anything about it because we did not use it. The A/C worked perfectly in our room. It stayed very cool. All we wanted was a place to rest our head at night, which we did very little of, and a nice hot shower, which it was - excellent! We were givin fresh towels daily and even asked for extra at the front desk with no problems. There was someone available at the front desk 24 hours. Our room had a deadbolt that worked perfectly. We felt extreamly safe. The one and only thing I did not like about the hotel was their request that you leave your room key with the front desk each time you left the hotel. Why? I'm not sure. I only did it once because when asking for it back the desk clerk did not ask for any type of I.D. - therefore anyone from off the street could have requested my room key and accessed my room at any time while I was away. SO, I just kept it in my pocket. Other than that everything was perfect! I'd absolutly stay there again. And I'd recomend it to anyone one looking for a place to rest at an affordable price with friendly staff in the heart of it all!	
May 28 2008 	Location Location Location!	We spent five nights at the St. James and were very satisfied with it in terms of value for money. This hotel is perfectly situated next to Times Square. We were there over the Memorial Day Weekend with tons of people and lots of noise, but when we entered the hotel we immediately escaped the madness outside. The room we had was clean and very quiet, even though the hotel was filled to capacity. Also, it was a really good size for a New York hotel - even had an old fireplace and mantel. The view was nothing to write home about - looked directly across at another building. Yes, the elevators are a bit slow, but it's an older building and we were never in much of a hurry to get anywhere. The Cranberry Cafe is next door and was the perfect place for breakfast or a late night snack - check their web site [--]The hotel staff were OK - nothing extraordinary, but certainly polite and helpful when asked a question.The drawing card for this hotel is the location and the price. I don't think you could find anything so close to Times Square in that price range and of that quality.	
May 27 2008 	VERY nice hotel	While we were staying they install an A/C in every room and a new elevator. See other reviews - the hotel is really nice. For me it is the best of affordable hotels in NYC.	
May 21 2008 	Just OK	This hotel is smack in the middle of Times Square. So if you like staying in tourist central, it's a good choice for a great price. The front desk staff, although their English wasn't perfect, was helpful every morning in loaning me a hair dryer. The rooms are spacious for NYC and the beds were fine. Overall pretty clean. The one problem I had was that it happened to be about 70 degrees for a few days while I was there in January and the windows didn't open and the a/c or fan in the window didn't work. I stayed here 2 consecutive weeks in January in different rooms, and both rooms had this problem, so I'd be weary to stay here in warmer months. The elevators were very slow (especially since only 1 was working). Overall ok experience though.	
May 20 2008 	Great Location.......	Stayed here in Dec 07, the best thing about the hotel is the location, bang on times square. The deli next door does real good breakfast. Loads of bars and places to eat nearby. The irish pub few doors away rocks....Would recommend this hotel for somebody on a tight budget, someone who spends less time in the room/hotel. Would definitely stay again.	
May 20 2008 	Superb!	Great stay @ St. James. We reserved and paid in advance at HotelConxion.com. We checked in by 1.00 PM, we got a Confortable big!!!!!! room in 5th floor (511), which was clean at arrival and cleaned punctually every day. Helpfull staff and brand new elevator!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so there are two working elevators now. No more Stairs... some people didn´t realize the new elevator was working.... and kept taking the stairs! There is also a new locker system to leave bags safe on arrival and check out. What else? Free Wi FI in the room, and of course, SUPERB LOCATION! just half block from Times Square, minutes away from anywhere in New York!!!!!!!!!!! If you are looking for a cheap hotel in New York, St. James becomes one of the best choices! just remember... you are staying in a cheap hotel... so don´t expect 5 star service or 4 star or 3.... just a clean confortable room. ENJOY NY!!!	
May 18 2008 	We had a great experience!	We had a fantastic experience. It was exactly what we expected.Highlights include: Excellent location Sandwiched in between Times Square and Rockefeller center. Its less than a block away from Time Square and two blocks from Rockefeller Center. All the major subway lines pass through the area.  Price  paid $763 (total including tax) for 4 nights in May using Hotel Conexions. Prices seem reasonable year round considering the location. Clean  nothing fancy, but the hotel was clean. Free Wifi in the room  we used this a few times to scope locations. Friendly StaffOther observations: The hot water is almost too hot! Be sure to always have the cold on too when showering. The shower curtain wasnt wide enough so water would leak on the floors. There was no mini-fridge, so we couldnt store perishables. This was too bad as there were two mini grocery stores on the same street. There were no signs of any bugs. There is no provided baggage storage. They do have baggage storage lockers you have to pay for ($5.00 for a medium size locker that lasts for 24 hours). We didn't have high expectations going in, so keep in mind that you'll get a very basic hotel room with no added frills, but it gets the job done!	
May 14 2008	Loacation Location Location	Where do I start????? After reading the reviews on St James Hotel I was doutbful as to whether the hotel would be up to scratch.I can tell you with confience that this hotel has everything that you could want or need in a hotel and not to mention the location.In the room that I stayed in there were 2 large double beds, a bedside locker, a large closet, a television and a large bathroom with bath and shower facilities.There was everyting that you could ask for.Rooms were immaculate and cleaned every day.Staff were superb, they really couldn't do enough to help.Last but not least the location!!This hotel is right in the middle of every tourist hotspot, time square literally only a minute walk away.Lastly I would like to take this opportunity to thank Carmen and Joey(receptionists) as they were so friendly and really made our stay that wee bit more enjoyable.St Patricks Day March 2008 (12th-24th)Attracta &amp; NiamhCookstown Co.

May 12 2008 	Great place! Repeat customer!	Ok, so it's not a 4 or 5 star hotel... For the prices you're paying you can't ask for more.. It's a clean, close to the action hotel. You're 1 block away from Times Square and if you go in the spring/summer or fall you're going to be paying almost 2 to 3 hundred dollars more somewhere else. I've stayed here in the past and just ask for a renovated room.. I've never had issues with the workers and it's always clean. We stayed in 203 I think had two double beds and a nice bathroom.. The only thing was it faced the street.. Not bad you hear the garbage truck pull up in the middle of the night and go back to sleep.. I would recommend this place to friends but just warm them it's not the Hyatt.. I would much rather spend the 200.00 to 300.00 I'm saving A NIGHT to spend it on other NYC things like Broadway, games or shopping.. Don't let the other reviews scare you it's a clean hotel room and that's all.. If you're go to NYC w/ the intention of camping out in your hotel then don't stay there.. Love this place and will return in the future.	
May 10 2008 	For the Price and Location What more could you want	Location sensational. Easy to get Uptown or go Downtown. Plus the theatres of Broadway are only a few minutes walk away.The hotel is basic, yet, bed was comfortable and the room clean.I did not come to New York to sit in my hotel room, I came to see the sights and this hotel was perfect for that.I m a female in her mid 20s who was travelling alone and I felt safe and happy whilst staying here.The deli two doors down was great for breakfast and dinner and Starbucks at the end of the street easy to get a quick coffee.	
May 10 2008 	Disastrous Horrible....Never Stay Here	NO WHERE TO STORE LUGGAGE ON ARRIVAL DATE OR DEPARTING DATE. -We arrived to find the new owner installed about 15 TINY LOCKERS for 145 rooms to hold your luggage for early check in. The day of check out, if there is no locker available, you have to drag your luggage around NYC. The lockers cost 5 dollars per day, AND....if you have two bags and shopping bags as I did, you will pay 30 dollars for your luggage to be held on your last day before you catch your flight. With 4-5 family members, that adds 80-100 dollars spent.... where all other hotels offer this service for free!IF YOU CAN'T GET A LOCKER, YOU ARE SCREWED! Have fun lugging your luggage possibly in the rain all over NYC!NO SLEEP! At 1:30 am, a trash truck picked up trash on the street and then food drop offs for bars and restraunts occurred all night long. This windows, and above the average NYC noise level. I got about 2 hours sleep.This lasted ALL NIGHT LONG!Literally. IT WAS A DISASTER! wE FREQUENT NYC SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR AND HAVE N EVER LOST SLEEP TO DRUNKS ON THE STREET AND TRASH TRUCKS! GOOD REVIEWS ARE DECEPTIVE BECUASE THEY ARE WRITTEN BY THOSE WHO HAVE STAYED ON THE BACK OF THE HOTEL. THE REMAINDER BAD REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY THOSE WHO HAVE FRONT STREET ROOMS... AND...KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT! NOW EXHAUSTED. REQUESTED A ROOM CHANGE , GOT IT, BUT NEVER RECOOPED LOST SLEEP WHICH COMPLETELY RUINED THE TRIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NO BELL BOYS TO HELP OLDER PEOPLE WITH LUGGAGE. ONE WOMAN in our elevator complained that her ROOM HAD NO AIR... and their response was the windows open! Great......more noise!second room was nice but to no avail. We were beyond exuasted and had a miserable time. I WILL NEVER STAY AT THE ST JAMES AGAIN!Terrible, awful no good rotten experience!NO REFUNDS OR DISCOUNTS FOR THE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WERE OFFERED!They should drop their rates to 100 per night. I am sure it is quieter at a youth hostel!NEVER AGAIN!NOT EVEN A 1 STAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DON T' MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID! TRUST THE REVIEWS!	
May 4 2008 	Maintenance Nightmare - good location	The Location is the only thing this Hotel going for it, I would be skeptical of any review that says otherwise. It is an old building with terrible maintenance, there are 2 elevators - 1 is always out of service and the other is very small and very slow -the lights do not even work. The hot water is hit and miss, you may have either a cold shower or a scalding hot shower. There are not window ac units in every room. The rooms were clean and had decent furniture though. If you stay on the first or second floor, you may be able to get by. The stairs are pretty steep and not easy to carry luggage up. If you are very young and travel light, like cold showers and hot rooms that are located very near time square, then this is the place for you. And beware, if you try to cancel your room, they will penalize you 25.00 a night!! I am not sure how they are staying in business, there must not be any biulding code inspectors in NYC.	
May 2 2008 	Great location	Great location! Ok so the hotel is not a 5 star but at the end of the day you get what you pay for! The hotel is a budget hotel, rooms are clean, towels changed daily and the rooms are adequate for what you should be using them for in New York - sleeping and showering! The rest of the time should be spent exploring the city and this hotel lets you do just that. One block away from times square is amazing! No taxis to pay going backwards and forwards.The reception staff are helpful as is the concierge service, the lift is possibly the worst thing about the hotel, but it is a good conversation point with other guests staying in the hotel. Plus if you are stayin anything below the 5th floor you really should be walking! We stayed in room 1109 so on the 11th floor and we managed to walk a couple of times, just to work off the food that we had eaten over there!Next door there is a brilliant deli called the Dunhill deli - great for breakfast and the perfect pint irish bar is great for calling in for a quick pint after heading back from a hectic day sightseeing.Overall because of the location itself I would recommend this for people who are on a budget and want a great location. If you moan about the hotel then pay more and stay somewhere else!	
May 1 2008	NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!	Worst place I have ever stayed in!!!! Could not shower water temp was only SCORCHING HOT!!!! Elevators took 40 minutes if you were lucky! We were on the 11th floor and had to lug our luggage up and down!!!! Staff very unfriendly and basically did not care	
Apr 29 2008 	Worst Place Ever	Hotel from Hell. The elevator didn't work and when it did the maintenance staff used it and wouldn't let the guests on board. The toilet wouldn't flush, the room door lock was broken and there was no air conditioning. After complaining to the management they gave us keys to go look at two other rooms to see if they were acceptable but when we went into them people were already staying in there and I felt that if the hotel staff gave us keys to other guests rooms they may do the same to us. I didn't feel safe here at all. We ended up checking out and going to the Edison which was much nicer.	
Apr 26 2008	good location but thats all	hotel st james this hotel is in a prime location for times square but thats about it i know its a budget hotel but with hindsight i would have paid extra and chose a better hotel.the hotel was shabby only 1 lift works which has a mind of its ownthe passage ways were dirty, our room was ok apart from the noise of the toilet cistern air con and radiator which keeps you awake at night. staff at the main desk were unhelpful and surly.all in all we loved new york and will be back but not in this hotelkent england	
Apr 21 2008 	Amazing location!!!	Yes the hotel's decor is a little outdated but the location is WONDERFUL!!! The deli next door has an excellent breakfast, long lines but they are very efficent. You do have to leave your key at the front desk, but my boyfriend and I are not bothered by this because it's one less thing we have to worry about. Times Square is right down the street, plenty of things to do. Staff was helpful and we really enjoyed the fact that they held our bags after checkout so we could enjoy the city before we left. This hotel was a perfect choice for us, so much so that we already booked a stay for June.	
Apr 17 2008 	Great hotel in fab location for budget-conscious travellers	My mum and I went to NYC for a bit of shopping and sightseeing. St James' was chosen as it was in a central location and competetively priced... In fact couldn't find a better deal, even in an East Village hotel I had stayed before!This is a standard, basic to mid-range, hotel with no extras as such (eg. no restaurant), but they're not needed as Times Square is around the corner, as well as cafes, shops etc.Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The lifts were reaaally slow and a bit dodgy, but we took stairs most of the time anyway. The rooms are unfashionably decorated but tidy. Our room was cleaned on a daily basis, with fresh towels and beds made. What else do you need, when you only sleep there and spend the rest of the time exploring NYC? We certainly didn't.If you have no problem with being in a basic hotel and rather spend you hard-earned cash on shopping and other entertainments, choose this hotel. Also a perfect choice for NYC 'first-timers' as it is right in the middle of Manhattan, so safe to walk around any time of day and always easy to find.	
Apr 16 2008	Fantastic location (NY best kept secret)	Fantastic location a 5 min walk to Times Square. There are 2 deli's next door and 2 Irish Bars the other side of the hotel - what more could you need.The lift is very very slow and the other one was being re-furbished so maybe that will be quicker once fixed. Rooms are clean and basic.Our room (204) had a red hot water pipe in the bathroom so watch out that you don't burn yourself on it.Otherwise a basically clean hotel with brilliant location.Check out the diner's next door but be prepared to be astounded by the choice available..... The Irish bars are just ideal for a quick pint after a hard days sightseeing.For the best burger in the USA check out Burger Joint (see separate review) but if you want meat overload check out Spanky's.If your wanting to go to Liberty Island make sure you pre-book as there are a limited number of tickets available each day. Worth a trip but for a first timer I'd just use the Staten Island Ferry which is free!	
Apr 16 2008 	Good location bad hotel	To start on a positive, this is very near Times Square, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. However, I appreciate this is a 2-star hotel, but nonetheless certain minimum levels are still expected. Sadly this hotel failed to achieve them. Only one lift worked for the entire hotel. The service at the front desk was as unhelpful as anything I found in the whole of NYC. The condition of the landings and stairwells was dreadful. The heater was supported on wooden blocks and wouldn't turn off. Further, it made sporadic loud banging noises, even through the night. The television would not tune in to any channels. The walls were paper thin. I would not in any way recommend this hotel.	
Apr 15 2008 	Terrible - really really terrible	I arrived in New York at the end of a ten day long business trip in America, during which I had also stayed in budget hotels in San Francisco and Minneapolis. If I had known what this hotel was like before I stayed there, I would never have booked it. It is, by a margin, the very wost place I have ever stayed in. There's &quot;budget&quot; and there's &quot;budget (rubbish)&quot;; this was definitely the latter and not a patch on the other, much less expensive places I also stayed in during my trip. Clearly, there is some significant work taking place there - as the builders' gear, the dust, the rubble and the endless drilling noises on my corridor would attest. The place was filthy; the wallpaper was torn; the corridors were shabby; the room was noisy; there was graffiti on some of the walls; I found the staff at Reception to be rude and unhelpful (except for one male member of staff who was great); the elevator was incredibly slow - on one occasion I waited in the lobby TEN minutes for it to arrive, only to find it full of the builders, their gear and the cleaning staff and all their stuff when it did eventually come. It feels like it's strung up with an elastic band and really did not feel safe at all. The bar was not open at all.Hostel? Yes, but a pretty rough one. Hotel? Most certainly not and I would not recommend this place to anyone. Luckily, I was there for just one night. If my booking had been for any longer, I would have left withing ten minutes of arriving. If you're going to New York, stay somewhere else. For me, this place was most definitely not with the money. Hunt around and you will do much better.	
Apr 15 2008	Location Location Location	We had a great stay here, yes the lift is painfully slow but if that's all you have to complain about you're laughing! It also results in lots of jokes with your fellow guests on your lift ride. Got a great price and the hotel had a perfect location. I asked for a quiet room when I booked and we got one so if you are worried about noise that is what to do. Room was large and clean, but to be honest it is just a place to rest your head anyway as there is much to do in NY. Front desk staff were really helpful too.	
Apr 14 2008 	Really basic but ideal location	We booked to stay for 3 nights at this hotel due to the bargain price for the location.It was ok and I did manage to sleep ok although I didnt feel particularly clean in the bedding! (Have a few drinks at The Perfect Pint a couple of doors away, it helps block out the room!)Would I stay there again...... No, well only if I really needed to and couldn't afford to pay a bit more.	
Apr 12 2008 	fantastic budget hotel and loved it	The hotel is clean and tidy and the only draw back we could find was the lift was slow and the other lift is being replaced.We found the hotel to be quiet and ask for a room on the rear of the hotel, our room was large for NYC standards and was in good condition and very cleanThis was my 4th time in NYC and the hotel offers the best value for money and the best location. We had a problem with the shower in our room, but after speaking to reception it was fixed that day. Staff at the hotel were good and the there was always someone at reception and I always found them helpful and polite.The deli two doors down towards Time Square is great for breakfast and the Perfect Pint Irish bar also on the same street, is great the barmen Dave and Mick are really funny and make you feel welcome and 6$ for a pint of Guinness is not bad and it tastes great.Best meal was at the Hi-Life Bar and Grill on 477 Amsterdam on 83rd St, great meal and great atmosphere and good value for money.Well worth a visit is Woodbury Common got some great bargains whilst there. It was smaller than the ones in Florida but still offered great value for money.	
Apr 9 2008 	Weekend Getaway with Spouse	Found this hotel thru a last minute get away type of website. Would not have stayed there alone or with my daughters. It was CHEAP but not what I felt really comfortable with. The hallways were dim and the stairwell was very dark at night. The elevator made sounds that were scary and had some strange bumps in the ride. The first room we were given was at the end of a DARK, crooked and narrow hallway. There were too many problems with it to list!! Including a broken lock on the door, a peephole stuffed with insulation, on and on... I smiled nicely and in my Southern drawl requested another room. The hotel clerk quickly offered us another. Almost as if she expected to see me again? The next room was SOO much better it seemed that we were no longer in the same hotel!! Apparently the new room was on a RENOVATED floor. The hotel staff seemed to change hourly and often didn't have on name tags or hotel logo of any kind. They were always nice though. At times, there was no one at the desk when we stepped in off the street, three blocks from TImes Square. It just seemed unsafe in many ways. I was with my husband or I would have changed hotels the first night! The cleanliness was good. the location was excellent to Times Square. Patrons of this hotel seemed to be predominantly foreign tourists.	
Mar 30 2008 	Good location but its share of problems	I recently stayed for 5 nights at the St. James with a friend on our trip to NYC. We were in New York for a conference, and we booked the hotel because it was less expensive. We were very pleased with the location - less than a block to Times Square, just a few blocks to Rockefeller Center, close to PLENTY of restaurants and shopping. The location was perfect for exploring the city and for attending our conference. Aside from the location, we found the hotel to have a number of problems.First, the hotel is old and really rundown. The carpet in the hallway is really worn, with several holes. The walls in our room had several dents and marks. There were just a lot of cosmetic issues that made the hotel look less desirable. The lobby, on the other hand, actually looked really nice. It was just the upper floors (where the guest rooms were) that looked run down. Despite all of these features of the hotel showing that it's old and rundown, I actually felt like the hotel was pretty clean, which was more important to me. The bathroom and bedroom both felt clean to me, so I was comfortable staying here for the week.A bigger issue to me was the noise in the rooms. I had read in other reviews that the noise in the rooms was pretty loud, but I am usually not bothered by noise, so I thought it would be ok. I was wrong. We had a room that looked out on the street, and it was SOOOO loud. At night, we could hear everything happening on the street below. But that wasn't the worst part. Every morning of our stay, at 6:45 am, garbage trucks came down the street and proceeded to empty garbage cans for at least 20 minutes. It was so loud - it woke us up and we couldn't go back to sleep until they were finished. My friend and I joked that this was why the hotel room didn't have an alarm clock - there was a built-in alarm clock in the garbage trucks that came every morning. If you are staying at this hotel, I would definitely recommend that you request a room that does not face the street. The noise was really unbearable.Another big issue to us was the room key. Like others have said, each room has only one key and you have to leave your key at the front desk every time you leave. This part didn't bother us too much - since we had two people coming back to the room at different times, we were ok with leaving our key so that each of us could get into the room whenever we wanted. Our problem with this was that when we returned and asked for our key, we were NEVER asked for identification. This made us really uncomfortable. My friend said something to one of the workers about this, and he said that he remembered us. However, this was impossible, since it was a different worker almost every time we returned to the hotel. One time, they misunderstood us when we said our room number and they gave us the wrong key. Again, this made us really uncomfortable. The rooms really lacked security in our opinions for this reason. I'd be really careful about what you leave in your room.For the most part, we didn't have any trouble with water temperature, until the last morning. That morning, we couldn't get hot water, even after letting the water run for quite a while, so we had to take cold showers. The towels were really small and thin, but I think that's really a minor complaint.Also, one of the elevators is still out of order. The other elevator was usually pretty easy to get going up - the exception was when big groups were checking in and had luggage to take up. There was quite a line for the elevator, because the elevator is so small and can only fit a couple of people with their luggage. Getting an elevator to come down was a bigger problem - we gave up after the first day and we always walked down. I'm not sure I'd stay here again, especially after finding out that some of our colleagues were staying at much nicer hotels and only paying about $30-$40 more per night. This hotel is definitely a budget hotel, so just keep in mind that it has its share of problems. It's definitely do-able, but I'd recommend looking a little further before deciding on this hotel.	
Mar 22 2008 	Disgusting	This place can not be called a hotel because it is a dump.We were given a floor on the first floor (because the elevator did not work) and it was extremely noisey. It overlooked a main street and the noise was unbearable: cars honking, people screaming, sirens... it was like trying to sleep in the middle of the street! We called reception to get another room and we were sent to another room that overlooked the back of the hotel. We have never seen such a disgusting view before in our lifes; the whole floor of the back yard was full of trash and on top of one of the containers we saw a rat! If that was not enough, the noise in that room was awful too because the heater was broken and pumping non stop all night! And as our door was in the middle of the aisle, we were hearing the other guests of the hotel going up and down the stairs with the suitcases all day/ night long!After the first night we decided to leave this place because coming back to that room was too depressing, it was ruinning our stay in New York and we did not want that.	
Mar 19 2008 	Excellent Location	My partner and I stayed 4 nights in this hotel, what can I say, I dont really have anything bad to say about it. The location was absolutely fantastic you step out of the front of this hotel turn right and walk about 150 yds and you are there on Times Square, end of the block you have Planet Hollywood. Starbucks across the street, 2 Irish pubs both serving food and one had live bands on 3 nights out of our 4 night stay, Also two Deli next door to the Hotel which was great for those late night snacks. Also try their cheesecake it is to die for. We stayed in room 1105 the décor was a bit outdated but clean and tidy and a good size room, the bathroom again dated but it was cleaned everyday and we had clean towels everyday also. Our room faced to the front of the hotel, which was quite noisy in the mornings, but who wants to be in bed when you are in NYC. I think my only problem with the hotel and not really a problem but it niggled me was the lifts, 1 wasnt working and the other took for age to come and then would stop on the 2nd floor every time no matter whether you were going up or down. But I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends.TIP: We found to get hot water we had to turn on the shower and let it run for about 5 mins after that no problems.	
Mar 19 2008 	St James Hotel - Perfect Location	We have been to New York 4 times before and stayed in New Jersey, Brooklyn and 56th Street hotels - this one was in THE perfect location. Our stay was from 7th - 13th March 2008.After reading several negative comments before we went we were really delighted with the location and our room - exceeding our expectations. Transport was only $19 pp via the Super Shuttle to &amp; from JFK, door to door too.Comments about leaving keys at reception have been addressed and although you still have to leave the key, we were asked our name every time we asked for it back and it was checked each time - reception is covered 24/7 so that was no problem.Although there are no dining facilities there are numerous diners etc. on the same block (2 right next door!) so that is no problem. The room was warm and the VERY large bed was comfortable and very clean. Although the shower wasn't working the whirlpool bath was a real extra bonus! Our room (514) was very quiet and we could hardly believe we were within about 100 yards of the Swatch shop on Times Square!Subway stations are easily available and being next to Times Square it was easier than we have ever found before to get around. We would highly recommend this hotel to anybody wanting to make the most of their stay.	
Mar 9 2008 	Superb location!!	Well, after reading all the reviews in the months before our stay I was dreading this hotel, but what I got was a basic and clean hotel room with a comfortable bed and quite a large room. We had tons of storage space, and the bathroom was in very good condition.Our purpose of our stay was for sightseeing, and just as everyone says on here, we aren't looking for the Ritz, just a room to sleep in.We discovered that the heating system is crap, and made sooo much noise (sounded like a drummer in the radiator and he made noise every 45 mins or so) that my boyfriend ended up turning it off completely. You might think we are mad, as it'd be cold?? Luckily we were at the back of the hotel and were by the fire exit, so this seemed to help, and with both of us in there it didn't actually seem cold. My boyfriend managed to lock the window for extra security and as there is only a blind for privacy, we had this down the whole time there.Yes, the lift is ridiculously slow getting down to the floor where you are at, plus it always stops at 2nd floor. Just as we were leaving they were fixing the 2nd lift. We did walk down a few times (from 6th floor), however only walked up once, as after a day of walking around and feeling tired, the last thing you need is to walk up those stairs....almost finished me off.Staff were many....always a different face, but helpful when needing help. First lady I encountered could have been more lively (blond, skinny foreign lady), seemed more suited to a mortuary. But again, not looking for Ritz, although went past it!Toilet and shower were fab, no geysers or dodgy temperatures in our bathroom, were we one of the lucky people??? By previous reviews I think we were.It is a shame that no food or breakfast is given, as would be a good thing, even if tea/coffee was supplied, would be great.But that wasn't a problem, had a great Irish pub 30 secs away, McDonalds on every street/avenue, cafes and delis galore, and next to hotel was a fabulous deli serving fantastic rolls/subs/sandwiches, so I recommend them.And BEST bit, literally 40 secs walk to Times Sqaure, sooooo fabulous!!! Its great, if you like shopping...Virgin open until 2am, have Toys R Us open till very late....fantastic. The whole atmosphere is awesome.This hotel is one where I would definitely stay again, and hopefully the lift might be working next time I visit!!!	
Mar 3 2008 	Good Basic Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 17 nigths.Its a basic and clean hotel, no frills.One more time, location is superb, half block from all the action in times square.Price was good compared with all the other hotels on the same area.OK i have to admit that at least in my room the 212, i got the same &quot;geiser&quot; problem others had. But only for the first week after that, the water eruption from the toilet was gone (this was the most disgusting part of my whole stay).No air conditioner in the room. There was a radiator that do not warm the room enough. but it wasnt that bad at all.Maid service was excellent, every day i had fresh towels.People at the front desk were ok. And yes you have to leave your key every time at the reception.Lift was extremely slow, so i better use the stairs.Other than that everything was fine. A CLEAN HOTEL thats all i wanted.ahhhh!! the internet conexion didnt work the whole time i was there, fortunately there was an open conexion from the building next door.Its a very good hotel if you are on budget. Just dont expect a lot and youll be fine.on my next trip i´ll stay at this hotel again, just if the price is the same, 130 dlls per night. more than that i´ll go to another hotel.	
Feb 29 2008 	Location is superb	This was my first visit to New York and I spent a fair amount of time on this web site reviewing several hotels before we opted for the St James on 45th Street. &quot;Expecting the worst&quot; means that you have a better chance of being pleased. This is what we did and yes we were pleasantly surprised!The Location was important, 1/2 hours gentle walk to many of the things on our list of things to see (Empire State, Central Park etc) Walkng times can vary depending on you making the lights in time and how many people are in your way and whether there are any shoe shops along the way!The room was fine and yes basic. It did get a little hot but I usually sleep with the window open and hiss of the radiator wasn't all night long and as for our room, not loud.The lift is slow so we walked (from the 11th floor!) down the stairs and would wait for the lift when going back up, usually about 3-5 minutes. As we left for the UK someone seemed to be trying to fix the second lift!The people on reception were not amazing but ok. We never asked them to do anything for us but they were polite. Overall the hotel was nice and relaxed,clean enough and from what we saw all other guests seemed quite content with what they had.Oh by the way if you like steak go to Quality Meats restaurant (awful name!) on 58 street near 6th Avenue. With the money we saved on our hotel we spent it on eating out nicely!	
Feb 28 2008 	Clean and simple well located terrible heating	As most of reviews put it, the location is the very strong point of this hotel, close enough to Times Square to walk in 4 minutes, and far enough to keep away from noise and agitation.My room was on 5th floor, a height still walkable by the stairway, but I do confirm one of the elevators was not working (and obviously won't be working for quite some time) and the other one was slow. Stairway was dirty and dusty.It seems my room had been refurbished recently. Brand new furniture, paint, tiled bathroom. It was very clean. Spotless bathroom. Quite basic though, I would say the standards of a Super 8. Forget the view, my room was overlooking a depressing and dark court with fire escape stairs. Anyway I was looking for a comfortable and clean place to sleep during my stay in NY and this hotel served this purpose.However I didn't like heating system. The heater was leaking/spitting boiling water and puffing vapor in a teapot noise, so I had to turn it off to sleep. The AC unit was not making hot air so my room was cold in the morning - especially when it's in the low 30s outside. That was the big downside of my stay.Free wireless internet working very well all the time. Same with TV, not that many channels but I didn't go to NYC to watch TV.Staff was neither friendly nor unfriendly. The hotel still has keys that you have to drop at the front desk when you go out. And they don't check your ID when you ask for your room key, or ask to access the luggage room when you leave. Quite a security breach here...Booked through a website affiliate of Expedia, for (on average) 86 per night (about $125-130 at the time).I would hesitate to return in winter due to heating problems, but no problem in the summer.	
Feb 23 2008 	perfect location	We live to travel and are the type to not want to spend vast amounts of money on accommodation but use it to see more.We wanted a clean central hotel and this is what we got.Its a no frills basic hotel, like many others in the city it has an oldstyle feel to it but not shabby.The amenities are basic but is spotless and comfortable.The rooms are cleaned and new linen daily and are spacious.The decor is old style but seems to have been recently done so is clean and tidy.On the downside,there always is! The lift is unbelievably slow,8 floors were quicker by stairs! and it always stopped on the second floor every time it went up!! ghost perhaps ha!. However this was the only quibble and a second lift was being repaired during our stay.Oh and the radiator did make some weird noises every now and again,minor details!As a result i would recommend this hotel if you look on them as a place only to rest your head as only about 100metres from Times Square and so walking distance to most sights. If you prefer room service,modern and snotty establishments pay for them but here you will pay through the nose and this was cheap.	
Feb 18 2008 	Very Old Hotel	We have just returned from Hotel St James, which we booked through Expedia as it was a good price for the centre of NYC.The location is brilliant for Times Square and the theatre district. We could walk wasily to 5th avenue for the shops, Empire State, Top of the Rocks etc.But it is cheap for a reason, it is old and not in excellent condition. The rooms were clean and of a decent size, not modern but my main problem was the heating system. The first night we were in a room in which the heating did not work and only after two nights and three phone calls to the front desk were we moved, the elevator is unbelievably slow. It is annoying have to leave your front room key every time you leave, there are no coffee facilities etc. The heating system makes a lot of nice, and resulted in my sleep being disturbed.I would spend a little extra next time and stay elsewhere.	
Feb 16 2008	false information	I have stayed at this hotel a few times for the excellent location , it is very central for Manhattan , and easy to uptown or downtown by taxi or subway. The problem I encountered om my last stay was an overbilling charge. I had prepaid on the internet, and at the end of my stay was forced to pay an extra night for no valid reason. I was told the internet booking agent had undercharged, which was not the case. I now see it as the St James hotel money grab from the tourist! I will never stay there again. Also the extra cot I paid for , for my daughter , was not in the room, and it took three trips to the front desk to get one.	
Feb 13 2008	Dissapointed	Upon arrival we found that our room was on the 7th floor. In my booking I had requested a low floor room. There are two elevators. The one was out of service and the other one is ancient and very slow. I discovered it also stops at floors where noone has pressed a button. We stood a good five minutes waiting for the lift to arrive and finally ended up walking up 7 flights of stairs, carrying our heavy suitcase!The TV only had 3 channels on it, so we had to call someone up to reset it.The room was so hot (and no way to control the heat), that we had to have the window open about 12 inches all night...this was in Feb.! It was still uncomfortably warm all night.The pillows were lumpy.The water during a shower kept going from hot to cold to very hot back to cold!Overall, not a plesant experience.Not recommended, except for the cheaper price!	
Feb 12 2008	The Geiser!	The hotel was terrible! After waiting for our room for 2 hours, they proceeded to put us in a room that hadn't even been cleaned (dirty sheets, dirty bathroom, cans and bottles on room - yuck!)After notifying the front desk, two of my friends went down to check out the next room incase it was worse. The room looked fine - until we noticed a space heater in the corner - the front desk explained it wasn't the hotels (????????) and that some people travel with them ?????? Upon spraying everything down with Lysol - one friend went to use the bathroom. As she was sitting, the toilet spit up a huge &quot;geiser&quot;. I don't know any other way to describe it. This continued our entire trip. The front desk, notrour travel company (A to Z travel out of Ebensburgh, PA) would not refund anything. We pretty much prayed the whole weekend not to be sprayed, and had to clean the toilet every time we sat down! The continuous clanging of the radiators made me glad I brought my ear plugs!	
Feb 11 2008	Disgusting!	There was no window shade on one window in our room. The front desk person said he would give us a sheet to hang on the window! The walls were thin. We could hear the person next door sneezing like he was in our room. The shower temperature had a mind of it's own and exposed heating pipes in the bathroom could've burned our skin! We ended up leaving a day earlier and staying at a four start hotel for only $50 more.	
Feb 11 2008 	Nice fair clean and awesome front desk	We had a great experience on the Hotel St. James times square.The front desk staff is absolutely gentle and super helpful. They went behind their limit to make us feel comfortable.The room was clean, and accommodating. Housekeepers will change linens everyday.Location is absolutely awesome. One step to all major attractions.Great, great location.The only downside, is that the elevators were out of order. They are changing the hotel system. But we got a room on the lower level, so we were fine.	
Feb 10 2008	One Night Only and You'll See Why!	The overall experience at Hotel St. James was that you get what you pay for! 20 of my friends and I got rooms for the weekend and we were so disappointed. The elevators were very slow and we had alot of luggage so we took the stairs the entire time. Our room was extremely small. That was the worst part! Other friends payed the same amount for both nights and had bigger rooms. One of my friends complained that they had cold water for a shower. Another friend complained that she couldn't use the toilet because it didn't flush. She had to use my toilet and we were cramed in that room as it was! Another friend said they had no towels when they arrived. I had to ASK for an iron, no ironing board. No vending machines, no room service. You have to drop your key off at the front desk everytime you leave, no key cards because the place is so old! If you want to stay at the Hotel St. James..stay for one night and you'll see! REALLY! One night! For NYC - cheap but not worth it. I'de spend the money to have a good nites rest and have an elevator that works. Oh, but they do have menus if you want to order out; they have those at the front desk-delivery is rite at your door. But didn't see the menus when we checked in! The front desk could have atleast let us know that. And didnt see one bug! That was the only nice part of the stay! I never complain but my friend said, &quot;this is one place I would definatly send my worst enemy.&quot;	
Feb 7 2008 	Better than expected Definitely use again!	hi there i checked on this page everyday for the last 2 weeks in the run up to my trip from the 2nd to the 7th of feb and i found it very useful, bar a couple negative reviews they were mostly positive and it couldn't have helped more. Well my stay was no different from the others, amazing location, maintained bedroom, friendly staff and a great experience for a lone traveller.i would definitely recommend this hotel to someone else in the future and i do plan on staying there again the next time i visit NYC!	
Jan 31 2008	No Frills But Perfectly Fine	After searching for hotels on expedia.com I came here to check reviews, and each place had something negative to say - except for this one. Ok, this is no frills to the max, plastic cups in the bathroom, you can pretty much guarantee the elevator will be out - but all we were doing was sleeping there, and getting ready in the morning and it was perfect for our needs. Good sized clean room, nice sized bathroom, plenty of hot water &amp; towels, helpful friendly staff. And the kicker - perfect location to the theater &amp; Times Square and many attractions are no more than a brisk walk. One caveat - request a room away from the street when you book, the street noises can be brutal at 5 a.m. if you're staying there on trash day! I'd much rather spend my money on the theater (oh, see Curtains, it's so wonderful!) or a memorable dinner than a place where I'll be spending most of my time with eyes closed! This place fit the bill nicely.	
Jan 29 2008 	Never again	Never again will I pay so little for a hotel in NYC. There is a reason this hotel is so cheep. The front desk was unorganized, and the keys are not electronic keys. You only get one key for a dubble ocupancy room and must check the key in and out every time you leave. Out of two elevators only one worked and the one that did work, didn't work well. You would have to walk to the second floor to get the elevator because it did not come to the lobby if called from the lobby. I was on the 9th floor and had to walk up twice because the elevator never came. The rooms were large, probibly the only good thing I can say. However, the beds were worn out, and we could feel the springs comeing through. When I took a shower the water was either too hot or too cold, there was no warm water, just hot and cold. Also, the towels had brown stains on them and hairs that were not ours since the towels hadn't even been used yet. The location was great, but I would never stay at this hotel again. A park bench would be preferable to this hotel.	
Jan 28 2008	Great Location	Budget Hotel , Excellent location , rooms are fine , clean, large bed , full bathroom , TV, and lots of hanging space . But the Location really sets this place it is just 2min walk to times sq etc really good deli next door to hotel for breakfast coffees etc	
Jan 24 2008 	Great Location for Okay hotel	The location of this hotel could not have been better. We stayed one night as a stop over. When we arrived, we were greeted by the largest dumpster full of trash right in front of the hotel. This was not a hotel issue, but rather a city thing. The lobby was inviting and the people working at the front desk were friendly. They didn't go out of the way, but they were not rude. One of the two elevators did not work, and the other had problems making it to the first floor lobby. After lugging my bags up 10 stories, I was informed that if you catch the working elevator from the 2nd floor, it works better. The room was nothing fancy, but was clean. I had trouble keeping the temperature regulated, but I think that was more user error than anything else. The bathroom was clean and there was plenty of hot water. As for the location, we were less than a block from Times Square. There were two pubs next to the hotel that were pretty good as well. I would recommend this hotel for singles and/or budget travelers that are looking for a great location and a no frills hotel.	
Jan 24 2008 	Tremendous Value	We stayed here during the busiest week of the Christmas season. While it is certainly a budget hotel -- and pretends to be nothing but -- the room was clean, the bed comfortable, the bathroom was roomy, with plenty of hot water. The location could not be better. The staff were all very accommodating and extremely pleasant. There are no amenities -- spotty TV, no internet or coffee in-room, very few places to hang towels, etc. But for the price they are charging -- who cares?!??	
Jan 23 2008 	Budget Bargin	This was the perfect hotel for us when we went to New York. Cheap Cheap Cheap. With flight, hotel, and insurance the package was only $550.00 for 4 days aprox. and get this the hotel was 1/2 a block from the center of time square durring peak season. We could stay out all night in Time Square with out worring about gtting back to the hotel because we were never out of walking / stumbling distance. The hotel its self wasn't fancy or elaborate but it was clean, had airconditioning and a good size room in a great location. I would book this hotel again if i went back.	
Jan 14 2008 	I love this place	We stayed at this hotel the day of New Years for 5 nights. I would rate this hotel a 2-3 star hotel. It has the best location and price for NYC. Hotels in this area are well over $250+. The rooms were nice, nothing too fancy and the bathrooms were well stocked with towels and they were clean. This hotel is not a resort, but for the price and location, you can't beat it. I have stayed in many different hotels in Times Square and I saved lots of money by staying here at St. James. The service from the front desk was hit or miss, but their map of the city was a life saver. The only complaint was the free wifi internet. Out of the five days I was there, the internet was down for two days. One tip, try to avoid rooms that face the street. These are rooms ending in -03,-04.(ie 203,204,303,304) The noise coming from the street was very loud but the interior rooms are shielded from it.	
Jan 11 2008	Fantastic Hotel Loved It!!!!	This is the perfect hotel to stay in to truly experience what New York city has to offer. Its a fantastic location, I was so surprised how close we were to times square. The hotel itself is pretty basic but its extremely clean. The hotel was great value for location alone and the staff were very helpful at all times. I cant recommend this hotel enough. Looking forward to going back!!!!	
Jan 8 2008 	Best Deal in NYC	This was my 3rd time staying at the hotel. The ladies at the front desk remembered me from when I was there back in August. Very clean room. Big for a NYC room. Bathroom spotless. Excellent price for the location that you are in which is about a block from Times Square. I like the fact that you have to give your room key to the front desk when you leave the property. That way I didn't have to worry about losing it when I was out and about sightseeing. Will definately be back in the summer when I go on vacation.	
Jan 4 2008 	great value totally worth it!	It has been a great place to stay in NY. If you are looking for a place to sleep comfortably you found it. The front desk was of great help all the time. We booked like 7 months in advanced and we didnt have any trouble with the booking or anything else.The place is very clean and the room was cleaned up everyday without any problems, we even left valuables in the room and nothing happened to them. In a few words, great place to stay at.	
Jan 3 2008 	A bargain ideal location	An ideal location that is clean, economical and convenient with a courteous staff. Had a double room on the fourth floor with no elevator problems. Easy walk down the beautiful marble back hallway steps if adverse to a short wait. Treasure of a deli next door! Not luxurious, but did not visit the city for hotel amenities. Perfect for tourists who sleep, shower and experience the city. Hub of location for most desired visitor locations. Will definitely return.	
Dec 21 2007 	Nice hotel worth the money better than expected!!!	As others have said was not to sure what to expect, but was happy with the stay over all. When we arrived we asked for a room on a low floor after reading the reviews on this site about the lifts being very slow. We got room 208 which is on the second floor directly facing the lifts and stairs so that was fine. With it being on a low floor there was noise of people going up and down the stairs but not overly noisy. Anyways when we went into the room first it was cold so went down to reception to ask them to switch on the radiator as it was behind a panel under window which needed to be screwed off in order to switch it on. They obliged and done it, went to bed that night and woke up the next morning and it was still not working, room was freezing. Said it to them at reception and they said no problem later on when you return from you day out we will move you to another room. One other thing about that room, is that in the bathroom there is a pipe which runs down the wall which is not enclosed so when others where having showers on upper floors you could hear the noise of water rushing down the pipe a bit annoying to say the least. So we were moved to the 8th floor, pretty much the same floor but with out the the noises, radiator worked fine. One other thing about this hotel is that none of the windows lock. Well seemed that way both of the rooms i stayed in you could not lock the windows and in the other room a friend of mine stayed in he could not lock his either. Overall i would have to recommend thou. Worth the money, right in the middle of everything, you could not ask for more.........	
Dec 20 2007 	Great Little Place!	Can't complain about this hotel - we paid around £100 per night for a comfortable double room, a stones throw from all the lights and action of Times Square.The rooms were clean and tidy, staff pleasant. A lot of people have said that it could do with a lick of paint but I think it adds to the history of the place - the building is around 100 years old.The Cranberry Deli next door but one is excellent, internet access, open all the time, good food - I highly recommend the chicken fajita wrap :-)You can't argue with the location either - ideal for tourists new to the city, you're slap bang in the centre of midtown, walking distance to a lot of main attractions, and near the 1,2 and 3 subway lines which are pretty central too.The ultimate question is - on the same budget would I stay there again? Yes!In a city where rooms are notoriously expensive, this is an ideal place for a budget concious traveller looking for a homely place to stay.	
Dec 19 2007	hot spot in new york city	st james hotel great central location to walk to macys bloomingdales 5th ave maddison ave radio city' top of the rock' xmas tree' saks 'empire state building 'warm clean accomodation its 2 star is true because of the shabby furniture we had a large room no 410 which is the 4th floor at the back of hotel nice and quiet and lovely and warm with a spotless bathroom and a nice deli next door meals in new york are on the go as they put it we did find a very nice indian restaurant a couple of blocks away called ut- sav well worth a try also a couple of irish pubs for a bar meal next door but one across the road the bond is quite good but a bit exspensive times square is only 5 minites away walking so its a great central hotel even though its basic no food or drink in the hotel not even coffee clean sheets and a tv great iff you are just going for the sights we spent 6 days there and the staff were pleasant at all times also its very close for the theatres any more info you can e. mail me on susan_colin22@hotmail.com	
Dec 16 2007 	great location	great central location, it is an old hotel and could do with cosmetic work (mainly in the corridors) but for the £££ its a steal. staff were fine, rooms were clean, bed was comfy, deli next door great.if your looking for a budget hotel to visit NY you wont go wrong, if your looking for a posh hotel, pay posh hotel rates!it gets a thumbs up from me!	
Dec 10 2007	will return	stayed Dec 7th for 1 night for Christmas sightseeing and found the hotel to be just fine. were concerned about some of the reviews, but were totally ok with the hotel. elevator was not slow at all, we were on 8th floor, room was quiet, we had the king size room and it was actually quite roomy. shampoo only and basic bar of soap. but for the price and location, it was great. we only stayed in the room to sleep and the hotel accomodated us by holding our luggage the morning we arrived until check in at 3:00 which allowed us to be out and about. they also kept our luggage after we checked out till around 4:00 as well. would definitely return for another stay. this is no frills, but was fine for our needs.	
Dec 10 2007 	Perfect Big Apple Pick!	Just returned from a long weekend at the Hotel St. James, which turned out to be a great Big Apple Pick. After reading other reviews, I was a bit unsure what to expect, but I was entirely pleased with our experience. The location is great: a short walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, Macy's, theatres, etc.; two good deli/snack shops next door, and a Starbucks a short distance down the street. The lobby was much more spacious and inviting than what I'd expected after viewing the pics on the hotel web site, and there's a small sitting/library area adjacent. The staff are friendly and helpful, and we were able to check in at 11:00. Our room was enormous by New York City standards, and though there were no frills, it was spotlessly clean. And, importantly, the mattresses were excellent, with good pillows and very fresh linens. Sure, the walls could stand a new coat of paint, and the carpet was threadbare in spots, but with this sort of convenience, cleanliness, and economical rates, who would have the nerve to nitpick? When I scratch my head to come up with negatives, I guess I could mention that the soap dispenser in the lobby ladies room was never filled while we were there, but that's about #357 on my list of priorities. I highly recommend the St. James and will definitely stay there again.	
Dec 7 2007 	Will stay here again	Excellent location. The deli next door was awesome. Big rooms for NY standards. Rooms looked aged and clean. No bedbugs although as we were leaving the hotel we did spy one small visitor (cockroach). Manager did say they would be getting the exterminator.	
Dec 7 2007 	excellent location - low class hotel	we had a reservation for 2 rooms - 3 adults - and one infant. the hotel promised a crib and they did not have one..........they had to go out and buy one. the towels were large enough to dry your face. messages were NEVER given. very shappy, delapidated - they need to invest a lot of money to improve the place.	
Dec 6 2007 	Excellent Location	Considering this hotel is rated 2* any traveller who stays here will be pleasantly suprised. 2 min walk from all the action of times sq and although the hotel has no restaurant there are plenty within a short walk from the hotel. Rooms clean and tidy, v spacious and beds are comfy!	
Dec 6 2007	Ideal starting point for any New York visit	This hotel was basic in as much as meals were not included, but at such a fair price its only understandable. There was a fantastic little buffett shop next door which sold every type of food, cooked well and nicely presented for eating in and taking away!The rooms were ideal for the occasion, and the bathrooms were clean and maintained daily.All the staff were fantastic and very helpful, thumbs up to Margaret and Team! Thank you for a fantastic experience! Kate, Portsmouth	
Dec 5 2007 	You just can't beat the St. James Hotel	I have just read a recent review for the St. Jame's hotel and I also give it the thumbs up! It is the ideal spot for a shopping trip or indeed sightseeing as it is so central to everything. While the hotel does not have a restaurant (who cares) as there are 2 great diners right next door!! I stayed there Dec 06 also and the only complaint I have is the heat as it cannot be regulated and the rooms get very hot. The beds though are very comfy and the room and bathroom was spotless. It is a great little find for the price and location and I will most definitely stay there again next year.	
Dec 3 2007 	Good fun great location	Stayed at the Hotel St James from Nov 22nd 07 - 28th Nov 07. Ive been to NYC and stayed in budget hotels before. If you want to spend all your shopping money on a fancy hotel this isn't the place for you. But however if you want a comftable bed to lay your head a clean bathroom a tv full of channels and an awesome location almost in the middle of Times Square without having to sell a kidney then the Hotel St James is for you. Myself, wife and out 2 friends had a lovely stay the ladies on front desk were very fun, helpful and bubbly. The hotel was clean and comfy and we will definately be back. Thanks	
Nov 27 2007 	Great!!!!!!!	Was a bit disappointed when we checked in, no fridge or tea/coffee making facilities.Didn't take us settling in thoughGood sized room, really lovely reception staff, one man especially, didnt get his name, but he helped us find specialised shops, we call him Mr BrooklynBeds were very clean. I Was with my sis in law who is paranoid, and she loved it.Couldnt b any more central and the prices were greatcouldnt say a bad word about the place, and no..i'm not a relation to any1 that works there, wish i was, i'd b visiting every month!!!!!!	
Nov 19 2007	Disgusting	what a DUMP! sure enough, if you sleep here you'll get biten by bed bugs. this place is disgusting. be forewarned. this is barely a .5 star	
Nov 13 2007	great location would reccommend	We spent the weekend here with our young daughters. Wasn't sure what to expect from other reviews, was pleasantly surprised! Accomodations were plain, but clean and spacious for 4 of us and most importantly we felt safe. The hotel staff was exceptional, the location goes without saying. Deli 2 doors down was not only convenient, but delicious. Would definitely book here again.	
Nov 9 2007 	Love service	My boyfriend and I stayed at the St James and we found it magnific. The service at the front desk is super friendly and very helphul. The hotel itself needs an upgrade like elevador, keys, curtains...but all in all we found safe, secure and absolutely super central.We recommend the St. James hotel to everyone.We will definetely stayed there again, as always we visit New York. We feel like home.Thank you to the staff.	
Nov 7 2007 	Central location	Stayed at St James hotel for 4 nights in November family room 2adults 2 kids, The rooms are basic but clean . They need to freshen decor as its a bit dated .But we didnt go to new york for the rooms, If your looking for a central location at a good price then this is it . 50 yards right of the door is planet hollywood in times square and 200 yards leftt is 5th avenue . Hop on hop off stop bus stop on the corner ,excellent location had a great weekend with everything on our doorstep . Would i go back yes without hesitation no food at hotel but coffee from starbucks across the street and breakfast in the manhattan grill (between 5th and 6th avenue) did the trick	
Nov 3 2007 	Just great!	After reading reviews we feared the worst, but were more than pleasantly surprised with the reality. Rooms were basic but clean and tidy for what was to be only a place to rest our heads.The lack of bar and other facilities were more than made up for by the Deli next door and the Irish pub a few doors away.With a 24hour bank opposite and Times square a hundred yards away to spend the cash, who could ask for more. The Staff were most helpful with all the typical tourist questions put to them.We are already planning our next visit and will be aiming to stay in the St. James in 2009!! Signing off..........Sue, Lyn,Steve &amp; Tony - UK.	
Nov 3 2007 	Superb Location	For the price and location, I was delighted with my choice of budget hotel. - Paying £100 / $200 a night, I was expecting the worst but my fears turned out to be unfounded.The reception staff were very friendly indeed.The location cannot be bettered. I fell out of bed and landed in Times Square.The deli next door does indeed make very nice breakfasts.The room with a Queen bed was plenty big enough for me and my travel partner.The only downside - the hit and miss water from the shower. It changes from scalding to freezing in the blink of an eye and you have to be light on your feet to skip around the bath to avoid having your skin taken off.That aside - perfect. Would recommend and stay again.	
Nov 1 2007 	Discounts Available	If you are lucky enough like our family was, you too might be able to get a discount. Just find the cockroaches!!!! We received $50.00 off a two-night stay.	
Oct 30 2007 	Very satisfied and will recommend to friends	I stayed at the Hotel St. James with 3 girlfriends from October 3 to October 7, 2007 and were very satisfied with this property and would not hesitate to recommend to my friends. As other have said, I read all reviews of this property before departure and was unsure what we would find. We arrived at 9am and our rooms were not ready, but we were able to leave our luggage in a locked room until our rooms were available. We did this and immediately left for the GrayLine bus tour of NYC. A must for anyone and was great to do on our first day there. The hotel is in a fantastic location. Out the door and to the right brings you to Times Square. Out the door and to the left 1 block brings you to 5th Avenue. There are so many resaurants and theatres right outside the door. You really can't get a better location. After returning from the Bus Tour our rooms were ready. I entered, holding my breath, but immediately let out a sigh of relief after opening the door. The room wasn't huge, but large enough for 4 women and their luggage and their shopping bags. The beds were clean and very comfy. The bathroom was clean and looked to be recently renovated. As others have mentioned the air-conditioning is noisy, and is a window unit. This makes for more noise if your room is facing the street. Request a room at the back as garbage pick-up is during the night and is VERY noisy. The elevator is indeed slow, so request a low room and take the stairs much more quickly. The deli next door is great. Taxi's are readily available at all times of the day or night. The 42nd street subway station is in walking distance. When you leave the property you have to leave your 1 and only key at the front desk. This was a bit unnerving as I would have been much more confident taking care of my own key. Check-in and check-out was efficient. You have to request hair-dryers at the front desk, so bring your own. All in all for the price, it is your best bet!!	
Oct 25 2007 	A great location a great price a great hotel	If you are looking for inexpensive, but clean, and in a central location, then I'd stay here. It's literally one block from Times Square. All subway lines are within a blocks distance too. And its right near 5th Avenue! It's definitely not a 4-star hotel, but the rooms were clean, the bathrooms were clean and the towels were fresh. The furniture is a bit cheap looking and was dinged in some spots, but the sheets were fresh and the pillows comfortable. Be warned there is no hair dryer in the bathroom. The rooms on the inner courtyard don't have any window locks on the window - which freaked us out a little since the windows are on the fire escapes. The air conditioner worked fine. No exhaust vents in the bathroom which made for a steamy after shower. The elevator was incredibly slow, so we took the stairs most of the time. We spent the first night in a queen room and due to construction across the inner courtyard, asked to be moved. The hotel front desk was very accommodating and let us pick our new room. They also reserved a car for the ride to the airport with no problems at all. A few tips: the Cranberry Deli is 2 doors away and is open 24 hours. They have a huge selection of food - buffet chinese/salad, pizza by the slice, wraps, sandwiches, sushi even! Plus they make the best breakfast sandwiches and burritos to go, that are super cheap! Overall, I'd recommend the St. James to anyone looking to save a few bucks in NYC but still stay in a nice, clean, decent location in the heart of midtown.	
Oct 24 2007	Hotel St. James was perfect for us!	Just returned from 4 nights at the Hotel St. James in Times Square NY. Had nothing but a good experience. As other people here have said, if you're looking for ritzy, this is not the place. But if you want someplace clean with a great location, this is the place. Our reservation was for a king bed ($175 per night). When we got to the room, there was a queen bed. We called the front desk, and they gave us another room which hadn't been cleaned yet, but we could put our luggage in the closet. They were very accomodating. Hotel is between 6th &amp; 7th Ave. (which starts Times Square). Can't get better location than that. We went to 3 plays, and we were able to walk to all 3. O'Lunney's Pub is on the same block as hotel - great food, and a really nice wait staff. Cranberry Deli next door to hotel - an unbelievable choice of food and you can even eat it there - big dining room upstairs. Havana Central one block over is a great Cuban restaurant, with a live Salsa band playing at night. We felt safe walking back and forth to hotel every night - lots of others walking. Only thing else I would say, is ask for a renovated room on lower floor (we were on 3rd). (Elevator was kind of slow - easier to walk down). We definitely will stay here again!	
Oct 23 2007 	Great location	I took my parents, both retired, to NYC for a long weekend and we really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel St. James. The staff were very accommodating and though the rooms themselves were minimal, they served their purpose: a place to rest. The location was great for walking to various tourist stops and for reaching the subway. (If you love cheesecake or carrot cake, head to Junior's towards Times Square -- both were delicious.)	
Oct 16 2007 	A pleasant experience	I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hotel St James. Like many previous reviewers, a was slightly nervous about what to expect, particularly since I am a lone traveller! However, I found the hotel to be a pleasant surprise. There were a few hiccups: for some reason the room had no curtains - not a problem at this time of the year but I would imagine that could be a problem during the summer months. The shower was not much more than a trickle and the temperature of the water was erratic - so I had baths instead. The windows were a little noisy and even though I was on the 12th floor I could hear the traffic/noise during the night. The air conditoning was noisy but effective - I always travel with ear plugs anyway, so this wasn't a major problem. I was slightly irritated by the envelope on my bedside table with the words &quot;Tips for the housekeeping staff&quot; written on the front. I resisted the temptation to write &quot; Here's a tip: Don't assume you'll get one&quot;. However, for me the good points far outweighed the bad. The staff were all really pleasant and helpful with advice and tips. Although my room did not have a hair drier, I knew, thanks to a previous reviewer, that I could borrow one at reception while checking in (which was in itself an efficient process). The location was very convenient and there is a really good deli two doors down (plus a cafe next door which I didn't get around to using). The room was a good size and spotlessly clean with a substantial supply of towels etc. Yes, the lift was a bit slow and antiquated but at least there was one. I am amazed at previous reviewers who have been sniffy about this hotel. Yes, the decor is tired and you don't get a choice of pillows(!), but you get what you pay for and if you want 4* luxury, go pay 4* prices.This hotel doesn't sell itself as something it's not but if you are fussy about the finer things in life, this is not the hotel for you. I only used the place to sleep and shower anyway and I would happily stay here again - I even left a tip for housekeeping!! An unrelated NYC tip for other lone travellers: some NYC restaurants are reluctant to seat single diners - last year I was begrugingly given a booking at Patsy's Italian restaurant and on this trip was unable to get a table at Carmine's restaurant which was recommended by hotel staff. The door staff told me the portions were very big and would be too much for a single diner!!	
Oct 12 2007 	A nice surprise	This hotel was a nice surprise to us. We booked this hotel based on location (one block off Times Square) but also on the previous reviews from this website. This is a no frills hotel (no ice, small rooms, regular towels) but very clean. The hotel staff accomodated our every question for directions, restaurants, and the best way to get to our cruise ship. With two deli's right next door, breakfast and snacks were easy and reasonable. Whenever we go back to NY, we will definately stay in this hotel again.	
Oct 11 2007 	Fantastic value	Location, location, location. Beyond a doubt, the best value in NYC. This is a no frills hotel...the rooms are very, very small, but reasonably clean and the staff was very pleasant and helpful during our stay. Be sure you try breakfast the Dunhill Cafe right next door. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an inexpensive place to stay in the city.	
Oct 10 2007 	Would definitely stay again! Park at Icon Parking if you have a car.	My boyfriend and I stayed for 5 nights, Oct 3-8, and were both very happy with the room relative to what it cost (about $175/night through Hotel Conxions). I requested a quiet, renovated room on a high floor. We stayed in room 907. The room was small but clean and the bathroom was very new and spotless. The bed was a bit soft but fine (we brought our own pillows). The room faced the back of the hotel so there was no view but it was really quiet, which was great. The location can't be beat. You're literally around the corner from Times Square and a street away from 5th avenue shops. We tipped Housekeeping $2/day. As we weren't early risers, we kept the Do Not Disturb sign on the door until we left in the morning - usually around 11am. We were never bothered before that, and when we got back the room was always done. We had gorgeous HOT weather the entire week we were there so it was understandable that the A/C couldn't keep the room super cold all the time. It was still comfortable enough though. For people with CARS - you can park at any Icon Parking garage. There are tons around the city - iconparking.com. Prices vary according to duration and location. Our lot was 1mile from the hotel (we cabbed it to our hotel) and cost $25/day, tax included.I'd give this hotel a 5 rating, except that we lost somehow lost our camera batter charger in the room. I don't know why anyone from Housekeeping would've taken it or if they did but it remains missing. I've emailed the hotel to ask them whether they found it when we checked out. Overall, an excellent trip and stay. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again - during low season next time!	
Oct 7 2007 	Comfortable hotel and fantastic location!	My teen daughter and I stayed at this hotel October 4-6, 2007. I booked through Hotel Connexions. 5 * for the LOCATION - We were in the theater district and just a 2 minute walk from the Marriot Marquis where you can get discount theater tickets. At the end of the street, there's a &quot;City Sightings&quot; tour vendor. I highly recommend this &quot;hop-on-hop-off&quot; bus tour! It's much cheaper than buying individual tickets for each attraction.3* for COMFORT - Our room was on the 11th floor in the back. It was small but efficient. The room was old but clean. There were no curtains for the bathroom windows. The bottom half of the bathroom window wasn't transparent though. Hotel furnished soaps and shampoo but NO HAIR DRYER! You must request one from the front desk. I had problems regulating the shower temperature, but staff were quick to resolve the issue. No coffee, but close to several delis and McDonalds where you can buy some. Bed was clean and comfortable. Our room was quiet! The door was old and the key got jammed a few times. I had to wiggle the key a bit to lock or unlock the door and to get the key out. The elevator was SLOW and made clicking noises as you passed each floor, but efficient.4* for CLEANLINESS - I would've given this hotel 5* for cleanliness had their not been long hair on the walls. It looked like a girl with long hair dried her hair and it stuck to the wall behind her. Not too gross, only a few strands. 4* for STAFF - The front desk people were helpful and kind. When I entered my room, there was an envelope asking for tips for the cleaning ladies. I thought this was a bit rude as it's their job to clean and besides, my room wasn't immaculate. I stayed for 2 days so I put a &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on my door so they didn't have to come in clean. It's good for the environment anyway to reuse my same sheets and towels. After check out the staff stored my luggage for me for a few hours until I went o the airport.4* for PRICE - It's New York City, so everything is overpriced. However, it was the cheapest I could find. I booked through Hotel Connexions. Other hotels were priced between $300-$400 per night, and I only paid a bit more than $300 for 2 nights! 5* OVERALL - I had a pleasant overall experience. I hope my review is thorough enough to help you decide if the Hotel St. James is right for you. This hotel provides the very basics and not more. If you're familar with the European Formule 1 hotel chain - Hotel St. James is just a step up. The only difference is that you get your own bathroom, privacy, soap and shampoo. And of course the price is a lot higher than Formule 1! Please feel free to ask me questions about this hotel.	
Oct 3 2007 	Great experience	We stayed at the St. James Hotel on September 18, 2007. We were in the city to see a Jimmy Buffett concert at MSG. From the time we arrived to the time we left the next evening, everything was perfect. The room was very clean and accommodated everything we needed. We actually shared a room with another couple and we still were fine. The location was fantastic and the price was right. My only minor complaint was the airconditioner didn't cool the room off quite to my liking. We would stay here again.	
Sep 25 2007 	Super location	Spent one night in September before our cruise. Old property but clean. Location makes up for lack of extras. There was no towel bar in the bathroom and no hairdryer, but it was a great place to get a night's sleep as we did a quick tour. The price was fantastic and I couldn't believe how close we were to Times Square. I would definitely stay there again.The deli next door had great breakfasts at a very reasonable price.	
Sep 17 2007 	Totally OK	we stayed here for one week at the end of August. We had a room on 11th floor and it was at the back of hotel so really quiet, the aircon did make some noise but its more like &quot;white noise&quot; so it covers any other noises.Location is excellent. The room itself was big, i think we were lucky as our friends who were staying on 2nd floor has a much smaller room but their bathroom and furnishings were newer/ modern. By comparison, our room felt a little tired in decor but it was clean.I would recommend the hotel for travellers who are looking for somewhere central, clean and reasonably priced. there are 2 great deli's next to the hotel where you can get your breakfast, and a starbucks just down the road and on the junction with 7th avenue there is a Planet Hollywood.	
Sep 16 2007 	great valuegreat location	I booked the st james and afterwards read some of the reviews on here and must admit I was tempted to cancel and book else where.I decided in the end to stick with it,due to the fact that the location is great and it was only going to be for one night anyway. When we arrived I was plesantly supprised,reception is modern and the staff were very pleasant.We were given a room on the 5th floor, try to use the lift and not the stairs, they are steep and narrow,they reminded me of the stairs they have in hotels in amsterdam. The room was fine, clean and modern but my girlfriend wasnt happy with the size(of the room)shes american and whilst us brits are quite happy to make do,she decided to head back to reception and ask for a bigger room,she came back with keys to 2 different rooms,,now you cant knock that,so we had a choice.After a heavy night being ripped off in grenwich village and getting back to the room at about 5am,we over slept, check out is 12pm,we woke at 12.20 so i rang reception,appologised and was told no problem,,,,so id say,all the bad reviews arnt fair, my experiance was good and my opinion is the the st james is well located,clean,friendly staff,good value.	
Sep 15 2007 	Great location	just returned from trip fantastic location hotel was old but very clean, had room on twelveth floor recently renovated. After reading reviews, we were worried but pleasantly surprised.	
Aug 28 2007 	Absolutely cozy	We had a lovely stay at the Hote St. James. After reading some of the reviews (which are not fair) we were kind of afraid.We got to the Hotel, and the reception staff was absolutely accommodating and friendly, very nice girls.The room was spotless clean and bid enough for both of us. The bathroom recently renovated and very clean.The Hotel St James is on a prime Location, right on the middle of Times Square and walking distance to major attractions, and public transportation.We will definetely stay in the hotel next October, we love it. We felt safe, and comfortable.Thank you to all the Hotel St. James staff, you guys are very nice.	
Aug 28 2007 	OMG sleeping with cockroach	My husband &amp; i stayed there for 2 days (Aug 07). The hotel lift was old &amp; slow, the cabinet &amp; bathroom doors were spoilt, bathroom look eerie, bathtub even had stains. And there were cockroach in the room.....	
Aug 25 2007 	Only if they hold a gun to your head	I asked for a quiet room and got one with a huge ventilation system RIGHT outside my window. After no sleep, I asked for a different room the next morning. They said they would move our (3 of us) bags when a quiet room became available. Later that day, we returned to find our room was on the 2nd floor right above a very busy 45th Street. After arguing, the only other room available was a SMALL single room that we all jammed into. No airconditioner working, and the cot had to be in front of the exit door. They said that they would move us, but never did.	
Aug 20 2007	2nd stay great value	This was our 2nd stay at this hotel for our annual NYC getaway. We requested &amp; rec'd a renovated non-smoking room &amp; got it, on the 10th floor. Yep, the elevators can be slow -small price to pay for a great location &amp; affordable ( for NYC) hotel room. Booked thru Hotel Conxions for $125 per night. Nice locked luggage room where we kept our stuff on check-out day. Yep, a bit noisy from the street noise. King bed, nice &amp; firm, cushy towels, shampoo &amp; conditioner, nice bedding. 1 small problem - ok, 2. The shower was SCALDINGLY hot, dangerously so. Be careful. On the 2nd night, the shower knob fell off when I turned it but I screwed it right back on. Yes, the 2 delis next door are cheap &amp; have great food. 1 even has a salad/hot bar. We will definitely book again next summer!	
Aug 18 2007 	Great Hotel	Our stay was from 13th August to the 17th. The place was terrific, modest and very comfortable. Try if possible staying in the rear of the hotel, we stayed in room 402 which was very noisy. The rooms on the front side are very noisy. The street is very busy, Garbage trucks pass every morning around 5am. Everything else was great; the front desk staff was very accommodating. We would definitely go back again.	
Aug 17 2007 	Great location for budget hotel	Great location! I just came back on 8/16/2007 and was amazed on the location where the hotel is located. If this is your first time in New York City and don't want to spend a lot of money, but you want to stay in a great location, this is the hotel to stay in. The room and bathroom were very clean. I stayed in the eleventh floor and found the elevetor to be very slow. I found the hotel to be excellent for the price. Keep in mind if you are looking for the Ritz this is not the hotel for you, but if your like me and you're planning to spend the whole day site seeing and will be going to the hotel to simply shower and sleep this will be the hotel for you.	
Aug 9 2007 	Older and Experienced	One night was booked thru Expedia, one thru the hotel. On checkin, they only had a 1 bed room available but I needed two beds. Explained what I needed and who I confirmed with at the hotel and the nice blond lady desk boss fixed it. - Graciously! Seven floors up in the small elevators, which seemed a bit slow to respond, but hey, if you're more than 50 years old, you'd be slow too. It got us up and down reliably. Stairs were convenient for going down. Room window looked out on 45th and the bathroom window opened to the center of the building, not a nice view, but who gazes out the bathroom window. The place was clean. Beds were ok, no complaints. Bathroom did have a bit of black mold in one corner, I can live with that for 2 nights. Our departure was the day of The Storm, August 8, 2007. The city was a mess, no taxis to LaGuardia. Again the same lady at the desk took care of us by calling a limo. Approximately the same price as a taxi and a whole lot more comfortable. If I ever go back to New York City I will stay there. Why go somewhere else? St James worked for me. Good friendly staff, clean rooms, and the deli next store made a great breakfast wrap. The deli two doors down had the best coffee, ask for cream and sugar. All in all, New York City was great, the people friendly and helpful. PS. Johns Pizza and LaFamiglia Pizza were awesome.	
Aug 8 2007 	Location Location Location~	They say it's all about location and this hotel definitley has that! Only one block from Time Square, it's convenient to all the hustle and bustle that New York has to offer. The hotel is clean and doesn't offer any bells and whistles, but if you are more concerned with your location then your amenities then this is the place to stay. We spent very little time in our room and pretty much just needed somewhere to shower and sleep and this hotel met that criteria. If you are looking for somewhere affordable (for NYC standards) and centrally located then I would highly recommend the St James. If you are looking for luxury and more frills then this may not be the place for you, but I know on my next trip to NYC I will try to get a room at the St James first.	
Jul 29 2007 	Very Good Price and Excelent Location in Manhattan	This hotel is a very good selection for those travelers with limited budget but that wish a good location and respect very much his privacy. Without having special luxuries, this hotel has comfortable and clean rooms and an insuperable location, only two blocks from time square. Definitively a look deserves if you are searching a hotel in one of the most expensive cities of the world in accomodations.	
Jul 26 2007 	I would stay here again in a minute!	I have to say that when I read the reviews, my sister and I were somewhat hesitant but decided to take the gamble and stay at the St. James...after all, it is New York-we were not going to be there much. It was a great experience that did not break the bank. For the price, you cannot beat it. The Dunhill and Cranberry Deli's next door were great. Open early close late. Very reasonable. The location could not be better. The only complaints are, the water in the showers was very hard to regulate. If you are traveling with children I would suggest baths for them as the water would be fine...then literally scalding hot. The elevators were very slow so see if you can get a room on a lower floor. The pillows are horrbile so bring your own if you can.Other than those minor items, it was great. I would stay here again for sure.	
Jul 23 2007	Great rate for the budget tourist in a great location	I was a little hesitant about booking at this hotel because of some of the other reviews I had read. Those mostly concerned me because they indicated the hotel was old and shabby.OK, so maybe parts of that are true. But what mattered was that the room was clean, the service was excellent and friendly, and the clientele was interesting. There were some young backpackers, an older Russian couple, some Korean tourists, and a French family all staying at the same time I did, so the place had a real international flavor. I had to leave my key at the front desk. But I found that to be a good deal cuz I left my laptop sitting on the dresser the entire time I was there and nothing happened to it. I figured if the front desk had my key, then only hotel staff were going to go in my room. And I didn't have to worry about losing my key.And what a great place to stay. Location location location! Two blocks and you're in Times Square. Metro stations are within two or three blocks almost anywhere you walk. Central Park is an easy seven blocks away. There are two deli's right next door that open at 6 AM and close at 11 PM. They both serve a quick and inexpensive meal. Just what you need to start your day. There's a Starbucks down the street and another cafe that I didn't eat at. There's an Irish Pub on the street too. Will I go back? Hell yeah. For the price, you can't beat it.	
Jul 20 2007 	worst hotel i have ever stayed in!	ok i stayed here in december of 2005, the location is good, but the hotel is terrible, the lobby was filled with junk and was not even finished, the clerk was never at the desk, and the floor in the lobby was plywood with smashed up tiles. there was a small &quot;room&quot; in the lobby that was made out of white unmatching panel board with broken plexyglass windows to put your luggage as you waited for the room and anyone could just walk in there and take it there was no door or anything. the room was disgusting. the bathroom was smaller than the one in my RV and the power went out if the tv was on at the same time as the lights! this hotel looks like it has not been cleaned in 20 years, disgusting. dont stay here, the people sleeping in cardboard boxes on the streets have it better than you do if you stay here!	
Jul 17 2007	Hotel nice but Beware Parking costs	We have just come back from New York we found the hotel in a good location close to everything it was clean and just used as a base, when I booked I asked about parking I was told it would be $50.00 a day in the parking opposite, a bit much but it is New York Right! we went to the parking first as there is nowhere to park on the street to unload bags, we were told nearly $80.00 a night to park by the attendants with a take it or leave it attitudde so we took what we could carry out of the Car and walked back to the hotel, we decided that this is just too much even for New York parking!!!so we drop the bags of in the room, 10mins max and went back to move the car they charged 8 Bucks for 10 minutes.We did find a great place after though !!!!!!Directions are as you come out of the front door of the St James you turn right, and go down 45th St and go straight across Times Square staying on 45th on the left you will see a a club called Private Eyes next to it is a parking sign on the wall ....there we found an outside valet parking whch cost us $50 for 2 days.Our recommendations:go online and book a double decker hop on hop off bus these are great and we saw everything we wanted within the 2 days no worries with parking nightmare traffic etc, use either Grays or city sight NY. we used city it was great but grays seemed to have more buses so there was less waiting time for pick ups.So park up for the duration of your stay we had a great time, hope this helps?	
Jul 5 2007	I guess i had one of the renovated nice rooms..	I've just read many of the reviews...it seems this hotel has nice 'renovated rooms' and rooms that havent been renovated. I had a very nice room and my bathroom was new-looking and very clean...perhaps i had a newly renovated room. Yes there was noise from outside, but i fell asleep quickly, it didnt bother me..and this is the times sq area, theres gonna be noise. Hmm, maybe the hotel will renovate the rest of the hotels rooms. All in all, i would stay here again..plus, with manhattan hotels out of control with their rates, glad theres somewhere that is under 300 a night.	
Jun 30 2007 	Very Very Acceptable!!!	This is not a luxury hotel. It is on 45th, a half block from the heart of Times Square. It is relatively inexpensive, saving you an easy couple of hundred or so a night. The room was probably a bit better than the average budget hotel which you'd typically find in Cowpasture, MO or along Highway 2Where. Apparently size and noise level can be luck of the draw, and we were lucky. We had a spacious room with double beds in the back. Air conditioner was a window unit and not super chill capable. However, we were cool enough even during NYC's mini heat wave this last week of June. As budget travelers in general, we look at air conditioners as 'white noise' anyway. Staff was at least as friendly as the average service personnel here in the city, but we put no major demands on them. Room was clean and adequately maintained. In summary, price and location were ideal. All else well within acceptable range. We, a family of 2 adults and 2 children of 12 and 14, would not hesitate to stay there again.	
Jun 26 2007	Worst Ever !!!!	This is the worst room I have ever stayed in. The window unit air conditioner was as loud as a truck so I didn't sleep at all for the three nights I was there. The room and hotel seemed to be in an overall state of advanced decay with the old wood flooring in the room not entirely covered by the carpet. The room was tiny, so you couldn't escape the air conditioner noise. No couch, chairs, nada. The staff also didn't give a hoot either. Next time I'll pay $100 more a night for something better than a jail cell! The only good thing I can say was there was a great deli next door. And I do love New York!	
Jun 26 2007 	Perfect for location and great for the price for a budget hotel	Ok....after reading the reviews I was scared about the St. James....But heres is my take. I am 35 year old white male and travel ALOT....NY is very Expensive and the hotel is on the VERY LOW end of price and amenities. BUT if your going to sight see and only use the hotel as a base of operations...this is it!....1. Ask for a room not facing the street....A bit loud at night.2. The front desk staff are great...they work to make you happy....they are very quick to please and answer questions.3. They have a FREE bag storage...thats rare in NY4. Out of the hotel and on the right about 2 steps is a GREAT and CHEAP place to get breakfeast and a snack.5. Starbucks is about 20 feet on the left from the hotel6 Your RIGHT off of Broadway and near the N, R and Q Lines7 The pillows are flat and small ask for 2 or 3 extra when you get there.8. The rooms are clean and the sheets and beds are clean and they smell like bleach...which i like....9. Ask for a room down low...the elevators are older and very slow....we stayed on the 3rd floor and just used the steps.Overall its a great location for the theaters and shopping...your in a great area...and its clean and cheap.	
Jun 17 2007 	Fantastic Location and Great Hotel	After reading some less than flattering reviews on St James Hotel, 45th St, I felt obliged to record the excellent standards and service we experienced. We booked two double rooms, which we were expecting to be fairly basic given that this is a budget hotel. Our room was extremely large, and our friends next door (which the receptionist was happy to arrange) also of respectable size. Most importantly rooms were very clean. The maid was pleasant, and we tipped her accordingly, to the point that she came to thank us on our last day (we stayed for a week). Reception staff were always helpful and courteous. This is a no frills hotel, however you more than get your money's worth. We travelled from Ireland, and the hotel was recomended by a friend, and I would highly recomend St James to anyone, particularly for the location just off Times Square. I cannot speak highly enough of the hotel, and question some previous reviews. Just what were they expecting from a budget hotel ?	
Jun 15 2007	bad bad booking clerks	rude cleak we booked june 9 10 11 one room two beds we got one room one bed we stayed very small hot we had four people go ahead and stay if you want problems on you next vacation i called the nite before to confirm and we still had no room the said they over booked	
Jun 13 2007 	POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE	My family and I stayed at Hotel St. James June 9th,10th and 11th. I booked this hotel room and confirmed it through travelocity in January 2007. Knowing we would arrive on the 9th around 6 p.m. I called one week prior to confirm a late arrival. I was told there would be no problem and my room would be ready. We arrived on the 9th at 5:15 p.m. I was not greeted but grunted at by a 20 something [--] desk clerk. He informed me that my room was no longer available. They had given it to someone else. When I questioned why he was very rude and said, &quot;Oh well, there's nothing I can do.&quot; He offered us two rooms with one bed. Having children with us of course we would not let them sleep alone, therefore my husband and I had to split up for the night. His room was facing an alley with a fire escape and the window did not lock. The next morning I called Travelocity and they spoke with a different clerk and he said they did have a room for me. I spoke to this clerk and he informed me that they overbook on the weekends because of cancellations. I should have been told by the rude clerk on the 9th that there would be a room available the next day. I was never told this by the VERY RUDE CLERK on the 9th. Our bags were moved to the new room by the hotel staff. Once we were in this room everything was find. Room was clean and comfortable. I feel the only reason I was taken care of was because I complained to Travelocity. Without their advertisement, you would never know that Hotel St. James was even in New York. Beware when booking, your room may not be available!!!	
Jun 4 2007 	Not a Roach Motel	A coworker/friend and I stayed at the Hotel St. James for a personal stop on a business trip. Since we had to pay for it ourselves and were only going to stay one night, we took the chance. It is convienently located a block off of Times Square in Mid-town Manhattan and a few blocks from the 42nd Street terminal. The room and bathroom was spacious for NYC. Everything was spotlessly clean, but somewhat dated (and that's coming from a germaphobe). The hotel staff was very nice, but it is a no frills budget hotel. There were no problems with noise either. The elevator was very small and sometimes slow. The bed was a bit stiff, but liveable. There was plenty of VERY hot water. The room was cooled by a small window unit, which could be a problem in the summer as it barely cooled the room during outside temps in the mid to upper 50'sHotel St. James is not a place I would take my wife for a romantic, extended stay. If you need pampering and concierge then go to another hotel. HOWEVER, if you want a clean and cheap way to visit NYC then you've found the perfect place.	
Jun 3 2007 	Great Location... BUTT yep theres always a BUTTT	Ok.. Following a read of previous tripadvisor reviews Myself and my partner decided that St James hotel would be a great place to stay in NY considering we wanted to be in amongst all the action for a reasonable price. There is absoultely no arguing that that is the case... you can see times square when you step out the front door and the price isnt bad...We are on a world trip and have stayed in both the 5 star aswell as the hostels over the states so have a fair idea what is expected.. All we expect from a place to stay is a clean, comfortable bed, be able to have a decent shower, and have no hidden suprises.Our first night after a long flight to NY we wanted a decent shower - one that has a constant temperature throughout?? not too hard to ask.. ? Apparently it is.. The plumbing system is less than adequate - we have stayed in hostels that would provide a much more reasonable shower. We asked maintenance to come and show us how to have a constant temperature in our shower - they came in and told us that this is how it is you pay for what you get..? ehh yeah ok...We asked to change rooms as we thought that this may be the case in only our room... &quot;No sorry we are full... &quot; we can not change your room Ironically we were speaking to guests in the lift who were experiencing the same problems..oh thats right THATS why they have a no refund policy and ask you to pay up front... if you want to leave you have already paid for nights you wont use..House keeping asks for tips.. well as do everyone in the states .. but considering you dont get your sheets changed your whole stay its not worth the tip...and.. yep the lovely surprise we had on the way out when we were checking out was.. we owe 21$ ??? Ok well you are charged 75c for usage of 1800 calling cards from your phone every call. Yeah maybe fair enuff if they make you aware of it or have something with charges somewhere around the hotel - nothing. The response i got was &quot;well you didnt ask what the charges were so too bad&quot;.I would not send anyone i know to this hotel ...	
Jun 2 2007 	Male Night Desk Clerk quite rude	My daughter and I stayed at this hotel from May 27-June 1, 2007 while we were visiting New York. We were not planning to spend much time in a hotel room, so we were not looking for luxuries. We stayed in room 503 and were pleasantly surprised, the room was quite large and clean. We were disappointed that we could only pick up 6 tv channels and couldn't find a channel with a NYC forcast. Hotel was advertised as having sattelite tv.We didn't have too much to do with front desk- except to leave the key when we left each morning. We had to leave the hotel on our last morning by 5:45 am to get to Penn Station, so I asked the male night desk clerk (the bald guy) about a taxi for the early hour. He told me we would have to walk to Times Square. Lets see 2 women 4 suitcases. Walk to Times Square wasn't what we wanted to hear. When we checked out in the morning, my daughter was leaning on the counter and he snapped at her to not read the papers he had there. Not very professional - confidental papers should be kept in the office not on the front desk. One other thing I was not told that each call made from the in room phone would cost .75 cents even when using a calling card. I had to pay $8:10 for calls that I coulda made from a pay phone for no charge had I known.I would stay again now that I know what to expect.	
May 31 2007	GREAT LOCATION AND PRICE	one block from times square and theatres. small,no frills but rooms were clean and recently updated. we had to move because the shower didn't work, but staff was prompt and friendly. the rooms were pretty good sized compared to other, more expensive places i have stayed in time square. two deli's located next door. there was plenty of towels, soap and shampoo.	
May 19 2007 	A Great Place	We had a great stay at this hotel!There were 3 of us in one room with 2 double beds. We had lots of room for a New York hotel. It was litterally 2 blocks from the center of Time Square. There were two little deli type convenience stores right next door - with fresh cooked to order breakfast!The staff was overall very friendly - it was very European - leave the key at the front door.It looked like they were doing some remodeling - but that didn't bother us at all.I'd stay there again the next time I'm in NYC!	
May 14 2007 	Perfect for the Price!!!!	The Hotel St. James was perfect for the price. The room was what we paid for: A place to change, sleep and shower. Room was clean but small, and as was the bathroom. The hotel was only 1/2 a block from Times Square, 4 blocks from Grand Central and within minutes of every possible transportation. We didn't go to NYC to hang out in our room so this was perfect and the price was right. Would stay again!!!	
May 6 2007 	a great budget option	just returned from a 5 night stay in NY and couldn't fault the St James as a budget option. Our room on the 12th floor was very large and the bathroom spotless - although the plumbing was unique, once we'd worked it out it didn't let us down. This wasn't our first time in NY and we are out of the room from dawn to dusk so have limited need for any traditional hotel luxuries. If you are in need of some pampering then this isn't the place for you (no toiletries, no hairdryer, no coffee in room. Slightly rickety plumbing, fairly noisy radiator). If your requirements are that the room and bathroom are clean and the location fantastic then give it a try. There are a couple of great deli's below the hotel, a Starbucks across the street, bars a few doors down and Times Square a minute away. I only needed the staff on the last morning - to order a cab for later in the day to return to JFK and to store luggage that day until we came back for the cab. They were extremely helpful and I wouldn't think twice about staying here again.	
Apr 25 2007 	Great Value for NYC!	In NYC Location is everything! Recently stayed at the St James in NYCwhen traveling with friends to the city. We knew we wanted to be close to Times Sqr and the theatre district, but also knew we had a budget. The St James was a great choice! All of the rooms have just been redone. The furniture and linens are all brand new. Very clean and enough room for our clothes and luggage. The front desk staff wasvery friendly and offered great recommendations for places to eat and shop. We were pleasantly pleased to find that the hotel offered wifi in our room for free. I would stay here again and again!!!	
Apr 24 2007 	Not as Bad as people say	I stayed at this hotel for a weekend with a friend. I was a little worried after reading other reviews but the price was right. We got to the hotel early and was able to check right in which was great! My room was nice size very clean I checked the bed to make sure it was clean it was, the bathroom was SPOTLESS. My friends room was also very clean but very small and didn't have a A/C in the window and was very hot but the next day we asked how to turn down the heat and it was OK after that.The only problem that I had was the front desk workers. The girls that were there when we checked in and left the next morning were great!! But the next shift guys were not as nice. You would ask a question and they seem to be upset you were even talking to them. They were to busy playing on the computer or whatever they were doing. People would come down with luggage and they wouldn't even offer to help cmon isnt that what hotels usually do?There is a deli next door. I think it was called Dunnhill just great! We had breakfast there both Saturday &amp; Sunday of are stay great food and it was cheap! They have alot of differnt things to choose from. We also want to Connelys couple doors down for Dinner that was also great! If you dont mind a small clean room with not alot of extras then this is great, good location 1 block for Time Sqaure can't beat that.	
Apr 22 2007 	A must stay hotel.....says "me"	This hotel is literally in Times Square, 1/2 of a block away from the center. The room was small but it was clean, the bed was great, location was great too. We stayed on the 7th floor in room 706 we didnt have a street view, which was fine with me, since we were out there everyday from pretty much dawn till WAY after midnight. The staff was great with helping us find places to eat, and with directions, they have maps there as well for people like me who have never been. The deli next door was good and fast at getting me what we ordered. The Irish pubs going towards Times Square, were also excellent, live music and lots of drinks to choose from. The best place is O'Lunneys, we went there everynight. Although there are other hotels in Times Square this one I think was great for the price, we paid 136.00 a night it was well worth it, its not the RITZ, if you need a place to stay that close to Times Square, and you dont want to spend a fortune, STAY HERE, it was GREAT. If this is your first time to New York and you dont know to much about the city, or have lots of money to spend, we recommend this place. I give it an A+.	
Apr 20 2007 	Front desk clerk.......in need of basic communication skills 	I reserved a room for 1 night at the St. James Hotel. I read previous posts and was forwarned. I checked in at 9:30pm. The front desk reception person made no eye contact and the entire 2 minutes of the check in process, viewed a video on DVD. He looked up once for a second or two when I asked if I could see the room first. Acted annoyed and bothered. I won't even bother to characterize the behavior . The room was clean,simple and basic. Bedding linen appeared clean when I took a cursory look. Upon closer examination, 2 tiny insects were found mid to lower end of bed.On Monday I tried to contact the manager. (The line at the hotel is often busy. When I got through I was put on hold for 5 1/2 minutes. I hung up called back and was told she would be in on Tuesday)Spoke on Tuesday to the manager who was pleasant and she offered 1 night free stay but not in writing. We shall see.Stayed here because most hotels at mid or economy range were booked . Interesting that in April a budget hotel is often $200 or more. I hope the manager follows through. I will remain optimistic. Again, the hotel is great for location. Lobby is new. Room seemed clean albeit very small, approx 9 1/2 x 11ft. B edding was not clean.N. Broome.......ex....native NYC resident.	
Mar 29 2007	CLEAN AND FIRENDLY..... BUT......	My children stayed here for one night en-route to another hotel for their weekend stay, and they were very happy to be moving to a better hotel because the radiator in their room clanked and rattled all night long! We were told they should have turned the heat/radiator off to stop the noise problem, but then they would have been cold, so, not good for chilly spring nights (late March) - there doesn't seem to be any central air conditioning in the rooms, so this may not be so good for summer stays either??? It is in fact, a nice little hotel, and you coudn't ask for a better location in New York if you're sightseeing or shopping. In general, it is a pretty building, the staff are friendly and the lobby is inviting and cozy. The room and bathroom were very clean (if a little small) but the carpeting in the hallway was totally threadbare.The hotel is under renovation, so we made allowances for that, but perhaps the owners would be wise to close off floor by floor, and finish the work on each floor before selling the rooms!	
Mar 6 2007 	Just perfect for Christmas Shopping!	We planned a Christmas shooping trip with 4 girls at the end of Nov 2006 and were of course looking for a hotel which was not that expensive but in the city centre. In the internet I found the St. James Hotel. And after reading all the reviews here at Trip Advisory, we planned to stay there. As we booked the room, we asked for a room on the back side of the hotel as some people here mentioned that a room towards the street was quite loud. The price which we paid was absolutely reasonable and extraordinary for the location of the hotel. It was just 2 minutes away from Times Square! The personnel was friendly, the room was clean and quiet. Not big and with simple furniture, but it was clean which is the most important for me. And the room was big enough for 4 people. I can absolutely recommend the St. James Hotel for younger people that go there for a few days. For couples or more luxury-loving people, I would recommend to take another hotel.For us, it was just the perfect hotel to stay on our Christmas Shopping trip and we would always go there again!	
Feb 19 2007 	Awesome location and sweet staff	We stayed at the St. James hotel, and we were extremely happy with the service this family style hotel has provided us with. Since we checked-in, very nice and sweet front desk girls. They were helpful and fast with our request about info about restaurants , shops, nightclubs,...The hotel is very clean, pretty good size rooms, extremely clean bathroom. We were actually in the 411 room, quite large two double beds for me, my husband and our 4 year-old twin boys.We could not be happier with the service and the location this hidden jewel offered us.All in all was excellent, and we would definetely stay next time we go to New York. Thank Margaret and Carmen for your kindness, you girls are great.	
Feb 17 2007	Hooked On Macys	This budget hotel was quite a find for my daughter and myself on a pre-Christmas shopping trip, only minutes from Broadway and &quot;cheap as chips&quot;. It was undergoing refurbishment but the staff were helpful and friendly.Our request for a hair drier brought a quicker reponse than we've met in grander hotels. The rooms were on the small side but then so was the rate per night and the bathroom was super clean. The lack of eating facilities wasn't a drawback either, in New York you can find a deli open 24/7.It was a great find and judging from the work going on, is moving up market and wont be so cheap when we visit again.	
Feb 17 2007 	dirty hotel with stains on sheets	I stayed at the St. James and had never stayed at a hotel this dirty. There where stains on the sheets and stains on the carpet. It looked like a hotel used for escort services. Lots of traffic at late hours of the evening. Very unsanitary hotel. Its priced cheap for a reason. I was very unhappy.	
Feb 6 2007 	Location superb for shopping lovers!	I've just returned from a 3 night stay at the low priced ST James Hotel. This 1 and a half star hotel was in a prime location bang next to Times Square and with easy reach of all the nearby shopping and sightseeing attractions. We got cabs everywhere because of the freezing february wind chills but if you can brave the weather :central park, macys the empire state building,rockerfella centre etc are all within easy walking distance (just dont wear your highest heels like i did!) A few doors down from the hotel is a lovely deli Cranberry Gourmet where we had a few snacks all beautifully prepared and really cheap too! The hotel itself is a clean and comfortable place to rest your head at night, the staff were really friendly and i would not think twice about staying here the next time i visit!!! a real value for money hotel!	
Jan 6 2007	Worthwhile Stay	My partner wanted to see the Christmas holiday displays of New York City, so we set out for an overnite from Westport, Massachusetts only 4 hours away. I picked the St James because of its location and especially its affordable price. As other reviews have suggested, it is a basic hotel...so don't expect extras. Our room was available and ready when we arrived around 3pm. The hotel staff was courteous and friendly at the reception desk. The room was very basic. I guess they were doing some renovations on our floor (9) as there were furniture, a mattress and a TV stored in the hallway. I did find the heat difficult to regulate (too hot) but the bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean and plenty of hot water. We needed an iron and extra pillows and those were provided once we asked. You can't ask for a better location. Within walking distance of many sightseeing attractions, Times Square and next to two well stocked deli/ convenience stores and also a couple of restaurants. (We ate in O'donnells, an Irish pub two doors down...very good but busy!) I would highly recommend this hotel when traveling to NYC on a budget.	
Jan 5 2007 	NYE in NYC	Hello, we have just got back from St James after staying there for 5 nights, including New Years Eve. The location is superb, its a basic hotel, but clean &amp; freindly &amp; you don't spend much time there anyway when you're in NYC, its just used as a base. The 2 Deli's next door were excellent, The Cranberry was particularly good value for breakfast. Times Square is literally at the end of the street(W 45th), approx 50 yards to Planet Hollywood!! The room was basic, but very clean &amp; maids provided clean towels &amp; made the bed everyday.It is definatley a hotel we would stay in again, as the location is prime for shoppping/sightseeing.	
Jan 4 2007 	New Year's Weekend 2007	The Hotel St. James is an excellent value! We were able to get a room for 2 nights (12/30 &amp; 12/31/06) for the price which was much less than what we would have paid for only New Year's Eve night at other NYC hotels . NYC Hotel prices usually skyrocket for this weekend, and St. James was very reasonably priced and affordable. This is a no frills place in a prime location, a stone's throw from Broadway and 45th Street. The bathroom and bedroom had recently been renovated. The bathroom was quite nice. It was also very clean. No frills means no ice bucket or ice machine, no soda machines, no computer hookups, no bellman standing outside. There are 2 great deli's next door that are very reasonably priced (You can buy bags of ice at one of them.) for breakfast, lunch or dinner. There are parking garages conveniently located a block away with reasonable 24 hour rates. And it is close to Broadway, Rockefeller Center and many other Midtown locations. For the price it was perfect, and we would definitely stay there again.	
Jan 3 2007 	Perfect Stay	I don't see how this hotel has any negative reviews, we really enjoyed our stay here! I've stayed in a 3 star hotel in NYC before but can honestly say St. James was the better choice. I went on a girls trip with my best friend. Our room was plain but newly renovated and the largest room I've seen in Manhatten. The bathroom was also larger than most with a nice tub. Everything was very clean. The staff was friendly and helped us find clubs and restaurants to go to. The TV only picked up a few stations but we weren't there to watch TV and the elevators are slow and small but other than that, no complaints. Right next door are 2 delis that are very cheap and really good! 2 pubs are also located a few doors down. The location couldn't be better if you're wanting to stay in Times Square. Just a heads up that you aren't supplied with soap or shampoo so you'll need to bring your own. A very simple hotel but nice and clean and a perfect price. I'll definitely be returning to Hotel St. James.	
Jan 1 2007 	Great Location-Nice Room	We stayed at the St. James Dec. 8-10, 2006. Great Location. Some rooms on the 8th Floor have been upgraded and ours was very nice. Large rooms for New York. Bathroom was very small but usable. Rooms were clean. Elevators are troublesome and have a mind of their own. If you have a lot of luggage, you may want to stay on a lower floor, in case you must carry it down the stairs. Front desk would not call us a cab. Cabs do not run past the hotel much. Husband had to flag one down on Broadway and have it come by and pick up the luggage and me.Overall, I would stay at the St.James again anytime.	
Dec 31 2006 	Great hotel	Arrived at the St James early and were allowed straight to our room before 3pm. Hotel has 2 lifts which were fine. The room was non smoking which we had booked, very clean room with good wardrobe, very comfortable bed, TV with remote control and clean new bathroom with working shower. Good supply of hot water at all times. Room was cleaned daily, also daily supply of clean towels and room was also warm. The only negative was the radiator which was a bit noisy at times.Hotel was next door to 2 great deli's which were both fantastic. The location of this hotel is amazing-within walking distance of Bryant Park, Broadway, Central Station,Rockefellar centre to name just a few. We felt very safe walking around and especially back to the hotel, the hotel staff always checked who we were before walking up to our room. We also left our shopping in the room daily and it was all safe.We would definately stay here again, cant wait to book in next Christmas!	
Dec 26 2006 	...it was ok	01. no one to help with luggage. we were staying for a week and a half and had a lot of bags. 02. no early check-in despite having available rooms03. hotel was under heavy renovations during our stay, and no one notified us04. the best part was the location.05. you could hear people having &quot;relations&quot; in the other rooms.06. they should do background checks on their housekeeping staff, because we ended up with missing items after the first couple of days....we refused housekeeping after that.'this was my first time in new york, and it was dirty and smelly and fun just like i expected. front desk staff was clueless and couldnt tell us where good food or bars were.	
Dec 19 2006	outstanding location	very much updated since a few years back!!!! not as bad as people are making out. we could go back to the hotel with shopping bags instead of carrying them around all day. Hotel is right by times square....also parking 1block away at $30for 24hrs. Very basic hotel but its clean plenty of hot water. Great deli next door salad n fruit bar. (New York is not da place you hav time to spend in your room!!!) Carol Ireland/Nantucket	
Dec 13 2006 	Be warned!	I stayed at the St James a few years back with my wife and can honestly say it was one of the worst hotels I have ever encountered. The rooms and lobby were not clean and the clientelle loitering around in the lobby was disconcerting. They obviously will let anyone into the hotel whether they are staying there or not. One evening on the decrepit elevator I encountered a woman under the influence of drugs. How could I tell, you ask? Well, she had a large beer in one hand and a crack pipe in the other. Stay away from this place.	
Dec 13 2006 	Excellent value great location	If its location you're looking for you wont find better than Hotel St James. It is literally a stone's throw from Times Square. Although the standard of the hotel is very basic, it is clean and staff are friendly. Rates are resasonable - you wont find a better location for the price.	
Dec 12 2006 	Great location	I was a little worried when I reserved the accommodation, that I may get a run down room. But I did not. Room 301 was very basic,but clean. Both the bedroom and the bathroom had been recently renovated. I was lead to believe from check in that some of the top floor rooms had yet to be renovated. The reception staff were friendly and helpfull. The location was what pulled this hotel for me. As I was hitting Broadway, it was all there with a short 2 minute walk. I would stay here again.	
Dec 11 2006 	December 8 - 10 2006	My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel St. James from Decmeber 8 - 10, 2006 to shop for the holidays. We almost canceled our reservation based on the negative reveiws. But we are very glad that we decided to be adverturous and keep the reservation. The front-desk staff was delightful. Any time we asked for help, we were promptly assisted. The location is FABULOUS. The two shops next door provided great snacks at a great price. Yes, the rooms are basic - you may find a light bulb to be too large for the fixture or a ceiling fixture with no globe - only a bulb. And the view from your room will not be anything you really want to see. But the room was extremely clean. The bathroom was extremely clean. The water was hot. The heater worked just fine (yes, it made noises all night long, but isn't that what we went to New York for . . . the atmosphere). If you're looking for high thread counts, fancy furnishings and concierge service, this is not the hotel for you. If you are looking for clean basic housing that is located in the heart of Times Square at an exceptional value, this is a very nice option. We are already booking next year's adventure and plan to return to the Hotel St. James. More money for the theater and food!	
Nov 28 2006 	excellent location	Everything about this hotel was perfect really. Firstly the price was very competitive. The location perfect. The end of the road one way was all the buzz otf Times Square and in the other the exclusive shopping on Fifth Avenue.The room clean and good with lots of storage, the bathroom clean and new with a shower over the bath.I was very comfortable here.The staff were pleasant and helpful	
Nov 28 2006	we came-we saw-we thoroughly enjoyed!	we needed a hotel with clean rooms-good service-reasonableroom costs-and a good location -we got the whole package-needless to say we recomend the st.james hotel to one&amp;alljoan&amp;tom	
Nov 28 2006 	The worst place I have ever stayed at..	I stayed in NYC at the St. James last November. The hotel is crap. I got there at 1:00 a..m. and did not have the physical strenght to leave immediately so I had to spend one night in. The staff was unfriendly and could hardly speak English (Chinese/Asian). The elevator was an attack to safety and so were the stairs (I am only 33 in perfect shape and exercise regularly). The room was dirty and so were the linens (I had to sleep onto my own towel). The bathroom was the dirtiest ever (cockroaches and lots of other people's hair that wouldn't go down the drain). The only good point the deli next door.Stay at a hostel but not here!	
Nov 25 2006 	great location!	My husband, daughter and I stayed at the hotel from November 18-24th 2006 during the week of thanksgiving to visit our son who lives in new york. We were very close to everything in times square, a short walk to the subway at times square and in the heart of the theatre district. We saw a Broadway play while there and were able to walk to everything we wanted to do. The hotel photos we saw on the internet were pretty accurate. The room we had was clean, and had plenty of storage. Bath was very clean and always had a good supply of hot water, towel, and soap. There is no ice machine, coffee service, or alarm clocks in the room, but the two delis next door had anything you could want to eat, and coffee every morning. Dunhill cafe will even deliver right to your door. It was not a luxury hotel, but at a very expensive time of year to visit, we got a good value.	
Nov 22 2006	This is a good hotel to stay in	11 of us, all girls, are just back from a 4 night stay at the Hotel St James. I had read the reviews before we went and was expecting a dump but it's really, really not. OK, it's not the Ritz but for $208 per person for the entire stay what do you expect? The rooms were above average size with 2 double beds and they were spotlessly clean. The bathroom was a good size and it does have enough towels as well as soap, shampoo and conditioner. You get irons and hairdryers from Reception. There are no safety deposit boxes but they will hold your passport at the front desk if you're worried about carrying it around. The staff were very friendly and were great about giving directions etc. around the city. The Hotel is half a block from Times Square and is in a great location. There is no bar or restaurant in the hotel but there are 2 deli's next door which are great for breakfast and snacks throughout the day, there are also 3 Irish bars on the block which open til 4am and serve food all day. The heating in the Hotel is a bit loud and there are only blinds on the windows, not curtains, but that was the only thing I wasn't happy with. If you're looking for somewhere cheap with a great location that is clean, than this is the Hotel to stay in. All the girls were very happy with our stay and if we go back next year we'll definitely stay there again.	
Nov 18 2006 	Great hotel in a great location at a great price	Having read some of the previous reviews about the St James we were slightly apprehensive about staying there but we both enjoyed our stay considerably. I stayed at the Park Central Hotel last year and the only major difference between the two hotels was in the size of the room. The location of the hotel is great and if you are looking for somewhere to sleep after a hectic day sightseeing this is the perfect hotel.The bathroom was new and there was always an ample supply of hot water and towels. The room had air conditioning and this came in surprisingly useful even in November. I would definately recommend the St James for it's central location and clean and comfortable room.	
Nov 15 2006 	Worst hotel EVER	The Saint James is, without a doubt, the worst hotel I've ever visited. Being a 1.5 star hotel, I was not expecting luxury, and the scratchy sheets (very low thread count), lack of any amenities (no alarm clock, lamps, etc), and general weariness of the room (mismatched worn furniture, etc) did not surprise me. What did surprise me was suspiciously sweet smell of my floor, the lack of any hot water in the morning (read: no shower) and the absurdly rude behavior of the staff. To make a very long (and somewhat surreal) story short, upon informing the 'manager' of the lack of hot water (which caused me to forgo a shower before attending the meeting I was in town for in the first place), I was 1) accused of lying about the hot water shortage (even though the desk clerk I called in the morning confirmed that there was a building-wide problem) 2) accused of being inflexible (I was seriously asked &quot;why couldn't you shower later, at 11 am, when there was hot water?&quot; Well, lady, I was at a meeting!), 3) accused of being a serial de-frauder by the manager ('How do you know other hotels would compensate you for this? You must have a lot of experience complaining at hotels, I am not falling for this'), 4) yelled at by the desk clerk for complaining to the manager in the first place, and 5) upon expressing disbelief that a customer would recieve such absurd service (really, it was verbal harrassment) from the management, was told 'we don't need customers like you anyway.&quot; My advice to any and all potential St James 'customers': stay far, far away... they don't 'need' you anyway, and certainly don't care give two hoots about your comfort and satisfaction.	
Nov 13 2006 	Not Impressed	While our experience with check-in went very smoothly, the lobby was stark. A nearby former lounge on the first floor was torn apart and it looked like it had been in this state for a while. The pictures of the lobby on the website are not an accurate representation of what you really see when you get there. The rooms are by far less impressive. The walls were filthy, the bed spreads worn. The heater would not shut off. The front desk was not helpful when we called about this problem. Our bathing was done very quickly as the water was barely tepid, not warm. We met another guest out front while waiting for a taxi and she said there was no way to plug the tub for a bath. When she called the front desk she was told to jam her wash cloth in the drain. The bathroom looked as though it had been updated recently and was clean. All in all we were just there to sleep so we decided it was adequate, but would not recommend this hotel to friends. Make reservations for dinner well ahead of time if you want to eat in the area!	
Nov 12 2006 	Will Stay at St.James Again !	My sister and I stayed at the St.James hotel the last week of October.We wanted to stay close to TImes Square and this hotel was in an excellent location.We were in New York to see some shows and shop and eat and tour the city, we only needed a hotel to shower and sleep.If you can live without all the &quot;extras&quot; this hotel is for you.We arrived early and got to check into our room right away...before check-in time. We stopped in the deli next door several times for food and snacks..it was perfect. We were close to everything we wanted to do. Last time we stayed in NYC we were too far away to walk to all we wanted to do. This time we only took one cab, and that was back to the airport.We did not witness anything negative about this hotel. It suited our needs perfectly!If you are foo foo and spoiled you may not want to stay here. IF you are needing a place to sleep and change, this place can't be beat for the price! My recommendation is not to stay here so when we come back next year, we won't have problems getting a reservation.	
Nov 9 2006 	Cheap but GREAT!	We just got back to California from 2 nights at the Hotel St. James on 45th St in NYC!The room was the cheapest we could find in the better part of Manhattan and so close to so much! It was clean, renovated, and comfortable.We arrived around 12:00 and they lets us lock our luggage in a room until our hotel room was done. Then again when we checked out but didn't want to leave the city until 3:00.The beds are doubles, not queens. The shower water pressure was great. The bathroom was super clean and I thought it was a good size.The tv was small but how much tv do you really watch when you're in NYC???Bring a towel if you don't want to use theirs, they are small.The only downside to it all was that everytime we walked around the room and then touched eachother or something metal, we were shocked.We did not eat at the deli to the left of the hotel but we ate 2 doors down at the Cranberry Gourmet. It was FABULOUS!!!! (Also try John's pizzeria on 43rd and Broadway (i think).I will deffinately be staying here again when I go back to NY...Hopefully soon!	
Oct 28 2006 	Going back to the St-James Hotel	We stayed at the St-James for one week-end in June 2006. We are going back to NYC during the Christmas vacations and we decided to book the St-James Hotel once again. Considering the awful places we saw on the internet for the same price, it is a safe choice to go to the St-James. The location is perfect and the room is clean enough, no insects or anything like it.	
Oct 28 2006 	Adequate with no frills	At first glance the hotel and our room made us wish we'd stay somewhere else but once we got past the initial feelings, I'd have to say that the accommodations, although spartan, were adequate. There was no alarm clock in the room, one of the overhead light bulbs was burned, a plastic fixture in the elevator was broken and the TV remote did not work. The heating system and the A/C both worked fine. The cafeteria next door was good and the location could not be beat. They provided wake-up service and secured car service for us to the airport. We stayed 5 night and since we basically only stayed in the room to sleep, everything worked out OK.If you are looking for a &quot;no frills&quot; hotel with a great location, I'd recommend it.	
Oct 25 2006 	Not the prettiest but certainly worth the price	Me and three other people went to New York City for the weekend and stayed at this hotel. The price was right and the location was excellent. The hotel doesn't offer anything extra (like a restaurant or coffee) but it certainly feels like it does because you walk out the front door, hang a right, and there are two deli's - right next door. Now for the not so terrific part...The elevators pretty much sucked - real small and took Forever!! And the &quot;maids&quot; came in our room while we were gone although the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign was hanging on our door knob.All in all though, I would definately stay here again. For that price, you can't go wrong. We will ask for the same room we had. We're looking forward to our next trip there!	
Oct 25 2006 	Very pleased!	We usually just come for the day from Massachusetts staying over night in Ct. But this is the second time actually staying in Manhatten. The first time we stayed in a pretty decent hotel with the little extras. but, it was in a bad location. did not feel safe leaving that hotel. when we planned this one, it was a shot in the dark. we had no idea what this hotel was going to be like. we read some reviews and went on that.When we arrived ( before check in time,,,) our room was ready and we were allowed up, we were SO happy! the room was clean. big. and just right. no you don't get the extras, but who cares! your there to have fun. and thats what we did!. there were 4 of us to the room and there was plenty of room. the deli's next door was awesome! Times Square was right down the street and it was so easy to bring packages back to your room when your pooped from caring them. We had a GREAT time and we will definitly stay there again!	
Oct 24 2006 	Better than expected	Hotel location is great. Two Deli shops next door served execellent breakfast at very resonable prices. (approx $4) Hotel is a good choice for people on a buget. It was better than we expected. There was no view from the room we stayed in. I doubt if any rooms had a view. I stayed in room 1210, Very clean. Beds were clean and very firm. Bathroom was missing a piece of tile where the plumbing had been repaired. This is just a very old hotel with no frills. It did have a TV. They did provide shampoos and soap. We had towels but no wash clothes. Great water pressure in shower. Very small, slow elevators, (2) but the building is only 12 floors. You can just run down the steps if you can get a low floor. When I go back for another few days, I will stay there again. I did hear on lady complaining that her room smelled of smoke. Mind did not. If you like old building and don't expect glamor, you will be ok here. It was close to everything. There was parking across the street. We parked one street over on 46th and paid $38 per 24 hour period.	
Oct 24 2006	Great Place and Great Hotel	We stayed in New York for 9 nights! This Hotel was excellent, its basic, lik all u get is a bed, a shower and a TV, but its what you need when your in New York. Its jus off Times Square, the closest, and cheap, the staff are friendly. We left all out clothes, jewellery, gifts, camera, everything there and nothing was stolen, there was renovations ongoion but no-one was ever bothered. This hotel is ideal for people who go out early and come in late.	
Oct 16 2006 	Neat 	For this trip, we had planned on keeping busy around the city, so booked an inexpensive room to leave more money for fun! We read the reviews and thought Hotel St. James would suffice. The location absolutely cannot be beat - steps away from Times Square, Theater District and Radio City Music Hall. A great deli, Cranberry Gourmet, is next door - they advertised a warm oatmeal (with maple brown sugar) breakfast for $2! For a knock-out breakfast, try the almond crusted french toast with strawberry sauce at Sarabeth's at Central Park South!Check-in was quick, and after a 4-hour plane delay, arriving in the city close to midnight was not a problem. Only one key is given (actual key, not electronic card) and you return the key to the front desk as you leave the building - pick up once you return. Room with full bed was clean, although we arrived to an open hotel door with dirty towels in the doorway. Bright green &quot;accent&quot; wall was an eye-opener. Storage was nice (and necessary), as room quickly became tight with two medium-sized suitcases. Surprisingly quiet. Depending on where you stay in building, don't expect to wake up to the sun shining in your eyes. Bathroom was actually quite large for a Manhattan hotel. Newly renovated, so clean tiles/shower. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE of the entire hotel room was in the bathroom - the toilet had an incredibly foul stench of stale urine, although toilet was completely clean. We think this was a larger issue with the hotel's plumbing. Even after flushing, the bathroom would quickly fill with the foul stench. Even pouring some of the FreshScent &quot;body wash/shampoo&quot; provided by the hotel (bring your own toiletries!) into the toilet and flushing, the stench magically reappeared. In order to make the smell bearable, we cracked the bathroom window at night. Towels were on the small side, but did the job.Overall, would recommend this hotel if you're looking for a bed to sleep in at the end of the night. No frills - no iron/ironing board, coffee/coffeemaker, but otherwise, clean and quiet hotel with a fantastic location. For $150/night in Manhattan, definitely worth it.	
Oct 14 2006 	Great Location	I have stayed in New York before and have paid between $120-$300 a night with in Times Square so I was a little worried as to what the hotel would be like for the price we paid and I have to say it was better than the other two hotels. The room was clean (evey day ,and with fresh towels) very quiet.Great location for what we needed.There are a few minor things that need to be looked at,the shower water supply runs hot one second and cold the next, no where to hang towels.We stayed 4 nights and hope to go back again.	
Oct 14 2006 	BEWARE - THEIVES AND POOR SERVICE	We stayed at the Hotel St James in October 2006 for 6 nights. We booked a Queen room but got a room with a tiny double bed with a rock hard matress, 2 thread bare towels (1 drop and they were soaked through) and no soap. The blonde girl at the desk was snobby, abnoxious and rude.On our third night we had personal belongings stolen from our room (brand new clothes and gifts). We immediately reported the theft to the receptionist who suggested we may have left our belongings elsewhere! We told the receptionist we were 100% certain our belongings had been stolen from the room and they suggested we call the police (they didn't even offer to call the police for us). The police arrived at the hotel immediately and informed us that &quot; they do not trust the staff in this hotel&quot; and that &quot;it is not uncommon for goods to be stolen from guests at this hotel.&quot;The hotel never provided us with an apology for the thefts and the blonde girl at the desk continued to insinuate that we must have left our belongings elsewhere!We would not recommend this hotel to anyone.	
Oct 1 2006 	Perfect Location Bare Essentials Wonderful Stay	Spent two nights at the St. James and it was awesome!! Cheap, Clean, Comfort. Don't expect the Ritz!!! Great Deli next door. The staff was super friendly.	
Sep 30 2006 	Ok place amazing location	I stayed at the St James in september 06 with 2 friends of mine. We booked a room with 2 double beds and we got what we wanted. Bathroom was ok, definitely bigger than in most NYC places. Room had a decent size, tv set with about 15 channels and working remote, closet, air conditioner (never turned it on anyway) and enough furniture for our clothes and to sit around. Place was quiet (we were on the 10th floor), not that much of a view from our window. Bathroom and wash stuff was changed everyday with clean ones. Not the cleanest place I've ever been to but we didn't encounter any insects or other living forms while we were there. Incredible location, close to everything (subway station, eateries, 2 different starbucks and everything else in Times Square). Staff was ok too. I'd reccomend this hotel to people who won't spend too much time in their room. Save on the hotel and waste your hard earned $$$ on shopping. You'll be happy when you are back home!	
Sep 25 2006 	Hidden Jewel	Stayed at this hotel three nights during the UN conference. St. James is located on 45th &amp; 6th streets right in the heart of Time Square and we managed to get a reasonable price under $150 when hotel prices are inflated through the roof during this week. We were somewhat leary as it had mixed reviews, it was very clean and comfortable. Staff was excellent and I would recommend this hotel, especially for its location and price. Some of the rooms can be on the small size, so be sure to let front desk know when you make reservation. The Hotel St. James is a hidden jewel. Will definitely stay here again.	
Sep 13 2006 	Was worried but had a great stay	After reading a few so so reviews I was a bit stressed about where to stay. In the end I went for the Hotel St James. Gives myself pats on the back for a top choice. If you are wanting luxury, spacious rooms, mods and cons, go somewhere else. Rooms are small, bed was a touch hard, shower was a bit &quot;different&quot; for a tired aussie girl, but I managed it.. I would have loved a porter when I arrived after a long delayed flight, as my room was 12 floor, but deal with it. The room was terrific for one person, only became a bit squishy when my daughter arrived next day to stay. But we really only were in the room to shower and sleep. You are in New York, a 2 minute wander down to Times Square one way, a 2 minute wander the other way to the Avenue of Americas. It was clean, aircon was great, cupboard space and drawer space plentiful. I was very happy with my choice. The 2 deli's next door serve up a good breakfast/lunch, and Rosie O'Donnells pub serves a great dinner. Loved it and probably stay again if I am lucky enough to get to NY again.	
Sep 5 2006 	Great bargain	After we had booked online we read reviews and were very nervous, but staying there was a delightful surprise. Our rooms for 3 (2 rooms, 3 people each) were HUGE by NYC standards. They were clean, lots of towels, air conditioning - - and, as everyone repeats: GREAT LOCATION. The price was the cheapest for Labor Day weekend we could find, but all 6 of us were happy with the St. James and look forward to staying there again.	
Sep 3 2006 	Great Location 	A friend and I stayed at this hotel Aug. 25-29 2006, and it was great. We were a little concerned due to some mixed reviews from travelers, but had a pleasant experience. This hotel is in a great location! The hotel is in the process of being renovated, but was still nice. I'll pass on the tip that another review provided....call the hotel and ask/reserve a room that has already been renovated. The air conditioner ran great, the rooms were clean, housekeeping came everyday, and the towels weren't as thin as people made them out to be on previous reviews. My friend and I came to NYC to see a Broadway play, do some sight-seeing, and shop. This hotel was perfect for all of that....it was basically right in Times Square, just blocks away from subway/train stations, the Broadway theaters, the double decker tour buses, restaurants, and shops. The cafe shops next door to the hotel are good and are open late. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. My friend and I just wanted a nice, clean place to sleep that was close to everything, as we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room, and this hotel provided just that. It is definitely the best kept secret in NYC as one person said in their review. Another tip: To/From LGA airport the Super Shuttle or AirLink Shuttle will bring you right to this hotel for approx. $15pp in a 9 person shared shuttle van.	
Aug 24 2006	Couldn't have asked for anything better!!!!!!!!	I stayed at this hotel last week from the 17-20 of August. The hotel is nice and in the process of being renovated. The room we stayed in was basic, no frills or perks. The bathroom and the beds/bedsheets were clean. The air was cold and housekeeping came to clean at 10 a.m. sharp. The front desk people were cordial and offered a place to leave our bags when we checked out and weren't leaving until later in the afternoon. If you are looking for an inexpensive, clean and basic place to stay because you would rather spend your money on more important things like: shopping, shows and food this is your kind of hotel...if not go stay at the Ritz.	
Aug 11 2006 	Not as bad as you think	We got there at 7:00 in the morning, so we had the fear that our room was not ready. But it was! When we tried to open the door, it didn't worked. There was a trick to opened it. The room was clean, with air conditioned, a small color tv with no remote controller. the bathroom was ok. The windows were facing a wall. The bed was confortable. There was 2 pieces of soap, with plastic glass, and shampoo with conditionner. But bring yours... And the towels were not that thin. (I have read about that in an another review)The location was great, only 2 min from time square, 5 from rockerfeller center and 10 from empire state. On foot!You can also eat very well at the 2 delis beside the hotel. The cranberry and the dunhill. It's cheap and not so bad.	
Aug 2 2006	Could have been a lot worst...	At first I was really worried about staying in a one and a half star hotel, but after reading the reviews, my friends and I decided to take a chance because it was the cheapest at the time and the location was great. When we got there, it was under renovation, so the big trash can in front of the building made it look like a true 1 star hotel. One of the staffs at checkin was nice and the other one (blonde) was some what rude. We got a room on the 10th floor. The elevator took forever but still functional. Our room was surprisingly clean and I was very impressed with the new bathroom. However, right before we checked out, I spotted a roach on my bed so my friends were a bit grossed out by it. But, given the location and the price, it's worth it if you can't find a better deal.	
Jul 6 2006	A Fabulous Time!	We had a super time throughout our duration. The hotel is 30 seconds from the heart of Time Square - who could ask for anything more?! The rooms were clean and the staff were extremly helpful.We will definetly stay here on our next visit.	
Jun 29 2006	Poor Service	Arrived Friday 9 June 2006.No assistance with baggage.Could only shower bath had no plug.On Sunday room not cleanedNo fresh linen provided.Beds not made up.Complained about the above on two occassions and received an arrogant attitude.None of above was sorted out.Had to leave 05:30am Monday.No hot water.Complained again.Was told I should have read notice @ reception desk.I definitely saw none.They could have informed us.Once again a poor attitude was displayed by the staff on duty and no apology given.I would not go back there again.This is such a pity as it is in a great location.NB I had prepaid after booking online via roomproviders	
May 24 2006	Frustrating Experience	We had 2-night confirmations to the St. James over a month ago through a 3rd party provider. When we got there, we were told that the hotel had been overbooked and because we didn't book with them directly, it wasn't their fault. (We eventually ended up staying elsewhere.)Here's what we did experience:When you first enter, there is a glass enclosure where travellers can leave their belongings if they arrive early. From what we can tell, it's not a safe place to put it. The bags are not tagged or identified. You leave them there, you pick them up there. We did not see any sort of security.The 1 person at the front desk was not helpful. He was just doing his job, but beyond that, you won't find much &quot;customer service&quot;. His answer to our questions was &quot;I don't know....&quot; or &quot;I have no idea....&quot;The lobby was clean, but definitely not fancy and the lighting was dim. The restrooms were clean, but definitely old. The elevator we saw was old and very slow. If you're on a budget and actually get a room when you check in, it may be an okay place to stay. But based on the poor service we got at reception, we would not book this hotel again.	
May 23 2006	Awesome Times Square location - who knew a one star would be this good	First of all, this is a one star no frills hotel. Saying that, it was very clean, with a new washroom and a very quiet location. The location to Times Square cannot be beat, within 1min of walking you are at the centre of it all. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap place to stay, who are not looking for a name brand hotel. I read all the reviews before booking this hotel and I was very surprised by what I got. Clean, quiet and near everything, you can't beat that for the price. Like the other reviews have said, the deli next door is fantastic, excellent breakfast and sandwiches. I will definitely stay there again whenever I get the chance to visit New York. P.S. There are face towels in the bathrooms!	
May 23 2006	Luxurious....no but Great location and value	Went to NYC with my husband from May 11 - 14. We stayed at the Hotel St. James. I was skeptical when booking because the price was so good for the location. I went in knowing it wouldn't be luxurious, so that prepared me. It honestly was clean and I felt safe. The housekeeper was very nice and friendly. We stayed on the 5th floor and our room was totally fine. The only things are that the towels are VERY thin and you need to bring your own shampoo, but big deal. Again..cheap for the awesome location. You are in VERY close walking distance to Time Square (1/2 block and maybe a block or so from the Theatre District). There are also a few pubs close to the hotel and a couple good delis. I would stay here again.	
May 12 2006	Great Option!!!!	Not only for travellers on a budget but all kinds of travellers. You get a clean (remodeled room) with an EXCELLENT LOCATION (just one block away of Times Square between de 6th and the 7th). No shared bathrooms or rooms at a very accesible price (lower than all the hostels I cheked!).	
May 9 2006 	You wanted cheap cheap is what you get.	Had to leave our luggage because we got there early. They have a glassed in room next to the desk and you leave your luggage there with no checks or tags or a guard or anything. Someone is supposedly always at the desk. The rooms are very small. We called ahead to see if there was a hair dryer in the room and Carmen at the front desk said yes, but when we got there, there weren't any in the rooms, though you can get one at the desk. They have irons available at the front desk, but no ironing boards. There is no shampoo or lotion in the room, so bring your own. The towels are very small and not at all soft, reminds me of a Motel 6. One of our party had his cord to the airconditioner stuck through the bathroom door so that he couldn't really shut the door. Two rooms in our party had a steam pipe that you had to reach around to get to the toilet paper, which when we first got there, was hot (they turned the steam off.)The beds slept very well. When there weren't any wash cloths in the room, we called the desk and they brought them right up. The wake up call was 15 minutes late.There are no ice machines, drink machines or snack machines, but there are two excellent deli's right next door.But, after all, this is New York. We travel there often and this is not the worst hotel we have had. The location is wonderful and since you don't spend much time in your room, we managed. The rates were $169 when we went and for New York, that is great, but I would have at the least expected an ice machine!!!!!We will not stay there again.	
May 1 2006	Great Location!!!	We stayed in the Hotel 4 nights. The Location is really great about half a minute walk from the Times Square. That was extremely important! We found a visitor Information for tourist in Times Square and it was very helpful. The Room was clean and good enough if you don't expect a fancy place. We traveled a lot and stayed in the room at nights. The staff was OK.We paid an excellent price of 145$ + tax per night for a room with 2 double beds. The Hotel allowed an early check - in 8AM for no charge. Ask for renovated room.	
Apr 13 2006	You get what you pay for	We read the reviews before we booked this hotel, plus we also knew it was only a 2 star hotel to begin with - so we didn't expect too much. I must honestly say that the hotel DID provide exactly what I was looking for - a clean comfortable bed, a clean bathroom, a convenient location, and of course a good price. Most of the hotel staff seemed pretty nice, except there was one front desk clerk who was very rude. He was an Asian guy in his mid-twenties/early thirties who appeared to only work weekends. He was a real ass.I would suggest you request a room on the back of the hotel, because of the noise problems. On our first night we stayed in a room on the front, and it was terrible. The room had a window air conditioner, and you could hear the never-ending taxi horns all night and there are also 2 Irish pubs nearby, and the drunks got pretty loud too. The second night we moved to the back and it was so much better. On the back you get a really lousy view of another building, and you get to hear the air conditioning units run all night long, but at least it was a &quot;peaceful&quot; constant noise. It's only a 12 story hotel, so there wasn't much of a view anyway. The only other noise we heard was the clicking sound of the hot water heated radiators - which was sort of strange the first time you heard it, but then you got used to it.The bath towels were not very soft at all, or very large, but they were clean, and the maids did a good job supplying fresh ones every day. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom, so the mirror fogs up.The television reception was horrible. I know....I know - who goes to NYC to watch TV? We had a couple cold rainy days, and at the end of the day it would have been nice to relax and watch a little TV. They only got 3 or 4 channels. You could &quot;view&quot; up to 10 channels, but most of them had really bad reception or sound problems. Really pathetic.My wife had injured her leg and we needed some ice to bring the swelling down. Too bad - St. James does not have any ice. St. James basically has no frills whatsoever. Just a place to sleep, and thats about it.I read somebody else's review, where they were complaining about blood stains and insects - sorry, but this guy sounds like a total whack-job. We never saw any of that. I guess anyone on a budget may find this place acceptable, but I think next time we come to NYC we are gonna spend a little more on the room. Having a nice home away from home always makes your vacation so much more enjoyable. This place needs to be improved.	
Apr 3 2006	A steal off Times Square	A great deal if you don't plan on spending too much time in your room. It's not the Ritz Carlton, but we were pleasantly surprised at how clean it was. Just a block off Times Square, you can't ask for a better location. $150/night + tax for a room with one queen bed, TV, AC, dresser. All rooms are now renovated, but we wish they would have added insulation to the walls! That's really our only complaint, but if you get good quiet neighbors it's a quaint little hotel. We would definitely return.Pros: location, price, new bathroomsCons: no parking, thin walls	
Mar 22 2006	What a Value!	Just a quick blip to those in search of cheap digs in New York. I was almost gonna cancel my trip after every rate I was quoted exceeded my budget of $180 per night. One of the hotels I had called was sold out and recommended a place called Hotelconxions (yeah it's spelt that way)! They recommended the St James Hotel which they told me was the best deal in New York and clean. I really didn't expect much at a price of $159 for 2! Nice surprise. Spacious, clean, affordable and a midtown location. Would recommend Hotelconxions and of course the St James Hotel.	
Mar 20 2006	Cool bit of trivia on the St. James...	The hotel isn's as bad as it used to be. The renovations are a definite improvement, especially considering that this is the same hotel that Tom Hanks' character in the movie &quot;Big&quot; moved into when he first became an adult.	
Mar 19 2006	Great location	My daughters and I spent 3 nights and had no problems. Had read the reviews, so I took my own wash cloths, coffee maker, shampoo, hair dryer etc. The radiator heat was sort of noisy but warm and after the first night we didn't even notice the sounds. Plenty of clean towels every day, the daily housekeeping was fine-we were careful to leave tips each day! We asked for and got a &quot;refurbished&quot; room, but the carpet was not refurbished-very worn. There were rolls of new carpet in the lobby, so perhaps that is coming next. The room and halls smelled fine-we were on the 7th floor. The TV had no remote, but we could get several stations. We were looking for a clean place to sleep near the theater district, which is what the St. James is-less than one block from Times Square. Not fancy, but cheap for NYC.	
Mar 19 2006	Try it and see how nice it is	We're looking at a return visit to New York in a couple of months, and I couldn't believe there were so many negative comments on this hotel. We were there with our daughter, son-in-law, and 2 grandsons in May of 2004 (just noticed my daughter wrote a review about the 15th of May 2004). It is an old hotel, but the price was so great. The big name hotels can be $300-$500 a night on Times Square. Hotel St. James is just a few short blocks away, and I agree with one of the reviewers about the deli next door. They had excellent food and we just took it back to the room. We had lots of other places to see, and the subway is just around the corner. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and adequate. Not great, but totally adequate. Sure the elevator was slow, but who was in a rush? Not us. As we were checking out they were getting new air conditioners delivered, so that has to make it better for the summer visitors. If we really do make it to New York the end of May, I certainly will be looking at staying at the Hotel St. James again.	
Feb 27 2006	Terrible Dump	WOW, I am shocked to see good reviews of this hotel. It was truly a DUMP. We had a large party so we rented 3 rooms, I didn't get to jsut see one DUMP.My first impression wasn't so bad. the lobby looked like any other hostel you'll stay in, clean and kinda neat. The clerks were behind glass, for their safety. Typical in NYC.I headed to the room and oh my. The first room I went to we couldn't get the door open. We tried using the key and it wouldn't work. As we pulled the key out, well teh door knob came off as well. Once inside the room it looked as if someone had been murdered. It was nasty, stained on the walls, floors and the blinds. The blinds were ripped to pieces and hanging there, no privacy thorugh them at all. The second room was just as bad. Stains everywehre and the biggest problem a LARGE whole in the ceiling that was stuffeed with plastic bags!!!THe third room &quot;appeared&quot; to be ok. Until about 3 am when a loud banging started happeneing in the floor in the bathroom. As I got up to inspect the floor was so hot it burnt your feet. Im shocked I didn't have shoes on anyhow, it was nasty. The floor was so hot to the touch you ahd to put on shoes. NOt sure what that was about, btut aht tile was HOT. When the lights were turned on BUGS scattered acrosst he room and even out of the bed. I will never return to this place, it is terrible and I do NOT reccomend it to anyone looking for a cheap place to stay.	
Feb 26 2006	Great price for a geat location!	I stayed at St. James Hotel last week and I must say I can highly recommend it. There were three of us on a shopping trip so we weren't looking for luxury as we weren't planning on spending too much time in the room! On arrival we were met by a friendly receptionist and checked in quickly. I had requested a renovated non smoking room with 2 double beds (most rooms seem to be renovated by now, but request one just in case)The room was fine, spotlessly clean, new beds, comfy pillows and the bathroom with powerful shower was also in pristine condition. It was on the 7th floor and very quiet at night despite the fact that Times Square was a 30 second walk away! The location cannot be beaten and neither the price. We paid EUR330 in total for 3 nights, EUR110 each! Got to see 2 shows as we were so near the ticket booths to queue for half price tickets. There are 2 deli's right next door to the hotel for breakfast, huge choice and very reasonable.When we checked out, the staff allowed us to leave our bags until 7pm when we returned....at no charge! I have been charged alot for this service in other hotels. I am definitely returning to St. James, already booked it for our Christmas shopping trip.	
Feb 5 2006	Really Not So Bad At All!!	My best friend and I were celebrating her birthday in NYC. We had tickets to Pajama Game and wanted a good deal on a hotel so we could enjoy the City for the night without husbands and kids. I booked the hotel after reading some horrible reviews. So I went into it expecting the worst and figuring if it was so bad, we would stay elsewhere that night. I got into the City a couple of hours before check-in time so I could take a look around just in case we had to jump ship!! I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the lobby mostly renovated. Yes, there are two areas in the lobby that are still under construction, but it certainly was not a turn-off. I figured I would have to wait to check in since I was there so ahead of time, but they gave me the key immediately, and I headed up to the 6th floor to Room 614. Elevators where a little slow, but so what, it's an old building. They were clean and escalated upward smoothly. The hallway had a little bit of a stale smoke smell but nothing too offensive!! I entered the room a little nervously and was again pleasantly surprised at the condition. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, new white tiles, new pedestal sink, new toilet and clean shower!! The living area was spacious with a faux fireplace, clean carpeting, clean sheets and bedspread and freshly painted walls. There was plenty of storage for clothing as well with an armoire, dresser and nightstand. The television looked brand new and worked just fine. The bed itself was nice and firm; probably near new. The pillows were horrible.....so what though....just ask for some additional ones!! We felt very safe as well. Locks on the doors worked just fine. It was very quiet during the night. We slept soundly and never heard any other guests or noises from the elevators. The only real offensive thing was a large garbage bag in the hallway that was left for guests to dump their garbage into. It sat there all day into the evening. So we decided to take it upon ourselves to send the garbage on a ride into the elevator to the first floor!! We figured that once it got down there and the elevator door opened someone at the front desk would get the picture!! The location of the hotel was amazing!! You are right there in Times Square, right in the middle of the theater district, access to some great restaurants and shopping. You will probably run into the &quot;Naked Cowboy&quot; who is spotted walking around the streets of NYC in just cowboy boots, underwear and a cowboy hat!! It is a 15 minute walk from Penn Station to the hotel. You can hit Macy's on the way. We dined at Trattoria TreColori which is right on the same block as the hotel. We had no idea when walking in that the restaurant is so well-known and absolutely delicious!! Not pricey at all. We shared an appetizer, salad and each had a delicious entree for $54 which included tax. It was a friendly place, could be romantic...really perfect for dining with a special person. There are two great delis right next door to the hotel...Dunhill Cafe (I had lunch there) and Cranberry Deli (We had breakfast there the next morning). Great food and amazingly inexpensive. We got pedicures around the block at Vogue Nails (46th between 5th &amp; 6th). Definitely a girly weekend!! Would I stay there again????? ABSOLUTELY. In fact, I will be bringing my two girls in for a weekend and staying there again.	
Jan 11 2006	Pleasantly Surprised !!	Went to NYC for New Years, with the entire family, (wife, four children, brother and future sister in law).Upon reaching the hotel, we became nervous because there was no sign outside, obvious remodeling in the lobby and elevators very small.However, it became wonderful afterwards.The staff was extremely nice and the rooms were surprisingly large with comfortable beds.What really made the hotel fantastic was its LOCATION, it is a short walk from Time Square, 5th Ave, Broadway, and Bryant Park.For New Years we were right there for the festivities....priceless.We spent 6 days/5 nites from the 12/28/05-1/2/2006 and was a bargain.Best trip we have taken in a while, due in part to the St James.	
Jan 5 2006	Great for the $ you spend - great location	Three Ladies stayed at this hotel. We came to shop &amp; catch some shows.We were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness and the size of the room. We were apprehensive at some of the reviews but were pleasantly surprised. There aren't many extras but the staff was friendly and helpful and tried to accommodate us. We were within a block of Times Square and found ourselves walking a lot more than we had planned because of the great location. We felt very safe and were able to see extra shows because of the price. There are 2 coffee shop/delicatessans next door and a great Irish pub just a few doors down. Everything you could possibly need. Great people to work with.	
Jan 1 2006	New Years Eve we stayed and my God!	We needed a cheap place to stay (my husband and I) on NEw Years Eve and boy did we get it. We got a room on the 3rd floor and learned w/help that there is a &quot;trick&quot; to unlocking the door w/the key.We finally got in the room and it was the size of a box. It smelled and the bathroom was gross to the point I refused to shower the next morning till we got home.They had the vaccuum going in the hallway at 9 am on New years day in the hallway and it soundedlike a train coming though. Plus, I don't know what they were vaccuming cause the place is a dump!Also, u cannot control the heat in the room and my husband and I almost wanted to die during the night. It was like a sauna and honestly had to be almost 80 degrees in there.Would I ever stay again? NO!	
Dec 31 2005	Not near as bad as we had feared from some reviews.	We stayed for 5 days the first of Dec. and I pretty much have the same review as one before me titled, &quot;St. James was just what we wanted&quot;. It is an old hotel but for the money you can't beat it. One thing I will advice you of is, if possible get a room away from the elevators, they are a little noisey. We were only in our room to sleep at night so it was plenty good enough. What can you say about the location, it's perfect if you want to feel the pulse of the city. 1 &amp; 1/2 blocks from 5th ave, subway a short walk away, deli next door, couple blocks from restauarnt row. We did eat dinner at Friday's in Time Square and we both agreed it was one of the worst steak dinners we had ever had(the worst considering the price we paid for it). St James Hotel bathroom was clean, fresh towels and bed linen everyday. NO BEDBUGS which I have heard rumor that NYC is battling. Room was decent sized with 2 double beds. Our only real complaint and I felt that it was a big enough one to cause me to stay elsewhere in May when I go back with my son is, that our room #411 had no dresser. Only a small closet that you almost couldn't get open far enough because of the bed. Not even a luggage rack. When we asked about a dresser we were informed that they didn't have any. Maybe when they finish renovating they will. I would definetly stay there again if I could get my clothes out of a suitcase. For one or two days it's not a big deal but for 5 or 6 it is. You have to remember this is a &quot;Budget&quot; hotel and if you keep that in mind I think you won't be dissapointed. We weren't (except for the dresser.)	
Dec 24 2005	St. James was just what we wanted	A last minute whirlwind trip to New York had me searching for a budget hotel the last weekend before Christmas. Looking through mixed reviews of budget hotels, we settled on the St. James. We are 2 women who are flirting with 50,like to have fun, and have champagne tastes on a beer budget. We were looking for something clean, safe and close to Times Square.I made reservations directly with the hotel, getting a rate of $145 per night for a Thursday and Friday stay. This was $15 lower than quoted on Expedia, Travelocity, etc. We drove (YIKES!) into New York City at 2:00pm on Thursday afternoon. Right down 42nd Street and through Times Square. Found the Saint James pretty easily by their address, though they had no sign. A little intimidated by just stopping traffic to unload and check in, so we pulled into a lot about 1/2 block down the street, where they let us park for 1/2 hour so we could check in. Check in went quickly and we were in the room in just a few minutes. The lobby was ok, it looked like they may be trying to add a little lounge in the back. Two very small elevators, one with lights in the ceiling that made it like a sauna, but they arrived quickly with no problems. This hotel is very old, and the hallways reflected this, but they were clean. Our room was a good size for New York City, with one queen sized bed, and even a fireplace, non-working of course, but it gave the room some charm. The furniture was new but simple, and the carpet and linens were clean.The bathroom was a decent size, and clean as well. This hotel was no frills, but turned out to be exactly what we were looking for. In the short block we walked to get to the middle of Times Square, there was a great Irish pub called O'Lunneys, where we had a light meal of soup and a smoked salmon appetizer that was wonderful. Also on our block was the Trattoria Trecolori, a small Italian restaurant with WONDERFUL food! This was our &quot;splurge&quot; dinner. We each had a glass of wine. My friend had the clams casino, and I had an amazing carpaccio. For our entree, we shared an order of carbonara, which they split for us in the kitchen. I cannot begin to say how good this meal was. Our bill for 2 including tip was only $70. All the wait staff and the manager were very gracious and friendly. Also right next to the hotel was the Cranberry Deli, where you could pick up anything from bottled water and pop, to great looking breakfast and lunch sandwiches made to order. The best part of the deli was in the back where they had a beautiful salad bar and hot food buffet. It was beautifully presented, and was available for carry out. All in all, we had a wonderful time. Right down the block to Times Square, hop on the subway, and we were in Chinatown and Little Italy in no time. An easy walk to both Rockefeller Center and the Theater district. If you are looking for a budget hotel, close to the action, this is it. The one drawback was no close parking. We parked about 2 blocks away, and were lucky to find a garage for $38 per night. We worked this out with only a little hassle, as 2 garages turned us away, because they didn't have an &quot;agreement&quot; with the St. James. Loved our stay and will be going back next year!	
Dec 20 2005	Like home!!!!!!!	My 3 friends and I stayed at the St. James Hotel on December. After reading the reviews, we were kind of scary. Our first impression of the hotel was so pleasant. Yes, it is a budget hotel undergoing renovation. The reception girls were just so wonderful. When you get to the front desk you'll see two ladies (Margaret and Carmen), They make you feel so cozy, specially the spanish one, with that bright smile all the time. The staff tries to make you happy at all times.You were given a room with two double beds, on the 5th floor, #502. A very clean and cozy room. Comfortable enough for all of us.So, if you really want to stay in the middle of the action of time square, and being aroung a family sort of style place, go to the St. James. Very convenient location and great deal for this season. You cannot expect to pay little and get the accomodations of the St. Regis. No way!!!!.So, we were quite pleasant with the hotel location, great and happy stuff, very clean. Very suitable for our budget . We will stay there again.	
Dec 19 2005	Can't beat the location and the price	What do you get for $150? At the St. James, a clean new bathroom and a relatively comfortable bed in a room with little space for any other than that bed and the dresser. The staff was friendly and helpful; the lobby looked pretty good half-way through renovation. But the real value is location. Situated 1/2 a block east of Times Square and a few blocks from Bryant Park and the New York Public Library, you can't miss, just as long as you plan on spending a limited time in your room.	
Dec 15 2005	Quite a pleasant surprise	My wife and myself stayed at the St James for three nights in mid-Decmber. After reading some of the reviews we were worried about the place but this is a busy time of year and the rooms were really cheap. However, we were given a room on the 10th floor which was a really good size. The bed linen was clean and we got clean towels everyday. The room was lovely and warm and also surprisingly quiet given the Hotel's location. The room had a TV, built-in wardrode and en-suite Bath/Shower/WC but not much else - not even a kettle for making a drink. The plumbing was quite interesting as it seemed a bit of a lottery if the water was hot, cold or tepid but it didn't cause us any real problems and we both showered everyday without any real dramas - although the shower controls remain a bit of a mystery to me.The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful and the Hotel's location is absolutely first class - turn onto 45th at Planet Hollywood in Times Square and you're there!There is still quite a lot of work going on so I guess you could find things a bit noisy in parts of the Hotel during working hours. We left the room first thing every morning and didn't get back until late at night so it wouldn't have bothered us anyway.Overall an OK Hotel at a very good price - I don't know if I'd like to spend a week there though!	
Dec 9 2005	very bad..dirrty rankdark and loud	I stayed ther with my boyfriend. we are both between 21 and 24 years old and we don't need a lot of luxury 'cause we are most of the time outside. but It was horrible! the toilettes overflowed 3 times in 3 days. the room was during the day still dark and smelled very bad! stay away from this place!	
Nov 21 2005 	Horrible place to stay. Please be aware!	I stayed at the St. james Hotel on 109 West 45th St in New York for one night due to a meeting I had the next morning in the area. I started my shower that morning and the water was very slow and minimum. I started to put shampoo and soap on and the water just stopped-Yes as I was drenched in soap everywhere 2 hours before my meeting. I had to call the front desk to see what was going on. They informed me a pipe broke and we will have no hot water for a few hours. I then told them I would have cold water just to wash off, but ALL the water was gone in the shower. I then asked them could I try a shower in another room just to check. They sent the maid up for access to the room across the hall-but again that shower was dead. I went back to my room and had NO choice but to use the little bit of freezing cold water that was dripping from the bathroom sink. This was so horrible, especially being a woman (that time of the month) with a meeting in less than 2 hours away. When I left I asked to speak with the manager to demand somekind of refund, since I was there solely for a meeting the next day. He would only give me a $25 discount and NEVER even apologized for my inconvenience. I was shocked to say the least. he said to me &quot;What do you want me to do fix the piping in NYC myself&quot;. I still cannot believe their attitude to a new customer. Please be aware of this hotel and stay somewhere else if you can!	
Nov 15 2005	Fanastic value for money would go again!	I stayed here for two nights in november with my mum and aunt. This hotel has an amazing location and has two great irish bars right next door. This is my third visit to new york, an this hotel was by far the best, yes it is under renovation but its clean an very central, and who spends time in their room when they are in new york!Ive been watching the reviews on this hotel ten months before i travelled and some people complain about the silliest things, trust me i travell all over the world and this hotel is great for what you need it for.	
Oct 31 2005	Great hotel Great Value. Would definitely stay again.	I save my money and take two really cool trips each year to exciting places in the world. I am not a rich man, nor am I a really cheap person who only considers price when choosing a hotel. I travel to DO things in the places I go, and my criteria for what makes an excellent hotel might be different from yours. These are the things I value in the places I go:SAFETYI absolutely must feel that my person and my belongings are safe or I will immediately switch hotels. The St. James Hotel came through excellently in this regard. There were lots of other tourists staying here from all over the world. My room was quiet and felt very safe. During the night, there are two large males sitting in the lobby and checking out who gets into the building. Very safe. The door did not have any extra kinds of locks on it, nor a sliding chain or such device, but I dont really think it was necessary. A maid entered every day and cleaned the room, but nothing was out of order at all. My girlfriend left her gold necklace sitting on the nightstand one day and when we returned late at night, the room was cleaned by the maid and the necklace was still sitting right where she left it. There was no room safe, but we did not travel with lots of valuables. Naturally, we kept all our cash on our persons at all times. We stayed out very late a number of times, walking around until the wee hours of the morning, and all the streets in every direction around the hotel felt very safe and non-threatening. LOCATIONI go places to do things, not sit in the room and there is PLENTY to do near the St. James. Times Square is a five minute walk down the road. There are hundreds of restaurants, theaters, bars, and nightclubs within blocks, and the streets are safe to walk. There are lots of subway entrances nearby, for longer excursions. Once you see how easy and safe the subways are to use, you wont use cabs any more and youll save yourself lots of money. This hotel is smack dab in the middle of so much. We stayed 5 nights and could have easily stayed 5 more because there was so much to do and see. I require lots of coffee in the morning and I hate Starbucks, and there are two delis right next door for good, cheap coffee. Theres also a Starbucks on the same street as the hotel for those of you who like that place. The location of the hotel cannot be beat.PRICEThe price was extremely reasonable, which youll see if you do some research on hotels in the area. If youre like me, all you need is a clean bed and a shower, and this hotel had both. I dont even need a TV, although the room did have one. Its bare bones here. Theres no room service, nobody carried our bags up to the room. There were two little bars of soap and four towels provided, thats it. Our room had no view to speak of, and faced the back away from the street. The carpets were clean, the bathroom was clean, the sheets were clean every day. It was quiet; no partiers all night long, and we had no construction noise, which some reviewers on this site said they had. I estimate I saved about $1,000 for my five nights here, which gave me plenty of money to go to two fabulous musicals, a jazz combo at Birdland, a cabaret show at the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel (highly recommended), a great dinner every night, and a dinner cruise around the southern tip of Manhattan to the Statue of Liberty. Not to mention dancing in some terrific nightclubs. All that great stuff because I did not have little shampoo bottles and fancy bottles of lotion. This hotel was a GREAT value.SERVICECant say much here because I really never spoke to anyone beyond checking in and checking out. I already knew from research on the net where I wanted to go and how to get there. My feeling is, however, that they would have helped me with anything if I had asked. The maid did a great job on our room every day.I was extremely pleased with this hotel and would stay again. There is so much we did not get to do, I know well go back. Write me if you wish to know something more specific. Id love to help if I can.	
Oct 25 2005	Location Location Location Want 5 Star? Pay for it!	I was really worried after reading reviews on this site but after finding we would be guaranteed a renovated room if we booked through hotel conxions I thought the risk was worth taking considering we would be £200 under budget and our other choice of hotel had increased by £200.What you need to remember with New York is if you want a perfect hotel you have to pay 5 star prices.This hotel is 200 yards from Times Square - come on for this price you have to expect it to be nowhere near perfect.Our room was a renovated room and whilst some parts seemed a little unfinished it was still clean and presentable. Towels were fine (I took my own after seeing they were said to be hard on another review)The negativesRoom faced a brick wall - we didnt care, it meant no traffic noise and we spent so little time in our room that we really did not care.Air conditoning unit was noisy but we were so tired we slept through it.NO SAFE!!! My one priority - their safe was not working and they were not allowed to keep cash and jewellry in their personal one - a bit worrying when you have over $1000 in cash!I agree with the many regarding the deli's - there are 2 next door and both were great - especially the muffins from the one exactly next door!I have given neautral review only because at the end of the day it is not 5 star and excelent review is what i would expect to give a 5 star. Please dont take this as a negative though - it has top marks from me.THINK ABOUT IT - You are in New York to go out, you need money to do this - I would rather have a cheaper ok hotel than somewhere ultra lush and expensive where I would have to end up staying in because i'd have no money for going out!!!	
Oct 24 2005	St.James Hotel-great location/value	Location, Location, location--can't beat the St.James!!! It's half a block off Times Square with two great deli's right next door. Bus and subway both closeby. As in other reviews, yes, the hotel is under going the rennovations, but it is very clean, the bathroom was new and the mattresses were also new. We had a room with two double beds(for 3 of us) that was plenty spacious &amp; quiet(we were not facing 45th St). The elevators were both always in working order with little wait. This building is old--but we are talking NYC--most are old!! No, this is not the Ritz Carlton but who wants to spend $500 for a hotel room just to sleep in!!! We went to see the sites of NYC and didn't spend much time in our room. We found the St. James staff to be very friendly and helpful, especially Carmin and even met Betty, one of the owners. We had a great time and good memories of our trip. Without hesitation we would return to the St.James Hotel tomorrow!!!(There Oct.13-21)	
Oct 23 2005	Good enough!	We didn't have much choice, having to pin down a 12-night stay at reasonable price and at very short notice, but we do not regret staying at the St James.Our room was small and basic, but everything worked and it was well serviced every day. Location cannot be beaten, and the Cranberry Gourmet next door offers reasonable food and drink and (importantly) a quiet place to sit and talk, so there was no need to stay in the room other than to sleep. There are of course a zillion good bars and restaurants within an easy stroll.If you want luxury go somewhere else, and pay for it. But if you want the basics in the heart of Midtown at an affordable price the St James is certainly an option	
Oct 19 2005	Don't go there	I requested a room with 2 double beds, got a room with one double bed. It was very small, the bed was very hard and the pillows were very flat! We did get 2 extra pillows. There was no restaurant, so no room service as advertised. There was no ice machine, so we had to buy cups of ice from a store two doors down. We had to flip a coin every morning to see who got to take a warm shower. The loser had a cool shower. Only bath towels were available-very thin. There were no hand towels and no wash cloths at all. The carpets were stained and the elevators were rickety. The only hotel staff that was friendlyt were the housekeepers. All in all, not a pleasant stay.	
Oct 19 2005	Not that bad.	I stayed at Hotel St. James the night of my bachelorette party, I was expecting it to be horrible because of the reviews. It really wasn't that bad, the price is great compared to other hotels. We only stayed one night, and barely were in the room. We found the front desk people to be very nice and helpful too! I would not stay here if I were planning on being in the room a lot or staying for longer than a couple of nights. But for poeple who will not be in their room a lot-it is cheap, safe, and in a great location. I would go back (p.s. us girls who stayed there have high standards too! )	
Oct 17 2005	Know what to expect and be prepared	My wife and I stayed at the St James on Sat, 10/15. We got an internet rate of $190 plus tax for a standard room with a queen size bed. I called the hotel a few days before to confirm the reservation plus I asked for a newly renovated room. The phone# was hard to find but I found it: (---) or (---). We checked in at 2 PM and got a newly renovated room w/queen size bed on the 11th floor (room 1111). The room was basic, but clean. We are experienced New York tourists and have stayed in many 4-star hotels in Manhattan before but we did not want to spend $400/night so we tried the St. James. We knew what to expect with the St James - just a basic room only steps away from Times Square. We brought our own towels as I read other posts about the poor quality of the hotel's towels. The bed does not have a mattress pad, so you might want to bring a spare sheet to place on top of the hotel's bed sheet. There was only one chair in the room so I used the night stand as another chair so we could sit at the small table and drink the bottle of Crown Royal that we brought to celebrate our Anniversary. There is a small deli right next to the hotel which was good for ice (a plastic bag full for $2), sodas, snacks, and breakfast sandwiches. There is a new Irish Bar called O'Lunney's down the street which was very good and reasonably priced (had lunch there - chicken marsala and chicken pot pie for $14 each). We had an early dinner at an Italian place around the corner: Oslo al Doge. The food was very good and not outrageouly priced. We saw Phantom of the Opera with half-priced tickets purchased from the TKTS booth on Times Square.All in all, we would return to the St James. I think that the difference between our experience and other's was that we knew what to expect, we were prepared, and we called ahead and got a newly renovated room.	
Oct 16 2005	Gross!	True, this hotel has a great location but that is it! I understand this hotel is very old and is undergoing renovations but that is no excuse. The rooms are dirty and dingy. I went with a group that had three seperate rooms and each was worse than the next. Stains on walls and carpets, cheap sheets, loud window-unit air conditioners and elevators that are very scary to ride are just a few examples. Staff is very rude and not helpful at all. Each room is only given one room key so good luck if you plan on seperating with the person you are sharing your room with. If you can afford to play in New York City than you can afford to pay more money and stay somewhere else or stay just outside Times Square and take public transportation or a cab into the city. You will be much happier.	
Oct 15 2005	Dump!!!	Expect zilch, I booked this hotel via hotels and paid $200 inc taxes, never again, service was poor, elevator [--] and the rooms were extremely sparse	
Oct 13 2005	worth an smile	My girlfriend and I stayed at the St. james during the weekend. We got what we expected, according to what we have paid for. A standard one star hotel, in the middle of time square, a great and convenient location for an excellent price.They are undergoing some renovation, but no worries.I do not understand all the hassle, some former fussy guest are making.Everything was nice and smooth from the check in; front desk girl just terrific, very kind, and making us feel confortable all the time. The staff was helpful anytime we need it.I think this is a great budget hotel. So to all these angry guest, i would like to ask them something? If you want to stay in the middle of times square, and having all kind of pampering then, don't you think that you have to pay 3 or 4 times more what you have paid?Carmen, keep that smile up, all the time, it's simply the best.	
Oct 12 2005	Can't Beat it	We stayed at the St. james right between snowstorms - and although it was cold outside, inside our reception couldn't have been warmer. Granted, it's not a 5 star hotel - but neither was the price. Our room was clean if a bit spartan - on the other hand we didn't go to New York to sit in the hotel all day. It was very convenient for the theatre, great restaurants and shopping - and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The place was full of Europeans (Spanish and Italian) all of whom seemed pretty happy. A real bargain and we will stay there again!	
Oct 11 2005	Expect Nothing	Expect nothing from Hotel St. James and you won't be disappointed. You get what you pay for. It's a cheap sleep with minimum underpinnings. The location is convenient to Times Square, the subway, and the 6th Avenue bus. Next door are two excellent deli's. On 44th Street is Osteria al Doge - fine Italian dining.John's Shanghai is on 46th Street. Avoid the rooms opposite the creaky elevator. The building is over 100 years old.	
Oct 11 2005	Pack your bags and head the other direction!	HotelConXIons guaranteed a renovated room at the St. James Hotel, but when we checked in we had a room with horrible stains on the floors and wall; a broken window and a toilet that periodically erupted like Mt. Vesuvius.The first night there was no hot water whatsoever and when I informed the front desk they told me we needed to let the water run for 10 minutes. That did not work! And of course, they told us there were no rooms to move us to even though people contiued to check in after us (many I saw later at the front desk complaining). The next morning we had hot water after letting the faucet run for about 10 minutes, but the hot water only lasted for about 2 minutes.The walls are paper thin and the doors slam like a prison lockdown. The front desk clerks were rude, inconsiderate and very unhelpful. They didn't seem at all concerned that we didn't have hot water and went so far as to tell me we were the only ones that complained about no hot water. However, I asked a group in the lobby if they had hot water and they said previously they had the same problem, but were moved to a top floor and didn't notice it so much. We were on the 3rd floor and the entire second floor was torn up with renovations.This hotel definitely has issues. I never felt very safe there, and if I were to go again, I would spend an additional $50/night just to have hot water and feel safe in a hotel with a staff that cared about their customers' concerns. Their only saving grace was the clean sheets (or at least I think they were clean.If all this makes no difference to you, then you will be happy to know that it is only a 1 block walk to Times Square.	
Oct 10 2005	What's with all the complaining!! 	If you're looking for a cheap place to stay in a PRIME location, you cannot ask for better than the St James. It's a minute walk from Times Square, and a 2 minute walk to the red line subway station that can thake you all the way up and down manhattan!! Just a birlliant location.The hotel is undergoing refurbishment and isn't looking in the greatest of shape on the outside but it offers good beds, big rooms, clean bathrooms and, for the money, you can't really complain. Plus, down the road it has one of the best Irish bars i've ever been to...Lunnies... fantastic for finishing of yet another night in the city...it's open till 4am!!I would definately stay there again.	
Sep 27 2005	Oh boy...	Sorry, but I've stayed at several other establishments in NYC and this was the pits. This review has been held back for long enough. I went with 5 other ladies for a shopping/broadway trip, and had to share a room with two others. The room stunk, the locks on the doors didn't work, and the front desk was of no help whatsoever. Being used to NYC life since I've spent many summers as a child there visiting family, my girlfriends couldn't take the noise in the hotel, along with the sirens and ruckus that occured all night. One of the elevators was out of service when I was there. They were in the middle of &quot;remodeling&quot; the establishment, and debris was everywhere. Please, someone tell me that the hotel was updated, b/c our room was awful. I actually had a man enter the room I was staying in to tell my girlfriends and I to keep the noise level down! How thin are those walls anyway!? I actually propped a chair under the door knob so that no one else would walk in. Towels and linens were clean, but that's about it. At $179 a night, a stay at a Days Inn or the like would have been a palace! One things for sure, Le Tre Venezie restaurant was a hit, as was the Playwright Bar and Restaurant on 49th between 7th and Broadway if I remember correctly. Just went there with my hubby two weeks ago, and the french onion soup is to die for! The Hotel St. James is a zero in my opinion.	
Sep 25 2005	Very disappointed in the Hotel St James	The elevator in the hotel did not appear to be very safe and our room was on the 12th fl I cringed everytime I had to get on it The walls in our room were dirty, there was no towel rack in the bathroom and there was a big hole in the bathroom wall behind the toilet. Our lamp was held together by masking tape. My girlfriends and I were concerned about safety in the event of a fire. What a disappointment	
Sep 16 2005	Ruined Vacation	There were some good things about this hotel, such as price($100/night) staff, and a deli next door. Staff was actually very very helpful - but even their excellent customer service could not save my ruined vacation! It was my first visit to NYC and my husband and I stayed there for two weeks. Unfortunatelly, our balance was prepaid, so there was nothing we could do to change it after we got there. Our first room faced another building, had no day-light and a very uncomfortable and small bed. I guess, you get what you paid for, we thought, until we saw a MOUSE running around like it was home. Again, the staff was very understanding, so they gave us a larger room with an actual window - but still the bed was uncomfortable, sheets were small and did not stay in place, carpet was rough and cheap (actually the entire decor was super-cheap) What else? Ah, the famous towels - I can still feel its scratches - you know the towels you buy at Costco to wash your car with? - No, St. James Hotel doesn't have them - they are too nice! As we came home every night, we had to find our way to the hotel entrance door through piles of garbage - beer bottles, paper plates - you name it - it was there along with the drunken crowd. There you go - if you're OK with such circumstances - then St. James is right for you. Otherwise, KEEP OUT and LOOK ElSEWHERE!Tip: Times Square is a very dirty place most of the time! Noisy too! For real New York Experience stay where New Yorkers actually live!	
Sep 12 2005	Thanks but no thanks	First the good stuff -Hotel is about one minute from Times Square and there is a nearby deli that is cheap but the food is average at best.Thats about it for the good stuffThe bad stuff list is a lot longer -No Hotel parking, the elevators are a joke, the hallways and staircases are terrible. Customer service is awful. I called the front desk and asked for assistance and they said, we'll send somebody right up.&quot; Well nobody ever came and there was no follow-up telephone call. The room is a tiny box with no music or alarm clock. The television was the smallest I've ever seen in any Motel room, let alone a Hotel room.I could go on and on but I won't. Spend the extra money for a better room, you'll be glad you did.I wouldn't stay at the Hotel St. James again. It was the lowpoint of an otherwise fantastic trip.	
Sep 8 2005	50/50	I stayed at this hotel in August for 1 week. When we arrived to our room I could have cried. The walls in the bedroom were filty dirty and the carpet had huge stains on it. It was a nightmare. I have to admit that the bathroom was very clean so that was something. We had arrived late as night so we had to stay at least one night. When I woke in the morning I didnt mind it too much. We then decided to stay and give it a shot. The halls were really old fashioned, the stairs were disgusting, like something from fauly towers. It was very close to Times Square and there was a realy lovely Deli downstairs which was cheap. I would not stay at the hotel again but if you were on a budget it was okay. i have to say that the bed linen was always clean and we had fresh towels every day.	
Sep 6 2005	Security and fire saftey concerns	The room was simple and spartan. The elevator was sluggish and there did not appear to be a contained fire stairwell. Sprinklers were absent from the room, and the smoke detector was smashed to pieces in a drawer without a battery. When questioned, the front desk supervisor said that nothing could be done until Monday. The door lock was feeble, and a saftey latch was absent. I notified the NYC Fire Dept. when I returned home regarding the apparent saftey concerns. Otherwise, great location and inexpensive.	
Aug 26 2005	Nothing like it	Though our stay at the St. James Hotel was brief, it made our first trip to New York a pleasant, enjoyable and memorable one.It's not as fancy as the other hotels in the area, and although the furniture need to be replaced, the room, bathroom &amp; the beddings are clean, and its centrally located in Times Square.We're planning to go back to New York, and we will definitely consider the St. James again.MSTLos Angeles, CA	
Aug 22 2005	Forget the bells and whistles...you've got Times Square	This hotel could not be in a better location, just yards from Times Square. Okay, so the place is a bit basic and is undergoing renovation. When you consider what you pay you get excellent value for money.The rooms are basic but clean and comfortable. The television reception is poor but if you plan to sit in and watch TV all the time then don't go to New York!The only problem we experienced was with teenagers making loads of noise outside our room at 2 am. As they didn't stop when we asked them to we called down to the front desk. Within 30 seconds security came up and moved them on. We were very impressed.I would certainly stay here again. With all the money you save on the room you can spend more on 5th Avenue (which is only 5 minutes away)	
Aug 15 2005	Great Place if your not picky safe location and right around everything	It looks nicer on the outside than inside. The rooms are ok. Not dirty but just not fancy. Its comfy and quiet. Everything works good. Late check outs arer hard to get with them. Its in a safe location and right down the street you have everything. The deli 2 doors down ROCKS! Im going back this week. Im just bringing an extra pillow lol. Its cheap and nice dont be a fool get a room there.	
Aug 9 2005	Nice budget hotel and great location.	Nice location and nice hotel. For a two star hotel, I was pleased. I traveled with my mother for the weekend. The proximinty to Time Square was about 30 seconds. If you are looking for a place to rest your head, because you are on the move a great deal this is the place for you. The staff was very helpful in giving directions and recommending places to eat. The room was very clean. The towels were a little stiff and the lightening was a little dim, especially in the bathroom, and there was no alarm clock, which surprised me, but I brought my own. They are in the middle of remodeling, but it was a nice hotel. I have stayed in a lot of expensive hotels in NYC and by far I was quite pleased with this hotel and would stay there again.	
Aug 3 2005	Not terrible - but bring your own plunger!	We checked in early Friday morning to a most accommodating front desk person. We were shown our room which was basically what we expected for the price. All seemed well until the second night when the toilet began to overflow. My boyfriend went down to the front desk to make them aware of the situation, but the front desk did not seem to care. He asked for another room and was told there was none available. He then asked for a plunger and was told &quot;I'm sorry, I can't leave the front desk to find you one.&quot; He didn't know what to do; how do you stay in a place with no washroom facilities and the night clerk was of absolutely no help and of really bad attitude. My boyfriend then went to another hotel down the street to ask if they had a plunger, but no they could not provide him with one. He asked if they knew where he could get one, they told him at the Duane Reade drug store in Times Square. So at 3:30 a.m., because of the refusal on the part of the hotel staff to do anything, he walked over to Duane Reade to buy a plunger. We asked for a discount on the room but they only agreed to reimburse the $4.42 he had paid for the plunger, saying we had made the reservation through Hotel Conexions and that we would have to take it up with them.	
Jul 28 2005 	Not for crybabies	No, this place is far from The Ritz, but if you can handle less-than-perfect cleaning (not dirty, just not pristine), small rooms, a small TV, etc. then you should consider this place. It is safe, inexpensive, and in a GREAT location.If you are a whiner (or will be traveling with one), then you should avoid this place, as you (or your companion) can find plenty to complain about, if you're so inclined.One caution--bring an alarm clock (or a PDA or cell phone with one), because my room didn't have one, and my wake-up call never came.	
Jul 17 2005	Location doesn't make up for the problems of this hotel	I just happened upon this website and decided to check out reviews of hotels my wife and I have stayed at, including the Hotel St. James in New York City. Recent reviews emphasize the location of this hotel and seem to be saying that the proximity to Times Square outweighs the many shortfalls of this hotel. I beg to differ.My wife and I have stayed at a number of New York City hotels, of various classes and in different parts of the city. If location is your major concern, there are other hotels close to the St. James that are in the same price category and offer a very nice level of comfort. A two star hotel should offer a certain base level of service, and that level is missing at the St. James. So the argument that you get what you pay for doesn't hold here -- you should get much more for the price of this hotel.Here's what my wife and I expect as basics in a hotel, even a two star hotel, that were missing at the St. James: 1) A helpful staff: The people working at the St. James range from friendly (the maids and one desk clerk) to rude (the owner, the manager, and another desk clerk were especially rude).2) Honest representation: The hotels provide info on their properties to the web sites and the travel agents. That info should be accurate, as should the photographs. In fact, this hotel does not have room service, wedding facilities, a restaurant, or a concierge.3) Amenities: an extra roll of toilet paper, wash cloths, the little shampoo and lotion bottles, a phone that works and temperature control in the room all make a stay more comfortable. These are basics, found in virtually every reputable hotel. But not at the St. James.4) Safety and cleanliness: Even a two star hotel should have an elevator that works reliably, and trash that is removed from the hallway regularly. The smoke detector in our room was broken, as was the toilet. And the stains on the floor and the sheets hardly reassured my wife and I that the hotel was clean. It also smelled bad, very bad.True, there is a Starbuck's half a block away, and a deli next door, and the subway is close by. But I think what's inside the hotel is what you pay for, and there are comparably priced hotels in the same area as the St. James that offer a basic level of service and comfort. You don't have to sacrifice comfort for price, no matter how terrific the hotel's location is.	
Jul 7 2005	Can't get much better	Me &amp; My family stayed in St. James for three nights last August. We were looking for something cheap &amp; close. We didn't have a car obviously &amp; had to walk to everything. It was perfect. They are under renovations, yes &amp; some things are obviously worse than others. In August, we went to a discount site &amp; got the room for $80. I'm sorry but there isn't anything better than that. Every other hotel we looked at for that amount of money was a complete dumb &amp; I mean complete. The reviews were horrible. We weren't going to be able to go to New York for that long &amp; do all the things my kids wanted to do if we didn't find a cheap hotel, one under $150 &amp; close. We looked &amp; looked &amp; couldn't find anything till we came across St. James! Everynight, we would just go to the hotel, change out of our day clothes &amp; just walk around &amp; shop at night with no inconvienace since the hotel was right there. We all loved it &amp; we are actually going back to stay there again in August.	
Jul 6 2005	Great trip to New York City and great lodging there!	A couple of weeks ago I traveled to New York City to spend a weekend with friends. The toughest part was choosing a hotel to stay in. I looked everywhere for the best rates and one site, HotelConxions, got me great rates. They put me at the St. James hotel, and despite the budget quality, I was very satisfied with the low price I paid. Thanks to Hotel Conxions, my trip was fun AND cheap!	
Jun 28 2005	Great Location!	If you are looking for a hotel for a reasonable price in a great location, look no further! You are in the heart of the city just off from Times Square. You will find no extras or frills but the rooms were clean and the staff was friendly.	
Jun 27 2005	perfect location	My stay at the St. James Hotel was one of the greatest. Some of this reviews are kind of silly. This hotel is in a great location, just half a block from Times square. Yes, a budget hotel very clean and certainly convenient. The hotel staff is just great, specially a young spanish lady, very sweet and kind. Housekeepers always available to bring you up anything you need. A very modest hotel but umbeatable location. So i will go to the St. James hotel next time I am in New York. Thank you to the front desk girls, just marvellous.	
Jun 23 2005	Wonderful location for the price	My husband and I stayed in this hotel from June 16th to the 19th, 2005. After reading all the reviews (after we booked the hotel) we were a little worried, but to our relief, the hotel was just fine. We wanted to save some money, but stay in a great location in NYC. We found the lobby to be welcoming -- they are renovating the building, but who cares? It was never noisy or dirty. We stayed on the 10th floor (room 1014 to be exact) and it was surprisingly roomy and very clean. No, there isn't an alarm clock, but we used our cell phones instead. Yeah, it was hard to adjust the hot/cold in the shower, but oh well....a minor inconvenience compared to the great deal you are getting. Besides, who spends time in their room in NYC?? Our air conditioning worked perfectly too....For a quick, cheap, and delicious breakfast or lunch...check out the Dunhill Cafe right next to the Hotel St. James. We would definitely recommend this hotel to people who are looking for a simple, clean, affordable place to stay in Midtown Manhattan.	
Jun 12 2005	in a fantastic position!!	I stayed in this hotel from 27th May to 4th June... it's very close to Times square...in a fantastic position!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My room was on 10th floor... it was clean and quiet... the bed ok... I had some problems with the shower!!!!!!!too cold or too hot... now the hotel is a site, but I think that when they will finish to work, it will be great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!if you don't want to spend a lot and you are not demanding...st james hotel it's for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	
Jun 7 2005	Cheap simple hotel in the heart of the city	If you want a cheap, simple room just round the corner from Times Square then this is the hotel for you. There are no frills, but the rooms are clean and there is a daily maid service. There is a great deli next door and it is in an ideal location for theatres, attractions and subways. The hotel was undergoing quite extensive renovations when we were there. The second floor should be finished by the end of 2005 and the overall feel of the hotel should improve by then.	
May 28 2005	Great Location good budget Hotel	We stayed at this hotel in May. And after having read the reviews on trip advisor we were well prepared for this hotel and presently surprised. We arrived early and they held our bags till check in. We had a booked a room with 2 doubles for 4 of us, $145 a night, room wasnt available and so we were given two rooms at no extra cost for the duration of our stay (2 nights). The staff were very pleasnt and helpful, the rooms, one a little smaller than the other, were on the 10th floor, were clean, the bathrooms were spotless, the towels although smaller than usual were clean. Yes there were grabage bags in the halls at times, and yes there is a big mess on the second floor with the renovations, and yes sometimes there were air conditioners and other things in the halls at times but they are renovating slowly and give them a break. This exactly what you pay for and more, it has perfect location, its bit rundown but its a 2 star hotel, and if you come to New York City what are you doing spending all your time in your room!! The staff were helpful, we had a great time, for $145 a night for 4 of us in NYC I would defintely stay here again. If you want huge rooms and to spend all your time in your room stay at the Marriott and pay $400 a night!	
May 24 2005	Not bad at All! Had a Good Time!	The Hotel was just fine. Some of these reviews are crazy, I was cracking up laughing and scared to death at the same time. We arrived at the Hotel on a Friday (May 20) It was clean and no problem checking in. We were in the 12th floor room 1212. It was just fine, the hall ways and elevator were old but we were not expecting the Ritz at $144. a night and that was with Tax incl. We were there 3 nights and had no problems. There were TONs of places to eat and only a minute from Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, a tour bus stop, Broadway, 5th Ave shopping etc....we walked everywhere and it seemed that we were always by our Hotel no Problem. You will Love the location! The weather was cool when we were there so I am not sure how well the A/C worked? This Hotel is nice enough and I would stay here again. Only 30 minutes away from LGA airport. Our Taxi fair was only about 27.00 with the toll fee. Dont get stuck paying 359.00 a night for a hotel you wont even be in much. The Hotel is at 109 W 45th street and the #212-221-3600. Nice place to stay and very nice staff!!! We saved our cash to have fun and eat alot....again this hotel is just great, and safe and clean. I have a friend that lives in NY and her &quot;upscale&quot; apartment is smaller than one of these rooms! and she lives way far away from any of the NY life! have a great trip and you'll enjoy the St.James!	
May 24 2005	Used Condem 	Get off the elevator to find my room and find a garbage pail overfilled, just in front of my room on the ground was a used condem, behind it a twin bare mattress against the wall. Had to go into the room to just check it out as I was in shock, room was disgusting, under the bed it appeared it was not cleaned in 100 years. There was a brown paper bag in the middle under the bed, i was scared to find out what was in it. I am from the NY area and have never seen such a horrible nightmare of a place and I have traveled to numerous countries...DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO STAY HERE.. it is not a place for women.	
May 18 2005	Cheaper is not always better 	When first checking in, The Hotel told us that one of our rooms that we had booked would not be available for our last night of stay but they would try to get us a room available which they did do after making us sweat it out. We get up to our room to find that there is no ac or wash rags so we open the window to get some air and it looks like an alley where homeless people would live, TRASH EVERY WHERE AND VERY DIRTY which leads to the second floor of the hotel which is as bad if not worse then the alley. We called about the ac and went to dinner when we returned they had brought a window unit to our room and sit it in the floor did not even put it in for us when we asked how we were supposed to get it in the window they told us we would have to wait until the next day and they would do it for us. They were suppose to bring us a roll a way bed that we requested when making the reservation which we finally recieved the second night after several times of asking. Not to mention that our room had a radiator for a heater that CLANKED ALL NIGHT LONG we thought someone was tring to break in from the alley because the alley was so scary looking and there was a man moaning in the hall. We locked our room key in the room and they give us a key with no ID check to the whole 3rd floor. There was a man in his robe and socks walking around the halls digging in the trash that was in the floor of the halls. We finally got our ac going after 5 times of asking. There was no hot water and the Hotel needs more then construction work. We would never stay there again even if if were for free. This hotel is devistating and will distroy your trip.	
May 18 2005	St James Hotel Times Square. May 2005	The St James Hotel Times Square is pretty much what it says it is - a budget hotel. I have read some rather bad reviews of the place, so was a little nervous about going there. However, the location and price made me take the risk. So, I booked two rooms, one for my parents who were visiting the USA for the first time. Unlike many who have commented here, I was not disappointed. Sure, the place is in the midst of an overhaul. That is apparent from the outside, since the facade is being worked on. The lobby is a 'work in progress', with a nice little front desk and a less than nice plastic bag storage area. Check in was smooth, and the desk clerk was efficient if not overly friendly. The elevators are clearly still to be upgraded. They are a bit slow and noisy. But they do get you where you need to be. Our rooms were on the 5th floor, which appears to have been renovated already. They were both clean and tidy, and featured comfortable beds. There were only a few TV channels, but I was not there to watch TV so it didn't matter to me. The bathroom was small, but more than adequate. There was soap provided, but you need to bring shampoo. Some people have mentioned that the towels were rough. That is true, they are not luxurious. So if that is the kind of thing that bothers you, don't stay here. The hot water in the shower came, but patience was required one morning. We were staying there in May, when it was not hot in NYC. I suspect that in the summer one might over heat in some rooms, since they don't all feature A/C (yet). And the windows are not double glazed, so rooms at the front can potentially be noisy during the early morning commute to work. This would be worse if you try to cool down with an open window. This is in the heart of Midtown, afterall. So for a summer stay you might want to check ahead to see if you are going to get A/C. The hotel is still being renovated, so you will notice signs of this. Coming down the stairs you will see that the second floor looks like a bomb hit it. Also, the housekeeping staff often have their carts in the lobby by the elevators, presumably because the rear area of the first floor is still being renovated. These things didn't bother me though, because in my room I had a good bed, clean towels and sheets, and a private bathroom. No alarm clock though, so you'll have to make arrangements for that. I just used my cellphone alarm.For food, there are restaurants in and near Times Sq, and there is a very nice deli just outside the hotel. Basically, you get what you pay for. If you want to have extra luxuries, go to the big hotels down the road, and pay $50-100 more per night. Or, go an hour out of the city to New Jersey or one of the airport hotels. If comfortable and basic is ok for you, the St James is fine in my opinion. And, I might add, will only get better as the renovations are completed. And the location just can't be beaten if you are a visitor to NY and want easy access to all Manhatten has to offer.Good luck!	
May 14 2005	Go elsewhere and spend the extra 20 bucks	If this shows up on your searches as FAR cheaper than others, then stay here. But if there are other places costing a bit more, and the rating is better, stay there. The place is VERY much still under renovation. Bathroom was fine in our room, and the staff was nice enough. But the place is still being worked on, and the bedding is pathetic. I had better towels in India. You can see the mattress through the fitted sheet. The pillows are pathetic, though you may have more luck asking them to bring more for you...but they were out when we asked for extra. Location is good. We paid about 180 with tax, and I would have gladly paid 210 for a less skanky room...but not 250.	
May 11 2005	Great Location! Great Place! Newly Remodeled!!!	The place was great. It has an awesome location. It's right in the middle of Time's Square. There's a subway entrance about a block away. There's plenty of good restaurants and ars nearby. The place looks newly remodeled. Our room was very nice. Neicely done restroom and nicely done room. Very clean and plenty of towels. It looked as if it had just been remodeled. I didn't know what to expect after reading other user reviews and seeing some pictures, but it was nothing like that. I think those pictures were taken before they remodeled. The lobby was half way remodeled, it looks like they;re still working on some stuff, but a very nice place overall.  The staff was very helpful too. They pointed us in the right direction anytime we wanted to go anywhere. They told us what subways to take to our various destinations (Yankee Stadium, Ground Zero, Little Italy). I don't know why anyone would complain about the place, and it's also one of the cheapest hotels in the area. GOOD DEAL!!! I imagine that once they finish remodeling, the prices will go up. It's a great place. Some of the other reviews mentioned that they were traveling with kids...I don't think New York is a good city for kids. Don't blame the hotel, blame the city. New York is fast paced and it's an adult world. (Just my opinion)	
May 10 2005	For one night in NYC it was fine.	This hotel is great for its location. However, it is definitely a no frills hotel. It was fine for what we needed it for, a place to sleep. The beds however were comfortable and our room was quiet. I think once all of the restoration is done, it will be a better place to stay. If you are only going for one night, this is the hotel to use.	
May 3 2005	I Loved the Hote St. James 	I was very impressed with the Hotel ST. James I and My 25 guess stayed there April 28th thru May 1st. I was worried due to seeing pictures over the internet and some of the reviews but Magaret the Hotel Manager did inform me of the renovations. She and The Hotel staff was very kind to me and went beyond and above their duties. The Hotel is being renovated in a modern fashion some rooms are ready and we were able to enjoy those rooms. The new fixtures in the bathrooms, new furniture in the rooms and you could also see the loads of new furnture that awaits the rooms. The Hotels is a half block from the beautiful Time Square. The Majority of My guest and I walked to the Garment District and back to the Hotel. It was a beautiful stay. Magaret took some of the load off of me &quot; The Group Leader&quot;. I must tell you the Hotel is in an excellent location and is an excellent price. There are Resturants and deli's steps away from the Hotel. It was a great stay, I hope to return next year. A special thanks to Maragret and staff.  ANNIE LUCAS, CHICAGO,ILL	
Apr 30 2005	The risk didn't pay off	I took my family to NYC and wanted a place as close as possible to Times Square. I read the reviews and knew that the St. James was a risk but decided to take that risk. That was one of the worst mistakes I've ever made in family travel. We had talked to the hotel staff for weeks about the need for a renovated room, a safe place to leave luggage for early arrival, and other details. From the moment we arrived things went badly. No safe place for luggage... only out in the open lobby. We left our luggage and upon return someone had changed our room request. They had 4 of us in a queen bed room and said WE had changed our request to that day. Ludicrous! We finally got two doubles after confronting their lies. Renovated room was dirty. Hair everywhere. Stains on carpet, towels, even the tip envelope. No hand or wash towels. Broken toilet. Leaking radiator. The staff was not helpful and some were quite rude. I've never written a bad review for any place I've stayed but had to warn others. If you're simply looking for a place to sleep and quality absolutely does not matter then the St. James may work for you. I was not intersted in paying big bucks for a 4/5 star hotel. For a little more money however, we found a great place on 47th. We had no choice but to stay one night at the St. James but I walked away from a prepaid second night and found the other place to stay. Losing that second night was the best money I spent. My advice - find an extra 40 to 50 dollars per night. Your family will thank you.	
Apr 30 2005	A "no frills" stay	We (4 of us) arrived at the Hotel St. James (also listed as the St. James Hotel) just after 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 19, 2005. Its location is 109 W. 45th Street in mid-town Manhattan.They have recently undergone some renovations according to their website. Even so, it is not handicap accessible -- one needs to go up 3-4 granite steps and a heavy door in order to get into the facility.The lobby was relatively small with a check-in desk about 8 feet in length. There are two elevators to take guests up to the rooms. Beyond the lobby was another large open area filled with lots of used furniture piled several feet high and looked rather unsightly. There was also a small glassed-in area --approx. 6' X 6' and right next to the desk -- for patrons to leave their luggage if they arrive before the check-in time of 3:00 p.m. We were allowed up to our room when we arrived at 2:00 p.m.The lobby itself had only two chairs and a room-size roll of carpet placed alongside the wall. The employee who checked us in was well-dressed and professional and pleasant. The check-in process was about three minutes. We were not offered a second key for our room -- even though there were 4 of us.No discounts were available for guests. Two in our group were senior citizens, two are members of AAA and I am a school teacher. We were told that none were offered at all -- ever.Our room (on the 6th floor) had two double beds, a closet and bathroom. The room was very clean and painted a lovely shade of Christmas-tree green. We were disappointed that there was not even a small refrigerator nor an ice bucket for us (three of us in our group need to take meds at bed-time and/or early morning) nor any kind of snack/drink machine. The room had no air-condioner. Not that it was broken, there simply wasn't one. We arrived during an April &quot;heatwave&quot; where it went up to 85 during the day and made the room quite uncomfortable to sleep in (NOTE: bugs don't fly that high but birds do). There was neither table nor desk in the room and just one chair in a room for 4. The windows (2) were unscreened and any items placed on the wide windowsill had to be placed so that they did not fall out of the windows when open. The TV had good reception but only got about 12 channels and had no viewer guide channel for us to determine which stations were which or which shows were on. The hotel has no restaurants or snack bar; no continental breakfast, coffee or morning newspaper. It is a 12-story facility.Check-out time is at Noon and for us it was a three-minute process after we handed in the key and the employee checked our bill to see if there were any additional charges. We were told, however, they were &quot;not allowed&quot; to call us a cab so that we could get to the Port Authority on 42nd street in order to catch our bus. We had to walk to the corner (about 100 feet) with all of our luggage and try our luck at hailing a cab. About 20 went past us -- already in use. We finally got one and arrived at Port Authority in plenty of time. Yes, I would stay there again, but I'd bring a fan. We stayed for 2 nights at a cost of $165.00 (taxes included) per night -- not bad when dividing the amount by 4 guests. I had booked the room for our group -- sight unseen -- directly with the hotel (by phone) although I found out about the hotel through an online travel/hotel site. I would rate the experience a &quot;B&quot;.	
Apr 27 2005	Cheap and erm... cheap	if all you want is qutie a comfortable bed and a shower that's luke warm most of the time then this is fine.The reception was small but staffed and the staff seemed fairly helpful.Our room, a double double bed room, was ok in size. The beds were comfortable.The bath unit needed a thorough clean and the towels were really small and rough, not nice.The room got really hot even at this time of the year, I'd hate to be there in the summer.The lifts were somewhat creaky and slow, so we took the stairs (we were on the 3rd floor)... the 2nd floor is deserted apart from bags of rubbish, it was quite freaky.At the back of reception is where they stored all the furniture they had ripped out during their re-furbishment.The TV signal was very poor and there wasn't a kettle!The bin men woke us up at 4am one morning and 6am for two mornings, facing the main road it got noisey and opening the window to let in some cool fresh air was very tricky.Worringly there were no fire instructions on the door or in the walkways!!!I don't think I'd recommend it or stay there again, I'd pay the extra £10 a night for somewhere else, the location was brilliant and the bed comfy.Good Luck!!	
Apr 19 2005	Std hotel great price great location	My wife and I visited NYC last weekend, looking for a cheap hotel, was very hard to do. This hotel on cost about $120/night, less than a block from 45th/Broadway/Times Square. True, the hotel is being renovated,and we got a renovated room. It looked clean, new bathroom and furniture. Lamp didn't work and window wouldn't close, but they fixedit quickly. Slow elevators, but so what, all of NYC has very old bldgs here.Took the narrow stairs sometimes, just remember some floors are still under construction. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to us. Plenty of towels. Only about 15 cable chanels, but who cares, I'm out touring NYC, not watching TV.I don't know what all the grief is about with these other reviewers. Give me a break, wonderful price and location. Quaint eateries down the street, subway close. Who needs 3/4/5 star hotels at the expensive rates they want, not us ? If you want to pay $200+/night, good for you, but that's not smart as far as I'm concerned.Next time I'm in NYC, I'd go back here for sure. Hope their rates don't go up to much by then. It's only a 2 star hotel, but it's a great bargain !!	
Apr 15 2005	Hotel St. James - not what the web sites tell you it is	We stayed five nights at the Hotel St. James in Times Square. Expedia should be ashamed, advertising this hotel as something it definitely is not. Relying on the hotel to provide a description of the premises, Expedia advertises this hotel to be a 2-star hotel with a restaurant that provides room service and cable/satellite TV, a concierge desk, a smoke-free property, and WEDDING SERVICES (heaven help the honeymooners who pick this hotel!). The only truth in advertising here is that the location is great, very central to Times Square and Fifth Ave. Otherwise, this hotel is the pits.First, to all those who say it's a good value, we've stayed at other 2-star hotels in or near Times Square, sometimes for much less than we paid for this one, and the rooms are clean, well-stocked, with actual concierge service and restaurants. You DON'T have to pay twice as much to get a decent hotel, and it's rubbish to think $150 a night is a deal for a really unsatisfactory hotel.Here's what we faced: The eleventh floor is a disaster. The doorknob was broken and there were no inside latches. If there had been a fire, our only hope would have been to jump, because the phone didn't work and the stairs were broken, if we could have found them without a map of the hotel fixed to the inside of the door (every other hotel I have ever stayed in has this feature, except the Hotel St. James). The elevators were a gamble, at best. Using a bathroom where the drains are plugged with years worth of people's hair is pretty disgusting. It's not a lot of fun to use a toilet facing a window without any curtains or shades, either. We were moved to the third floor eventually, which was better but still lacked the features that would make this even a 1-star hotel. The lack of temperature controls in the rooms means you are at the mercy of the front desk, and you either end up roasting or freezing, but it's not of your own choosing. The TV had only a few channels available, and since we don't speak Italian, two stations were definitely not applicable to us. And sheets that have stains (hate to think of the source) and cigarette burns are pretty disgusting. No washcloths or toilet paper on the third floor either.The maid was nice, as was one young lady working at the desk, otherwise the employees were unhelpful and some were downright rude. We think the plexiglass enclosure is to keep people from spitting at the office help, which in frustration you might be tempted to do. Some of the people there are just plain rude. The owner is an old French woman who doesn't care in the least that the rooms have no extra toilet paper or wash cloths, or that the &quot;non-smoking&quot; rooms actually have ashtrays, and smell of smoke and urine. We know this for a fact because we tried to talk to her about how unhappy we were. Her response to complaints is that you ought to have checked out the first night and gone elsewhere.My suggestion is don't bother with the first night, just go somewhere else. You can enjoy the convenience of a 2-star hotel in Times Square without sacrificing cleanliness, service, and a few amenities (like soap or toilet paper).This experience has made us very wary of using internet booking sites such as Expedia, at least without checking out customer reviews on sites such as this one. The photos posted on these sites are obviously sent in by the hotel, and were either taken 30 years ago or are from another property. The sites provide little help once you've actually checked in, and our credit card company said if you stay longer than 30 minutes after check-in, they won't make an adjustment on your account. SO CHOOSE CAREFULLY!	
Apr 11 2005	Perfect for location and price	This hotel is perfect if you want somewhere with a great location and are stuck to a strict budget. It is right in the heart of Times Square and has a superb Deli just next door. The price is great, hence why you won't get many amenities. If you want a telephone that works(who you're gonna call beats me!) and room service(why you would wanna stay in your room I don't know!) then don't choose this Hotel because it doesn't have these things. The main things are that its clean, cheap and in a great location. If you want more you pay more simple as that. There are still renovations being undertaken but you only notice this in the lobby downstairs and if you go to New York to stay in your Hotel then there must be something wrong with you!!	
Apr 10 2005	An Eye-Opening Experience!	I didn't like giving this hotel - and I use that term loosely - a 'terrible' rating just because of its fantastic location, but I could not say it was 'OK, but some problems'. It has lots of problems.My first clue that we had made a mistake was the plexiglass enclosure they use in lieu of the normal lobby desk. My second was the old-fashioned key instead of the access cards that have been used for many years now.We checked in to the room and it was quite reasonable. The bathroom was fairly new and clean, however there were no face cloths or hand towels, strangely enough, only bath towels. They doubled as all the rest, including as a bath mat.Fortunately, the next morning we met the maid as she was doing our room. She was a young Polish student (who hated New York and was returning to Poland shortly) and very helpful. She found face cloths, extra pillows, extra towels, extra toilet paper, lots of soap and an extra waste basket for us. After giving her a nice tip, we found our room to be well-cleaned and supplied the rest of our stay, which was a total of 5 nights.The staff I found to be very indifferent. When I went down to complain about something, it was as if they didn't care. Perhaps they get these complaints so often that it's like water off a duck's back!My biggest beef is against the internet sites that sell these hotel rooms - hotel and expedia. They are blatently lying about the amenities available, and I will never use them again:- air conditioning. There was none in our room.- concierge. No!- room service. Not a chance when there's no restaurant, as advertised.- business services available. What's that? A telephone? Certainly there was nothing else.- dry cleaning service. I think not!- hair dryer. No!- individual climate control. The nearest thing I saw to this was the old valve that I had to shut off to stop the heat and the clanking from the pipes.Having said all that, after the first day we more or less accepted what we had and made the best of it, laughing at some of the things mentioned above. It is very handy to Times Square and Broadway. We were there for the sights and shows, and were never far from out hotel room.My last beef had to do with the unavailabilty of a receipt when I checked out. I was told that since I booked online, they were responsible for sending me a receipt, and had done so, by e-mail. Obviously the young man who told me this does not know the difference between a confirmation and a receipt. In any event, he would not give me one. If I lived in the USA, I might refer this this to the IRS as this hotel could be playing games with their receipts.The bottom line is that I would never stay there again. There are 'name brand' hotels in the area that do cost more, but I'm sure the difference is well worth it!	
Apr 6 2005	we loved ittttttttttttt	My friends and i just got back from new york, the most wonderful place in the world. We decided to stay at the St. James hotel, at 45st. This is a fantastic hotel due to its perfect location. The st James is a standard hotel that does not have many amenities, otherwise it will be woth much more . It is a very cozy place, where the hotel staff is marvellous, from the housekeepers ,specially the front desk girls, who are the nicest in the world.So I should say that the hotel is very modest but very clean, and for the price, nobody can beat. I would like to say to all people that say the St. James did not suit their needs, next time go to the Marriot MArquis and pay 300 and up for night, you will have all you want, but you wiil have to pay for that.	
Mar 24 2005	Worst hotel ever	Just returned from a trip to NYC and stayed with my family at this hotel. It is nothing like the representation you see on the travel sites, who should check this one out immediately. The rooms are substandard. We were moved 4 times before finding one that almost met a single star.Image: so much hair clogging the bathtub drain the water won't go down the drain. Gag. Telephone not working. Disconnected fire alarm in the drawer of bedside table. Broken window with plywood patch. No exit plans posted on door. Filthy rooms. Little or no maid service. Torn up lobby. Uninterested management.My advice -- run, don't walk, as fast as you can away from this hotel.	
Mar 21 2005	Hated It!!	We stayed at the Hotel St. James in February and I hated it. When you first walk into the lobby, you see what the pictures on the internet show you. What you don't see on the pictures is that the desk clerk is not standing behind the beautiful desk, he was standing behind a decrepit run down desk surrounded by plexiglass. The marble front desk must be for show. The elevator was a joke. We stayed on the sixth floor and it would stop about a foot short of the floor and the door would open. If that wasn't bad enough, when you exited the elevator there was this horrible smell that set my allergies off. It smelled like they used a whole can of cheap spray to hide a smell. We had to open the window to get rid of the deodorizer and New York is not warm in February. We had to shut the window so that we could leave. The rooms are horribly small and the beds were very uncomfortable. There is a pipe in the bathroom that you need to beware of if you have small children. Although the bathrooms were clean, there were no amenities to speak of. No hairdryers, and no clocks. Later on that night after we had finished what we did for the day, we returned to the room. We were thirsty and decided to get a drink. The promos lie, there is not a restaurant on site, but there is a couple of places next door. So we had to bundle up and go back outside to get a drink. The elevators were sketchy, so we decided to take the stairs back up to our room. Big mistake, the children were terrified. The bottom two floors looked like something you would see in a poor horror film or on a crime scene in Law and Order. I am guessing that these two floors had not been renovated unlike the promos suggested. When we finally settled the children down, we went to bed on what felt like concrete. Throughout the night, we were freezing. The next morning when we woke up, my cell phone that was plugged in by the window felt like we could use it for an ice cube. The rooms are definitely drafty. As we were leaving, on our way to the elevator a man stopped me and asked if these were the renovated rooms. I had to reply honestly, I did not know. If they were, they need to be redone. If I had to give one pro, I would say that it is extremely close to Times Square and walking around even in the cold weather was no big deal. We were close to everything that we wanted to do while we were on vacation. Would I stay there again? Not if they gave me a free stay for a month with everything included. Piece of advice, fork over the extra money and stay somewhere that you feel safe. I would have felt more comfort in the van. Speaking of parking, if you have a big vehicle, SUV or full size van, parking is very hard to come by. We had to park three blocks away because nobody wanted to take a full size vehicle and if they did they didn't want us there overnight. It was a no win situation. Another piece of advice, if it costs more and includes parking go for it. Sometimes, it's not worth the hassle. In this case, pictures don't say 1000 words. They must have shown the one room that had been refinished.	
Mar 20 2005 	The worst hotel I have ever stayed at in America. Period.	I came to this hotel as part of a group tour, and we had stayed at a very nice hotel (On The Ave Hotel) the previous year. This year was the complete opposite of that experience. The hotel has old-style keys, not the card-keys most hotels have. The elevator (there's only one, for 13 floors) is slow and old and unreliable. So, I figured, my room is only on the third floor, I'll walk. I went halfway up the first floor to find a metal gate like something out of a prison. After this, at the top of the first flight of stairs, the floor is ripped up and there is trash all over the place. It was a disgusting sight. My room was not much better. The walls were scuffed and stained, and the room itself was barely large enough for a &quot;double&quot; bed (really barely wide enough for one person). The bed was so short that my feet were hanging off the edge--and I'm only 5'7&quot;. It was also incredibly hard, as was the pillow. The sheets were torn and stained. Everyone else in my group had a similar experience. Some even had bloodstains on their walls or sheets. The hotel also provides no amenities. No shampoo, no water bottles, not even a box of tissues. In fact, all they do provide is a little envelope for tips for housekeeping, and a set of aluminum-foil ashtrays. Speaking of housekeeping, I never saw any evidence that it existed. Not only were there no maids to be seen, there were no maid closets or carts to be seen either. It should also be noted that there is no such thing as a non-smoking room in this hotel, and the rooms and hallways all reek of cigarettes. Also, there is no way to control the temperature of your room, except by opening the window. The rooms get very hot, and while I was lucky enough to be there in the winter, when I could get cool air from outside, if you go in the summer, you will find no cool breeze in new york city. Speaking of opening the window, at one point in the middle of the night, i opened it because i was very hot, and a few people who were obviously drunk in a room on the other side of the airshaft (most of the rooms overlook an airshaft) noticed and raised a huge noisy ruckus that made me very fearful. This hotel belongs in an episode of Fear Factor--if you can brave this hotel for a night, you win a million dollars. that's the only way you could get me to stay there again.	
Mar 19 2005	Don't Waste Your Time!!!	If you're looking for a dump to stay in or looking to do some chores, this is the place for you! With only one key to use for this room, be prepared to make your own copy at the local locksmith. The towels and washcloths are deadly (they feel like sandpaper against your skin), so please bring your own. If you need anything done, anything at all, you must do it yourself (getting clean towels and washcloths, getting a remote for the television, figuring out how to turn on the heat, etc.) And the room service...there is none! You may order out at other restaurants, but not this hotel. Please take my word for it. If only I would have listened to other people's reviews...	
Mar 17 2005	A good place to stay if all you want is a bed and a shower.	We stayed at the St. James based on location and price. We didn't expect much considering the price. A list of ammenities would include: towels and a TV which tuned in about 5 channels 2 of which were Spanish. If you're looking for a no frills place to stay that is in the heart of Times Square, you've found it here. The beds weren't exactly level but they served their purpose and the bathroom was clean. Remember to pack a hairdryer and there are no irons in the rooms but they do have them at the front desk. The deli next door is great! Don't expect a lot for the price you pay but if you really think about it, why go to NYC if you're gonna spend the whole time in your room!!	
Feb 25 2005	Loved the Hotel St. James	My family and I stayed here for 5 days and it was acceptable based on the price. The room was clean and the staff was helpful. We spent most of our time enjoying New York and only slept in the room.	
Feb 14 2005	Terrible - that's putting it nicely!	The online description of this hotel is very misleading.....1. there is no &quot;restaurant&quot;, therefore no room service. 2. all rooms do NOT have a queen or 2 doubles - just doubles.3. non-smoking facility: not when a creepy man sits outside your room and smokes in the hallway! 4. &quot;newly renovated&quot;: the entire hotel is in great need of an update - i'm not sure where these supposed renovations took place!5. &quot;Elevator&quot; - not very reliable. If you want to get to your room it's safer to take the stairs!6. Stairs: to get up to all floors you must take the stairs past the 2nd floor which looks like a decrepit crack house!Overall, this hotel is reasonably priced and well located, but you're really left wishing you'd spent a little extra so that you'd feel safe while you slept! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Even when we complained on check out about a man smoking in the public areas of the hotel, we were told there's nothing they can do about it! How about remove the ashtray!	
Dec 16 2004	You can't Beat the Location or Price	We had a group of 6 women stay here Dec 1-5 and we were all very pleased. We were only in the rooms to bathe and sleep and the rooms were perfect for that! The second floor is scarey, but it must be the floor that renovations are just beginning on. The location could not be better, especially for the price! Once this hotel is finished with the rennovations, it is sure to become more expensive, so I'd advise to stay there now. The staff was friendly and helpful and deserves an A for effort.	
Dec 6 2004	In need of Extreme Makeover!!	Hotel is very old and in need of the renovation that has just recently been started. Rooms are small along with the bathrooms. No amenities to speak of. (Ex: Could get an iron sent up, but &quot;a customer was using THE ironing board&quot;) No concierge service, no room service, no clocks in the room, no ice machines, no hair dryers, coffe/tea pots, or safes. It really had more of a MOTEL feel to it. Lounge/bar was under renovations and not open (housekeeping kept their carts in there - in plain view from the &quot;lobby&quot;) Had to go downstairs and grab our own clean sheets off the carts in the Lounge/construction area, to replace the dirty ones on our beds (from prior guests). If I were to think of some positive comments for the St. James, ... friendly staff, but not overly accommodating. It was only 1 block from Times Square, which was great. It had very hot water - a definite plus! But other than that, nothing too great to comment on. Kind of embarrassed that we booked it for a Bachelorette Party weekend. Might be more appropriate for Students or maybe Bachelor Party attendees, but me and the 7 other ladies were very disappointed that we stayed there.	
Dec 1 2004	Fantastic Location	My friends (5 in all) stayed at the St. James November 23rd to November 30th. Like everyone, after reading the reviews I was nervous. When we checked in we were given a room on the 12th floor. The room was awful, it was dirty and very old. We went down to reception and asked for a renovated room (like someone advised in another review) and we were given a room on the 5th floor. This room was much better. It was a good size with 2 double beds and plenty of room for the roll away bed we needed. The bathroom was a decent size and there were clean towels daily. Housekeeping staff were very friendly and visited daily. There are 2 deli stores right outside the hotel which are great. Breakfast is especially good at Cranberrys and very inexpensive. Connollys restaurant is also really good. The location of the St. James is fantastic. Right between Times Square and 5th Avenue. We had less than a 5 minute walk to the parade. My 2 bits of advice to anyone would be 1. Ask for a renovated room and 2. call the hotel directly for a quote. We were quoted $189 plus tax and roll away bed per room at hotels and paid $125.00 plus tax and roll away bed when we called the hotel directly. This is a basic hotel, no frills. It definitely served our purpose and we had a wonderful time. I would stay there again.	
Nov 22 2004	wonderful	We just got back from a wonderful trip to New York City. Stayed at the St. James for 5 nights. The room was clean, staff was friendly and helpful. We felt completely safe her and you couldn't ask for a better location for the price. I will defiantely stay here again.	
Nov 18 2004	Fantastic Location	I stayed at the St James Hotel from November 7-14. I knew it was a budget hotel and I had read all of the reviews so I was prepared for basic accomodation. If you are on a budget this is the Hotel to stay at since many expensive Hotels are in the same area and the location is fantastic. I had asked for a renovated room and my accomodations were basic and the room and bathroom were clean. It was better than I was expecting.This Hotel is 1/2 block from Time Square and you will feel very safe at this hotel. There are great restaurants, shopping and Broadway Shows within blocks. As other people have mentioned, the Deli next door has excellent breakfasts and reasonably priced lunches and dinners. I would definately stay at this Hotel again because I could not have had a more convenient location for the price. The Hotel lobby is still undergoing renovations and no one was working on it for the week I stayed. Once this Hotel is finished you can be guaranteed that the prices will increase--so take advantage now!	
Nov 14 2004 	Not a bad deal after we moved to renovated room.	We arrived late and were given a room on the 12th floor and told that we could change rooms the next day, since this room had two double beds and we only requested one. I asked if we had to change and the desk person implied that we would want to change as this was not a renovated room. After going to the room there was no question that we would want to change! The carpet was the worst. Spots everywhere! I did check the bottom of my white socks and was pleasantly surprised that they did not seem to be picking up any dirt, so maybe it had been cleaned just looked horrible. The mattress was worn and the only lock on the door was a push button kind in the knob. The next day we moved to a renovated room on a lower floor. It was smaller, but much better. The door lock had a bolt lock. The rooms are simple. I like at see older buildings still in use. The elevators are older and have slow moving doors. So be sure to ask for a renovated room! Otherwise it is a great location. The deli two doors down is great as well as the Italian restaurant a few doors down. The staff was friendly enough and helpful.	
Nov 10 2004	best value in The Theatre District	We had a nice and clean room in an ideal location; friendly service and very reasonable rates. We stayed for 5 nights during the New York marathon, attending 4 shows in Broadway, all theaters located no more than 2 blocks from the hotel. The Rockefeller center and Central Park are within walking distance. Because the hotel is within 2 blocks from most metro subway (2 blocks from Times Square) and bus lines, you are virtually within minutes from most New York landmarks. What we saved in hotel and transportation, we spent it in fine meals in nearby restaurants. Also, by staying in the heart of the City, we saved the most precious resource, time to enjoy all the museums and other wonderful sites in the limited number of days available. If what you want is a clean and safe place (since you will be out most of the day, anyway) look no further and try to get a room here. The hotel is currently under restoration, but other than cosmetic signs of ongoing work, we did not hear any construction noises. I had read the comments about unfriendly service, but I did not find that to be the case. The front desk lady was very accomodating and courteous and the cleaning ladies were very friendly.	
Nov 4 2004	Don't Stay Here!	We arrived and we left in a matter of 1/2 an hour.What can only be described as a 'body fluid' like substance over the walls and the water stained filthy carpet, I phoned the front desk to ask the question &quot; Are we in a refurbished room?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; came the reply. The bathroom was disgusting, the towels were stored on top of the toilet. We weren't expecting luxury or even a fancy bed covering, but we did expect CLEAN - as described by HotelConxions website. After viewing the second room on offer a shoebox, equally as inviting minus the sickly sweet smell of the first room and equally as UNclean, we decided to leave.Out of pocket $US200 plus tax, we found another room at the cheapest hotel on offer of the bunch we called, quoting $US289 per night - I felt sick. On arrival, we were given an excellent deal (compared to the $289 first quoted) and were apparently we were the second couple to come to them with a similar experience that evening. My advice to those contemplating staying at the St James Hotel is don't if you can possibly stretch to an extra $US80. If you don't mind dirt and grime and pros down the hallway then stay there by all means. All I can say is that I wish I had seen the comments on this message board before making the booking.	
Nov 1 2004	St. James Hotel - For The Bargin Hunter!~	I stayed at the St. James from October 20-25th with two other friends. The location was Wonderful! Close to the subways, and Starbucks Coffee just a couple of doors down. The Cranberry Deli next door was fabulous! This certainly isn't a fancy hotel by any means, but for the price and location, it was well worth the price! We had a room with two queen beds (the room was a good size). The matresses were firm, and nice and clean. The bathroom had been remodeled. The walls could have used some paint. So there were only two things that one should take note of when staying at this hotel. Even though the bathroom had been remodeled, I think they must still have old pipes. It literally took about 10 minutes of running the bath water before it became hot. The other thing was that the air conditioner in the window had been fastened with ply-boards and there was an extremely cold draft coming through the window and lots of noise from the street. We asked them to please remove the air conditioner so we could totally shut the window - they were very happy to do thing for us. And it cut down the noise and cold air.All in all, I'd recommend this hotel if you are looking for a bargin. I would definitely go back and stay there again!They have really cleaned up Time Square and felt totally safe walking in the streets at midnight!By the way, we saw three Broadway plays. I would definitely recommend Wonderful Town with Brooke Shields!	
Nov 1 2004	Detailed and Thorough Review of St James Hotel NY	I stayed at St James Hotel for the 29th and 30th of October 2004. I had read the reviews here before going, so I think that it is my responsibility now to give a detailed aftermath review. Pros: 1- Location. It is unbelievable. It is 3/4 of a block from the point which is the exact middle of times square and duffy square (that means the best photo point in times square). On the other side, it is about 3 blocks to rockefeller center, 3 blocks to 42nd street. Some of the best broadway theatres are 2 blocks away. Secondly, if you are planning to use the subway, then times square is the best place to stay, because every line goes through times square, and I think that times square station is the only one that can boast this. 2- Safety. It was quite safe. I went down at 4 AM to have a cigarette, no problems, and I didnt feel any more or less safe than in the rest of the city. 3- Clean Bathrooms. Well, lets just say that it would have been a drag had the bathrooms been dirty, but it was clean and marbled. And there was no problem with hot or cold water. 4- Didnt use the heating, but the AC was pretty effective. 5- Check in time was 12 PM. They gave us the room at 8 AM so that we could leave our bag over there. Also, while checking out, they allowed us to leave our bag with them till 2:30 PM despite the check out time being 12 PM. And I cannot tell you how much of a help that was. Dont know if other hotels would allow you to do the same thing, I basically was never in this situation before, but in this particular case, St James was very good to us.6) There is a starbucks across the street, and there are two delis right next door. That is if you dont want to walk 3/4 of a block to times square :)Cons: 1- Puny Room. I think the room must have been about 10 by 10. and bathroom was probably 5 by 5. Very very small. But if all that you need to do is to sleep, its fine. 2- Pathetic tv channels. I think they just had an antenna up. We were obviously not interested in Tv channels on a vacation to new york city, but if you are into it, this one gets 0/10. 3- AC made a lot of noise. We were however, so tired, that even if there were drums beating we would have gone to sleep. 4- The place was.... well..... dingy. It did have a haunted feel to it, and since no one used the stairs, they looked quite dirty. 5- Management has an unfriendly tone to them (though they are not really unfriendly, if you read my listing in the Pros, they did help us out, just their manner of talking appeared unfriendly)6- Their employees sounded East European, so there were a couple of times that you could hear their maids fighting. Also, some of their housekeeping and front desk staff were the same :). Not that it matters a lot, but hey, just my observation. 7- The view was of a deserted alley :), and there was some kinkos type of place acorss in the other building. It was quiet. I didnt really care about the view... thats not why I picked St James Hotel :)All in all, if this hotel was in San Jose, CA, its room would not cost more than $25 - $30. So when you rent this room, keep that in mind. The only reason why we stayed in this hotel was because it was the cheapest in times square, and the next one in line was $75 more expensive per night. If you dont have a geographical limitation like that, or if you can find as cheap or cheaper place in times square, go for that..... I guess. I would probably never stay in this hotel again, but I have to say that the hotel this time around was ok.	
Oct 6 2004	Great Location for the Price	As mentioned in the other reviews, the St. James Hotel is undergoing renovations. The accomodations are very basic, but the rooms are clean and the bathrooms newly remodeled. The main attraction is the location, only one block to Times Square. It is a great place if you are looking for an inexpensive place to sleep in a convenient New York location (We paid $99 for a Saturday night in September 2004). The staff was helpful and stored our luggage for us after check-out so that we could enjoy NY before taking a late flight. There is a sign to mark the hotel, but you have to look UP on the side of the building! We would definitely stay there again, especially when the reconstruction is complete.	
Oct 4 2004	Location Location Location	What this hotel lacks in amenities it makes up for in the most important factor in real estate: Location. This is truly a no-frills operation -- don't except more than a couple plastic cups, a couple tiny soaps, and a TV (CNN and a few minor channels). The carpet and walls in the room we were in had small stains. If you expect to spend quite a bit of time at your hotel, this is not a good choice.On the other hand, if you spend most of your time outside: hitting the theaters, Rockefeller Center, cruising around Times Square or other parts of midtown Manhattan, the location is great. We popped back in the hotel several times a day just to plunk down our stuff and take a short breather before heading out again. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. If you get a midnight (or later) craving, plenty of restaurants within a 5 minute walk are open till 1 or 2 am, even later on weekends. If desperate, a 24 hours-open McDonalds is around the corner.For our purposes, it was just fine. If you are used to a little more luxury and are willing to pay more, look elsewhere.	
Sep 21 2004	Awful	We stayed at this hotel this past Saturday night. We paid $199 for a quad room, because we needed 2 double beds. When we arrived, we found an OLD, very run down room with one double bed and one twin bed. Not even enough space for what we had reserved! My husband went down to the front desk (which was closed in by plexiglass and very sketchy) and complained, but the best they could do was give us a roll-away bed. The room had extremely old bedspreads and furniture, including a folding chair!! The bathroom was just as bad, which light blue tile and a faucet that wobbled all over the place. The beds creaked when you sat down on them. It was just horrible.Needless to say we will NEVER stay here again, and I highly recommend to others that you do not. It appeared that they were renovating the lobby, but our room had not been renovated. Two of the walls were cream (dirty dirty!) and two were a very bright turquoise green. Just terrible. We were so angry that we had to pay this much for this dump. For some reason all of NYC was sold out for the weekend.	
Sep 10 2004	Was Interesting and Enjoyable	I stayed at the St. James recently and found it enjoyable although not what I expected. I stayed for three nights (Sept 6-9) and for the price I paid it was quite efficient.While the cable was basic and could have used a few more English speaking main channels such as CBS, NBC and ABC, I did get several movie channels to spend my time in the hotel watching. We were given clean towels every day and when we asked for a better room we were given one.It is under renovations currently so it's not up to par with the many more expensive hotels around but the building has history and it was comfortable, clean and safe. There is a large sign above the door, however it is unlighted so may be hard to recognize during the night time. The Third floor elevator door had a problem but it was an interesting addition to the New York experience.I recommend this to people on a budget, who wish to stay in the Theater district within walking distance of Rockefeller Center and Times Square. Lots of available restaurants and stores near by. It is very close to many attractions and is close to many public transportation outlets.The staff was friendly and tried to accommodate us as much as they could.	
Sep 9 2004	Not Recommended - you get what you pay for	We stayed at the St. James Hotel in Times Square the night before and the night after a cruise. We shared a room with 2 beds with another couple the first night and we pulled back the covers on the bed and found hairs all over the sheets. It took well over an hour before we could get new sheets to remake the beds ourselves because the desk clerk didn't have a key for housekeeping. I am left to wonder if he pulled the 'clean' sheets from some dirty hamper because they were also dirty with globs of something black stuck to them. What an issue just to get clean sheets! You have to wonder why you can get a hotel room in Times Square for $99 a night, and I thought it was because they didn't provide things like face cloths, soap, kleenex, alarm clocks (bring your own folks!) and because they used the cheapest toilet paper known to man. It goes much further. They haven't painted in a long while, so the walls are dinged, scratched and have black marks all over. The bathroom door looked like it had been punched and there was a hole in it, but you couldn't see right through. The showers were dirty, the carpets looked pretty grimy too. I have read other people's reviews on this site that said it was clean, but I found exactly the opposite.The location certainly is convenient, and if you're not fussy about cleanliness, you can't beat the price.We were so happy to get on our cruise ship where the bedrooms and bathrooms were so clean! I hated the fact that we had to come back for one more night at the St. James afterwards. If I could have switched hotels I would have, but it was in the middle of the Republican Convention and we couldn't find a place.We have learned our lesson. From now on we'll be going back to the Park Hotel South which costs a little more and is more out of the way (but on the subway line), but worth the effort to get the cleanliness and luxury of a decent hotel.	
Sep 1 2004	A good location but an unprofessionally run hotel.	Stayed August 27-30,2004Lobby is still not finished. No workman working on it. The glass partition in lobby still in place despite a formal reception desk. Bathroom was nicely redone, but the rooms (we had three in our group) were uneven as to state of remodeling. Room 414 badly stained carpet. Tiny, tiny soap packages in soap dish. No other ameneties not even a box a Kleenex. TV had only some channels but not ABC or CBS. Could get CNN. Other rooms in our group got other channels, but not always the ones we had. Good location. Management seems untrained. Does not use any sort of computer reservations system. Uses old fashioned metal keys and unable to find more than one key for some of our rooms. Seems to keep everything on note paper and xerox copies of emails!	
Aug 3 2004	Wonderful Time!	Hey!I stayed at the St. James durring summer '04 and had a splendid time! The staff is very kind, and caring. Beautiful, marbol floor lobby, wood decorations all over. A new front desk is currently being built, which is beautiful, and yes renovations are being made. Yet, the hotel is very nice for the price. Way above average for the price.Great location, right next door to a great/nice/good food deli. Half a block (minuite walk) from all of time square (same block as the Famous Planet Hollywood from The Apprentice...ya fiyad!) And really is just a grand place. A bar is also being built in the rear lobby, so thats something to look foward to on your second visit there. They are going to be expanding thier staff soon...to doormen, more security. Clearly this is a place, to go to while the price is still low! How do i know this to? Well when you have nothing to do, and you don't want to watch the great New York TV upstairs in your comfortable room. Just talk to the very pleasent, hotel staff (the elderly women at the front desk especially)...very kind people, and they really care about their customers. The rooms were very nice for what you pay too. Nice, clean, white bathrooms, great carpeted rooms with made up beds, and towels. Nice artwork on the walls, windows too, to catch that cool night breeze. Now oppsed to what some have said, there IS a sign saying HOTEL ST. JAMES...right outside of the hotel, it is quite huge and I am suprised they missed it. But while your looking up anyways at the sign, dont forget to check out the great architecture of the building, beautiful moldings...and it sure shows that this building is a true antique. Don't miss out on the historical, and newly renovated Hotel St. James. Stay there while you can for such a low price!...im sure the prices will at least double in years to come!	
Aug 2 2004	great hotel for the price	This is definitely a gem in midtown. Excellent location. THe staff let me check in at 11 am instead of 3 pm. also when we left, they let me leave the luggage IN THE ROOM until 7 pm, when I swung by the hotel and picked it up on the way to the bus. clean bathroom, clean room, well worth the $99 i paid. the towels were not fluffy and soft, instead they were more like sandpaper. but that's hardly a significant complaint. definitely consider this hotel if you are on a budget.	
Jul 16 2004	I loved the hotel	I stayed there in december ,the room was fine and the location was spot on right next to time square .Would recommend and stay there again myself	
Jul 12 2004	A decent Hotel a 1/2 block away from times square. Clean but simple.	nice clean hotel. currently finishing renovations. Rooms are small but renovated. no amenities in hotel. quick service. VERY close to times square (45th between Broadway and 6th av.) . good for 115 bucks US per night.	
Jul 8 2004	Not so bad for the $$ 	Based upon some of the posted reviews, my girlfriend and I were very concerned about our stay at this hotel June 3 - 7. However, if you're doing NYC on a budget and are simply looking for a place to sleep with a clean private bath Hotel St James is a reasonable choice. The staff was friendly and accomodating (they do have irons if you need one) and the location to the subway, theatre &amp; bars/restaurants cannot be beat for the price we paid ($100 per night.) Do patronize the deli next door as the food is great, the staff very friendly and the great prices. You do need to bring soap, shampoo &amp; hair dryer. Our room DID have working a/c and was not facing a street so we gladly sacrificed the view for a quiet night's sleep. If you can overlook dust on the window shades and worn carpeting, and just want a safe place to rest up in between jaunts in the city this is a decent spot. For the cost and great location in Times Sq. we would stay here again.	
Jul 1 2004	Be careful	We stayed at the St. James June 24-26. The rooms are OK and, as others have pointed out, a decent place to stay for the cost.Be careful though. On one occassion, I returned to the hotel to pick something up, and realized that my wife still had the key. The front desk did not have a duplicate key, but the woman at the front desk got the master key set from the maintenance man, and then handed the ENTIRE set to me and sent me to the elevator. She never once verified my ID, despite repeatedly asking her if she should. Of course, I could have had the run of every room!	
Jun 18 2004	Close to everything	Can't say I've ever stayed in a hotel quite like this one, seems to be in transition and improving. While the hotel is a little run down, the bathroom was clean and the closeness to everything we wanted todo was terrific. The Deli next door was great for late night snacks. There's a fantastic Italian Restaurant just a few steps down the street toward Times Square. Radio City and NBC are nearby along with St Patricks Cathedral and Shopping. The theatres are also within a few minutes walk. If you're looking for a reasonably priced place to shower and rest your head, this is it. This hotel truly is for the budget-minded traveler, but we had more money for shopping and nice restaurants..... keep in mind that there's no doorman, but we had no problem hailing a Taxi right outside the hotel doors. Bring your own shampoo, hair dryer, and travel iron. Hey, its New York, imagine the history there must be in these old hotel buildings!!!	
Jun 11 2004	good for the money		
Jun 1 2004	Not so bad!		
May 20 2004	Good value!
