	Small rooms but good hotel	We stayed in the club rooms and found them to be slightly small but large enough when you are rarely in the room. They were adequately cleaned and the club rooms come with breakfast which was great, plenty of fruit, yoghurts, bagels, toast, juices, cerials and coffee. The check in was quick and the staff were always friendly. On the last day one of the group though that they had lost their passport and the hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful, particularly Curtis. We would definitely stay again	
	Perfect location	Having booked this trip in March 09 i was slightly worried over some of the reviews i read and now i can now say there is no pleasing some people!! On checking in the service couldnt have been any better and we were shown to a nice room on the 8th floor with 2 double beds. Not a massive room but not small by any means and was clean with no sign on any bugs! service from security was good and made us feel safe knowing people had to show there room cards before using the lifts.All in all we would definately go back to the Milford although maybe after renovation prices wont be so attractive, which would be a shame as we couldnt have got a hotel in a better location.	
	good hotel excellent location	hotel is closing soon for renovation for approx two years but wanted to say what a superb hotel -friendly staff and excellent location just around corner from time square	
	Old and tired	Even my supposed 'upgraded' corner room was dumpy and small with old smelly furniture and drapes and a saggy mattress. I'd received an 'upgrade' because I had to wait a half hour at check in while the clerk tried to find my reservation, which had been filed under a misspelling of my name. This was after waiting in a 15-minute line to check in. (There was always a line at the front desk.)The bathroom was clean and internet in the room worked well.The location is good if you want to be near Times Square, but other than that I don't know why you would want to stay here. The area is mobbed with tourists, and the lines and people milling around the theaters make it difficult to walk from the hotel to points east. For the price, there are better choices.	
	value for money	The Milford Plaza is a fantastically based hotel which is only around the corner from Times Square and is in walking distance to fifth avenue, rockafella and empire state building if you are up for the walk. Right in the middle of Broadway so if you are looking for a show this hotel is a must. The room was a bit small, a bit grubby and really warm, we had to put the air con on in November. The only downside is that our room was on the small side, smelt very musty and was way to hot otherwise it was a good base to sleep and leave your belongings behind. there is a safe in the bedroom and we found the staff to be totally trustworthy, very helpful and really pleasant. The Milford Plaza is due to close in December 09 for refurbishment though i must say it is looking a bit tired and could do with it. would definately go back once its been refurbished well worth a visit. Oh and take no notice of other comments about bed bugs and cockroaches there were definately none in our bedroom and found the linen very clean, enjoy	
	friendly hotel with excellent security	my friend and i stopped at the milford plaza from 31 oct to 5th nov 09. we are both in our 40s. I read the reviews after we had already booked and was 50/50 of what to expect. I prayed that we hadnt made a mistake and i needent have worried On arrival we were shown to our room which was a deluxe room with 2 double beds on the 16th floor. we were expecting the room to be very very small because of what the reviews had said. We do not think the room was to small for what we needed and felt very comfortable there. There was even a hairdryer in the bathroom which was great. Also there was a safe which was free and all u had to do was select a password of your own to open it. our room was cleaned daily. The only noise we heard was from the emergency services blaring past the hotel.The security could not have been any better and you felt very safe staying here. You had to show your room key before you was allowed in the lifts which was good and made u feel even safer knowing that any body up to no good would not get past these security men. The underground station is just outside the hotel and is so much cheaper than getting taxis. we used it quite alot while in newyork. the best thing though about this hotel is its location. right in the middle of new york city.Not forgetting the theatre district.We asked the security man if he new of any good restaurants to go to and he directed us to one on 9th ave called west side about 5 to 10 min walkfrom the milford where if u like pancakes this is the place to eat. The local police also eat here which is a good sign of good food. service is top marks. and the orange juice is lovely also. This hotel though is closing on the 12 dec for 18months to 2yrs ive heard for renovations and my cousin who lives in newyork told me they are goint to build on top of the milford plaza apartments. So next time i guess you will have to dig deeper into ur purses to stay here, i dont think it will be a budgit hotel for much longer but i do hope im wrong. Also watch the taxi drivers from the airport we got stung by them. from the airport to the milford should have cost us 64dollers as thats what the man wrote on the paperwork he gave to the driver but the driver went to the wrong hotel as he mistook what we said so charges us 84dollers. We were told after by the reception at the milford that they have one set price no matter where they drop us. Goodluck and no need to worry about this hotel it isnt dirty at least not on our floor. great hotel. great location. what more can i say xx Bridget from coventry.	
Nov 23 2009 	Great Service and Great Location	Just spent an awesome weekend in NYC. I booked this trip in the spring.As a vacation package. I read Trip Advisor so I was concerned about our room. No need to worry. Of course the room was small it's NY. We booked twin beds. The room was clean , bathroom was clean. The service was right on. The hotel does need updating, but it offers everything we needed. It's located 1 block from Times Square!!!I would recommend Milford Plaza.	
Nov 20 2009 	I have my own New York bed bug!	Thos of you who are squeamish look away now! We were at the Milford Plaza in October 09. Stayed for a week but moved rooms 3 times! On the morning of the second day I spied something moving across the top of the sheet - thinking that it may be a spider and not being over fond of insects I carefully crushed the little blighter between my thumb and fore-finger, through the sheet and then sat up. The 'crush' had not actually killed it as in spite of a copious amount of bright red blood, the damned thing was trying to crawl away - I put my glasses on and looked closer. I pressed harder and finally squashed what I thought looked like a bed bug - the amount of bright red blood was a clear indication it had had a big feed- yeah on me! My partner looked up an identification on the internet on his laptop and sure enough it was a classic bed bug! I felt sick and looked closer at the bed. It was a baby bed bug as very tiny and I thought maybe I could kind of live with thinking there weren't any more to be seen. We also realised that this was a notifiable incident and promised ourselves we would report it to the hotel. As it was squashed we hadn't any evidence and left it in the end thinking a lot of time would be wasted off our trip and the ensuing hassle probably not worth it. My partner offered to swap beds so that I didn't fret about it. Anyway the next morning my partner threw back the bed covers to get up. When he came back from the shower he remarked, 'hey, look at this!' Sure enough there was a large, mature, fat,bed bug looking extremely well-fed, crawling across the bottom sheet. 'OK that's it!' I screamed and we trapped it and got it into my ear-plug container and shut the lid tight. We took the box down to see the manager who acted innocent and really surprised and changed our room to an upgraded room on a different floor. We had to fill out an incident sheet but later found the Milford had already been recently registered on www. bedbugregistry.com the notifiable pests database! Nothing came of our report and no money refunded. Suggest travelers check out this database before booking into a hotel! Mould (what The Milford is more famous for) I can almost cope with but not creepy crawlies! Ew!!! We still have the little critter in the container and it was remarkably resilient as it actually survived for an amazing long time without air and food. Arrrgh!	
Nov 20 2009 	Good location rooms not so good	The hotel was near Time Square and that was definitely the only thing good about it. I am sorry that I am being so critical but I couldn't stand the room I stayed in. Apart from small the carpet was full of other guests hair, and the bathroom wasn't clean. I am aware that the price was very good but I wasn't expecting the room to be so dirty.	
Nov 19 2009 	CheapClean And Cheerful.	For the price you are paying to stay in a central location in Manhattan you can't go wrong. Got the Bus from JFK Airport to The Port Authority Bus Station which is 2 blocks away. Times Sq and many a theatre on your doorstep. The subway and many place to eat are just outside the Hotel door. If your looking for a Hotel Room to just relax in after a days shopping or site seeing then this Hotel is highly recommended.	
Nov 17 2009 	Location is the only thing for it	Location is great, it's a shame the staff and rooms don't match. Beware when checking out, I used the express key drop off DON&quot;T when I checked my credit card they had charged me $50.00 (?) I've sent a few e-mails asking what the $50.00 was for they do not reply, just send them back unanswered. The staff are the grumpiest I've come accross in the states. But as I stated very good location and I guess you get what you pay for!!	
Nov 17 2009 	Nice Hotel in the Heart of Manhattan	Brilliant Location, Close to TImes Square. Our room was quite nice although it was very small. Next time I will upgrade to an M-Club room as they are more spacious and modern.	
Nov 13 2009 	Don't be fooled by location not worth it!	Well, let me start with a positive, there were no bedbugs! However, that is about the only thing to say about that!First, the hotel advertises internet connection and wireless service in rooms. This is false! There is a cute little card in every room stating that it is available but it is in fact, not. After 2 days of requesting a change to a room where internet was available we were told that there was a business center on the third floor with internet access but could not use our own laptop. This was useless especially if you are trying to complete work for a company,I was also on crutches due to a hip fracture. You could only access the elevator to the ground floor with a security code, which they refused to give me. I had to contact a security guard each time. I was there for 4 days!Also, beware of the shower! You are either running to the back of the bathtub to escape the scalding hot water (again, hip fracture!) or standing there when the water automatically shuts off only to return freezing cold! Again, there is another cute sign in the bathroom warning you that this is how the water temperature is regulated! HELLO it IS 2009! I know you are in NYC and really not too concerned with the hotel room, but please be advised this is definitely not worth your money.	
Nov 11 2009 	Unbeatable location if you want to pay the price	Fantastic location thats near all the major broadway shows, times square, restaurants, TKTS Store, and right near the bus and metro stations. From the Milford we were able to get everywhere with ease and it was nice to see a show and be able to walk home.Rooms are very small. We had two very small singles that were comfortable.No faults with check in/out and staff.Business centre and gym available. The business centre allows you to print boarding passes for free.The truth is you can't beat the location, but if you do your research NY transport system is so good you can stay about anywhere near a metro line and get to where you want with ease so you can save money.	
Nov 8 2009 	Not a bad deal - PERFECT location	We spent one night here - the location is almost unbeatable! There must be at least eight Broadway theaters within one block of this location. The room was a bit small but manageable. According to their website, the entire place will shut down for major renovation. I hope they completely gut the place and build more spacious rooms. This place could bring in HUGE profits if they do the 'right' job in the remake. We stayed on the 19th floor and could easily hear the busy traffic on the street all night from 8th avenue (even though our window did not face the street) - sirens, honking horns, truck engines, loud passersby, etc.	
Nov 6 2009 	Friendly Staff adequate rooms great location very secure.	Travelled this week to NYC with 3 friends, and we had booked the Milford. A week earlier, I had read many reviews, a lot of them unsavory. Most of them were about the unfriendly staff and bedbugs. Since I had did the booking, was expecting the worse. Was pleasantly surprised! Hotel was very nice, staff extremely friends, rooms were clean and adequate. Hallways were quiet, and we liked the fact that the elevators were only accessible by people that were staying and had to produce a room key. So no worries about anyone going up the elevator, that didn't belong. Hotel was close to Times Square, shopping, restaurants, plays. We ate at a restaurant around the corner, Juniors. Well know deli, we had breakie there, and a late night cheesecake and red velvet cake . Their bakery is open till midnight. Overall, I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel. And if I were travelling solo, which I quite often do, would feel totally safe and secure.	
Nov 6 2009 	Excellant Hotel and location	Having read all the reviews on tripadvisor, I was very uncertain as to what to expect, however having flown in to JFK with American Airlines the journey was very short using the Airtrain to Jamaica Centre then using the New York Subway (E) to W42nd Street, coming up the steps and finding the hotel across the road right on the door step.We stayed in one of the Club rooms for 5 nights, located on the 23rd floor with excellent views of Time Square, and surprisingly was quite a spacious room with ample storage space, safe, and good sized bath room. The breakfast was good, a selection of pastries, cereals, juices, tea and coffee in a nice setting, as we were only using this for somewhere to sleep and not to live in for our entire stay this is an excellant hotel.We visited the Statue of Liberty (Monument pass required if you want to go inside the base and pedestal), The top of the Rock, Central Park, Macy's, Bloomingdales, Apple store, F.A.O Schwartz and Tiffanys. We had an excellent seafood meal at the Famous Oyster Bar on Sixth avenue (near the top towards Central Park), and also the Empire Diner (www.empire-diner.com) a good authentic old american diner looking a little tired, but the food and the service was good. A globe type sculpture can be found in Battery Park which once stood in the Word Trade Centre, and also a Bull on Wall street is worth a visit (notice how shiny the testicles are from people rubbing to get good fortune), The Brooklyn Bridge (walk to the top of Warren Street, past the New York City Mayors Office) has got the most amazing view from not only the middle but also walk the whole length into brooklyn and keep looking back (Awsome), if your feeling energentic take a walk down Dover Street to the very bottom and look at the bridge from this angle, try this before walking across the bridge!!!!.Overall an excellant holiday, really looking forward to visiting New York again, sooooooon.	
Nov 4 2009 	Average hotel but in great central location	Ten members of our extended family stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in October. Initial impressions when entering the foyer were good but the bedrooms were a bit disappointing. We had 3 rooms in total between us. They were all a bit compact with very little storage space so we had to live out of our suitcases. The standard of overall cleanliness was an issue and seemed to be variable between our 3 rooms which were all on different floors. If there was a complaint it was the lifts which were often insufficent for the number of people wishing to use them. However the great plus point about this hotel is its location which is a very short walk away from Times Square and Broadway. As the hotel does not provide breakfast we asked one of the staff, who were all very friendly, if they could suggest a nearby diner at which to eat. The Westway Diner at 614 Ninth Avenue between 43rd and 44th Street was suggested. It proved to be so good that we went there all three mornings of our stay.This was our first trip to New York so what were the highlights? Visits to Bloomingdales, Macy's and Tiffany's resulted in some spending of cash and the more modestly priced Century 21 led to more expenditure. However the highlights were probably going to the observation deck at the top of the Rockefeller Centre and the trip across the Hudson on the Statten Island Ferry. Both visits were undertaken in good weather and proved to me most memorable. Another memorable moment was viewing the 'Eleven Tears' memorial to the members of American Express staff who died within the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. The concept and execution of this memorial was handled so sensitively that we were choked with emotion at viewing it. More visitors to the Big Apple should put a visit to this on their list of must do things when in New York. Finally we were told that the hotel would be closing later this year for a major refurbishment programme. While all the negative points will hopefully be addressed during this period I suspect that the revamp will result in greatly increased prices which may place the hotel out of our price range in the future.	
Nov 4 2009 	Can't beat the location	Lavish, spacious, modern, luxurious - sorry it's none of those, in fact it' s pretty average really but it's location makes up for any shortcomings - you really are right in Times Square! The Milford is reasonably priced (for New York), our room was small but neat and clean, the staff were courteous and helpful so what else is there to worry about??? In terms of value for money, I wouldn't hesitate staying here again.	
Nov 3 2009 	$500 for one night stay NOT WORTH IT	My car broke down when I was in NY heading home to NJ. The Milford was the only hotel with a room available that late at night. I was charged $500 for a &quot;closet&quot; with a bed shoved in it and a filthy bathroom. RUN FROM THIS PLACE. DO NOT BOOK HERE!YOU WILL REGRET IT!	
Oct 29 2009 	Fabulously located hotel	Just returned from the Milford Plaza, yes the room wasnt the largest I have ever stayed in but it was perfectly OK for our group of 3. The bathroom was very pokey but adequate. Staff were very friendly and helpful.Location wise the hotel is perfect, 2 minutes walk to Times Square and very close to the Subway. Lots of Deli's located close to the hotel, we recommend Junior's for breakfast.Overall it was a very nice hotel and I wouldn't look at staying anywhere else when I return to New York.	
Oct 29 2009 	Crumbling in places but perfect for what we wanted!	I read some really bad reviews about this hotel but since we got a good deal on the price of the hotel it seemed like the best one. It is smack bang in mid town Manhattan -perfect to get around. Subway station across the street made it easy to get around. 5 minutes from Times Square. Things such as chipped paint on the doors made it not the best hotel, however everywhere was clean, bathroom, rooms etc. The cleaners did a good job everyday and we had what they call &quot;milford club room&quot; which meant we had access to the Milford Club Lounge. This meant that we got a free breakfast which had lots of things: Croissants, pastries, about 5 different cereals and a choice of milk, coffee machine and tea available, fresh juices, fresh fruit, yoghurts, lots of bread and toasters with spreads. We were quite impressed with the choice. Also there was free internet usage which was handy to look up things. Staff at the conceirge were helpful too. Hairdryers in room weren't too brilliant so if you like a good hairdryer ladies take your own. We heard while we were there that they are completely renovating the hotel so I've got a feeling it would be a lot better next time round if we visit again. Apparently it is closed for most of 2010 but I may be wrong about that! Considering the location and price we paid thought it was a good hotel.	
Oct 28 2009 	Ugly somewhat unfriendly but amazingly located and cheap	You get what you pay for in life. Many people moan about the quality of the rooms in this hotel. They're small, they're ugly, and aesthetically there really aren't any redeeming features. But this hotel is safe, it's clean (mostly), I slept well both times I stayed, and it's bang on Times Square. If you want a pretty room PAY MORE, or get less central!!!! If you want a fantastic base to explore New York then book a room. Sardi's is on the next street, sit at the bar and have a good time.The only big negative from my point of view is that there's no dining at the hotel - so no breakfasts. But with all the deli places around that's ok.TOP TIP: This is a BIG hotel with a lot of rooms. If your room is really disgusting then ask to change it. I changed mine three times last time I stayed and eventually got something marginally better than the first ones I was given. The staff are happy to do this, and if they're not - who cares? It is their job, just be polite and get the best you can.I stay in this hotel almost every time I'm in New York now now - it's good budget accommodation and there is TOO MUCH TO DO IN NEW YORK to waste time in the room.	
Oct 28 2009 	A good hotel	Well once again I had to go to NY, clicked over to Essentravel.com and got a great deal on the Milford Plaza. A good hotel, not the plaza!! But hey what is hehe. Staff was helpful, room service was good, I got a good nights rest.I recommend it!!	
Oct 27 2009 	Wouldn't mind paying an extra $50 to stay elsewhere!	My first impression was great. Friendly staff, nice looking lobby, great location, etc. In fact, I arrived extremely early, shortly after 11am knowing that check-in did not begin until 3pm, but they let me have the room early anyway. I was impressed....until I got to the room. No it's not the small room size that bothered me, as I'm not someone who cares for room size and well aware that a large or even an average sized room in NYC is rare. But the issue here was how unclean the room was. Everything looked unpleasant. The sheets didn't even look clean. I am also quite surprised that not a lot of people who reviewed this hotel complained about the PAPER THIN walls? You can literally hear every single word the guests in the rooms beside you are saying. And I wouldn't advise taking a mid-day nap or sleeping early if you need to. You'll get woken up constantly because it will sound like someone is trying to break into your room! The walls are so thin that this is what it sounds like when your neighbors are opening and closing their room doors.Some nice things about the hotel... the location (steps away from a subway enterance and minutes away from Times Square), and the price (the lowest I can find). The Gym is also convenient if you like working out, and if you don't have a laptop but you want to check your email you have 2 options. It looks like the TV's in the rooms are equipped with some kind of internet access to do light web-surfing. Also, you could go to the 3rd floor and use the Business Center ($5 minimum charge applies though). Overall, not too bad. But next time, I will spend the extra $50 and stay somewhere a little better.	
Oct 27 2009 	excellent staff	We recently stayed at the Milford for a week. The staff is very helpful and courteous and you really do feel safe. Time square is a short 2 block walk and numerous Broadway shows are just around the corner. Good dining right across the street with plenty of options and decent prices. Never did see the restaurant and was told by another traveller you needed to be a member to go into it.The hotel is clean, the rooms are small and not very appealing to the eye, but the location makes it all worth while.Would definitely return!!	
Oct 27 2009	Great LocationEnjoyable Stay!	The Location alone is a reason to stay here, it was right down the street from Times Square and all the theatres. For the price you pay i think it was great! The hotel room was on the smaller side but it was clean and there was enough room for all of our luggage. The sink in the bathroom would drip occasionally and would also take a while to drain but i think thats all i can say on the downside of this hotel. Luckily we had a room on the side of the hotel with a view on the other side you would be viewing a brick wall. I would recommend this hotel if you are trying to stay on a budget but dont want to stay somewhere disgusting!	
Oct 23 2009 	Great stay	I have stayed at the Milford 4 times yes it is a old hotel but for the price who cares 5 min. walk from time Square, I am sad to hear it is closing for almost 2 years for renovations because the prices are sure to go up... I hope not I like it just the way it is	
Oct 21 2009 	Do not stay at this hotel.	Hotel needs serious upgrades. It is old and the rooms are very small. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls. I have stay in Super 8 motels that were nicer than the Milford Plaza.	
Oct 21 2009 	We felt like we were scammed and forced to accept the room	We came from Ohio for one night and a Broadway Show. The theatre was half a block from the hotel. I called and spoke to the reservation desk a month before our trip. My wife is in a wheelchair. Most handicap accessible rooms have only one bed and a roll in shower. We require 2 beds and a bathtub, however, as long as the bathroom door is a normal width (anywhere from 32&quot; to 36&quot; is normal) we would have no problems. When I spoke with the reservations desk, they guaranteed the bathroom door was adequate and the hotel itself was accessible. On our arrival, we found we had to take a seperate elevator to get to the lobby, then a second elevator to our 15th floor room. God help my wife if there was an evacuation! Our room was approximately 10' X 17&quot; with a bathroom no larger than a closet. The door was NOT large enough for a 29 inch wheel chair to get through. To add to the experience, the bathroom was dirty and trashy. There was a metal tissue container on the wall that was 1/3 chrome and 2/3 rust. The bathroom mirror was literally framed with a pine 8 X 10 frame, scratched and chipped. To add insult to injury, the door sign in the room, which I thought was required by law to list the prices of the room, listed this room at $95.00 a night, not the $287.00 we paid for the room. Frankly, the employees we spoke with were friendly but had no interest in our problem. Basically it was take it or leave it. You'll still be charged for the room at this late date. This hotel room was the quintessential negative stereotype of New York.	
Oct 20 2009 	Great Location!	We stayed at Milford Plaza for three nights, Oct 15-18, 2009; had a great room, double beds; room was clean; no complaints! We will definitely stay here again! And, the price was very good! This was not our first trip to New York, so we were very well pleased!	
Oct 20 2009 	Milford Plaza - handy location in nice hotel	Booked this on the net without knowing much about it. Fab location just around the corner from Times Square. Nice staff, got a discount on the room rate via their website, rooms were clean - nothing amazing - but comfy and the bathroom was fine.	
Oct 19 2009 	Good Service 	Just returned from a long weekend in NYC. First of all, the location of this hotel was fabulous. We could look down and see the Billy Elliott and Lion King Theatres...just a half block away. Check-in was smooth. We arrived about 12:30, and our room was ready early. Security is great, and they have the most efficient &quot;private&quot; elevator system I've ever seen. The rooms are small of course, but they are in desperate need of updating. We never could get the TV to work...despite 2 maintenance calls. We weren't there to watch TV so it didn't matter much. We had the &quot;Club&quot; upgrade, but you couldn't tell by the room! The wallpaper was peeling off the wall, and the bathroom was rusted out and worn. The bed was fairly comfortable. Street noise was ok--we had a corner room on the 15th floor. The best part of the Club upgrade was the free breakfast on the 3rd floor. It was delicious! Nothing hot to eat, but a large assortment of cereals, breads, muffins, juices, etc. We enjoyed it each morning. The two plays we saw, Billy Elliott and Wicked were fantastic. We had advanced tickets for Billy Elliott but were told to show up 2 hours prior to Wicked for the &quot;Cancellation&quot; line. Sure enough, we were third in line and able to secure 8th row seats for $126...incredible! We also thoroughly enjoyed the food tour of Greenwich Village. Seffra was a fabulously entertaining guide. Well worth the $48 price for 3 hours...my 14 year old was a bargain at $20 for her tour.We loved the Times Square location of the hotel where we could get anywhere quickly. However, this is not a hotel I would stay in again.	
Oct 17 2009 	THE BEST value for the NY $	this was our 3rd stay @ the Milford; each time gets better and better!we were on the 18th flr, and had a GREAT view of 8th ave; the 'high tech' elevators assured that we never waited for a ride!the rooms have been updated and while small, they were very clean and adequate.you can NOT beat this location! the hotel is adjacent to several broadway theaters, a few minutes from times square, and a block from &quot;restaurant row&quot;. AND, a block down from LATTITUDES, a 4-story bar w/ awesome happy hour specials and a rooftop bar!the staff is very accomdating, and for the price, you can't beat the milford!my only complaint is that they charge $3/bag to store your luggage after you check out, but, that's not really that big of a deal.	
Oct 16 2009 	Stay away from the Milford	It was the most unpleasant and unhealthiest hotel I've ever stayed in. We had mold in our room, complained after a night, so they put us in another room with even more mold. (have pictures). when we complained again, they were more concerned with telling us to be calm rather than calming us down. The room was cleaned twice in the 5 nights we stayed there, and the bathroom had filth on the walls from the previous guests. The doormen only milled about chatting amongst themselves never opening a door, No coffee anywhere in the hotel and they even have signs no eating. Difficult to speak with anyone there. When I went to request my prepaid shuttle be contacted the first words out of their mouth was NO we use... Really?? I would definitely not stay there again.	
Oct 14 2009 	Decent value in midtown	I attended a convention in New York City and spent four nights at the Milford Plaza. I booked the hotel through the convention housing bureau for a rate of about $180 per night. When attending this convention in the past I have stayed at the Marriott Marquis; however, I needed to trim some cost from my trip this time, and the Milford Plaza was almost $100 per night less expensive.The Milford is an older hotel, and I saw some reviews that were not favorable. The age of a property is not important to me. I want a room that's secure, quiet and clean. After arriving and spending my first night, I knew the Milford was just fine.As I said, it's not the newest hotel. There are several layers of paint on the molding. The door knob on the closet was broken. There were some signs of previous water damage in the bathroom. It's not pristine, but it's not unacceptable. If you expect everything to be brand new, look somewhere else and pay a great deal more.The room had two queen beds, a dresser, a nightstand and a single chair (like from a dining set). There was no desk, which I missed this trip because I had some business work to do. I was able to set a laptop on the edge of the bed and lean over. There are rooms with a single bed, although I do not know if there are desks in those rooms.The room has wired Internet access. I was told there would be a daily charge for it ($11), but there were no charges on my statement when I checked out. The access was reliable and fast.The desk staff was courteous. The night I checked in, the toilet was already backed up in my room. I called the desk to inform them of the problem, and before I even finished explaining the situation, the operator said that maintenance and housekeeping would there in a few minutes. Maintenance arrived within 5 minutes. Housekeeping arrived 10 minutes after maintenance left. I call that fantastic service.The hotel is one block from Times Square. The A-C-E subway station is at the corner of 8th Ave and 43rd Street. The location is central to midtown.There were signs that the Milford was about to begin renovations, but I did not look to see when that would begin on the inside. There was scaffold on the outside already in Oct. 2009.I was pleased with my stay at the Milford Plaza, and I would stay here again. I reserve a full 5 rating for truly outstanding experiences, so my 4 is well deserved. I look forward to seeing the Milford Plaza after renovations. (CS)	
Oct 14 2009 	pleasant surprise	having never been to new york was concerned about choice of this hotel. Fortunately no need to be. As mentioned previously great location , excellent security,lots of fast elevators. On the minus side the shower had a mind of its own and wouldn't work unless you started with cold followed by hot and even then it didnt work. Room on higher floors nice and quiet . Guy at tour desk not overly help ful would verbally tell you many instructions but unwilling to write anything down!! Beware of street fairs outside hotel as we were not informed of this and entire street was closed meaning that our transport could not collect us from directly outside the hotel. would definately return to this hotel.	
Oct 13 2009 	Good location bad services	Old hotel, bathroom with poor facilities,Plus point: great location, next to the best places in town.Don't have internet in the room. If you need to leave your bags at reception must paid US3 per bag.	
Oct 13 2009 	Overall not bad	Excellent location... in the heart of it all and just a short walk to whatever you want. Some rooms have excellent views so keep your fingers crossed. After about 4 times having stayed there I was going to again.... booked my room on their website 3 months in advance and by chance I went back to their website 2 months before my travel date to find out they were closing for renovations. No calls, no emails nothing.... I guess they would have let me travel there get out of a cab and meet a closed hotel with a confirmed booking in my hand..hmmmm. Not pleased with the service but it's a great location and price.... maybe just need new management.	
Oct 8 2009 	Great location great vacation	It was the first time I stayed there and I would go back any minute! I was impressed by location, safety, in and out of the hotel. Employees are all very polite. I loved this place!	
Oct 8 2009 	Great Location + Great Price = Great Hotel	We stayed at the Milford for six days at the end of February. We booked our stay based on the recomendation of a colleague who has stayed in NY several times in the past and we couldn't have been happier with the results. The location is absolutely unbeatable being just a block from time square. We were with a 5 minute walk of a multitude of shows, theaters, resteraunts, transportation, attractions, and more. Being a first time visiter I was a little anxious about getting around the city, but with the hotel's central proximity we had no trouble whatsoever. Now getting a hotel close to everything is not really an impressive feat in itself, but we were able to book our room for under $100 a night which is completely unbelievable. And on top of this, the hotel is quite nice. There's really nothing fancy about the hotel, but the rooms, while small compared to a room outside of NY, was a more than adequate size for the two of us, was always clean, and had a hot shower and comfortable bed. We're not really picky about our rooms as long as they're clean and comfortable and the Milford was exactly that. My only complaints about the hotel would have been no free continental breakfast and no free wifi. I am a firm believer that in this day and age every hotel should at least provide free wifi, but given the price and the fact that a free wifi hotspot is never far in downtown Manhattan it is definately something I can live with. In the end I would definately recommend the Milford Plaza for anyone visiting Manhattan. It has a great location at a great price.	
Oct 7 2009	it was just great	I read the reviews and i wasnt expecting much. I was very pleasantly surprised! The rooms are small as are the bathrooms but adequate to collapse in. The concierge (especially Tom) was very helpful and very pleasant. The hotel is SOOOO near anything and everthing. I reallly appreciated the security imposed by the hotel. YOu have to show your room key everytime before you will be let on an elevator. I dont know why more hotels dont do this. We walked and stood and watched and just had a great time	
Oct 4 2009 	LOVE THE LOCATION	This was our 2nd stay at the Milford and I will definitely stay here again. Staff was very courteous and helpful &amp; we were pleased at the security. Room, though not large, was more than adequate &amp; clean. Beds were very comfortable. Would have liked a bit more space for toiletries in bathroom but made do. There was a bit of a snafo with requested accomdations but a call to the front desk took care of that immediately. Room was ready upon check-in and registration was quick/easy.	
Oct 1 2009 	Good Hotel Excellent Location	As previously stated this is not the Ritz or Plaza (Central Park) but, it is a good hotel in a great centrally located area. We were in room 1452 which as the previous person stated who was in 1952, it is a dual aspect room. You can see 8th Avenue and part of 44th Street. We never went for the breakfast option at the hotel but, instead went for breakfast at the 'Westway' Cafe on 9th Avenue. Average cost $7 which includes tea/coffee and orange juice - food is excellent as all of my party testified. The location is excellent for access to Times Square (100 yards), Central Park (about 800 yards) and all of theatreland. There are many places to eat, we ate at Frankie and Johnnie's, not the one opposite the hotel but on 37th Street (I think). The meal was good but a bit pricey with a statutory $88 dollar tip thrown in !!! New York is excellent and the walk through Central Park and shopping on 5th Avenue the highlights for me. Ground Zero and a trip up the Empire State Building are also a must. All in all New York is fantastic with a boat trip around Manhattan explaining the essential parts and things to do and look out for another must do attraction. I enjoyed my stay in the Big Apple, but, I do much prefer London. Sorry New Yorkers but that's just the way it is. Would I go back though ? Yes, maybe next time stay at the Plaza though....	
Oct 1 2009 	Ok Hotel good location	WE booked this hotel for two phases, pre cruise and post cruise. We came from Europe only to find out that at 8:00pm. ny time they didn't have a queen's bed room available (it was our honeymoon) so they gave us two single beds but they told us that by the morning they would change us. The following morning they gave us a room on the 24th floor with a nice view. Room was clean, good sized bed. The bathroom was very old but at least everthing worked and it was clean. We could see part of Times'Square from our window.The location is very good, only 5-10mins away on foot.On each floor there is an ice making machine where everybody can come at ANY TIME to fill his ice bucket so hopefully try to avoid a room near this machine as the rooms' doors aren't so good.For 180Euro a night bed only, it's quite expenisve but you're paying for the location also.Second part of the stay (post cruise), we had a room on the 21st floor with good view also but with a huge mirror that covers the whole bed	
Sep 29 2009 	Basic type hotel for a quick city break	LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Just got back from a 5 day stay, the original room we were offered was awful - window had a view of a brick wall, the room was small the bathroom was very old and needed a refurb and the ceiling paint was peeling - dont get me wrong, I appreciate you pay for what you get but this was worse than we expected, after going back down to reception and saying the room was far from adequate we were given room 1952 (19th floor), it had a refurbished bathroom,32&quot; LCD, dual aspect windows overlooking the city streets and was at least 30% bigger than the previous - so the rule is if you get given a dud COMPLAIN! Rooms vary in standard!In terms of location the hotel is superb, 5 minutes from times square, 2 minutes from the tube (or train as they call them) and on the door step of the theatres. The staff like most New York staff we encountered are a tad aggressive, and you tend to get treated like a number. The rooms are cleaned daily and housekeeping deal with your requests quickly. The concierge service in the main lobby is very helpful and offer a wealth of information. The hotel is old and basic so dont expect the Ritz, for a quick city break for us it was fine If you are going shopping then take the Woodbury Common Premiun outlets tour (you can buy this from the concierge), its approx 1 hour coach ride and will cost $80 but the stores are all designer outlets and offer 30-50% savings - we bought enough to make our $80 back and then some! Only book this if you are seriously going to buy plenty of clothes as the $80 price tag is steep for just a tour. On a side note we never opted for bed and breakfast as there is a great breakfast place opposite, you should also try 'Juniors' - a fantastic American diner (go out the side entrance of the hotel and walk facing right towards times square - its approx 4 minute walk) - you will be greeted with great service and food to match - portions are huge though and we usually bought one breakfast and shared approx $25 inc teas - they asked once for a 15-20% tip, we declinedSo in summary good for the price, dont expect to be amazed and it will be fine, if you get a dud room - complain, location great - staff ok, its fine to get your head down - lets face it 90% of the time you will be out in the city anway!	
Sep 26 2009 	i enjoyed my stay	The location was incredible. rooms were clean and service was great.We stayed one night and would stay again. However our room the air was not working properly , the toilet did not flush properly and the shower was not spraying or draining as it should.	
Sep 25 2009 	The good and the bad...	This was our first time in NY so we weren't sure where to stay but did some research and found the Milford. It has pros and cons.Pros: great location - it's two blocks from Times Square and close to subways; friendly staff - we got in early and they were very accommodating getting us into a room before check-in; room cleaned daily - room was always cleaned, new towels issued; elevators were quck - you enter the floor you need and it displays which elevator is available so it's pretty quick; security is good - you had to show your room key each time you wanted to get on the elevators so only guests can get in; luggage storage - we had a few hours before we needed to head to the hotel so they have an area to store your luggage for a small fee that was reasonable.Cons: small rooms, tiny bathrooms, kind of dirty walls &amp; wallpaper in bathroom was coming off. We pulled the top comforter to find the next blanket with spots. Wall had some dirt or somthing on it. Pictures of rooms advertised must be of the suites....certainly NOT the regular rooms; no free wi-fi so we paid for service but signal strenght was poor. Expected more for the nightly room rate.It wasn't a bad hotel but do your research for a hotel that's newer and has more amenities for the same price.	
Sep 24 2009 	Bed factory	Tired and tiny room with broken air con. Out dated, pint sized shower cubicle but with good shower head.. Adequate wardrobe but no hangers. Efficient lift system. Friendly. Good location. Rip - off for theatre tickkets. Would not reccomend.	
Sep 24 2009 	Greate choice for the money and location	I was not dissapointed after my stay at the Milford Plaza. The size of the room was fine and it was clean I was on the 12th floor on 8th ave. The sound of the AC was quite high, but i've experienced the same thing at other hotels. Check for deals. If you want a secure place, a good location and a decent price, then the Milford is your place. I would certainly go back again.	
Sep 24 2009 	Fantastic value for money.	Just returned from NY and stayed at the Milford Plaza for 5 nights.Hotel room was clean. Fresh towels and room cleaned dailly.Room was not the biggest but had everything you need.Hotel is a bit dated but they have plans to upgrade the hotel this winter.Security is really good and makes you feel safe. No bar or restaurant in the hotel which was disappointing, but the hotels ideal location means you,re not far from a great restaurant. Would recommend Smithy,s Bar across from the hotel on 8th Ave. but would stay out of Charley O,s bar.ABSOLUTE RIP OFF.You have to tell the barman that it,s &quot;happy hour&quot;.Shouldn,t it be the other way round?Overall I,d happily recommend this hotel.Won,t be back in New York for a few years, but I,ll dfinitely book the Milford Plaza when I return.	
Sep 23 2009 	very good location	ok its nothing fancy but the beds are clean and when in new york you should only be in your room to sleep.everything worked as it should,its in a great spot,two minute walk to times square,few bars near by,lots of good restaurants and it feels safe to walk about till stupid o'clock in the early hours of the morning as lots of police about.empire state building is a short walk and most of the other sites,i'd stay here again.	
Sep 21 2009 	Do Not Use The Hotel Phone!	We stayed at the Milford Plaza from the 15th-22nd December and had a wonderful time in New York. The Milford Plaza is very central and everything was within walking distance. The hotel would benefit from a bit of decorating as it's quite drab but as we went at Xmas the beautiful tree and lights in the hotel helped to brighten it up. The room was small but big enough to get suitcases etc stored away but again could do with a bit of an upgrade. The hotel is in the Theatre district so is obviously surrounded by Theatres. However, this didn't stop the hotel trying to rip us off when we tried to purchase tickets for The Lion King. We tried to purchase tickets at the Theatre but they were sold out for the day we required. When we went back into the hotel we saw a sign advising that the hotel could provide Theatre tickets. However, when we asked the price we couldn't believe they would try to rip their customers off by charging almost double the price. When we had tried to buy tickets at the Theatre and they didn't have them for that night, they advised us to go back just after 3pm as they sometimes have cancellations - so we did go back and ended up getting the tickets for half the price due to the fact they were selling them that day (the show didn't start until about 8pm so it was not a rush at all). I felt the hotel was good but would take the opportunity to rip you off if given the chance as we found that quite a few of the trips they were selling were hugely marked up. The icing on the cake with this hotel was the ridiculous prices they charge for the hotel phones (which conveniently isn't advertised). We made 2 phone calls back home - one 7 minute call and one 5 minute call and got a shock when we checked out. The price of the calls came to $216 which was an absolute rip off. We couldn't argue as we were literally checking out and out taxi was waiting but it left a bad taste in our mouths and really put a dampner on our stay. I think if the hotel is going to charge extortionate rates like this then they should have the decency to put the telephone rates in the room. At the time we travelled the dollar was very poor so our 12 minute call ended up costing us about £180 and for this reason I would never recomment the Milford Plaza to anyone as like I've said before - they will take any opportunity to rip you off. So be warned - if you do stay at this hotel - do not buy anything from the hotel or use the telephones as you will pay sorely for it.	
Sep 20 2009 	pretty nice hotel	Good hotel, very good location, near the local attractions and transportation. Nice room, rather small but I guess that's NYC. Very clean. performant but noisy AC. Noisy, even if our room was on the 7th floor and not on the 8th Av. good value for money if you can get a discount.	
Sep 19 2009 	Its a Tear Down	Booked thru bookings.com Rated 3 star...the orginal room on the 19 floor smelled like mold (hallway ceiling hanging with water and mold,hotel would be SHUT DOWN compared to Canadian standards) and was so TINY...my sister pulled off bed sheets looking for bed bugs and found a URINE STAINED MATTESS..(both sided)... we complained and they moved us to the 14th floor &quot;MILFORD CLUB&quot; much better sized room NO STAINED MATTRESSES...was told hotel is to torn down this December.2009.. Great staff.. safe place BUT Really	
Sep 15 2009 	Great Location Acceptable Room	The Milford is &quot;tired.&quot; The entire facility is outdated. BUT, if you are a NYC tourist you should not be hanging out in your hotel room!! In NYC you only need a place to rest your head at night. What more do you need than a secure, moderately price, convenient &amp; centrally located hotel room? That IS the Milford Plaza. The rooms are of a good size (for NYC). The hotel is one block from Times Square and the subway. The hotel is in the middle of many Broadway theatres. And the staff is friendly and willing to assist your needs. If you are looking for an elegent, trendy, romantic, luxurious, spaciously roomed, or a hip, young &amp; pretty crowd, do not book a room at the Milford because you will be disappointed. I believe they are on the verge of renovating the Milford. There was scaffolding around the hotel during our Labor Day 2009 stay.	
Sep 15 2009 	EXCELLENT VALUE; EXCELLENT LOCATION; SOMEWHAT SHABBY	This was our 2nd stay at the Milford. Room was $168/night. That's a great price by New York standards! We choose this hotel because of its location - Times Square adjacent, 1 block from restaurant row, subway station across the street. The rooms are typical New York City: on the small side. The rooms do show their age. No desk in our room and we ended up being somewhat cramped. Bath is small, and they need to take some Clorox to the bathroom tile. Not dirty, but showing some signs of mold. The hotel says it is being renovated. If so, this is an extremely long renovation in the works. We stayed here 1-1/2 years ago, and I did not see any changes. Perhaps good news coming in the future.Staff was always accommodating. The room staff is superior. Our room was made up immediately. Leave a generous tip for the room staff - they are hard workers. The elevator system is unique and helps to provide additional security.	
Sep 15 2009 	Excellent Location - Basic Hotel	I stayed in the Milford 2 weeks ago for 5 nights with my husband. As it was our first trip to NY, we wanted something central, and to be honest for the price this was ideal. Yes, the hotel was basic, but it didn't promise luxury accommodation anyway. I would recommed this hotel to a friend for the location alone - and it was reasonably priced.	
Sep 11 2009 	Gross mold problem	I can't belive the mold in my room.1906 is really gross.I have pictures of all this to so my company to make sure we never stay here again.I tried to check in and they were oversold and tried to send me to a differant Hotel.I wish i would of taken that offer.I asked to be moved because of the mold and they said my choices were to go to New Jersey or stay were they put me.You won't ever have to worry about me staying here again and make sure my Company finds somewere else.Very unsatisfied customer.	
Sep 11 2009 	Hidden costs	Stayed here one night. Room was old and dingy, but the bed linen was fine. There is a strange smell, like mould could be the carpet. Overall the hotel for the price and location was OK.What really got me was they advertise internet in the rooms, but when you try to connect, you get told see desk, and they tell you no connection available, but business center has internet access. It sure does, Min charge $5 &amp; another $1 to print boarding pass.Then checked out and had to pay $3 per item to leave luggage at bell desk, we only two hand luggage bags=$6 I put a kids cowboy hat(takehome present) on the hook inside the rail, he was going to charge my another $3, I said thats ridiculous so he let it go.I also felt that the only nice personnel in the hotel was the security staff, the desk staff were awful and the bell man was down right rude.	
Sep 9 2009	I WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN	I stayed here in December 2007 for my daughters 21st apart from the locality I was unimpressed our room was tiny the bathroom cramped, dirty and smelly we overlooked an alleyway strewn with rubbish the only positive was we only slept here I would not recommend this hotel to anyone	
Sep 8 2009 	Classic but met our needs	This hotel is older, but still very nice. I'm amazed at how many rooms they can squeeze in there! It was quiet, we had no trouble sleeping and enjoyed our little room. The hot water was very slow to warm, but eventually did. Security is good and location is good. Not right in time square so it's not as loud, but very close. Also close to several Broadway shows and Restaurant Row.We chose the hotel because of it's price and still feel like we got a great deal. If you want another great hotel and excellent location, try the Stay. We will go back there next time.	
Sep 3 2009	We love the Milford Plaza	This our 3rd stay at Milford Plaza and we will definately stay there again. The location cannot be beat. You are across the street from the subway, and 1 block away from Times Square. If you take the &quot;Coach USA&quot; bus from any of the 3 local airports, it drops you off at Port Authority bus terminal, which is 2 blocks from the hotel. The rooms are a little small, and you can tell they have been updated several times, but the rooms are clean and we felt very secure staying there. In fact, one night our door did not completely close before we went to bed, and about 11:30 security came by and knocked on our door to make sure that we had our door secured. we cannot say enough about the value at Milford Plaza.	
Aug 30 2009 	Good if you're there for the location and not the room!	A decent value ... we booked ahead and secured rooms for under $150 / night, only a 5 minute walk from theatres, Times Square and Restaurant Row. Long waits in reception, and the room was nothing special. Mold in the bathroom. Worth it if you don't plan on spending much time in your room!	
Aug 30 2009 	An affordable hotel in a great location!!!	Stayed in this hotel a couple of years ago for my honeymoon. Superb location and the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our 5 day stay. The rooms were basic but when you are in New York you spend very little time in your hotel, but to be fair the room was very clean, comfortable and the maids visited daily with new towels etc. The hotel itself is a five minute walk from Times Square and Broadway, 15 minute walk from Madison Sqaure Garden and the Empire State Building. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant but there is a really nice pizza cafe on the same street. I recently recommneded this hotel to a friend who has just arrived home and he also enjoyed his stay and commented on the superb location of the hotel.	
Aug 24 2009 	Great location and value for price	Visiting NYC was part of our family trip to New England.I booked online from Honolulu using price and reviewsin my decision making. Upon arriving we had a shortwait before checking into room #2058 which overlooked8th Ave. For a double occupancy room, the area wassmaller than we expected, so we placed our luggageon the floor. The A/C unit was cold enough to cool ourbottled water overnight! While the bathroom sink wasprobably too small, the shower had Hot water, and weencountered no smells, dust, or mold during the threedays/nights at the Milford. The beds were just fine, andeveryone slept well.Concierge service helped us with tickets to the Museumof Nat History, and the doormen were helpful. Securitychecked our room cards each time we entered elevatorarea. We loved the elevator system that directs you to aspecific elevator designated for your floor only. We gotcoffee every morning from nearby restaurants.We did lots of walking in 3 days and the Milford doesput you right in the center of many tourist areas. Ourcheckout was simple using the hotel telephone, andthat enabled us to leave the hotel effortlessly.The Milford is an older hotel and seems set for somerenovation very soon. This did not take away from ourexperience of visiting New York. We felt safe insideour room and hotel hallways, and outside noise wasnonexistent. We would recommend the Milford to ourfriends or anyone who does not want to spend bigdollars while staying in the Big Apple.	
Aug 23 2009 	THE MILDEW PLAZA FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE MILFORD PLAZA	I recently travelled with my best friend to the Big Apple, the great New York City, to see the Broadway musical CHICAGO.Now as the native New Yorker that I am, I always grew up knowing of the Milford Plaza and on a couple of occasion, in the past have been a guest there, so I figured, &quot;Hey, since this will technically be my best friends first broadway muscial, why not say at the &quot;Lullaby of Broadway-The Milford Plaza.&quot; Boy, was that ever a BIG MISTAKE.I had made online reservations, and was quoted 425.00 for the weekend stay, upon checking in the front desk clerk, I showed my reservation to the front desk clerk which clearly notated the agreed price for the stay, I presented my debit card and the debit card was processed, but without any notice, I was charged 100.00 extra, as security. Now granted, the website does not state anything about a security deposit and neither did my receipt which clearly stated how much I was to pay upon check in. When I entered our room, a voice in the back of my head told me to check the bank and my debits, and WALLAH! I came to realize an additional 100.00 was debited. I called the front desk and asked to speak to the front desk, to only be told that this is their policy and there is nothing they can do about that. I explained nothing on the website, nor the receipt revealed the &quot;hidden fee&quot;, I explained it was not an issue of the fee since it was not that much, 50.00 per person, it was an issue of an undisclosed fee. They refused to work with me.Now at this point my best friend asked me what was going on, so of course I told her, this did not sit well with her either, so she literally went down to the front desk, politely requested to speak to the Manager, she showed him our paperwork and made him go online to prove the fee is not disclosed. Much to his dismay she prove the Milford wrong and the monies had to be reversed right there and then.NOW WAIT.....This gets better.We are back in the room now, room 2205, unpacking and organizing our clothes into the closet when one of us have to go to the bathroom. What we saw almost made us faint.The vents were literally covered by dust and spiderwebs. I kid you not, it must have gone without cleaning for years, plus the vent was not working. When we pulled the shower curtains, we found the walls literally covered with black mildew.By my friends bed, on the wall there was a large, I mean LAARGE bloctch of dirt on the wall, and by her bed a pill, seems the previous guest medication, which concerned her because should she have brought her 2 year old along for the trip, who was to say the baby would not have found this and put it in his mouth.There were streaks on the bedroom mirrors, as though a good cleaning was in order.So, what did we do? We took pictures, went back down to the front desk, showed them the pictures, they notated down our findings, they asked us not to go to lunch yet, mind you we were starving, they changed our room to room 642 and advised us that we were to go down to the lounge for a complimentary meal when we finished.So we transferred rooms, turned on the AC which was off and away we went to lunch. This is only gets better folks, hang on......We get to the Milford Lounge to find that they were straight out of food. At this point I am starving and exasperated. My frined speaks to the lounge Manager, who again, apologized for the misinformation and gave us the correct hours of operation for their lounge, however he was nice enough to ask us to come back tomorrow and he will personally make sure we are taken care of. So here we are starving, in search of food, but first, being the ladies we are we decide to go change our shoes first, we enter the our new room to find the room as hot as hell.So here we go again, we call the front desk and asked for someone to come and check the AC. The &quot;engineer&quot; comes up, looks at the unit, says their is nothing wrong, that it will take time to cool down and leaves. So we look at eachother and decide to go to &quot;dinner&quot; at this point, since lunch is no longer and hopefully the room will be cool when we get back in.We went to eat at FAMOUS DAVES in Time Square. The meal was worth all the aggravation. Absolutely fantastic food.We get back to the hotel, to find our room hot, humid and muggy. The hall was cooler than the room. We call the front desk, explain the situation and they try to blow us off. My best friend goes back downstairs and speaks to the front desk explains that this is totally unacceptable, she manages to get them to change our room, again, and she also wants the hotel to render a peace offering, in the form of maybe a fruit basket, munchies, something. She is told that the hotel is not in the custom of doing this. She advised the clerk that her friend is a writer and she is sure her friend will have a field day writing an article about the Hotel and will have them for lunch. The clerks reply was, let her write her article. My friend of course does not back down to anyone, so again she speaks to the Manager. She explains everything in detail to him, he is quite apologetic and shocked at the reply the front desk clerk gave her. Needless to say.....we got some Godiva Chocolates and a couple of bottles of water, plus complimentary breakfasts for the duration of our stay...hopefully this time they will not run out of food.So now we are in room 1205, and guess what the room was cool, the television working, the beds looked comfy, but the quilts were stained, so we tossed them aside. We enter the bathroom again, again a wall full of mildew, worse than the first room and it has a ceiling full of mildew too.We got tired of the run around given, spent the night in the room, since it had a working AC.In the morning I wanted to check out early and head out back home, but my girlfriend insisted she wanted her complimentary breakfast. So hesitantly, I accompanied her to the Milford lounge, to find a continental breakfast. However, remember that Manager who promised to take care of us personally in the morning? Well he did. Everyone else feasted on the cold Continental Breakfast, but we on the other hand, was provided a hot meal of our choice. So, thank you Mr. Manager. I would mention his name but he did not want to get in trouble, since in reality he was not suppose to do that, but he did because he was shocked at the treatment and lack of service and professionalism we received at the Milford.So, as of today, August 23rd, 2009, we christened THE MILFORD PLAZA with a new name. Fellow readers, let us introduce you to the new &quot;MILDEW PLAZA&quot;, located in New York City, 8th Avenue.ENTER AT YOUR RISK, DO NOT FORGET TO BRING YOUR ASTHMA PUMP, GAS MASK, SCRUBBING BUBBLES, PILLOWS, QUILTS AND STERILIZED SUITS AND GLOVES.The hotel is disgusting, and the service horrendous.Makes me wonder, &quot;I paid how much for WHAT????&quot;By the way, yes I did file an Attorney General , Better Bureau and Department of Health complaint against them.	
Aug 21 2009 	Standard hotel in a great location at a great price.	Milford is a standard large NY hotel, 1200 rooms I believe. Old building with old pipes, however the lobby is nice, the hotel is generally clean, the elevators work well, and the service people are good and professional. The rooms are small standard NY rooms, with good sized bathroom, with toiletries. This was our second stay at Milford, and once again there was a mildew problem in the bathroom. The cleaning staff needs to throw away there old rags and start using heavy scented cleaners with new equipment. The bathroom smells more mildewy after they clean. The room has an in-room safe, medium tv with ~40 channels, good AC, and responsive professional staff.The location is excellent, everything is within 2 blocks, including Theater District/Times Square, subway &amp; buses, 9th Ave food in Hell's Kitchen, market/pharmacy, etc. There is a Starbucks a block away for cheap internet wifi, but the hotel does NOT offer internet. They have changed the &quot;business center&quot; which is no longer free. Instead the computers are USD$0.25 per minute for internet, which is not cheap.Overall, the hotel is very good for the money and location, especially for NYC.	
Aug 20 2009 	Very Disappointing	If you value a decent room while on holiday, do not stay here, you will not get one!I travelled to New York with my parents and brother, for a 30th birthday celebration. I have travelled to New York on numerous occasions and wanted to be in the Upper Midtown/ Times Square area. We chose the Milford Plaza on the recommendation of expedia, whose pictures of the hotel looked lovely.When we arrived the lobby was nice and the staff were friendly. However, the rooms were disappointing. They were very small, although they had 2 (so called) double beds, there definately would not be enough room for 4 people! The rooms were unclean and smelled of damp. There was very limited space for suitcases and I have no idea how you would fit 4 into a room.When I informed the front desk of my concerns their attitude changed from the previous friendly demeanor, they were unhelpful and smuggly remarked that I was staying at the Milford Plaza, not the Hilton. I replied that although the Milford may be cheaper, standards should still be of an acceptable level, which they were not. The staff were completely uninterested.It is often said that while on holiday the room is the least important thing because all you need it for is to sleep. I do not agree, after staying in this room I felt like I could do with a powerful, hot shower and a good nights sleep, in a room that didn't smell of mould or look unclean.	
Aug 17 2009 	Confortable Hotel and excellent location	We stayed at the Milford for 7 nights. The location was excellent. The actual hotel was undergoing external renovations but the inside is clean and the staff all courteous and helpful.Our room was cleaned every day without fail with fresh towels and our beds made up.Aside from this big fan outside our window below, the room was quiet, but with all the walking and sightseeing, we were so tired that we didnt even notice the noise in the end.I would recommend the Milford to any budget traveller and I would defenitely stay there again. If you are looking for 5 star accomodation, then this is not for you. A very enjoyable stay.	
Aug 14 2009 	Very good value for money	For a 2* Hotel based in the centre of New York City , the Plaza was wonderful value for money. The staff were very helpful, rooms very clean and had a lot of space. Would recommend the hotel to any traveller to stay in, Location excellent!.	
Aug 12 2009 	What a great location - you will be so glad you stayed here!	I book my trip through Expedia - it was flight plus 7 nights at this hotel. Pros- ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS location. Right in the middle of the theatre district and just a block from Times Square. As a tourist really, what more could you ask for? - Subway is only 2 blocks away, which is very easy to use. - Safe. I guess it was very touristy when I came here there were always people out and about on the street. As a young female walking around at 1 am, I felt safe. - Air conditioned :) - Windows. Have a good view of city buildings :) - Flat screen TV- So many eateries around therefore please don't book breakfast with this hotel as you can easily get a cheap breakfast right outside the door. - I'll say it again, location location location !!! I actually came here &quot;partly&quot; for business and it is in the middle of midtown so it would only take me 10-15 minutes to walk over to Park Avenue/Rockefeller centre....Cons- I have never had a slower internet connection. Maybe it was because of my room location but boy oh boy...this nearly killed me as I had to follow up with work stuff. And you have to pay for it :( - Shower water pressure wasn't that great, but the water was hot so really this was NOT a big deal.Would totally recommend to stay here if you are visiting :)	
Aug 12 2009 	oh my god!!	this is the best hotel that i stayed in all the way over the usa. it has clean, safe as you cannot get in without your room key. it is about a 1 min walk to time square but you cannot hear it at night. all the staff are poliet and friendly. there os no job to big or to small.	
Aug 10 2009 	Good value	My girlfiend and I stayed here just right after Labor day for 4 nights. We booked through hotwire at $139 per night for just a queen bed.The service was not bad. We called in a couple of weeks early to request for a queen bed because hotwire did not guarantee a queen bed. It was either a double or two twins. They were able to meet our needs for the queen size bed. The room was tiny. It was probably 125-150 sq. ft including washroom. It was just big enough fit a queen bed, night stand and dresser. There was a window but practically no view because it looked out to the side of another building. The room was clean, room service cleaned the rooms and replenished the toiletries everyday. We did not mind that the room was small because we only slept there, there is too much to do in NYC so we were always out. So the room did the job. The location was great. It was 2 minute walk to times square. Subway was right across the street. Which was great because we took the subway everywhere, very convenient. Broadway theatres around the corner as well.We did not use any of the amenities, but there was a gym and a pool there I think.Security in the hotel was good, you had to show your card to the security guard before passing the elevators. Once you slid your card in it takes you directly to the floor of your room.We would stay at this hotel again. Good value for what you can get in NYC.	
Aug 10 2009 	Gem of a hotel	Stayed here last september for 5 nights, found everything about it brilliant, in a great location and very clean, not modern but i didnt really mind about that! what more do you want in new york?? liked that there was a safety deposit box in the room and always security at the elevators which made it feel very safe! try smiths across the road for breakfast really nice and cheap and robert emmetts bar for a few drinks at night!	
Aug 7 2009 	Great location very good service	We piclked this hotel because it was the best deal for the location and the best location for the price: we got a room for under $150/night with Times Square just a block away! We were allowed to check in early without additional cost, and transfer later to a better room, as it became available - thanks Reina at the reception fot her very perosnal attitude.Rooms and bathrooms were maybe a liiitle bit outdated, but overall - clean and neat.	
Aug 7 2009 	Could have been a lot better could have been a lot worse	A completely average hotel in my opinion: most of the negative aspects were canceled out by the positive aspects.We had to wait a long time for a member of staff to become available, but once we did get the desk he was extremely helpful (even going so far as to advise us not to use the phone in our room under any circumstances as it was ridiculously expensive. I never use hotel room phones anyway but this is the first time I have been advised not to by the staff!)The first room we got was ok, but a bit dark and the shower didn't work properly. We requested a move after spending half an hour trying to get the shower to work: they moved us promptly and without issue.The second room was much better, although both rooms had some minor mold in the bathroom (not really a concern for us). There was also half a box of cigarettes left on the windowsill, so I can assume the cleaners are not very observant.The concierge was helpful but with a somewhat brusque manner that takes a bit of getting used to! One of the most annoying things about this hotel was that you have to show your key to the security checkpoint every time you want to go to your room (I can only assume it is standard practice in New York???). Most of the security people were fine, but one or two were downright rude when I asked them for directions/assistance.The main selling point of this hotel really is it's proximity to Times Square: you are only one block from Times Square which makes it easy to visit, and you can stay at Times Square late into the night and not have to worry about getting back to your hotel. You have a lot of attractions within walking distance: Times Square, Madame Tussauds, Ripleys Believe It or Not, the city bus tours, the subway (42nd street station is just down the street for those arriving from the airports), and the Empire State Building and the harbor cruises are within walking distance.The only thing I would advise is that some people may be a little disturbed by the various adult cinemas, gentleman's clubs and adult video stores that are across the street from the hotel: this is a throwback to when this area of NYC was one of the seediest, most dangerous places in the US (luckily it is no longer like this). Also watch out for the guys selling drugs, although you are more likely to encounter them in Times Square rather than on 8th Avenue (where the hotel is) so this isn't really a problem exclusive to the hotel. NYC is apparently the safest city in the USA now.The price was another selling point: Expedia had a special offer on so that it worked out costing us something like $80 per night for the two of us ($40 each): I consider this a good deal to be in the heart of NYC.All in all, the low price and great location made up for the somewhat shabby rooms and sometimes less than helpful staff. Given it's location, this hotel could be a hell of a lot better (they are renovating at the moment), but to be honest, I would rather pay $80 to stay here than have to pay $200+ to stay in one of the other hotels around this area. Save your money for the attractions (they're not cheap) and remember: it's NYC: you don't want to live in your hotel room. Don't spend more than eight hours a day there (asleep) and you won't go wrong.	
Aug 6 2009	Great Hotel	This hotel was a great stay, comfy beds, spacious room for me and my sister, clean, and very helpful, this was my 1st stay ever in america let alone new york, when i needed to ring my transfers i went to the main taxi desk and the old lady was not helpful so i went to the checking desk and she did everything for us...everyone were so nice, i would defo recommend this hotel...I go back new york in 3 months but will not be staying here because its booked up, i was put off by the reviews but it turned out to be a good hotel. i have been put off by the moderne reviews as this is where we are staying on our next trip but all i can say is dont let these put you off, every trip is diff and some people expect to much from a cheap hotel, so im going to wait and see for myself	
Aug 5 2009 	Dissapointed totally......!	My kids and I just returned from a week vacation in New York City. We stayed at this hotel and were totally disgusted the first hours we spent there. The bathroom was all filthy and there was mildew on the walls. We requested to be moved to another room, still we had the sense that the rooms were not cleaned properly. The hotel is an old building and lots of re-building needs to be done. The drapes were disgustlying dirty, the rooms are not soundproof thus one can hear noise all night, including the traffic from the street. The rooms are tiny and dirty. We have traveled to Spain, Holland, Jerusalem, Canada and this has been the worst hotel we have stayed. You take your chances by staying here... ps make sure you check rates before checking in.....	
Aug 5 2009 	Never Again place smelled like vomit	All the other reviews are correct. This place has a decent location, but having stayed in NYC numerous occasions there are other places to stay far better and just as close to Times Square. Your gonna have to walk anyway, its NYC afterall. The room was tiny, which is ok. However the bathroom was nonfunctional. I hit my head everytime I tried to brush my teeth at the sink. The toilet was so tight there is no room to move your elbows out from your sides. But the main complaint was the smell was so awful in the hallway, I had to cover my nose and my mouth just to get to the room. I asked for something to be done and the smell got somewhat better but quickly returned. The carpet looks as though it has been there since the opening. All I can say is find another place, have stayed at the Doubletree and Hilton Marquee which are both great. The Mildew Vomit Plaza, I would not stay there again unless they tore the place down and rebuilt from the ground up.	
Aug 4 2009 	great location but i'd never say here again!	The location is great. But what our problem was was the rooms and service. Our first room was incredibly small and had 2 twin beds- we reserved a queen bed. The room was so small just by putting 2 suitcases down it would be filled. So an hour later of service complaints we were taken to the next room which was alright a little bigger. We then relized the air conditioner wasn't working so we gave it some time. The bathroom was moldy and the sink looked like it was from 100 years ago. We brought spray disenfectant because we didn't trust the place. We tried to make the best of not having an air conditioner through the night but we were sweating bullets since it was a warm august day. So we went to the desk and told them, they sent us up to the 22 floor and we opened the door to the smallest hotel room i had ever seen and it smelled like smoke and mold combined there was no way we were staying in this- we are non smokers. So finallly we got sent way up to the 24 floor and the room was a lot bigger and still smelled but we delt with it. This hotel was not what i expected, i would never ever stay at this place again!	
Aug 4 2009 	Paying for Location and nothing else	Stayed here for just short of two weeks.Location great, short walk to time square.Rooms, the one I stayed in was adequate room, my friends I wasn't sure if they were in a cupboard or not it was that small.The showers didn't have much pressure and it had water coming from the tiles also! reported this but never was repaired.Outside there was a lot of noise with construction but thats NY, constantly building so would expect this anywhere. All I can say for this hotel is great location nice lobby, shame about the rooms and rest of hotel.	
Aug 4 2009 	Great location average service poor rooms!	We recently stayed at the Milford Plaza. New York was our last stay on our US trip, and up until then our accomodation had been amazing. I will grant the Milford that the location is awesome, right on broadway, a block from times square, perfect, but the service and rooms leave a lot to be desired. When we arrived the lady at reception was rude. The doormen rarely opened the door for us or even gave us a 'hello' as we came in anf out of the hotel. I will say that the information desk staff however were friendly and helpful. We brushed that off and then went up to our room- which was the size of a SHOEBOX!!!! Absolutely tiny! As all girls do in New York, I shopped! And there was barely enough room to put my bags in the room! It was also not very clean, especially the bathroom, which we could barely move in as it was so small. After a 6 hour flight from Las Vegas, all we wanted was a nice hot shower. Not to be! The water took about 5 - 10 minutes to heat up (and it did this every morning we were there) and all the staff said was that it was a special temperature controlled nozzle so we just had to put up with it. Then when we were checking out we had to pay for our bags held until we were ready to leave- this had not happended at any other hotel we had stayed at on our trip. Some staff were nice, but not enough to make our stay a positive one. Luckily we loved New York so much that this bad experience did not ruin our trip!!	
Aug 3 2009 	Great trip	I had absolutely no problems with the MIlford! It is a fab location, so close to Times Square and Theatre District. Room was perfect - me and my boyfriend had enough space fot our stuff and to sleep which is all you need. At check in, asked for a room on upper floors due to previous posts about noise and that was done. No complaints about noise or housekeeping. Everything clean and working! Would definitely go again to this hotel - New York was amazing so am certain I will return!	
Aug 2 2009 	Location is everything	Stayed here mainly due to location, which I have to say is excellent - Times Square one block away. Reception staff were OK, smooth check in. We had a corner room which was great - looked like the room had been refurbed - new wallpaper flatscreen TV etc but the bathroom was fairly old-skool (but clean). Friends had a much smaller and older room on same floor. My tip would be request a corner room for views out over the river and up and down the street, and potentially more space. This hotel windows are not double glazed - this made traffic and sirens very noisy but you are you are right in the middle of &quot;city that never sleeps&quot;!! - we were out late soaking up the excellent night life so no worries - but maybe not an ideal location for the business traveller who needs his or her sleep!Met several hilarious Americans from &quot;outta town&quot; in the downstairs bar. Good fun for a warm up drink or two before going out. Can't really comment on any other facilities as NYC is a place to be out all the time....Tour buses are outside and 1/2 price theatre booking place next street. You are never far from the subway in NYC.Security are good - don't forget your key! Excellent breakfast places nearby - traditional NYC favourites like pancakes and waffles.	
Aug 2 2009 	Great location but average hotel	The hotel was on W. 45th street so the location was super convenient to walk to Times Square and all the broadway theaters which is why we choose this hotel. It's defiantly older and although they are planning extensive renos, none were started when we stayed there. The room we had for three people was was too small, we could barely fit three average sized suitcases in it. The bathroom was also way to small to accommodate 3 people. So get two rooms if there are more then two of you. Bell hop staff were very friendly, but check-in took a very long time. Most of the housekeeping staff were kind of hostile and 3 out of the 4 days we were there, they didn't have our room cleaned before 6pm and wanted to clean it just as we were getting ready for dinner/shows. There is also no restaurant in the hotel or any room service which is kind of a negative. The hotel is decent, good value, and has an amazing location, but I'd look elsewhere if you could.	
Jul 30 2009 	Never again Milford!	I stayed here a few years ago and found the room to be OK but the bathroom mouldy, leading us to nickname it the Mildew Plaza. It was OK though and the location made up for a lot.This time, the room was appalling and the reception staff were rude and surly. The window faced a wall. The curtain tiebacks were stapled on to the wall. The sink was deeply cracked and the plug clearly hadn't fitted for ages so you had to race to wash your face before the water drained.I don't expect fine furnishings in a two star but I expect polite staff and fittings that do their job!	
Jul 28 2009 	Fulfilled all expectations	Stayed in a club room for 4 nights having previously read that the standard rooms were small. I'd requested a room on a higher floor as it was my first time to New York and they booked us into a corner room which meant that we had two views from our room! When we were booking in the staff member was a true professional. Perfect location in the Theatre district and Times Square. Staff were welcoming and their service was excellent. Have recommended it to friends now we're back home and will definitely stay there if we're in New York again!	
Jul 28 2009 	Great location great hotel!	The Milford Plaza is just what any short stay traveller could want from a New York City hotel. We booked it along with our flights through Expedia and it was coming up as one of the cheapest deals. It is a 28-storey hotel just a block away from the nearest subway station and Times Square and Broadway, pretty much as convenient as it gets. Our room was basic with a double bed, TV and writing desk, the bathroom had a bath/shower, but it was fine as we were just using it to sleep in! It is also very secure with a safe in the room and a great lift system where you have to show your key to the staff and then call your own lift, no hanging around (you'll see what I mean when you get there!). Don't bother booking breakfast with the hotel there are plenty of places nearby (we recommend the Tick Tock Diner on 34th Street and 8th Avenue). The service was good, helpful when we needed them to be, answering our questions and having a blocked bath sorted for us straight away. All in all a great place to stay, although it does have scaffolding outside so how long it remains a cheap stay is anyone's guess. We'll be back on our next visit!	
Jul 27 2009 	Excellent location but poor room	We got an O.K. deal for $95 per night last Thanksgiving holiday. Maybe our hotel room in Boston was so nice that made this hotel looked horrible. The location was great. I believed 99% of the price we paid was for the location. The service was bad. They even charged us $2 per piece for temperately luggage storage the day we checked out. The room was not very clean and very tiny. The bath room was supper tiny and horrible. There was mold on the floor everywhere. I was so afraid of taking shower every night. Even though the location is so great, I am not staying there again. By the way, they discriminate Priceline customers. They gave Priceline customers the worst rooms in the hotel.	
Jul 25 2009 	Good Value option in Theater district	My wife, father and nephew spent 6 days as tourists and booked two rooms at the Milford for its location and price. We were not disappointed. We stayed in the double deluxe rooms on the 24th floor for $169 per night (including tax). We were delighted that the hotel was able to accomodate our request for relatively quiet rooms on the same high floor . Yes, the rooms and hotel were dated and in a long process of renovation. But we didn't mind. My 83 year old father appreciated the short walks to the theater, restaurants and convenient taxi service and our 14 year old nephew was equally thrilled to be in the midst of the limelight , marquees and times square and yes the Apple and Nintendo store. We all plowed back our savings from staying at the Milford into entertainment and saw 3 shows. We would not hesitate to book here again if the price is right. Cautionary note: Due to the hotel renovations there is no food service in the hotel but there are numerous options just outside the hotel and on 9th Avenue, a short 5 minute walk away.	
Jul 22 2009 	Best located hotel for what you pay!	After extensive researching on the internet, I finally decided on booking at the Milford Plaza. However, I continued to keep my fingers crossed that I had made the right decision, after so many mixed reviews! This was my first trip to NYC.....I can honestly say I could not find fault with the hotel, apart from coughing almost $60 for two 5min international calls!!!! The room was small, but having said that it was clean, the AC worked, cleant towels provided everyday etc. It is perfectly located for the solo traveller and first timers, as it is literally around the corner from Times Square. All the tour buses are located there, adding to your convenience. What more can one ask for!	
Jul 19 2009 	Smoking Rooms A No Go!	You could not fault the hotel for the location, it's brilliant. It's so close to Time Square, and in the heart of the Theatre District. The only thing that I can comment on, is the fact that smoking rooms looked like they haven't been renovated in years! My sister nor I smoke, but my parents do. Again, shouldn't complain about being taken on holiday to New York - it was fantastic! The smoking rooms, obviously had windows that you could open, and in November in New York was very chilly! There was such a draft from those windows at all time. I'll definitely be back to New York, but I doubt I'll stay in the Milford Plaza.	
Jul 19 2009 	Best value for money - for location location location!	We stayed here for 5 nights from 16th December 2008; despite the annoyance of lackadaisical reception staff who didn't care two figs for the fact we had to wait 2+ hours beyond normal check-in time to get to our room! Once we did, we found (after unpacking, of course!) that we had been placed in the wrong room for wifi access and again, met with total disinterest from the reception staff. This was as bad as it got, thankfully - we moved ourselves the next day to a smaller room but hey, we're right in the centre of Manhattan and as long as its clean and comfortable, that's all we cared about.New York is a place to be out and about in, not locked up in your room - if you want peaceful solitude, then why come to Manhattan with all its wonderful noise and bustle?!This is far from being a 5* hotel but the price is reflected in that. Our room was always kept clean even 'tho the bathroom could be described as &quot;quirky&quot; but we weren't there to admire the wallpaper in the room, merely to sleep after our shopping expeditions! Admittedly the rooms were so small we had trouble fitting in all our shopping bags but we've seen far worse.What more do you want - or need - when you have Broadway right on your doorstep, Times Square in the background and being centrally positioned for all that makes New York so very special. We even got snow!Security is excellent and if you forget your key, then forget going up to your room - they are very strict but polite and its very reassuring to know that you are in safe hands. The Club Room facilities are very good and we enjoyed our stay so much (despite a few negative points) that we have just booked for a return stay at the same time, the same place.You would be hard-pushed to find better value for money at this price. If you want the plush carpets and swish curtains etc then you will have to pay a significant premium and (as we found from previous New York trips) that the additional premium is not fully justified.Word of note: There is no lift from the 1st floor reception area to street level ... so make sure you can still lift your suitcases after all your shopping expeditions, because you have to carry them down the spiral staircase yourself ... Oh! And if you don't tip the doormen when they hail a taxi, they may well leave the taxi boot open so all your suitcases spill out (he he - it happened!)	
Jul 14 2009 	We are disappointing with Milford Plaza	Mi wife and me have been guests of Milford Plaza 5 days and unfortunately our level of satisfaction has been very low.The rate was low because we had a 30 % reduction offer; however, this low rate do not justifies the following aspects:a) in the room we did not dispose of a simple chair, the only place where was possible to seat was the bed;b) the room was very noisy day and night despite to be in the 20 floor:c) the sheets were broken; d) the attitude of several employees was peevish, authoritarian and very near of the impoliteness; I must recognize that others were charming persons;e) the worse reason of disappointing was the wifi wireless connection provided; it is expensive but this is not the problem because I can choose if I accept the price and use it or not; the problem is that it is impossible to maintain an operative connexion the main part of the time probably because the system has not transmission capacity enough for a huge hotel like Milford; in other words, Milton Plaza offers- as intermediary - a service that is charged but is not rended in the practice.	
Jul 14 2009 	Excellent Location	We stayed here from the 21 - 26 June. The location was absolutely fantastic - just around the corner from Times Square - the rooms were old but clean and lets be honest, when you are in New York you dont spend much time in your room. The security at the hotel was great - couldnt get past the security staff without showing your room key.The only downside was the overpriced internet access. It was quite noisy but I got used to all the sirens after awhile.	
Jul 10 2009 	Excellent location great value	We enjoyed our stay at the Milford Plaza. It's a perfect place to stay when visiting New York for theater. Broadway is just steps away. Our Milford Club room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We'll definitely stay here again next time we plan a theater overnight.	
Jul 10 2009 	Never again Warning!	The Milford Plaza by far is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at.This hotel for starters looks ok from the outside, the lobby is somewhat ok and the security by the elevator is nice. Its nice if they were trying to keep there guests in the rooms.The rooms were horrible. They were so small that after we put 2 suit cases next to the wall we were cramped in the room. The radiator made tons of noise and the walls were paper thin. The guests next to us left there alarm clock on and we could hear it for hours in our room. I finally called the front desk and they said there was nothing they could do. This was at 9 oclock. We get up to shower and find the shower is 50 years old and the water turns from hot to cold without warning. We complain about this and they say &quot;someone has checked it out and fixed it&quot; then we shower once we return and same problem. After we complained they moved us to a newer room which was alot bigger and nicer. However after we flushed the toilet once the whole bathroom flooded with water. We stayed for 3 days total and at the end of the stay we requested we get a refund for our stay and they said they would be happy to do it, we would just have to call in when the manager was on duty. Which we did and we were given the run around for 3 weeks and never got a refund in the end.PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE BEYOND THE LOCATION THE ROOMS SUCKED.	
Jul 8 2009	Always a great time at the Milford!	I've been staying at the Milford Plaza since 2002. Just stayed there again June 23 - 26th and had a total of 8 rooms reserved. The whole group LOVED the location of the hotel and never did I hear any complaints about their rooms. When you stay at the Milford Plaza the service desk people aren't always the most welcoming as most have attitudes. I can put that aside because i'm so close to Times Square and the theatre district, all they need to do if give me my key.. I find killing them w/ kindness helps as well.. The security is great.. Once you get the hang of how to operate their new elevator system you'll love it.. No long lines anymore for an elevator. They have a great business center there if you need to get on line, etc. Let's remember people we're not paying Hyatt or any of those other prices. What more do you need in NYC than a hotel that you walk out and you're just about a block away from Times Square and you have theatres right next to you.. I'd rather pay less and spend more outside on food, theatre and fun! All I go to NYC 2 to 3 times a year and most everytime I go I stay here... The rooms are clean and so are the bathrooms. Sure, they're small but are you going to spend a lot of time in your room????	
Jul 6 2009 	Top Hotel!	We've stayed in this hotel after we got a very good rate ad at Expedia. The hotel is situated in the centre of Manhattan(very close to bus terminal Port Authority). The Subway entrance is just across the street. From our room we had a ood view to Times Square.The rooms are very clean and big enough to put all your luggage on the floor. The bathroom is Ok, especially for New York hotels.We booked the Milford Club Room, which included breakfast(a nice continental breakfast in a big room, with newspapers, lots of seats and 8 computers with free internet) and free internet on your room(you have to use the cable and just bill the internetusage to your room(it won't be billed after all,because it's included)).Just like all the other people mentioned, the elevator system is working perfectly, and the service of the people is very good. Yes! I would really recommend this hotel to anybody.	
Jul 3 2009 	Won't be back to this hotel!	The ONLY thing this hotel has going for it is the location. It is right in the hub of everything. HOWEVER, the bathroom was disgusting..with mildew in the tub and the ceiling. The beds were ok...but the room needs much attention. The tv was tiny and the plugs-ins did not work well. And to be honest it was not that good of a price either.We will certainly be back to NYC but we will not be visiting the Milford Hotel. I would not recommend it to anyone who cares about cleanliness and comfort.	
Jul 3 2009 	Perfect location and perfect price	Okay it's not the Hudson or the Soho Grand and the new temperature-controlled shower-heads may be temperamental BUT if you're looking for a perfect spot for a theatre show and some great dining at a realistic price then this hits the spot! Chose the Club Room offer (which gave us exclusive use of club lounge, complimentary breakfast and internet til 1pm) which worked for us. A stone's throw from some of Broadway's finest theatres and a block from Restaurant Row (46th Street between 8th and 9th).	
Jul 3 2009 	Excellent location close to Times Square and Port Authority bus terminal.	I have stayed at this hotel twice. It is very good value for money. Noone else has mentioned its proximity to the main bus terminal, about 150 yards ,and buses come and go from the airports all day and night, I believe. The rooms are average size for a city hotel all facilities are adequate and the lift system and security are first class. It is a bit noisy but it is on Broadway, what would you expect?	
Jul 2 2009 	Time for some TLC	As usual the staff were extremely friendly and the continental breakfast is good. Room, however needed a make-over despite the large LCD TV.Electric sockets hanging by the wires off the walls, hot tap to bath/shower falling apart, tiling and sealing of bath looking tired.Wi Fi down.	
Jul 1 2009 	Did NOT like this hotel	This hotel was shabby, the rooms were tiny and the staff unfriendly. I agree the location was good which was in my opinion with only thing it had going for it. I just wonder whats with the scaffolding on the outside which has been there for quite some time now as if there are wonderful renovations going on, I certainly could not see this internally anyway. My family and I stayed in hotels in Boston, Cape Cod and Washington on this trip and all the hotels provided internet access, but the Milford Plaza charged guests (unless you were a member of some exclusive club) I thought this was rather mean. New York has had it so good for so long that they feel they can hand up anything to tourists, but beware this hotel is NOT good value for money. Search around, because I'm sure there is better out there, I know on my next visit to NY, I will not be staying at the Milford Plaza.	
Jun 28 2009 	Excellent Hotel - Will be back!	Stayed here for 5 nights from June 15th. Flew into JFK and got the AIR TRAIN from JFK to Howard Beach station $5.00 each per journey. (pay when you get to Howard Beach) Then bought a 7 day Metro Card as this would work out cheaper for us as we would be using the subway everyday, this was $25 dollars each. And i've heard a Taxi would be at least $50.00. Took about an hour to get to the hotel on the subway got off at Port Authority station which is literally 30 second from the hotel. Really easy to find just look for the big letter M on top of the hotel! Check in went fine and I asked for a room high up just for a better view and also thought this might be a bit quieter - further away from the cars beeping there horns! Got a room on the 19th floor and it was great. All we wanted and needed was a double bed, a good shower with hot water and space to put our belongings and also it HAD to be clean and we got it all!  Room was actually cleaned everyday and one day I left a note asking for 2 extra pillows and by the time we had returned that afternoon they were there. It can be noisy but I was so tired from all the walking around I pretty much slept through it all. This hotel is perfect for people just looking for somewhere to sleep while they explore New York. When you leave the hotel turn left and walk up broadway then right in front of you is Times Square - hundreds of restaurants, tourists shops - selling the I LOVE NY t-shirts jumpers and everything else you can think of. We ate at the Hard Rock on times square and that was great, burgers HUGE and staff very nice and welcoming - think all the restaurants are very busy about 5- 6pm because all the people eat there before they go to the shows on broadway. Also ate at Famous Daves BBQ restaurant was really nice, portions are ridiculous - as in way to much food! and you get a Muffin with your main meal which was weird but it tasted good! On Times square you have got to go in to Toys'r'us just to see the massive ferris wheel they have inside!Did all the normal touristy attractions Top of the Rock - Empire State Building - Statue of Liberty - Central Park - Grand Central Station - Natural History Museum - Yankees baseball Game - Macy's and Bloomingdales all places easily accessible from the hotel. Also went to Little Italy and China Town which I would really recommend. China Town is great for a bargain the sell Perfume, Handbags, Sunglasses etc. Little Italy had loads of great restaurants - obviously all Italian- had an amazing Pizza at Lombardi's Pizzeria would actually go as far as saying it was the best Pizza I've ever had! Also went to Ferraras - which is a cake/coffee/ice cream parlour was lovely in there aswell New York cheese cake was gorgeous. Overall the hotel was great - perfect location and price was good aswell - anyone who says otherwise is just way to picky and obviously just has a negative outlook and going out of their way looking for bad things to say. Will put pictures on soon.Have a great time if you stay at the MIlford Plaza! Also I never usually write reviews - this is the first one, but I enjoyed the trip and hotel so much I felt I had to lol.	
Jun 26 2009 	Location Location Location	The Milford Plaza is an older hotel that will be undergoing a renovation in the near future (the scafolding was already being put up around the building). The rooms are small when compared to newer hotels, but the room was clean, the bed was comfortable and everything in the room worked. We booked what was called a &quot;Club&quot; room that included local phone calls, internet access and an excellent continental breakfast in the Club room on the 3rd floor. The support staff was very friendly and the people staffing the breakfast room were very pleasant and helpful.The major advantage of the Milford Plaza is its location. We attended 4 shows while we were in NYC and 3 of them were within 2 blocks of the hotel. The location on 8th avenue also makes for easy access to a number of restaurants both on and off of Times Square. The hotel did not have an on-site restaurant or bar which is a minor inconvenience. We were able to get a very attractive room rate by regularly checking the Milford Plaza website along with sites like hotels.com. The reservations people at the Milford Plaza were very helpful when we called to re-book our roms at lower rates and wound up with rooms at a 35% discount.I would certainly put the Milford Plaza on my list of hotels to consider any time I am visiting NYC.	
Jun 25 2009 	Good location mediocre hotel	This hotel is very near Times Square and the theatres. Our (small) rooms had a view of the wall and we heard the noise of the airco. This hotel is not very nice, but okay is you just want something to sleep in and be near the sights.	
Jun 19 2009	Great Location but...	Excellent Location, near to Times Square, Gray Line Sightseeing pick up and drop. You feel secured due to the good security arrangements. Room is so so as you hear all those sounds from the nearby room, TV or other voices, Bathroom is tiny, yes really tiny, the shower floor is dirty as the tiles are old and you do not feel like visiting the bathroom. Go only if you want a good location - eg special interest in theatres.	
Jun 17 2009	Beyond expectations	Our group had stayed at Edison for seven years. This year it was booked. We were not expecting much from Milford after reading reviews. BUT, it satisfied all of us beyond expectations. We had a total of 28 rooms and no one complained about a room. Great security, awesome elevator system, good room service, clean, no bugs, dirt, peeling walls, or any of the things some folks seem to have made up to write a bad review. Fantastic location, walking distance for all of our six plays.	
Jun 15 2009 	Bed Bugs!!! Avoid This Hotel	We found a large infestation of bed bugs the morning after our first night of what should have been a two night stay. Needless to say we did not stay a second night. Weekend trip was ruined and the Management of the hotel was not helpful and would not guarantee a refund of our stay. I will never stay there again, would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy and hope that the hotel comes through with some sort of compensation for the horror I endured. It was not just a small infestation, there were many many bugs and it was very gross to know I slept in that bed.	
Jun 14 2009 	average hotel	It's an average hotel with a perfect location. I had a really small room, but I mean really small and it was a disaster. Toilet was also poor. Window was broken with a/c hidding mos tof view...I saw there are bigger and better rooms next to mine, but obviously I get the worse one...	
Jun 12 2009 	OK hotel in a very good location very close to Times Square	We arrived at New York on a hot day and the queue was huge to check in. We checked in, the first room still hadn't been serviced. We came back down, queued again and were designated a second room, on an even higher floor. We made our way there and that one still hadn't been serviced, so we came down. We queued again and were designated another room on an even higher floor again (I think it was 16 out of a hotel with 28 floors). That one had been serviced and we got in. It was a room for 4 people with 2 double beds. There were 2 smallish double beds and the room was tiny. Good job we didn't spend much time in the room. We weren't disappointed though. It was comfortable and clean. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, the only sort of café we saw there was a small coffee place selling ice creams, hot drinks, cakes and pastries and the hotel was huge. I thought that there might be some sort of restaurant there, but there wasn't. The hotel was in a great location, close to Times Square. If you ever want to go to Broadway and see The Phantom of the Opera, then stay at the Milford Plaza, the theatre is right next door to the hotel. Also the theatre for The Lion King is just up the road. The staff were OK but we didn't really talk to them that much. The hotel was okish value for money.	
Jun 10 2009 	Would stay here again	We stayed in two rooms--four adults and three children aged 11, 12 and 13. It was comfortable, if a little cramped. The location couldn't be better--a block from Times Square. The staff were very friendly and helpful and security was great. We had to show our room key to get on the elevators, which went directly to our floor--and quickly! There were many eateries and pizzerias within a block where we could pick up something quick and inexpensive to eat at the hotel. There were no coffee machines in the rooms, but we were given small refrigerators, and the gift shop in the lobby had tea and coffee for takeout. Bathroom was clean, but rooms were a little outdated. Price was great!	
Jun 9 2009 	Not bad not bad at all!	Stayed here for the first time as an overnight trip to Manhattan for our 22nd wedding anniversary. Even though all the news stations were claiming that Manhattan hotel prices were way down - try finding one!!!We wanted to be in the Times Square/Theater District and have been duped by Priceline/Hot Wire too many times to chance it so I booked the Milford Plaza despite some negative reviews here:This place was absolutely fine. Yes, it is an old hotel with small rooms -but our room was clean, had a nice view of 8th Ave. clean crisp linens, comfy pillows and a clean bathroom. What more do you need in NYC? Most people are not there for the hotel stay but the Manhattan experience. The location was perfect, the staff was A+ and I liked the charm of an older place instead of the sterility of the newer places.	
Jun 9 2009 	Business Travellers Avoid	Bathroom was clean but had the toilet paper holder torn off the wall before I arrived. Was never dealt with or mentioned during my two night stay. The small tile bathroom floor was coming apart and you could see that the fix ups in the bathroom involved large quantities of silicon. Forget it if you want to work - the lighting is horrible, the only connection was wireless and I could only get a 70% signal on the 8th floor - not stable enough for a VPN connection. No desk - but there was a regular kitchen-type chair in the corner.On the up side - they had installed an interesting elevator system where which only goes to the designated floor - which you put into a call device. I bit confusing at first - but quite handy once you realize that the input device tells which elevator is coming for you.It is a less expensive hotel and may be just fine for tourists coming to see broadway shows.	
Jun 9 2009 	lovely hotel... just needs a bit of a face lift	This hotel is a great find...if its a comfy bed, hot water in a great location with knowledgeable staff on hand then look no further...Yes the bedrooms are a little tired but we had no problem sleeping as the bed was as comfy as ours at home! By tired i mean some flaky paint in one corner next to the air con unit (probably due to moisture / heat anyway) and a little bit of wall paper peeling away here and there... hardly a major issue when we were there simply to shower and sleep.plenty of hot water... just dont flush the loo while in the shower... may get a hot shock!! nice deep bath was a great way to rest tired legs and feet. Toiletries were a great addition.Concierge was very good especially as i needed directions to a specialist dance wear shop and they knew exactly where i needed to go.Security was great... no access to the lifts without showing your room key to a security guard!!fantastic trip...can not rate this hotel enough!!!	
Jun 8 2009 	If they won't answer the reservations line how good could they be?	I never wound up staying there because I asked if I could negotiate a refund because I had to cancel the stay and I got hung up on. Then I called back five times and no-one answered. If they don't treat their would-be guests very well, how well could they treat their guests?	
Jun 8 2009 	The best choice we could make	We stayed at the Midford Plaza Hotel for 8 nights I had to work at the UN and my boyfriend went sightseing all days. The room was small (but considered New York City standard was perfect), very clean and with a touch of warmness of home. I have asked for a city view room and I got it. Breakfast was included and was really tasty. I will suggest this hotel to everyone, the location is perfect, just two minutes walk from Times Square and one minute walk from the subway station. The rooms at the bottom floor on the avenue side are a little noisy and often the internet connection doesn't work in the rooms. But the pros are sooo many that who cares. We had a wonderful stay!	
Jun 7 2009 	fantastic	superb location and a good price. It is bang in the middle of the city and is only a couple of minutes walk from Times square. Located in theatre district and has easy access to broadway shows. Rooms are average but clean. it was easy to come to the room anytime you want to get some rest after several hours of roaming before you get energised again to go around once more.But be careful about the telephone charges, they are very expensive and they even charged us for using free phone numbers form calling cards! that was the only negative factor during our stay.i would highly recommend it mainly for the location. Rooms average.	
Jun 7 2009 	This was the best location to see everything!	We were in northern New York state for a friend's college graduation and decided to spend a few days in Manhatton. The Milford is right in the middle of the Theatre District which made it perfect for us to see some shows and check out Times Square. All though the room was tiny and out dated, the service at the Milford was steps above everyone. If we make it to New York again, we will definetely stay at the Milford.	
Jun 7 2009 	Great location great fitness center average everything else	The location is the best thing about this hotel. On 8th Ave, between 44 and 45 St. In the theater district. Very convenient.The fitness center had 3 or 4 treadmills, some ellipticals, free weights, nautilus machines, yoga mats, etc. I even learned where was the switch that turned off the noisy and obnoxious piped-in &quot;music&quot;.There is no restaurant in the hotel, so no room service.There was no desk in my room, so there was no convenient place to work.The wireless signal didn't reach my room.The wired connection was agonizingly slow.There were too few wall power outlets, so I had to disconnect a lamp in order to plug in the laptop.The hot water took a long time to reach the 17th floor.	
Jun 6 2009 	brilliant hotel	We stayed in this hotel at the end of May beginning of June-09 for a week, like a lot of people who use this site we were wary due to previous reports. However we found this hotel fabulous, my fiance and me went Club and would recommend this over basic room (not that we saw any basic rooms so cant comment on those). The Club lounge was open from 6.00 -13.00 breakfast is supposed to be from 6.00 - 10.00 but we went down one morning (with hangover) at 11.15 and they where still clearing stuff away and we still managed to get something to eat. The staff are very polite and cant do enough for you. If you complain about this hotel then you are looking for Hilton quality at guest house prices!!! We got an amazing deal and could not have been happier with the hotel. We would return tomorrow if we could the room was amazing a separate couch and the most comfortable bed zzzzzz . the large flat screen tv, the choice of programs and it was great seeing how the Americans greeted the morning everyday! a Kitchenette with a must fridge and freezer even though we where B and B. the shower was glorious so easy to use and gauge the temperature, this and a bath too, we loved it. We knew of the complaints people had posted and we went in with eyes open. But we just wanted a decent base and somewhere to come home to in the evening to catch up on the excitement of the day, the room we had was perfect. We had no view from the room but we didn't care, we didn't go for a hotel view we went to see New York!!! the people who waste time looking for dirty grouting and mouldy corners have wasted a lot of money coming to New York . We had far more exciting things to do but when we sat on the loo contemplating our next escapade we found no mould, no creatures, nothing at all and i have to say the only reason we looked is due to what has been said on this site. Also the hotel is undergoing a massive overhaul and we will return when it is finished, as we would love to see how this hotel can improve on what it is. We missed a hotel bar but was informed that one was being added in the new improvements. I can only repeat that going for a Club room with what it offers made a big difference to us. Big warning! Don't go to Charlyos across the road we where ripped off the comedienne was extremely funny and it was a shame we got ripped off as we would have gone to see her again. If you do want to go there don't!!!!!!!!! pay to go in as its free but yup we paid but got our own back by not paying the gratuity on the bill. In conclusion I would recommend this hotel big style for position and quality.	
Jun 3 2009 	Excellent location!!	My mother and I just returned from a fabulous trip to NY. It was my second stay at the Milford Plaza. The hotel is in an excellent location....within walking distance to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, The Port Authority Bus Terminal and right in the middle of the Theatre District. The room was clean and quite comfortable....it's older, but has everything you need. It was a secure building and security was very helpful to my mother after we returned home and she realized she had forgotten some jewelry in the safe. She called the hotel and dealt with the security department and they found her jewelry and had it FedX'd back to Canada for her. They were very accomadating and helpful. We will definitely stay there again!	
Jun 3 2009 	Avoid This Hotel Like The Plague	My friend and I arrived at the hotel, only to be told, that the hotel was full. This, after we had a confirmed reservation. There were lots of people in the lobby and at the desk however. We were told by an employee that they had made a reservation for us at the Hotel Carter around the corner. Well, I know the reputation of the Hotel Carter, it's nearly as bad as you can get and remain open. I told him I was aware of the Hotel Carter and we would not be staying there. I told him we had a reservation, but he wanted to argue that all the rooms were taken. We left and found another hotel that evening.Of course, this put a damper on the weekend. I sent a letter of complaint to the hotel management and we got reimbursed for one night's stay in another hotel. Of course, now I would never consider staying at that low rated place and I'm sure they will survive without my business.	
Jun 1 2009 	Great location grossest bathroom ever.	Location couldn't be beat, walking distance to train, subway, Times Square, Broadway. Room not well insulated, noise audible from neighboring rooms, and from the traffic at night. Rooms very small, although I hear that's typical of all NY hotel rooms. Hotel in need of a remodel. Bathroom had no exhaust fan, and smelled like the mustiest, moldiest, basement that suffers from constant seepage. A bottle of bleach would have gone a long way toward minimizing the odor. I have had better bathroom facilities in a campground. We had to hold our breath while showering, the odor was so foul. If it wasn't for the location, I would have been extremely upset with the rate. In NYC you get what you pay for, but you must pay far more for it than anyway else in the country.	
Jun 1 2009 	great location	Location is the big thing the Milford has got going for itself, round the corner from Times Square, surrounded by thestres and restaurants. Up the street from Port Authority bus station so handy if you get the Newark airport shuttle bus ($15). Its also just a few hunderds yards down from the Grayline tour bus group head office and main departure point for 3 different tours. i'd go for these guys if you want a good deal, lots of stops and informative guides. Rooms were clean but small but as long as your not an extremely large person its not an issue. Staff were friendly and helpful. We got the Milford Club deal which allowed us breakfast and internet access in the Clun lounge was a nice start to the day, good variety but if you want a coked breakfast off egss you'll need to go to a diner.One last tip - Empire state building is over rated, if you want a fabulous view go to the Top of the Rock at Rovkerfella centre on 5th Avenue, its new and fab!!	
May 30 2009 	Convenience is worth something.	This hotel looks like a tired old building and the rooms are the bare minimum. I have stayed here twice and the first time they told me that they were remodeling and it would be great soon. I came back the next year because my friends booked it and it was the very same. I saw no change. Think Motel 6 type accomodations when you book this hotel. The one thing that it has going for it is the location. It is close to about everything, especially Broadway shows. The staff was mostly nice. My major complaint is that they charge so much for internet. I was told that it was 29.95 per day for internet. Needless to say, I did without. Also, no breakfast bar unless you pay extra, no coffee in room, poor gift shop. Absolutely no amenities.	
May 29 2009 	Good points and bad. Read before booking.	If all you're after a basic, good value hotel in a great location then look no further. If the style and quality of your hotel is a big part of your holiday then you should probably look elsewhere.Milford Plaza is in an unbeatable location. It's moments away from Times Square and Broadway, making it an excellent base from which to explore the city. It's relatively cheap for the area, the staff are friendly and checking-in was a breeze. On the downside, it's badly in need of renovation, it's not the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in and the rooms are miniscule.We opted to upgrade to a Club room, because we thought we might appreciate the breakfast facilities. Even if you arrive in NYC with thoughts of eating in diners each morning, in reality a bagel and some coffee in your own hotel is a lot less hassle. The Club Lounge is open until 1pm, too, making it a handy place to get a cup of coffee after a morning touring the city. It also contains a bank of computer terminals with free internet access.Our upgrade supposedly meant a larger room, although if this was the case I cannot begin to imagine how small a standard room must be. Our's was barely large enough to hold the double bed, although it did have all the basic facilities you would expect: TV, safe, an old and noisy air conditioning unit, and a bathroom with shower.Our bed was comfortable, although it came with sheets and blankets rather than a quilt/duvet. The bathroom was small but adequate with a working bath and shower. As other people have pointed out, the decor is in serious need of an update. It's not dirty, exactly, but feels well worn and a little shabby. I tried to straighten the picture over our bed but found that it had been screwed to the wall in a wonky position.The rooms would benefit from double-glazing, too. New York is a loud city and even on the 23rd floor, the sounds of the street below were clearly audible. There was some contruction going on across the road from us, which wasn't especially noisy in itself, but seemed to involve blowing an air horn at 7am each morning, which certainly was. A pair of earplugs is a must if you are easily disturbed by noise.In summary, if you just want a place to sleep and grab breakfast, that isn't going to break the bank, the Milford Plaza is definitely worth considering.	
May 27 2009 	Excellent experience!!	I stayed at the Milford Plaza from May 19th through May 24th on vacation with my husband. We were a little scared after reading some of the negative reviews that have been posted here, and boy were our worries proven wrong. Our experience was EXCELLENT, great value for your money. Service is A+, very friendly staff from the doorman to the check in clerk and room service, our room was of adequate size, very clean, bathroom had new fixtures, and we had great city view through our window. I have read complaints about noise, however we were in the 26th floor which is one of the upper floors (it has 28 total), and facing towards the back of the building so the noise was minimal or nonexistent- I would guess there is noise in lower floors facing 8th avenue, maybe you should address this during check-in and make sure you get a higher floor facing back. The elevator system is very fast, you have to enter your floor number in a keypad and an elevator is assigned to you and goes directly to your floor. The hotel's location is the best, right near Times Square and there is a subway station a block away. We had Broadway tickets to see God of Carnage and to our surprise the Jacobs Theater is literally next door to the hotel. Checkout is simple and fast, you can do it over the phone or on the TV. I will stay there again and recommend it 100%.	
May 27 2009 	All Good until the last day...	After reading reviews, I had mixed feelings about giving this a try, but the price was right and the location was the best for our first visit to NY. The staff was very pleasant, it felt very secure, and sure, it is old, but everything worked. Housekeeping starts up very early, so be sure to use your do not disturb sign. I checked to make sure the bathroom was clean, sheets were clean and AC worked - all good. The walls are thin, so bring ear plugs if noise is an issue for you. We stayed 4 nights, and were in the room only to crash at night and clean up in the morning - okay, there was a little hanky-panky and in the process, all the sheets ended up on the floor. I threw them in the bathroom and expected clean sheets. We got in very late that last night and went right to bed. In the morning, I pulled down the sheets and found the most disgusting mess of someone elses old, dried blood on the bottom sheet. I can't even be sure the sheet had ever been washed. I was so glad we were in the process of checking out, it was just so creepy. And all along I had been thinking what a great, reasonably priced hotel - but no thanks.	
May 26 2009 	Does The Job- But Don't Expect a 4 Star Hotel	I read many reviews before deciding to stay here so I wasn't surprised or disappoitned by the outdated bedspread, thin walls, curtains, furniture, etc. I was literally in the room to shower and sleep for the 5 nights I was in NYC so it suited me well for the location and price. Many restaurants nearby, and several subway stations within blocks of the hotel. Beware: there is no counter space in the bathroom- luckily, I was alone so I used the other half of my bed for my toiletries (there is a glass shelf below the mirror above the sink which runs the length of the mirror, about a foot I'd guess). The fitness room was comparable to those at a 4 star hotel- very nice, and by far nicer than the hotel rooms. There is internet access on the 3rd floor ($5 for 10 minutes). Ask for a quiet room; I had a room on the 19th floor, away from the street, and if it weren't for my earplugs, I would have been awake from drilling going on nearby (not sure if it was at the hotel or on the street). I can't imagine how loud it would have been if my room was facing the street. Upon checking out at 530 am to catch an early flight, I had to haul my 40 pound suitcase down to ground level- there is no elevator, and the escalator only goes up, not down. At that time of day, there was only one bell man outside on the sidewalk so it was quicker for me to do it myself. I hope that this will be something that is added to the hotel upon the remodel's completion. I don't think I would stay in Times Square again if I ever go back to NYC, but as a first timer in NYC, it was a convenient location to get to public transportation, food, and shows. Many tours begin in Times Square as well.	
May 26 2009 	Perfect location helpful staff no frills rooms but perfect for the price	Staying on a limited budget in New York was made easy by booking a room here, we went to New York twice and stayed there twice. It's just off Time Square which made most of the places we were going to within walking distance, lots of great restaurants around including John's Pizza just across the road. Didn't see much of the staff but when we did they were always pleasant and helpful. There's a guy stationed in front of the lifts at all times to ensure only people with room keys are allowed access to the residents floors which was great for peace of mind.Would definitely go back!	
May 25 2009 	Excellent location!	As the title reveals, the location of this hotel is absolutely perfect just one block from Times Square and lots of theaters and restaurants just a few minutes walk from the entrance, a subway entrance half a block away, a few minutes walk to the Port Authority Bus Station and a 15 minutes walk to Penn Station.Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 5 nights, between May 18 and May 23 in a Milton Club Room with complimentary breakfast, access to the Milton Club Lounge (where the breakfast was served and they had 8 free Internet stations) and wired Internet access on the room (wireless Internet access was not included).The breakfast was alright but lacked some basic things such as ham, salami, cheese and fresh vegetables to put on the sandwiches. On the other hand, as other reviewers already mentioned, you had the possibility to bring back water from the Milton Club Lounge and even though the water bottles was small (about 150ml or so) it was nice to be able to grab a couple of bottles before heading out to explore Manhattan.Wired Internet in the room did work for the first two days, with some minor glitches and a bit poor performance. After that I experienced some sort of DNS problem which the hotel was not able to fix even though they managed to send a guy to the room (after one call, a 30 min wait, a breakfast break and a personal visit to the managers station in the lobby), I was however able to surf the Internet if I connected my laptop to my work through VPN and using the DNSs at work.The room size was enough for two persons and had a small wardrobe with a safety box inside, an ironing board and an iron was also located in the wardrobe which was very nice. The bathroom was ok and they changed the towels every day (even though we hanged them on the door or over the shower curtain). The room also had an air conditioner unit which was nice even though it was a bit loud to have turned on during the night. Our room was located on the 12th floor in the corner of 8th avenue and 45th street, we were able to hear the street noise but it was not to annoying. . The only thing I can complain about regarding the room was that it might not have been the cleanest room Ive stayed in but it was not so bad after all.The staff was very nice, the security on the hotel was excellent (you could not gain access to the elevators or to the floors where the rooms were located unless you showed your room key card to the security guards) and it was possible to store the luggage at the hotel for free when we arrived early and our room was not ready.	
May 21 2009 	Excellent Stay	Stayed here for a 5 night break on the 7th may, upgraded to the club room on arrival for $30 a night and was not disappointed, the room was a good size, cleaned everyday with fresh towels and never ran out of toilet roll, there was even a spare roll in the closet. Location is excellent, times square just one block away and subway just on the corner for the places a little further away. Breakfast was good and never ran out and they let yu take items out if you fancy a snack of a coffee later. Staff were very friendly and security did not have an attitude problem as mentioned in some reviews, if people think by them asking to see the room key they have then there must be something wrong with you cos they are simply protecting you and your belongings. I even went out one day and my room door did not close fully, returned and all my belongings were still where i left them. They gave us a corner room on the 18th floor with 2 windows for views down 8th ave and across the hudson. Numerous theatres on the doorstep or a small walk away and restraunt row just across the road, could not have asked for a better location or friendlier staff.	
May 20 2009 	Great Experience!!!!!!	I stayed at the Milford Plaza for seven nights in the end of December 2008 (20th - 27th) with my mother and my girlfriend (double double room). It's one of the best locations in NYC and I have absolutely nothing to complain about, on the contrary, I only have compliments to make. Delicious breakfast, great location, excelent value for money (when you book in advance and watch for 48 hour promotions as the one I got - 50% off). I really recommend the Milford Plaza and also I'm staying again for 10 nights this year. Best Regards,Rodrigo	
May 19 2009 	Nasty	My 13-year old daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights earlier this month and would not go back. On the plus side, the price was certainly good, the location was fabulous, the staff were pleasant and helpful, and we liked the 24-7 security to get on to the elevators. We knew that the rooms would be small and it would be an older, very basic hotel...but the smell in our room was AWFUL. Mould with a very chemical-smelling cleanser product masking it perhaps...The room was very tired and it looked dirty (although I have to admit that I pulled the beds apart to check for anything untoward, and found nothing...thankfully!). And the room was so small that we kept catching the nasty bedspread in the door as we were coming and going... Finally, we brought a laptop with us based on the promise of wi-fi access, but once we got there we were told that there was no wi-fi available due to renovations. I am all for budget hotels, but the smell at the hotel was really problematic...	
May 18 2009 	Budget hotel in a great location	I would say that the best thing about this hotel is the location: just a couple of blocks from Times Square, in the middle of Theater District. With a subway station half a block from the main entrance.This is a no-frills hotel, the rooms are OK and bathroom is clean. But there are no extras, no restaurants, bars or fancy lobbies. Anyway, there are lots of fine places to eat at walking distance. At the time we stayed at the hotel, it was undergoing a big renovation, and maybe some guests might have suffered from it, but we were lucky not to. This is a big hotel and there are lot of people in the lobby anytime, so don't be offended if the guards ask for your room key before taking the elevators. Overall, the Milford is the one of best deal I have found in NYC and I honestly feel that I'm getting exactly what I'm paying for. I definitely would stay again at this hotel.	
May 15 2009	Great Hotel for first NYC Experience!	My daughter and I found The Milford at a price we could afford, then came to Tripadvisor to see what folks had to say... After reading quite a few reviews we felt this would be fine for us. It sounded small, old , friendly, and secure. Well to our surprise it was in the absolute BEST location, we loved wandering the Theatre District, and the hotel was easy to find from the Penn Station. On top of that it is much larger than we had expected, and the service was excellent, everyone friendly and helpful to us first timers. I found it to be clean and comfortable, very secure, quick check in and out. I hope to have the opportunity to visit NY again and I surely hope to stay here. It is a great value for the money.	
May 13 2009 	second honeymooners	My husband and I went to New York to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. We had 9 nights at the Milford Plaza Hotel. The Milford Plaza is a very old &quot;tired&quot; hotel but we thought it fantastic (and we had no &quot;bed bugs&quot;)!! We paid extra for the Milford Club which was brilliant as it enabled you to have access to the internet, gym and the breakfast lounge which saved us lots of money. It was clean and we felt very safe. We tipped the maid $2 every day for cleaning. Take earplugs though - the street noise ie sirens can be quite loud. But fantastic location 2 blocks from broadway and Times Square. We were very lucky and got a great rate of US$137.50 per night which included the Milford Club Lounge. We would stay again as it was perfect location to everything.	
May 11 2009 	great location and safe and clean	The Milford was not as expensive as the other hotels in Manhatten,and was very clean. The room was comfortable(view of nearby construction was not pleasant) but it is very,very safe. IIt is closeby to Port Authority withnincoming buses and subways---so you cant get lost! There are security people at all times at all elevators to ensure safety,coming or leaving. It is so close to the theatres--that was wonderful! My onlycomplaint was checking in---everybody and their brothers were checking out at the same time--and of course they received all the time and attention.We waited over l/2 hour in line until help came. All in all---a good,clean,safe,convenient place to stay.	
May 11 2009 	A Comfortable safe hotel very close to Times Square	I stayed at this hotel for a week in May 2009. The hotel itself is very close to Times Square, roughly a few minutes walk. It's location is brilliant. Also as it is so close to Times Square walking to and from the hotel it's always busy and feels safe no matter what time of day or night it is. Inside the hotel there is constantly a member of staff waiting at the lifts to whom you must show your room key before geting on the elevator, another nice security aspect.The rooms were average. The bed was comfortable and clean and the bathrooms were too. I had three main problems with the room, when we arrived our TV didn't work. I called the helpdesk but no one ever came to fix it. I ended up fixing it myself. Secondly, our air con did not work at all. Thirdly the pressure in the shower would cut off if other rooms nearby where using their bathrooms. This would last for a few minutes at a time and was annoying.Overall however the hotel is recommended for people looking for a safe, comfortable place to sleep near times square. The hotel is a little run down in places, some of the wallpaper was peeling behind the tv cabinet in my room and the bathroom door was needing replaced, but as a central hotel that is reasonably priced I would recommend it.There i splenty of places nearby to grab some food. My personal recommendation is to go to John's Pizzeria which is down one block, excellent food and very reasonably priced.	
May 7 2009 	first time in Manhattan	Wife and I stayed at the Milford Plaza Hotel17th floor. They do almost everything perfectly. Room was small but more than adequateeverything in the bathroom worked; beds were very comfortable; view was adequate; street noise (over which they have no control) was survivable at that height. The employees are the besteverybody extremely helpful. The rate was awesome compared to every other hotel in Manhattan we averaged around $175 per night for a deluxe two doubles. We did have one really tough night. Our next door neighbors were having a party and the walls in this older hotel are especially thin. Finally at about midnight we called security. They said theyd send someone right up I honestly dont think that happened. We should have called again, but just finally passed out at about 1:30 noise or not. Next day I asked security about itthey apparently have no system for writing down complaints..so they only remembered our call and said they sent someone uphmmm. But that was only one small glitch. Overall, the experience was wonderful, and we would definitely stay there again..its right in the heart of the theater district.	
May 6 2009 	We are going back!	We stayed here in the spring of 2008. The location of the hotel is fabulous, especially if it's your first time. It's literally round the corner from Times Square. I've been to New York a few times before and stayed in and around Times Square a few times at some pricier hotels, I would say that the Milford Plaza is definitely value for money. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful at all times. The rooms are not top of the range but you get what you pay for and what we paid for was absolutely fine for the room. The hotel and rooms are older and slightly run down but you don't come to New York to sit in your hotel room! The location is the hotels selling point it's right on seventh (restaurant row). Try Frankie and Johnnie's steak house across the road, gorgeous steak. I would definitely recommend this hotel. We liked it and are going back this year over Thanksgiving!	
May 4 2009 	In Feb. I gave this hotel 5 stars...now it has dropped to 3 stars	We stayed here in Feb 09 and we thought it was a great bargain. We paid more this time and felt we got a lot less this time. It is still a superb location - truly in the heart of the theatre district and a short walk to time square. What disappointed us this time is the Milford Club. I think it is still about a $30 option - but they close it at 1pm - and there sit 8 internet locations no longer available to guests. When we were here before, you could access the internet from 6:30am - 9pm (I think). No longer are there snacks in the afternoon - but the biggest shame is the loss of the internet access. Our room was slightly bigger this time and we were on a corner - so we had two windows which we loved. I had a bit of an upset at check in - trying to locate my reservation (make sure you come equiped with the confirmation number). Overall it was fine - just not the super deal I thought it was back in February. I would still stay here for the right price. Public transport is right outside the door or just a few blocks away depending on where you want to travel.	
May 1 2009 	Nice hotelgreat location.	Stayed here for five nights recently.Was a little bit apprehensive about what to expect after reading some of the reviews on here,but shouldn`t have worried.Check-in was quick and we were in our room in no time.Some reviewers have said that the room was small and so we were expecting the same,but we were pleasantly surprised as the room was ample sized for our needs.There was a double bed which was very comfortable with lovely squashy pillows.A nice flat screen TV with internet access and a games console.The bathroom was a little small but very clean with plenty of clean towels which were replaced each day.There wasn`t a wardrobe as such,just a small closet style cupboard to hang a few clothes and a small safe which came in very handy.There was an air conditioner under the window which was useful as the temperatures were up in the high 80`s when we were there!All the lifts were in good working order.The staff were pleasant and helpful.A continental breakfast was provided on the 3rd floor.There was all the usual-cereals,bagels,toast, fruit,fresh orange,etc.All in all a great hotel and like what a lot have said on here,a fantastic location.	
Apr 29 2009 	Couldn't ask for more!	Just arrived home from a 5 night leisure trip with my girlfriend after staying in the Milford Plaza just off times square. What can I say? Well after reading a several reviews on this particular hotel, some of them not entirely flattering, we bit the bullet and booked it for our stay. Instantly upon our arrival all our fears were alleviated from our check-in experience through to the cleanliness of the room and bathroom. We were greeted by an extremely courteous and efficient receptionist who gave us a room on the 23rd floor. It was surprisingly large, easily housing our four large suitcases, with a comfortable double bed complete with pillow top mattress for added comfort! The bathroom was very clean, with housekeeping providing plenty of clean towels every day. The room was also high enough to be away from the hustle and bustle and noise of the city. All in all the hotel outshone our expectations and we would have no hesitation in recommending it to any-one for a stay as it ticks all the right boxes i.e-Value for money, cleanliness and most of all-location.	
Apr 27 2009 	Excellent location with poor staff service	Excellent location, very close to Times Square and Broadway. On the other hand the hotel is very old and out of date. Rooms are so small, there is no place to put the luggage. The thing which I will remember for long time is car garage service. I took the hotel's garage for one night (price was 40 USD). They charged me 80 USD (it was mistake) and I waited my car 55 minutes instead 20 minutes, I was late to return my rent a car and I was so nervous. I had no apology, nothing. There was no responsibility at all. Really, poor client relationship.	
Apr 26 2009 	Small room that needed upgrading	I travelled here a whle ago now but forgot to write a review.For what its worth, we found this hotel to be a bit shabby and not that enjoyable to stay in.The staff on the desk were rude and our room was TINY - the smallest hotel room I've ever had. We had nowhere to store our clothes and had to live out of our suitcases all week. One side of the room was all mirrors in a pathetic attempt to make the room look bigger.The bathroom was also very small and the toilet was coming away from the wall. Not that clean either. The hotel was 3 stars when we stayed but is now only 2. This is much more accurate. Great location but not worth a stay if you want a bit of comfort.	
Apr 24 2009 	Fantastic Location	This hotel is in a fantastic location in Times Square. Booked a 40% off rate of $154 including the 14.5% taxes...It seems they are running different discounts ..so keep checking the rates...when it gets as low as you are wiling to pay..book it... Abundence of stores/ resturant row. loaded with entertainment spots...Subway around the corner...Security is located by the elevators to make sure you are a guest...you can check your bags downstairs until your room is ready or after you check out as a holding spot until you need to leave the city that day...cost $3 per bag....you pay 1/2 when you drop off and the other 1/2 when you pick up your bags...The room we were in had 2 double beds...spacious enough for an overnight....not as clean as I had expected....the bathroom could have been a little cleaner....but the price and location were fantastic for what we needed...	
Apr 23 2009	Just a place to lay your head at night.	The good the points of the Hotel:Its fantastic location.Price.Comfy Beds.Bad Points:Paper thin walls, I could literally hear the couple next door, um 'at it'The smallness of the room.***To me the room was merely a place for me to sleep and wash, other than that I didn't see any reason to stay in the room. To conclude, Its a bargain for an active tourist who doesnt care for lounging around the room.	
Apr 19 2009 	Cannot beat location of this hotel!!	The best thing about this hotel is the location, Times square was just down the end of the street &amp; all other main attractions were in walking distance. The room was but was clean &amp; spacious, not that we spent much time in the room as there as so much to see &amp; do!!I would certainly stay there again!	
Apr 16 2009 	Only good thing was the location.	We arrived from England tired and 1.5 hours after check in to be told the rooms were not ready and to come back in 2 hours. You can imagine we were not best pleased. They offered rooms on different floors but as we were a family travelling together we wanted to be on the same floor. We went out and came back nearly 4 hours later - guess what one of the rooms was still not ready! We retired to the one room which was ready and waited and waited, eventually after two irate phone calls a slightly better room than the one we had booked was offered on the same floor.The service at the hotel was not the best. One evening I phoned guest services four times and got no reply. I couldn't order films or play any games on the TV as there was some sort of error which they were not able to fix. The heater in the room sometimes worked, sometimes didn't. One day the room was not even made up, by the time we arrived back from a full days sightseeing, the last thing you want is someone coming in to do the room!There are no facilities at the hotel to speak of, no bar, no cafe, only a gift shop that sells hot drinks. It felt a bit like a train station with people waiting around in the foyer with nowhere to go except their rooms.The decor is very old and tired and needs renovating rather badly. The location was great for Times Square etc. and it was clean.	
Apr 14 2009 	Perfect comfortable hotel in great location for the budget traveller	Visited the Milford Plaza on a four night stay in New York City. Hotel was in perfect location just minutes from Times Square. Staff in hotel were pleasant and very helpful we needed some extra pillows and I was only back in the room minutes when the pillows arrived. Anytime I needed to go to reception for help they were always pleasant and happy to help. The beds were clean and comfortable. The decor in the hotel is very tired looking and it could do with being renovated but for the location, price we paid and the time you spend in your room it good value for money. If you are not looking for anything fancy this is a great budget hotel and a perfect base for exploring the sights of New York City.	
Apr 14 2009 	Great Value Good Location	I stayed at this hotel for 4 days and my general feedback is positive. Upon arrival we were greeted by the front desk staff who were pretty friendly considering we were in New York. Valet Parking is $40/day but it was still a bargain for the location.The hotel is walking distance to Times Square which is a bonus. The location was the big plus for this hotel. The room was very small, I mean very small, but considering we only slept and showered in the room it was adequate. There is a safe in the room which is nice. The bathroom is old and outdated, but clean. The bed is somewhat hard (there are no king size beds in this hotel), but considering the amount of walking we did in NY I had no problems sleeping there. There are ice machines on every other floor. The elevators are fast and easy to use. Security is great as they check everyone's room key prior to getting on the elevator.If you are looking for a good value hotel in the heart of Times Square and not fussy about having LCD TV's or room service this is the right place for the right money.My only complaint was that there is no wireless reception on the higher floors. Although I was charged for this service, I was never able to use the internet. The front desk did NOT give me a refund. Oh wel....	
Apr 14 2009 	Value For Money will defineatly stay here again	I had heard so many mixed reviews about this hotel before we went, so I was a bit nervous, when we arrived our room was v.small and smelled of mould so we asked for another room and got a perfect room on 21st floor with amazing views. 3rd day into the trip we realised there is an all you can eat free buffet breakfast, it was beautiful so saved us lots! The location is amazing, right beside the Lion King on broadway! I cannot wait to go back here, the staff are so so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this to a budget traveller. It certainly is value for money. My advice if you end up with a room you are not happy with defienatly ask is there a nicer room.	
Apr 7 2009 	Amazing location!	We stayed at the Milford for 5 nights in Jan 2007. We were a bit worried before going as the reviews weren't the best. The room was a bit dated but was very spacious. We had a broken shower which was a bit of a nightmare and the water temperature fluctuated hot and cold! The location really was superb. We requested a room on one of the top floors and ended up about 3 stories from the top. From our window we could actually see the Times Sq. screens! As we were quite high up it wasnt too noisy at night time, however it is New York so you frequently hear sirens and car horns! Times Sq. is a 2 minute walk away but there are many many resturants and take away places for food across the street from the hotel. I'd definately recommend this hotel to New York first timers purely because the locations fab and the price is very reasonable!	
Apr 7 2009 	Great location okay but dirty and in state of disrepair.	I stayed with a friend, lobby was okay when checking, thought this would be okay. However, on entering the room we were disheartened. It was grubby, musty, wires hanging out the wall, really not worth the $'s we were paying. This hotel should be no more than 2*. The only thing it has going for it is it's location, but we managed to get a lovely room at the Holiday Inn Garden Court one block up for just a few dollars each more.We also paid for Wifi, which didn't reach the part of the hotel we were in, so mischarged!	
Apr 4 2009 	Disgusting rooms - would never stay there again	We asked to be moved once we saw our tiny twin room, with the pubic hairs in the bathtub, and the musty bedspreads. However, we were told we couldn't be moved until at least the next day, and even then it would depend on whether or not there was another twin room available.We moved out the very next morning - one block away to the Hilton Garden Inn, and for only a few dollars more per night, we moved to pure luxury !The only thing the Milford has going for it, is its location. But as I said, the Hilton was only on the next street up, so was well worth the extra 1 minute walk to Times Square to be able to stay in a decent hotel.	
Apr 4 2009	Decent Hotel	I stayed here for 4 nights in March 2009. I must say I was worried due to some bad reviews on here but it was absolutely fine. The rooms were small but clean and tidy and the lobby was nice. Security was good as you were always required to show your room key before you could enter the lift area. I was greatly impressed with the lifts (elevators) actually! There were 10 lifts labelled A-J. You punched in your floor number to a keypad on the wall and it gave you the letter of the lift to go to. This meant you only had to wait a few seconds on a lift and generally you had it to yourself. No messing around with different people putting in different floor numbers! I think this might be the norm in NYC hotels but it was certainly something I'd never seen before - I know I'm easily amused!! You couldn't get a better location either, being on 8th avenue, a few blocks from restaurant row, and of course, round the corner from Times Square. On the whole I'd stay here again. It was perfect if all you're looking for is a place to sleep and shower before heading off for a long day exploring the city.	
Apr 2 2009 	Good hotel would return for the location	Good Hotel could use the hoover around the edges of the base of the bed and make sure there is no hairs in the shower. Hotel should ask you if you want to book the Club Lounge on arrival as we didnt even know it was there until i had to ring up as i had to make bottles for my son and needed hot water and when i went up they had tea coffee soft drinks food it was great but i didnt get to have any as i wasnt included. The hotel had a good security team on at all times. Check in was okay it was very fast and nobody explained anything to us about the hotel or get to our room as i had a pre paid reservation the person at reception wanted us to leave 50 dollors per night which we were staying for 5 nights which is 250 dollors luckily our friend was with us and she had a credit card where they took 50 dollars and refunded the card on check out. i would stay again because you walk out the door down the street and your in times square. it was a nice hotel they should just clean the rooms a bit more as i worked in a hotel as a housekeeper i wouldnt leave the rooms with dust on the tv and the floor. It's new york city and that all i was there for had a great time will be back again and i will book this hotel again.	
Apr 1 2009 	Right where you want to be	This hotel is a wonderful place right in the middle of town! Walking distance to Times Square and close to subway! This is my 3rd time and I will definatly be back again!	
Apr 1 2009 	Cheap and good to stay in	For those who have been there during this time, you would probably know that New York over Christmas and the New Year can be a truly amazing experience. New York during this time of the year can also be prohibitively expensive. Which is why I was pleased to have found Milford Plaza (on the edge of 8th Ave and 45th Street) on the Internet when I recently went to New York.The costs of a standard room with Club lounge access (US$120 or so per night) is one of the most competitive and value-for-money in New York's uber expensive accomodation scene (where $200 and over a night is more the norm). The location of the Hotel is also very much central: being only about 5 minutes walking distance from both Times Square and Broadway, visitors would have quick and easy access to some of New York's most famous landmarks.When I first arrived at the hotel, I found the room to be functional, if a little antiquated. That said, there was definitely a certain rustic charm to the room. One little matter though was that the walls appeared to be somewhat thin, which allowed me to eavesdrop on conversations that took place in adjoining rooms if the visitors in those rooms were too loud (and presumably, for them to listen in to conversations that I had if I were too loud). This was of course, part of the charm of the place, and can be easily overlooked, though I can imagine how disconcerting that might be if you were attempting to sleep at night and you were beside a particularly noisy neighbour (I was blessed with early sleepers as neighbours). There was a view of New York from my hotel room - while nothing spectacular, it is easy to forget that given the hotel's considerably lower-than-norm charges, the fact that any view is available is, in and of itself, quite a bonus. The lift-allocation-system is also structured in such a way that in most instances, you'd be given a dedicated lift to go to the level that you need - while some find the system inconvenient (and to be sure, it is, to some extent), I loved it since it means there is no need to engage in small talk with other guests.That is not to say the Hotel is not without its faults. For one, it did appear during my stay that there were too many people who had access to the Club lounge, making it impossible to get seats in the Club lounge if you are not an early riser (whenever I went to the Club lounge at 9:30 am, for example, it was impossible to get seats, though it was much easier to get seats whenever I went earlier than 9 am). The Club lounge is also separate from the level the hotel room is on, which does mean the little inconvenience of taking the lift whenever you needed to go to the club lounge.In short, Milford Plaza is not perfect, and definitely no big-name 5-star hotel, but for its costs and central location, is extremely value-for-money, especially in the festive season where most other comparable hotels charge almost double what Milford charges.	
Mar 30 2009 	Brilliant Location clean and friendly hotel.	i stayed at the Milford Plaza with a friend for two nights in March, we stayed with friends for three days and left there early to get a full day in the City and the hotel allowed us to check in early which was great. We were shown to our room by concierge and the room was what we wanted, a clean and tidy twin with enough space for both of us and all our shopping, We ordered the bus to the airport the day before we left and that was on time which was great, although got us to the airport a little early, which gave us time for Duty Free shopping. After check out there is a place to leave your bags for a small cost. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends travelling together and also couples, as we had a peek in a larger double room and it was very spacious.	
Mar 29 2009 	Can't grumble...	If you want a reasonably priced hotel in the centre of NYC, you can't grumble with the Milford Plaza. One block from Times Square and underground stations very nearby - the location is perfect especially if this is your first visit. Obviously, for the price you pay, this isn't a five star hotel, but it's clean - and to be honest if you're in NYC you're not going to spend too much time in your room! Btw, we stayed in a room that hadn't yet been refurbished and so it was rather dated, but we did get the offer to upgrade for $30/night and that included breakfast and internet access.	
Mar 27 2009 	Very good for the money.	Me and my brother went for our first time in New York, and this was an excellent place to stay!Just a block over from Time Square, and surrounded by great places to eat and theaters.Also only a block away from several of the New York subway lines, and pretty much in the middle between Soho and Central park, so not too expensive for a taxi anywhere in the city.But enough about the location. We got the room for about 140 dollars a night, and it wasn't too bad a price, since we only ordered it a few days before.The staff was very polite and the concierge (who we talked the most to), had very good knowledge of the town and what to do.The rooms were nice and relatively clean. We felt comfortable there. It was sort of small, but I reckon that isn't more than what you can expect in New York, unless you want to pay a few hundred dollars a night, and honestly, I only use the hotel to sleep in, so I don't bother.Bottom line; I would most defiantly stay at the Milford again!	
Mar 23 2009 	Great location and value	Found this hotel through expedia.com but chose to book my travel directly from the hotel website for flexibility. Hotel is in a great location about 2 blocks from Port Authority (I traveled by Greyhound from DC). Well within easy walking distance to just about anything in New York. Reception staff were friendly and efficient. I arrived before check-in and they were still able to accommodate me. When I mentioned it was my first time in New York, the clerk said she would make sure I had a view. My view was of 8th Avenue from the 18th floor. There was construction to the left but otherwise an unobstructed view of the Hudson river. Room was small but clean. The same with the bathroom. But plenty of room even for someone my size (BBW). Could do with some upgrading because it was a bit shabby but I wasn't planning on spending a lot of time in my room. The security is excellant and friendly. I opted not to upgrade to club level because I wasn't planning on being around the hotel a lot but might be useful if a person is staying for a few days. There are plenty of places to eat right outside the hotel. The cleaning staff straightened up my room while I was out sightseeing and replaced the towels that I had used.This hotel was an excellant value and I would recommend for the location and sense of security. However, if a person likes to go to bed early or sleep in I would not recommend because the noises from the street was high plus the I could hear talking in other rooms. This hotel is definately not for people that expect 5 star service and quality even though they are staying in a 2 1/2 star hotel.I would highly recommend checking out the hotel's website for deals or rate changes because they do change constantly. I managed to book 2 nights (Thursday &amp; Friday) for $113 because I went to their site multiple times until I got the rate I wanted.	
Mar 23 2009 	Great Location!	The Milford Plaza is a good place in New York is you're using it for resting and just relaxing after a busy day in the city. We stayed there in March 09 and it did the job for us.We checked in and they ask you for a $50 room deposit like in every hotel in New York. This is just so you know before staying there.The rooms are quite small but in New York you sometimes have to expect this, but they are big enough for what we needed. The hallways and rooms in the hotel are quite dated and need a lick of paint but the banners outside the hotel say that it's having a total refurb so this should be done soon.The rooms were quite small but the bed was comfortable and had clean sheets every day. The bathroom was small as well but the shower was very good and powerful when we got it working. They have an anti-scold device on them so you have to start it on cold and then slowly turn the hot on to the temperature you want. The towels were also changed every day and were fresh and clean. Our room was on the 18th floor and we have a good view of 8th Avenue out of our room.We got woke up most mornings but building works across the road from us and all the police cars going past haha but hey thats all part of the New York experience.The hotel security is very good and they ask each person to see their room card before they go up the elevators which makes you feel very safe. The elevators are very good as well as they have a system so you don't get stuck stopping on 15 floors to get to your room. You basically head straight up to your floor.The best thing about the hotel though is the location. It is 1 block from Times Square (1 minute walk) which puts you right in the middle of things. It is a great location for a cheaper hotel and really does sell this hotel big time.So overall if you're someone on here that takes photos of silly faults with the room that doesn't really make a difference to your stay then maybe this isn't the hotel for you. But if you're like me and you just want a cheaper hotel in New York for a place to sleep and relax occasionally, with a great location near Times Square so you can get out and explore this magnificent city then this should be a place you will like. We loved our stay in NYC!	
Mar 20 2009 	Excellent location!	Loved the location, Midtown, theather district.It was freezing cold outside, but our room was warm. The radiator was noisy, but we got good service from the maintenance staff who came to check it. The front desk clerks were not that nice.Basic rooms, clean bathrooms, affordable.	
Mar 19 2009 	Good Value brilliant Location	Just back from a trip to New York, stayed at the Milford Plaza, had a pleasant experienceThe rooms are very clean, but basic and small enough, our room consisted of a double bed, tv, wardrobe, desk and the bathroom had the usual bath and shower toilet etc. towels are changed every day we found the staff very friendly. We were on the 15th floor (right at the A of the neon Milford Plaza sign but it wasn't an issue) we didn't have a problem with noise. We paid 500 for 6 nights for 2 (this didn't include breakfast) I would recommend the hotel for location, its right around the corner from the theatre thats shows Phantom of the Opera. if you're just looking for a place to crash at the end of the day this is it but if you intend to spend time in your room, then this may not be the place,it is clean but small and basic. I would recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.	
Mar 17 2009 	First time in NYC	We booked seperate rooms at this hotel, but upon arrival they up us in a suite with two seperate bedrooms, I had to sleep on the sofa bed and 6 people sharing one bathroom was rather tasking. The hotel like most in NYC has a grand entrance lobby. Rooms could do witth some up-dating and we had a view of a brick wall but this is common in NYC. The location was fantastic and we were in 2 min wlak to time square. we eate in the hotel for breakfast which was nice, large selection and friendly staff. One issue though. whislt my cousin was getting ready in her bedroom a mouse ran past under the window, we complianed to the hotel and we got one nights stay for free, but this was quite off putting. Location was great, I personally would stay here again. BUT MY COUSIN WOULDN'T.	
Mar 16 2009 	Not bad at all	I'd read reviews of this hotel after I had booked it and was a little bit worried that it was going to be some sort of dive but I was pleasantly surprised ...We arrived to be greeted by the door man who took our luggage and carried it into the hotel for us. Once we booked in the lobby staff arranged for our luggage to be taken to our room so that we didn't have to cart it there ourselves. Before going to the elevators you go through security and this is manned by friendly staff who ask to see your room key before allowing you to proceed to the elevators.The elevator system is easy, you just tap in which floor you want to go to and it tells you which elevator to get into, e.g. A, B, C or D. Simple! Then when you are on your floor and want to go back to the lobby you just tap in 1 and it tells you which elevator to get into.Our room was better than we had expected. It was a good size, had comfortable beds and a compact en suite bathroom including shower. Also provided in the room was a hair dryer, towells, an ironing board and an iron. The closet or wardrobe was very small and consisted of hooks rather than a rail. The room also included a TV, telephone and games console which we did not use. The internet is available on wi-fi but you have to pay for this - I paid about $12 for 24 hours usage.We had a view over the river ... and a construction site to the left, but it was better than nothing at all. The contractors started work every morning at 7am so it started to get noisy outside around that time - this in addition to the usual traffic noises of cars honking their horns and of police, ambulance and fire truck half sirens! The room was lovely and warm, not swelteringly hot but just right.The decor was fine - a little bit dated but this is an old hotel. The hotel is situated a few blocks from Times Square so within easy access of theatres, restaurants, gift shops and lots more.We found all of the staff in this hotel to be extremely polite and helpful and we enjoyed our stay here very much.	
Mar 9 2009 	A solid deal for the money good location	This was my seond time staying at the Milford Plaza. I chose there the first time two years for the great location. It was satisfactory the last time so i decided to go again for 4 days in feb 2009. At check in it was suggested by the reception staff that i change to a Milford Club room for an extra $30 a day. I suggested an got the corner room 1508. great view but that was the best of it. The carpet was not cleaned, there was BLOOD in the shower, there was mould on the shower curtain. The following morning suprised me, after telling reception manager what the situation was, the security manager called to see the room and immediately i was transferred to another room at the other corner of the hotel. the same Club room standard, loads of room and a complimentary dressing gown and $50 discount on the first night. This above anything else will direct me back to the Milford Plaza hotel. The security, breakfast, Club room, location. It is not the RITZ but it a solid safe deal. Go there.....	
Mar 6 2009 	Never again!	I booked four rooms through Expedia for a business trip with clients and coworkers. The job changed and we had to change the date by two weeks. Yes, I knew the Expedia booking said &quot;No Refunds&quot; but I called them and asked to change the date. I would have gladly paid a change fee. Expedia contacted the hotel, as the hotel WOULD NOT even speak to me! They refused the request and told me it was too bad. Yes, I lost $475, but they lost a customer who is in NY EVERY MONTH. In this economy I wonder if they can afford for me to tell the world... NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!	
Mar 5 2009 	Good Location so so room	First time in New York and we stayed here because a friend recommended it. Friendly service from the bell man to front desk. Line was long to check in but they did have 6 employees checking people in. The man at the counter asked if we wanted to upgrade our room to include breakfast, and unlimited snacks and drinks for the three days from the lounge for $30.00 per day, said yes it was a wise move considering you can take snacks and bottled water for your day out.The location was great- didn't know it was so close to times square we stumbled upon time square by walking out of the hotel and down the street. We had a view of the street and the neon sign from Smiths bar lite up our room at night. The room had two double beds which were uncomfortable but okay considering what we paid. The washroom was small and felt icky to step on the floor of the shower. Overall we did not spend a lot of time in our hotel room, just for sleeping and getting ready. The location was great, the staff friendly, the prices were reasonable considering how close it is to broadway and times square.	
Mar 4 2009 	Decent Rooms Excellent Location-We'll be back	The location of this hotel cannot be beat. I have made many trips to NYC and have stayed at this hotel every time except for 2. Times square is just on the opposite end of the block, Sardi's just around the corner as well as the metro. Most of the Broadway theaters are within a 5 minute walk and 3 theaters are on the same block. All the shuttles stop here. This is an older hotel, thus the rooms and baths are small. Security is excellent. No one can get onto the elevators without their room key and then your &quot;private&quot; elevator stops only at the floor your room is on. The Milford is currently in the middle of a remodeling phase and there currently is scaffolding all around the outside parameter (looks like 1/2 the other buildings in NY). The only complaint of our stay is the old fashioned bedspreads were a bit worn and in need of replacing. I expect this will be fixed during their remodel. The Milford offers luggage storage until 10 PM the day of your checkout for $3 per bag. An excellent feature if your catching a late flight. We also stayed here in January and both times got a room for $99 a night. Unbelievable! This was a great rate 15 years ago! This rate does only gets you a very small room with 2 twin beds, but on our January visit (guess business was slow) the desk clerk upgrated our room to 2 doubles for the same rate! Valet Parking is available.	
Mar 3 2009 	Great location not so great rooms...	Only stayed for one night but having read the reviews I knew it was going to be basic. I have a feeling it is pot luck with the rooms here. The twin room myself and my freind got was so small it was untrue. We were on the 24th floor but there was no view as the window had a big aircon unit in it and the only view was from the few inches you could lift the window in the bathroom. There is no room around the single beds and it was very disappointing and very dated. The sheets were clean (but ripped) and that is about it.If you dont care about the room you stay in but want a great location then this is the hotel for you. If you expect that bit more and room to put your suitcase then dont stay in a twin room here!!!	
Mar 3 2009 	Do yourself a big favor and never stay here!	There is really too much to write... Overall this is the dirtiest, filthiest hotel that I ever stayed in! There were pubic hairs all over the shower, mold on the bathroom floors. Bad stench throught the smallest room ever. I could go on and on, it is highly recommended NOT to stay here!	
Mar 3 2009 	A comfortable convenient hotel with New York charm	We had two days in New York and wanted to be near to the sights. Milford Plaza was just the right spot, being very near to the theatre district meant you could easliy catch a show as well as sight see.I had read the reviews before booking and quite honestly they almost put me off but the location was so good and the cost reasonable that i thought that I would give it a go - pleased that I did.The staff were very friendly and the room, clean smart and comfortable. The Milford is not a new hotel but it has been maintained well and managed to keep it old NY charm.I don't normally get excited about lifts but I have to say the system they used when calling a lift worked a charm - never had to wait ,no matter how busy they were.	
Feb 28 2009 	Excellent location and price!	The hotel is right in the Theater area so very close to everything. 2 blocks from Times Square. The hotel staff are very friendly. You have to show your room key to security to go up to your room so it is very safe. Security also walks around the floors.The rooms are small but clean. The heater makes a loud noise when turning on so I ended up turning it off at night so I could sleep. The bathroom could be updated with new fixtures but acceptable. We were out all day and only used the room to sleep so the size was acceptable for the price.	
Feb 26 2009	milford plaza - took a chance what a mistake	There are two saving graces for the Milford Plaza. The nice breakfast and the great location for Broadway theatre. Aside from that, most Americans will be horrified by the place. We are world travelers and have never before experienced such a poor quality hotel. We &quot;upgraded&quot; to a Club Room, hoping it would be clean, perhaps even remodeled. Instead my daughter and I found dirty carpet in our room, broken fixtures in the lav, a connecting doorway to the room next door that was so thin we could hear every word from our neighbors (late night party too) and allowed their cigarette smoke into our room (we were on a non-smoking floor). The staff were nice though, and did check to see if we could be relocated (no luck). Security seemed good too. But the place needs to be gutted and rebuilt. Next time we will stay at the nearby Hilton, which is only marginally more expensive.	
Feb 25 2009 	Great Hotel Friendly Staff and Fab Location	This hotel is perfect for NYC. I travelled with 2 friends in Feb 09 and our room was more than adequate, very clean and big enough for 3 girls all trying to get ready at the same time! We were on the 22nd floor overlooking times square and had fantastic views. The reception staff were very helpful and even gave us complimentary late check out so we had somewhere to leave cases for a while as we had a late flight home.The location of this hotel was fantastic, the only sight we needed transport for was Liberty Island and we used the subway to get to battery park, we walked to everything else. The subway is a cheap way to get around the city and is very safe, its definately not like it is in the movies!!Give this hotel a chance, i understand that not everyone will have a great room location like we had but you dont spend much time in the room anyway - why go to new york and look at times square out of your room window!	
Feb 24 2009 	Okay RoomsSweet Location I Can't Wait to Go Back.	I met two girlfriends for a long Christmas shopping weekend in Dec. 2008. Since we were on a whirlwind trip we wanted a centrally located hotel and thats what we got. It was so close to everything that we almost didn't have to take a cab anywhere. There was scafolding along the outside of the building so I'm guessing they are doing upgrades. But no construction while we were there. The room was okay..Yes it was small but we did have our own bathroom. The avg. temp the weekend we were there was 30ish but we never had to turn on the heat. We actually had the window open. We never heard our neighbors and it did seem the hotel was quite full. The elevator system is nice you never had to wait for it to opena nd close on ten floors that weren't yours becaseu it only goes to your floor. The hotel felt very secure. They checked our room keys every time we came in. The lobby set up is kinda tight but meh who stays in the lobby. The staff was very friendly and even upgraded us to a better room on check in. Our room was high enough over the street that the noise was never a problem But you did hear the occasional lost horn. We could even see the river from our room. It's not the Plaza but for the value I will stay here again.	
Feb 24 2009 	stay at this hotel!!	please don't believe any people who say bad things about this hotel. i was so put off before i went because people were saying bad things about it but they are not true. ok so the rooms are not massive but who cares. it is not the marriott but that isn't what you pay for. we stayed in room 2028 and there was plenty of room for the 2 of us, plus we had an amazing view and could even see times square. The bathroom was clean, everything worked perfectly and the bed was soooo comfortable! The service we recieved was amazing, our luggage was lost by our airline and the concierge was on the phone for hours trying to find it for us and we were called the minute it arrived. all the staff were so friendly and helpful and really added to our holiday. Times square is so close, its not even a 2 minute walk. if you are going to ny then stay here, its not expensive and you'll have a fabulous time.	
Feb 23 2009	Milford Hotel New York City (Midtown Theater District)	I reserved this hotel because it was near another where I was to attend a conference, at a very good price. Beware - this place will be nice after the renovation is finished, but right now it's pretty sketchy. The first room I was offered was barey big enough to turn around in, had paint peeling off the walls and a fist-impact mark on the bathroom door. I was transferred to a much nicer room but (after a -hour runarround) I learned that this room has no internet access. The manager invited me to view two other substandard rooms (said to have internet but I didn't check). He also offered a &quot;club upgrade&quot; for $30+/night: access to a room w/ internet and free continental breakfast. If you want a cheap place in the Theater District and don't care about space or internet, this is a bargain. If not, go elsewhere.	
Feb 21 2009 	great value for money	Stayed in the Milford from 2009.01.12 till 2009.01.20, great room at the 21 first floor, a little outdated but who cares. Got a courtesy late check out because of my long stay. Rooms where small but very clean and the staf is friendly.	
Feb 19 2009 	Would stay again	Just back from a 5 night stay at the milford . We had booked two rooms one milford club room and one standard room for my brother now i would have thought that the club room would have been a lot bigger than the standard but there was no difference but the club room gave you access to breakfast which was brilliant great selection of pasterys, bagals, fruiet, ect a good start for the day, Now the hotel isit one to lounge in its a bed to sleep , Make sure you grab your showers before 8am otherwise cold. ohh they like to clean rooms really early there knocking on your door from 8.45 onwards which i found a little annoying, security is tight which was reassuring . We chose to stay in the milford plaza beacause it was so close to port aurthory if your were planning a trip to woodbury common which we did twice great bargins and knowing that when you get back into port aurthory with all you long day shopping bags you only have one block to walk it was perfect. what eles can i say about milford i would def recommend it for anyone who loves to shop everything is easy to get to from here.	
Feb 19 2009 	Fantastic location Friendly staff Secure hotel - great time.	Please ignore all the negative picky posts who complain about the bath, room sizes, carpets etc etc etc - Its a 1920's hotel with 1920's character in the very HEART of NY.We live in the UK and dont visit a city very often. We work hard for our money like most people. I am 40 and the wife is 44. I surprised my wife for her birthday with a 4 night stay at the Milford Plaza (12 - 16th February 2009). The dates also ran over valentines day, which was a bonus. We stayed on the 19th floor (room 1942). The reception and service on arrival (midnight) was excellent. The security in the reception area is unobtrusive but very effective. They are very friendly and always say hello, good morning, how was your day etc etc. They dont expect tips.You are given a key card to your room. You input the floor number (ie 19th) into the lift console and you are taken directly to your floor. 8 lifts to choose from.Our room was more than adequate and about the size of a middle bedroom in a 3 bed semi in UK (not the box room or the one mum and dad have). Double bed, bedside tables with lamps, TV, dressing table and chair (for the missus to put her war paint on and do her hair). Bathroom was a small 'on suit' type with bath with shower hose over it, sink and toilet. Basic but effective. Yes, the hotel is a little dated and therefore currently retains its carpeted corridors instead of marble. It retains its cream coloured wallpaper which has been painted and painted but it is effective. It is clean. It is warm. It is friendly. It is secure and it is comfortable. It is what you make of it and it was ideal for us as sightseers from UK.The hotel was perfectly located on 8th Avenue and next door to broadway theatres (if thats what you want) and literally a stones throw from Times Square, which is where evreyone goes and no more than a 2 minute walk away. You could only get more central if you could stay above the hard rock cafe in Times Square. Milford Plaza location couldnt be more central if you tried. We have travelled around the world and stayed in numerous rated hotels, apartments, camp sites, camper vans, hostels etc etc. We work, save and enjoy. Our short break to NY was purely to see the sites - not to live it up in the room or hotel. We basically used the room as somewhere to sleep and get a shower. We were in it from midnight till 8am. The rest of the day was spent out and about seeing as much as we could. From the Milford Plaza we would be in Times Square within 2 minutes. Then onto a bus/taxi that could have you at the Empire State Buiding, Central Park, Ground Zero, Brooklyn Bridge etc etc in 10 minutes or you could take a leasurley walk to these sites and enjoy the hustle and bustle on your way.We enjoyed the whole experience and it all starts and ends at the hotel - were you simply fall into bed exhausted, sleep, get up and shower and do it all again. The Milford Plaza is soon to be fully modernised and i understand that this is to be carried out with the minimum of disruption to its guests. I liked its quirky 1920's feel, which will undoubtedly change once it has been modernised but it cant change the fantastic location. Go with an open mind and enjoy NY - we did and will be going back to see the Milford again once we have saved enough.	
Feb 18 2009 	Pay more and stay elsewhere	Arrived late evening and had to wait at the reception for the extremely slow staff to check us in. They then stated that we had to give them $50 or one of our debit cards to cover any charges incurred during our stay at the hotel. On arriving in our room we found that there was nothing that would incurr a charge, such as a mini bar. The room smelt damp and musty. Bathroom had wallpaper peeling off the walls and lots of mould on the radiator, walls and ceiling. Could hear other residents due to thin walls and noise from lifts all night. Most staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. Such as asking the concierge if there was a restaurant to get something to eat and he replied &quot;There isn't one&quot;, after ignoring us the first time. Although website states that there is a cafe selling breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel.Having looked around the local area we would advise that people pay a little more money and stay at one of the branded hotels right on Times Square.	
Feb 15 2009 	Hell Hole!!! Stay Well Away..you will thank me	I am staying at the Milford Plaza in New York and I have never been so digusted with a hotel. I am in a room with bed bugs, dirty water and a shower i wouldn't even expect an animal to stand under.  If you care to read on you will understand the week we are having. We had numerous problems, but you have to be here in person to believe how bad it really is. We entered the hotel feeling positive, the reception area looks impressive but once you reach the check-in staff everything is downhill. The check in staff are unhelpful, rude and EVERYTHING is a chore for them. They were not welcoming, they handed us a map that did not even show where our hotel was. All of the floors except 1st (reception) and 3rd (conference center) are VERY shabby and rundown. We opened our and entered our 'dog box' of a room- it was so small, no fridge, a 60's TV, but even worse... our bed cover was torn down the middle, the wallpaper was hanging off the wall in numerous places and when we turned the air con off-we realised the noise was not coming from the unit-but a massive generator outside. I was tired and would have put up with most annoyances but i could not sleep through that noise. Therefore we complained and got moved into another room this time on level 16 (we were on level 5), there was no apologie and no help with moving our bags- the room was just as awful but the noise was not as bad. It was past midnight and we were beyond arguing with people who have no customer service skills. What i really do not understand is that the hotel is no-where near full, so why are they giving people such awful rooms-maybe they are all bad? The second day we had the 'do not disturb' sign on the door', after our long day of travelling and changing rooms, we wanted to be left alone. Instead housekeeping banged on our door at 10am! They were very loud-chatting throughout the corridor, no consideration for their guests, we gave up trying to sleep.  The third day- security banged on our door, i thought there was a problem, i was frightened and jumped out of bed. When i opened the door (in my bed clothes) i was faced with a male security guard telling me that i still had the 'do not disturb' sign'on the door and it is hotel policy that after 3 days we have to let the cleaners in. They said they would be back at 3pm and would appreciate us out of the room by then. I was so shocked and annoyed. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels (i am on a 3 month trip), paid a lot less and never been treated like this. I insisted a manager came up to the room to discuss this- especially as no policies are displayed in the room (not even a welcome pack). After waiting half an hour the 'head of cleaning' and the same security guard graced us with their presence. They gave me a speach about since 9/11 they have this 'policy' in place. However, i argued felt they were implying that the cleaners would go through our stuff. They then said i could just have the bins emptied- this would also be classed as óur room being serviced'- which totally contridicts their policy. Plus i do not believe the cleaners cleaned as i have done more cleaning in our room, it is filthy.I explained how i felt it was more a security issue for us to let a stranger in our room- they could see we were living in a clean and tidy manner. They agreed and gave us complimentary access to the 'Milford club''. We were offered this on arrival for an extra $30 per person, per day. It includes a free continental breakfast, snacks throughout the day and free internet access, plus a bigger room. What they fail to tell you is there is only 8 computers in this room, you cannot take any off the food out of this room and they have no bigger bedrooms- apparently they are all the same size (informed by reception when we complained on day 1). So how can they justify $60 per day to queue for a computer!!!????? I have also been informed that this is meant to be a 2 1/2 star hotel but the majority of the rooms are 1 star (if that).  Day 4- its a saturday morning and drilling starts at 6am. This was workmen in the road outside but as the hotel does not have double glazing (which it should in this day and age) it was very loud. I video taped it- to show expedia how bad the noise was on 16th floor!! Once again we gave up sleeping and went out. When we returned from a very early stroll our room key would not work. The reception staff were very moody and we had to wait for security to let us in our room. Day 5- We returned from a day out, our room key would not work again. Then our keys to the 'Milford club''would not work. When i went back down to reception to explain the problem, the woman on reception basically accused me of stealing the card. She said ''according to our system you shouldn't even have that card, so it's not my problem it doesn't work. Where did you get it from?'' I explained we had issues earlier in the week and were given access. She sighed and said she would have to get the manager- she did not believe us. Our cards were re-issued and i am so fed up that i am writing you this email now- whilst on holiday.To add insult to injury everyone gets an electric shock everytime you use the lift!So unless you want to be in my position sat her full of bed bugs and feeling disgusting please save yourself. I am not a complainer but everytime we go downstairs people are complaining about something- smoky rooms, windows don't open, air con won't turn off, somethings been stollen. I cannot understand some of the positive reviews on here cos if you look at any other websit (which i did not) they all seem to agree with me). Check yahoo travel for one. This could be a nice hotel, as its in a great location..but they just don't care.	
Feb 14 2009 	Beware!!!	Location was excellent...BUT... room was awful! no room to move and paper thin walls!!! had to put up listening to guest next door on phone most of night. Complained to reception and they did move us into another paper thin wall room where we had to listen to the couple next door chatting most of night as if they were sitting on our bed!!!Will without doubt never stay there again!!!!	
Feb 13 2009 	Milford Plaza you may wanna think again	The location was ideal; blocks from everything. The desk staff was rude from the minute I walked in, I waited for an hour before I was able to check in. The room I was finally given was full of mold. The next morning I went downstairs to switch rooms and the lady at the desk rolled her eyes at me, but alas I was moved. Everything worked out, but I will NEVER stay there again	
Feb 12 2009 	Worst hotel I have ever stayed in avoid it at all costs!	I visited NYC for the 2nd time in the summer, after staying at the Sheraton in Times Square and being given a huge deluxe corner room I was looking forward to returning to NYC. After searching for hotels on the net I came across Milford Plaza, the website made the hotel look outstanding so decided to give it a go. What a huge mistake. From the moment we arrived I wanted to leave, getting out of the car there was no-one to greet us, we had to carry all our luggage up stairs as the lift was broken, then we had to que for an hour just to check in. Me and my friend had seperate rooms and had requested to be placed near each other, yet we ended up on completely different floors and sides of the hotel. My room was dark, there was no view at all as the only window was blocked by the neighbouring apartment block. The corridors were small and cramped, housekeeping spent a grand total of 5 minutes cleaning my room, it was dusty, mouldy and dirty.  The bed linen felt damp, the lamps didn't work and I had to keep my curtains shut as there was a man in the apartment block next door who chose to sit at his window and watch what I was doing for the whole 3 days.  The staff were rude and un-friendly, especially housekeeping. The location of this hotel is fantastic, but the whole experience of the hotel completely ruined my NYC vacation. I strongly advise paying a little bit extra for any other hotel. The Milford Plaza website was completely misleading and I am still very disappointed.	
Feb 11 2009 	Great hotel wonderful staff!!	I stayed at the milford Plaza from the 2nd-8th February 2009. I came out to New York to get married with some friends. All I can say is, what an amzing hotel. Our luggage was lost by our airline Britsh Airways, and didnt arrive until the 5th, which meant my wedding was cancelled. But through all that time the staff couldnt have been any more helpful than what they were. They gave us cleaning bits and clothing wash so we could wash what clothes we had. They called the airline for us everyday and made us feel better about the situaution. The rooms were cleaned everyday, we didnt worry about leaving things out, and although its just a walk away from time square, we were on the 20th floor, the noise wasnt so bad. To those who have complained on here about the size of your rooms and the noise, I say get over it-its new york, a trip of a lifetime, and we only went to our rooms to sleep at night. The concierge were all fantastic, especially a guy called eugiene. He helped us out no end, and although my partners and mine special day was ruined, he made us smile. For the price we paid it was a great hotel, and deserves all the credit it gets, plus more.	
Feb 11 2009 	Excellent Location and Ok Hotel	Stayed here with 3 friends for a 5 night shopping trip to NY at the end of January 2009. We booked directly with the website for a special deal including breakfast. Got to room on 7th floor and they had given my sister and I a small twin room (which we had booked), with a tiny bathroom. If you opened a suitcase on the floor you would have nowhere to walk in the bedroom. I didn't like where it was located as it was in the very corner of the building and the door was not visible from the corridor. Our 2 other friends meanwhile had been upgraded to a room with 2 double beds in it. When I went back to reception to complain that they had been upgraded and we hadn't been they agreed to upgrade us free of charge. The new larger room was much better. Staff were not very friendly and the following morning when we went to get breakfast they argued that it wasn't included in our booking (even though we had the paperwork for it) and we never got breakfast provided. The breakfast area was closed and they had set up a small breakfast bar type that you could get pastries and coffees. Over priced and the staff were extremely rude. On a positive note about the hotel, it was clean if a bit dated and felt very secure. I would stay here again but I would definitely book the larger room. The location is absolutely spot on for Times Square, Port Authority etc.	
Feb 11 2009 	Good value for money	Stayed at Milford Plaza for 7 nights at their Milford Club. Was given a room at the 15th floor and by New York standard, was a decent size room. Was very sceptical after reading the other reviews, but was surprised at the quality of the hotel. Will definitely recommend. The breakfast at their lounge is an added bonus.	
Feb 10 2009 	Milford Plaza NYC	I stayed at the Milford Plaza on my first visit to NYC way back in 2002. Although it was some time ago, i imagine that the hotel will have changed very little. My friend and I were in a twin room which was extremely small. But we were 18, not very well travelled and, hell, we were in New York! Who goes to NY to sit in their hotel room?! Because we were so young, we couldnt go out drinking on a night so we did spend most evenings in the room, which was comfortable albeit small. What did it for me about this hotel was the locaiton. We could see Time Square from our room - it was litteraly a few minutes walk away. The location makes this hotel and for my next trip to NY, i will be staying on Time Square again - cos this is where it's at! Dont expect THE Plaza is what i would say! NY is a city where space is limited and accommodation in a good location is generally not cheap. Compared to somewhere like the Wellington, i'd choose the Milford Plaza any day!	
Feb 10 2009 	Impressed. Great price great hotel.	My husband and I travel to NYC often, just for fun. We used to stay at the Wolcott because years ago it was $100/night which was a good deal. Now the price has risen to about $290. For this trip I found the Milford Plaza for $129 so we went for it. Weren't expecting much except for a place to sleep but were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. Small room, small bathroom yes, no big deal. Nice view of 8th Ave, an unexpected plus. Continental breakfast and free internet in the lounge with the &quot;Milford Club&quot; status. Close to Times Square and very close to the ACE subway lines. Recommended for those who are realistic with what to expect for this price in NYC.	
Feb 10 2009 	Milford Plazacheap but cheery!	Just got back from a 7 night stay today and its not a bad hotel.The outside brickwork has been cleaned but the inside was last decorated when Huggy Bear was the main man!The outside scaffolding looks permanent now or its holding the place up.Towels and bed sheets are changed everyday but theres no coffee/tea making facilities in the room.Theres a safe in each room and the shower is molded from Stevensons Rocket!!Theres hotel security which on the face of it looks really good but they only check so many people to see if they have room keys.We had to complain one night when next door had people in there room who werent registered.Thats another thing the walls are made of tissue and you hear everything.The hotels position is top notch for night life with everything within a 15 minute walk.Its one of the safest cities in the world to explore now as theres police everywhere.The first 3 days it was freezing but the police were standing on street corners frozen to death in snow storms.Id stay at this hotel again if it was a good price but there are so many other options so search the net.	
Feb 8 2009	Checked out after 1 night.	My mom and I were initially set to stay at the Milford from Feb. 4 to Feb. 8, but we checked out after 1 night and moved to the Belvedere 3 blocks away from the Milford Hotel. The main reason why I chose the Milford was for it's location. The check-in staff were friendly and offered us an upgrade for $ 30 more per night, which includes unlimited internet use, continental breakfast, and unlimited snacks and soda throughout the day. We thought it was a pretty good deal, so we decided to take it. The hotel lobby was nice and clean and security was tight, but everything else went downhill from there.We got 1 of the Milford Club room with 2 double beds and a flat screen TV. The room was located on the 12th floor. When we got off the elevator the hallway was dated and they did a bad paint job, it was lumpy in some areas. The hallway's lighting was a bit dim. Once we got to the room, we were fairly impressed by the set-up. The room was small, but then this is NYC. My mom and I were happy and decided to unpack, that's when we found a curly hair under the bed covers. The carpet close to the beds were not cleaned. I found a feather close to the side of my bed. The bathtub had a couple of long hairs and they were crumbs on the tray with the apparently clean glasses. The housekeeping personnel did a very bad job of preparing the room for the next guests. My mom and I did not get to the hotel until 6:30 pm, so they had plenty of time to prepare the room since check-out is at 12 noon.We were both too tired to complain and decided to do it in the morning. The next morning, we were both itching and I saw 3 bug bites on my left arm. We packed our bags and left. I'm not a luxury traveller. Never had been and never will be. My family and I have always stayed in modest hotels and we love them just as long as they are clean, but my room at the Milford was absolutely filthy. I have read negative reviews about the Milford here on the site and decided to ignore it because I have had great stays in other hotels that were blasted here on Tripadvisor. I'm never staying at the Milford again. If their upgraded room was dirty, I literally would hate to see their standard room.	
Feb 8 2009 	Location Location Location	This was my first time in New York and this hotel fitted my needs perfectly. I went with three friends and we shared a double room together. It was a bit of a tight squeeze but the location was wicked.You are close to the theatre district and the near by streets have good food, public transport and culture options available.The only thing about booking this hotel is to keep checking the rates in case the price is reduced b4 you go. The bathroom and room were both clean and the staff were polite and helpful.The only thing i didnt agree with was having to pay to keep my bag at the hotel for the day when we checked out but as that is my only complaint it tells you how good the hotel was overall.This is a sound hotel and i would stay there again.	
Feb 8 2009 	Hostel not a hotel	Only thing this hotel has going for it is its location. Rooms are the size of a stamp,we could not control the heating ,could not sleep for the noise. it is an old hotel but surely after 80 odd years it is time they spent some money on the place,worst hotel i have ever stayed in(including 2* on Greek islands)	
Feb 4 2009 	The Rotten Apple	From the moment my head hit the pillow, the loud clanging of the radiator every time the heat went on, kept me up most of the night. Apparently, this should have been my warning that the heater would malfunction and shut off, leaving the room icy cold when I awoke in the morning. In addition to the noisy radiator, in the middle of the night I heard a loud thud, which turned out to be the ceiling fixture plummeting to the floor. When I called maintenance to restore the heat, it took half an hour to find someone. What a disaster!	
Feb 1 2009 	Loved our stay!	This was my first time in New York. I went with my boyfriend and we stayed for 4 nights. The hotel location is fab, with Times Square just around the corner. The hotel is right by all the theatres and the sightseeing bus stop. We bought a 3 day tour bus pass for 60 dollars and it was definately worth it as we hopped on and off all over the city. Also there is another 'tkts' office down by the South Street Seaport (we got off there on the tour bus). The queues for half price broadway show tickets were nothing there compared to the mile long queue at Times Square.The room was clean and we had clean towels etc every day. But it did smell a bit musty (we left the windows open while we were out to get rid of the smell). The staff were very friendly and helpful. We asked for a high floor and they gave us a room on the 25th. The room had a big tv, iron, hairdryer and tea/coffee making facilities. It is also very secure. We had to show our key to staff before we could take a lift to our room. The lifts were great by the way.The hotel isn't posh (we were only there to sleep and shower), but we definately had value for money! We'd definately stay there again.	
Feb 1 2009	Great Location	Just arrived back from 3 nights at the Milford Plaza, great location - 2 minutes walk to Times Square. From reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we didnt really know what to expect, yes the hotel looks tired and could do with a load of money spent on it but in NY it all about location, location, location and to be fair you only sleep in there!! Rooms were clean,, small, no kettle/tea or coffee making facilites but there is a coffee shop in the lobby which is open from 7am till1pm. TIP - if you buy tea/coffee from the gift shop its cheaper than the coffee shop and its nicer. Check in was quick, security at the lifts which makes you feel safe too. If you need to leave your cases you do have to pay $3 per case if you have a later flight. The hotel can also arrange a shuttle back to the airport for $24 pp which works out cheaper than the flat fare (plus tip) taxi trip into Manhattan.Although not the best hotel Ive ever stayed in I would stay here again as the location is excellent!!!	
Jan 31 2009 	great location	A great place to stay in new york. the rooms are a bit small but are very clean with all the mod cons. the location is the key this hotel 5 minutes walk from times square. and 2 miutes walk from the bus station. the staff were very friendly and always helpfull .The millford plaza is a good hotel justs needs a small bit of a refurbisment.	
Jan 29 2009 	Good value 	This was our third stay at this hotel, our second business stay for which we got a great rate. Staff is efficient and friendly. Everytime we arrive (which is about 11 am) they have a room for us although actual check-in is later. This time our room (#1535) was the smallest (about 14x15), but was adequate and clean. The decor of the home (and whole hotel) could use updating. The bathroom was OK; the tub was recoated with some material (Bath Fitters?) and the bottom of it was bouncy. Althought the bed felt soft, I slept extremely well. The heating unit was hard to regulate (we kept it off most of the time) and occasionally made strange noises, like something was trying to get out of it. The elevators have been replaced with state of the art equipment. You press your floor number and you are directed to a particular elevator--very fast and efficient! This is a great hotel to stay in if you want to be in the theatre district and we will continue to use it.	
Jan 28 2009 	Fantastic!	Ideal location for just about everything in NYC. Rooms are great for the price, I honestly didn't expect to get such good value for money in New York. Bathroom was clean, great shower. Staff were friendly, security is good. Can't fault it!	
Jan 27 2009 	Great place to stay on a modest budget	My fiancee and I stayed here for 7 nights and had very few complaints. The accommodation was basic but clean and the really retro 30s decor added to the atmosphere. We had a view of Times Square (just) and it was ACE being 2/3 minutes away from Broadway. There's a little shop in the hotel with refreshments, gifts etc and a coffee bar in the lobby which has limited opening hours. We didn't use the Club Lounge (up a few floors) but wish we had after reading the last review! The hotel lobby is well-kept and there are always plenty of friendly staff around to assist. The baggage storing service was invaluable for us on our final day, too. Only $6 a case. Don't expect luxury in the Milford Plaza - but you can expect a decent, convenient stay. Also, check out Virgil's BBQ on the other side of Times Square... it's ACE! Also a little Belgian bar nearby which shows European Football (SOCCER to Americans!).	
Jan 24 2009 	Thank God I did not believe the reviews.....	Just back from a five night stay at the Milford Plaza and cannot say how brilliant this hotel was! After reading reviews on here I was extremely anxious that I was going to be staying in a cockroach infested dump, and seriously contemplated changing hotels up until the last day! This was my first time in New York city and this hotel really made it special! The location is absolutely brilliant! It is a 2 minute walk to Times Square, and a ten minute walk from most of the theatres! The Port Authority bus station is not even a five minute walk from the hotel, and the nearest subway station is less than 10mins, so it is perfect to get to from the airport if you don't want to fork out $55 for a taxi! The staff at the hotel are brilliant, really helpful and very polite and friendly, security is tight so you feel nice and safe! I opted for the Milford Club room, and I would definitely recommend that others do so too! You have all day access to free soft drinks, teas coffee, bottled water cookies and crisps, and also free internet access! It really was a great thing to have! Also our room was really quite big with great views of the Hudson and 8th Avenue! Our room was really nice and clean, and there was loads of room to move about and for luggage, shopping etc. It really was a lot bigger than I had expected! I really couldn't fault our stay at this hotel, personally I would say it equals a 3+ star hotel at home with the advantages of the Milford Club a definite plus! I would most definitely stay here again, and would recommend choosing the Milford Club rooms!!	
Jan 24 2009 	Nothing to write home about but okay.	We stayed at the Milford Plaza for 5 nights in November. I wanted to book at the Salisbury where we stayed last year at the same time, but a friend suggested the Milford. It was okay, just okay. They checked us in early, which was good. We had 2 rooms. Our friends got a much bigger room than us and we were paying the same price. They also had a better view. Our room didn't even have a closet. At first we laughed it off and tried to make the best of it. One of us would have to get on the bed to let the other one pass by, we thought it was kind of funny. But then we saw our friends room and asked for a bigger one and were told that our room was the biggest one in the hotel. Huh?? We were willing to pay more, but they wouldn't do it. They told us we had to get a room with two double beds instead of one queen size. After going down stairs, waiting in line, and explaining, we finally settled on the room with the two double beds. I thought the whole thing was a bit shady and we paid the same as our friends and they got a room with one bed and plenty of room so we should have also, or we should have paid less or been upgraded. Also, the location is right in Times Square, but kind of the crappy part of Times Square, so when we went outside we couldn't really walk anywhere that cool, it was always a cab ride everywhere. Okay, let me explain the ridiculous elevator system that they have, I've never seen anything like it. There are 8 elevators. You punch in your floor number on a keypad and they you wait for one of the elevators to open. At the top of the elevator, it tells you which floors it's going to. It will say something like, 4,8,9,15. If your floor is on there, you jump in. It's not that bad if you are on the floor your room is located on, or the 1st floor. But if you are on a middle floor and there are alot of people, it can get confusing. Especially after a couple of drinks. By the time I had it down, it was time to check out. I don't know who thought of that system, but Why? There is no logical reason for it. Also, the concierge sucks. We dealt with a couple of them and they gave us bad advice, wrong addresses, etc. I don't know if the two that I dealt with were having a bad day(twice), but they weren't the brightest people. I'll leave it at that. The lighting in the bathroom (which, by the way, was designed for people 5'9 and shorter) was too dark. The shower pressure was good, but we figured out that we had to let the hot water run for about ten minutes before we could get hot water. Everything was a mission. We ate at the Palms, which was about a 6 block walk from the hotel. The Palms is a great restaurant and totally recommend it. It's a little pricey ($175 for 2) but worth it. None of the other places we ate at on this trip were worth mentioning. I wouldn't really recommend the Milford Plaza to anyone I knew unless it was a great deal compared to the other hotels in the area. We paid $289/night and I didn't like the place. It was just okay. I wouldn't go back.	
Jan 23 2009 	Brilliant	Milford Plaza gets very mixed reviews on here, but I just got back and it was amazing. Me and my mum were delighted with our room on the 15th floor, great view of the Hudson.Location was unbelievable and couldn't have asked for more. Hotel staff were friendly and security excellent.	
Jan 22 2009	Very safe and secure place	Los Angeles. After reading a few bad review about this hotel and for the price I didn't expect much. Check in early, didn't have to wait, five minutes tops. Everything worked great, plenty of towels, toiletries, hot water, heat, normal size room in the SE corner of the 25th floor. Elevators worked, security was tight, lost a room card key and didn't get anytrouble when I report it, didn't have to pay extra to replace. You are at the center of everything, Times Square is around the block, tour buses a block away, Central Park a nice leisure ten blocks away. PERFECT!!!	
Jan 19 2009 	Location Fine Room Marginal	This is an older NY hotel; I was here for a convention. The front desk staff was pleasant and security at the elevators good. Upon exiting the elevator on the tenth floor you realize just how old this hotel is. Thick coats of paint cover everything and the musty smell is not pleasant. I had a corner room, others in my travel party commented that it was smaller than theirs. Internet access didn't exist for me, others said it was marginal. The hotel is very near the theater district and one block from the Subway and a few blocks from Times Square. If you prefer getting the experience from one of the chain hotels like Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt, you will be disappointed with the Milford. This hotel is bargain priced for New York City and if youre visiting the city, youre not staying in your room much anyhow.	
Jan 16 2009 	Location location location . . . and a bargain too!!	PROS - If you are going to NYC for Broadway Theater, like we do, you cannot beat the location. Simply the best.We love the proximity to all the small neighborhood restaurants on 8th Ave, and on 46th St (Restaurant Row) and in the surrounding area. They are charming and reasonably priced.The price we paid for our room was fantastic for New York City. We found an internet special that included Milford Club privileges. The Club privileges included continental breakfast every morning, plus chips and cookies and coffee and beverages throughout the day, and wired internet access for no additional charge. And the Milford Club lounge is lovely, the absolute nicest part of the entire hotel. Even if we have to pay extra for that, we will consider it in the future, it was so pleasant and so convenient.Security was excellent.The bed was comfortable. I'm guessing that it's &quot;newer&quot; than the rest of the furniture in the room. (Read the rest of the room info below).The elevators are faster than most hotels of this size.The other couple we were with had a death in the family while we were there. They said the hotel staff was very nice in accomodating them, and allowed them to cancel the remainder of their reservation, and to check-out late, with no extra charges. We thought that was very thoughtful.CONS - Check in was S L O W. We arrived at 11:30 am. The other couple we were with, they were able to check in immediately. We were told our room was not ready, so we checked our bags and ventured out into the city. When we returned at 2:30 pm, STILL no room. Even though official check-in time is 3 pm, It was ridiculous, since we were there during a very slow season for tourists. The desk staff was not very friendly regarding the delay in check-in.The entrance from the exterior is on the first floor. The front desk is on the second floor. The regular elevators stop on the second floor. There is an escalator going UP, but only a Grand Stairway going DOWN. When we left the hotel on a daily basis, we did not mind using the stairs. However, when we checked out, we discovered that we could not take our own luggage down in an elevator to the first floor. There is an elevator from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor, but that is only available for handicap access. Basically, they want to force you to use the bellman, in order to generate tips. We carried our own luggage down the stairs.I thought that the staff was generally NOT friendly.Finally, as stated in many of the reviews, the Milford is in need of renovation. While it is very CLEAN, there was wallpaper pealing in our bathroom, and the paint around the bathroom door looked like it was 50 years old (bumpy, like it has been painted over and over again). The furniture is shabby. Would I stay there again. Definitely. But keep in mind that this is a bargain hotel and not a luxury hotel.	
Jan 14 2009	Awesome!!	This hotel has an awesome location!! The staff was very friendly and accommodating and helpful. We checked into our room and it was nice but didn't have a great view so when we went back down to the front we asked if we could change into a room with a better view and they gave us a room with a fantastic view!! I loved this hotel and the for the location the price was more than reasonable!	
Jan 14 2009 	great value and location	We were very apprehensive about staying in this hotel after reading some of the reviews beforehand. But I have to say we were pleasantly surprised as we had only booked standard rooms! We stayed for five nights and found the staff to be extremely helpful and pleasant especially at the check-in counter, (Thank you Jennifer!). We requested nice rooms on our arrival and were given two corner rooms and were told that these were bigger and further away from elevator noise. Now the rooms are not luxury but are ideal for people who are looking to put there head down during a site seeing holiday. The rooms were clean and cleaned on a daily basis. The best part about this hotel is its location, with nearly all the major attractions within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again if Im ever in NY	
Jan 13 2009 	look for another hotel	We've stayed at the Milford Plaza - NY for 6 nights - after Christmas till the 6th Jan.There were works of renovation going on - wich we were not told before.We would like to refer that besides the location, everything was under what we expected.The room we got did not correspond at all to the description showed at the receipt from Hotels.com.We did not get a room with two double beds, we got a small tiny room with two single beds and a little space to move around,also the cleaning was not so good.The (small) lobby was always crowed, and had no place to sit, as we could not do it in our own room, we just had space to get into bed!!I just hope next time, next costumers from that site get a better service .	
Jan 12 2009 	Excellent location	This was our first trip to NYC to spend Christmas and New Year in the Big Apple. The hotel location is excellent as it is just behind Time Square about 2 minutes walk. I would advise about the joining Milford Club which has added benefits of late check out, continental breakfast and entry to their lounge with free internet access, snack all day and soft drinks (especially good for children). Because of the location you would be paying a lot higher for these bits and pieces. The staff are very good and polite. The gym is ample and clean. There are plenty of restaurants and theatres near the hotel.	
Jan 12 2009 	Great experience!	We couldn't have been more pleased with our choice of the Milford Plaza for our 2 night stay in NYC. My boyfriend and I decided to take a post-holiday get away to sightsee and explore the city. Upon arrival at 10:45 am, we were promptly checked in and given our room keys. We were very surprised to have our room ready since check-in wasn't until 3pm. We arrived to find a rather small (as expected) room but in excellent condition. The hotel is a bit dated and worn in some areas but nothing to worry about. The hotel is currently undergoing renovations on the inside and out so there are some blocked off areas. Our bathroom was very clean as well as the room. Others have mentioned not having hot water in the bathroom but I believe it's probably due to not following the directions for turning on the shower. There are clearly marked instructions that indicate the hotel has an &quot;anti scalding system&quot; on the shower. If the directions are followed, the water works just fine. If they aren't followed, the hot water will never begin flowing until you start the process over again. The location is absolutely perfect in terms of accessing theaters, restaurants, attractions and especially Times Square. The hotel security is excellent and you cannot get to your room or anywhere near an elevator without showing the very visible security personnel your room key. Our room was on the 20th floor which in the past at other NYC hotels has posed a problem regarding getting an elevator. I have had many situations where the wait for the elevator became a huge hassle because of the high volume of traffic and limited elevators. At the Milford Plaza, they have an excellent system for requesting your elevator. There are certain elevators allocated for each section of the hotel. Once you pass security, you push the button for the floor you are going to and the keypad will give you the corresponding elevator (a, b, c, d) to wait for. It never took more than a minute to have the elevator arrive and also eliminated the need to stop on several floors before arriving at yours. One warning though, once the elevator arrives you need to be ready and waiting because the door opens and closes quickly. The hotel has a very nice lobby (two floors) and reception area. They also offer a baggage check on the day of departure for $3 per bag. It was very convenient and well worth the money for us. We were able to spend an extra 7 hours in the city after checking out and before catching our flight home. The hotel also offers the use of a restroom on the first floor for guests who have already checked out of their room. This was quite helpful on our day of departure when we returned to claim our bags before catching the flight home. The restrooms are monitored by security and you must show your room key to get the restroom key to enter. All in all, it was a wonderful trip with a great hotel in an excellent location at an amazing price for NYC! As their motto goes, It's the &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot;.	
Jan 8 2009 	Great hotel for the money	Me and my husband stayed at the Milford Plaza for a week over Christmas. We were very apprehensive in going as we had read many poor reviews of the hotel.When we arrived at the hotel we were greated by very friendly security staff who showed us where to go. We only used reception twice- to book in, and to ask how to use the telephones, on both occasions they were very approachable and friendly. We upgraded our rooms for $30 dollars a day. This meant that we had a larger room, breakfast, which was only toast, muffins etc, but we found the food in New York very expensive and so were glad of this facility. Snacks and refreshments were available throughout the day and free internet access, which was really helpful when trying to locate places in New York and keeping in touch with my family.The hotel halls do need updating, which they have started to do, and my immediate impression when walking to the room was that it was like being back at university, however, the bedrooms were fine, a little musty smelling at times, but this soon went. After a long day walking all over New York, I was always pleased to be back at the hotel. Comfy, warm and safe.The room was small, but we didn't need one any bigger, as the only time spent in the room was sleeping, so the room was perfect for us. It was clean and very comfy and we had a view of Times Square. The towels and bedding got changed every day . We didn't find our room noisy at all, but were on the 23 floor. We had a TV in the room and had access to up to date movies for $11 per viewing. The hotel was in an amazing position, couldn't have asked for any better. There are many theatres to choose from- don't pre-book, go to the theatre on the day of the show you want to see to buy your ticket. My friend went to see Grease, it should have been $140 per person. Her family of 3 went and paid $109 in total and had their own box just above the stage! Also, just around the corner were a few cinemas with very comfy chairs!!!Just across the road is a big information centre where you can book trips and get lots of information about where to go. Also across the street is the main bus station. We bought tickets to shop at Woodbury Outlet, it is a definite must if you are wanting to do some shopping. It is an hour on the bus and cost just under $100 per couple, which sounds alot, but the saving you can get certainly make up for it. We had to buy an extra suitcase whilst there! We did see shoppers (obviously regulars) go with suitcases to put all their shopping in- great idea!Yellow cabs are easy to catch, but I would advise walking to places in the evening as the roads do get very busy and can take a long time and a lot of money to get there. We didn't do the bus tours (there are people in red and yellow jackets everywhere trying to sell you these), but my friend who went at the same time did and said it was well worth it. We had an amazing time, the position of the hotel and the friendly New York people really made it for me. I would reccommend this hotel to friends and family.	
Jan 7 2009 	Cheap and Nasty!!!	We wanted a honeymoon and a white Christmas in one so we had our holiday booked by a travel agent. Big mistake!!! Upon arrival we were placed in a room the size of a dog box with views of a brick wall! Upon complaining we were told by their useless staff that they were a one star hotel and that we could get a suite if we paid an extra $700. They did not give a s##t that we were on our honeymoon. The room we ended up in had no bar fridge and a TV made in the 1960's. The only thing going about this place is truely the location. Next time we will skip New York and go straight to Vegas!!!	
Jan 7 2009 	Clean and good location but tired and noisy.	Great location, clean but noisy rooms and poor service.Every single night at around 12:30AM to 1:30AM I was woken up by the noise of laundry baskets being wheeled from the elevators into a laundry room right next to our room (room 2126). I called several times and no one did anything. I challenged a member of staff whilst making the noise, yet it still did not stop. I imagine people in this room have been putting up with the same for years unless the laundry room has been moved which tells you something about the attitude to customer service.Put a carpet down! Limit the hours when you do the work, or just stop using the room.Or...just ignore it and offer to relocate the guests that complain, which is what I suggest the Milford philosophy has been and continues to be.Also - all the lifts on our floor gave an electric shock when summoning the elevator. Again, this did not change throughout our 5 day stay. I guess Milford doesn't depend on repeat custom.	
Jan 6 2009 	Avoid this place	Well the location is excellent, but that is about all I can say.When we had checked out I realised that I had left a bag in the room. I returned to security later that day and reported it, but it had not been handed in. So somebody has found a nice new Kipling bag in the room and kept it - I feel that I have been stolen from.Service is abysmal - we left our cases in the left-luggage until we had to leave for the airport. We had to queue for three quarters of a hour to retrieve the bags - I think the guy was going as slowly as he possibly could.The room was scruffy, noisy and about the size of a large dog kennel. Noise from adjoining rooms kept us awake.	
Jan 6 2009 	Keep looking	The location is no doubt excellent, but other than that, the Milford Plaza Hotel has nothing else going for it.Our hotel room was a dump. It looked like they forgot to finish cleaning it. It obviously hadn't been vacuumed. There was trash on the dresser and the sink had a bunch of someone else's hair in it. It was pretty disgusting. The room itself was miniscule, but I didn't expect more than that in Times Square. You really only get the basics and that's really all we were looking for, but the problem was that the basics at the Milford Plaza were falling apart. The TV didn't work at all. The vending machines on our floor didn't work. By far the most annoying though was that we had no hot water. For $200 a night, the least I expect is hot water.Please also note that the Milford Plaza Hotel doesn't distinguish the difference between a queen-sized bed and a full-sized bed. All of their queen-sized beds are actually full-sized beds. We had rejected a different hotel of a slightly lower price that was closer to our theatre simply because all of their queen-sized beds were booked and only had full-sized available. Turns out it didn't make a difference.Our package said it came with a free complimentary breakfast, but when we asked the front desk about it, they said there was no breakfast. Ummm, okay.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We will not be staying there again. There are other hotels in the same location and the same price that I'm certain are a step-up from the Milford Plaza.	
Jan 4 2009 	Flithford Hotel!	Our minimum time of 2 days spent in this hotel was more than enough to sum up our feelings of this hotel. Mounds of dust on floor, sweet wrappers left from previous guests and strands of hair on the pillows and bed sheets. No bar in hotel as it was 'under construction'. we did not get queen size bed which was confirmed in our booking on their website. Reception staff reflected the quality of the hotel and it's overall service. only positive was location but in reflection and extra few dollars would have went a long way for a more positive experience.	
Jan 1 2009 	What a deal!	We booked the Milford through a discount website based solely on the price. We were a large family group, with small children going to New York to see the lights at Christmas and needed something cheap and central. We got a clean, incredibly located hotel for an amazing price. Definitely better value than we expected.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are 'tired'. But, they were clean, and enough room to move. Our deal included breakfast, as well as unlimited snacks and beverages. The two employees in the breakfast room were polite, friendly and very helpful. I personally loved the security at the entrance to the elevators. We travelled with two teenagers and were never worried about them.	
Jan 1 2009 	definately stay here again!!	A week before arriving in NY i read the reviews on this Hotel and was somewhat dissapointed with some of the negative reviews and did consider changing hotels, and on arrival when we were told at check in our room wasnt ready and we were told we would have to wait another hour I was wishing we had changed, however when we returned again to check in and the room was now available i was still apprehensive but i didnt need to have worried our room was 2709 it was a large room with a fridge TV internet and fantastic views, it was clean and we didnt experience any &quot;musty &quot; smell!. you couldnt ask for a better location this was our first visit to NY and everywhere was so easily accessible , which is an advantage on a first stay visit to a large city with only a few days in which to get around. The hotel security was excellent no one was allowed past the concierge desk without showing your rooms keys and we felt very safe. we would definately consider the milford plaza again stay. the only critisism is at present there is no bar area to relax in before or after an evening out but i do beleive this is to be introduced. but over all absolutely no complaints at all.	
Dec 30 2008 	Fantastic Location but a dated room	We stayed at the Milford Plaza for 4 nights from 28th Nov  2nd Dec. The hotel is in the perfect location. 1 block west of times square!! So ideally placed for theatre and shopping.The room we stayed in was 2705 and was situated on the corner of the hotel with views north up 8th avenue and across the east river. The room did have a strong musty smell and is in need of some updating. As with all hotels in New York the room isnt the biggest, just a double bed, wardrobe and chest of drawers with a TV on top. The bathroom was also very small and had wallpaper on the wall which as with all wet rooms, was peeling off. However, due to the lack of time you actually spend in your hotel room whilst in New York this wasnt a problem. The hotel lobby is very nice and the reception staff and concierge are very friendly and willing to help you with any queries. We had booked a helicopter trip around the island via the internet prior to travelling and had to call to confirm the booking once in NY, we asked the concierge if he could do this for us and he was happy to do so. A gentle reminder to anyone travelling to NY or the USA from England, it is expected to tip around 15% - 20% for all services. This is not a big ask as the American people are all very friendly and always helpful.A word of warning, it does rain in New York, we forgot to take an umbrella and got very wet one day, so bear this in mind.	
Dec 29 2008 	locationlocationlocation	Stayed here for a week before christmas hotel is basic and needs a revamp.The rooms however were very clean and tidy with a cleaning service every day and fesh towels daily.The rooms are very small and need of a overhaul.The location is the saving grace one block from times square and all the action.We visited woodbury common and found lots of bargains the massive bus station is one block south of the hotel and the buses run every half hour beware the journey back it can take up to two hours depending on the traffic.The sightseeing tour buses are excellant value with their hop on hop off service.I would recommend the celtic bar one block north of the hotel for a lovely pint of murphys charley &quot;o,s&quot; opposite the hotel does a good range of meals at reasonable prices.The hotel has no bar or resturant and only has a small coffee shop which opens 7 to 1.But whatever get out there and enjoy the most vibrante city in the world!!!!!!!	
Dec 28 2008	great hotel	Well my family were apprehensive after reading the negitive reviews, but we were very pleased with the hotel, we've stayed in ny many times and would recommend this hotel ,our room was clean, bathroom was clean always had clean towels, the views from our room were great! security was good , lots of places to eat near hotel and if you want to see a show you only have to go round the corner to the hotel what a fantastic location!! for the price we paid i cant say enough about it i will be booking in again next year!!	
Dec 24 2008 	Lighten up folks! The Milford is great...	We stayed at the Milford for a family vacation the week before Christmas. We booked our flights and hotel reservations months ago, and in reading the Milford's recent reviews before our trip, were beginning to get a sinking feeling that we'd made the wrong choice. However, upon arrival, we were relieved to discover those doubts washed away by the Milford's fantastic location and other great attributes.After traveling on possibly the worst day (650 flights were cancelled into NYC that day, and we were lucky to get into Newark 12 hours after our anticipated original arrival), the Milford was a virtual snowy oasis! We had booked 3 rooms, and all of our requests (proximity to each other, bed size, etc.) were accommodated upon arrival (even though it was 2am and I'm sure the staff would've much rather been asleep!). Part of the charm of this hotel is its fantastic location as well as the history in its walls. Because it was built just before the Depression, the rooms are small (as current with the expectations of that time). Any traveler expecting huge rooms and over-the-top luxury at this great price just doesn't know New York hotels. The rooms are clean, bathrooms and closets are clean (though also small) and the standard hotel amenities (iron, hangers, television, soaps) are all there. We chose not to have our towels and sheets changed daily for the short time we're there (you're welcome, Mother Earth!) but housekeeping staff would've absolutely been there like clockwork to do it, were it not for our ever-present Privacy Please hanger, which is all that is required if you choose to recycle your linens.In short, the Milford Plaza is a great hotel for those of you who are heading to New York for the city, not for the hotel room. If you're wanting to lie around in 1,000+ thread count Egyptian cotton sheets and be pampered all day, go somewhere else, but any sensible traveler should be more than happy at the Milford. If we ever venture into the frigid temperatures of NY at Christmas (which is all part of the experience), the Milford will definitely be on our list. And I will say you haven't lived until you've walked through Times Square in the snow. :)The Milford's truly outstanding aspect is its location- blocks from Times Square and great restaurants, every theatre you would ever want to visit and all the hustle and bustle NYC is known for. Try Junior's around the corner for great breakfast and great desserts (the cheesecake is supposed to be voted best in the city, but I'll award Carnegie Deli's titanic-sized portions with that honor hands-down, along with their to-die-for pickles, pastrami and corned beef.) Carmine's is also some of the best Italian you'll ever put in your mouth, served in huge family-style portions, and it's just around the corner. Expect a wait, unless you're lucky enough to get a reservation. If you're up for a bit of walking, venture over to Lombardi's in Little Italy for fantastic pizza- billed as the oldest pizzeria in America. As for shows, I can't recommend Jersey Boys enough (as my husband said, the lead sounds more like Frankie Valli than Frankie Valli ever did!) Girls, if you're planning on meeting Daniel Radcliff after he exits his show, Equus, get there early to beat the gathering throng of girls and take your zoom lens!All in all, a fantastic trip, made even better by the quality of the Milford.	
Dec 23 2008 	A big disappointment	I planned this trip as a surprise birthday gift for my husband. We arrived to utter confusion in the crowded main lobby. We arrived early so we knew we wouldn't be getting our room until after 3 pm. By that time the crowds in the lobby had vanished so check in wasn't too hectic. We had to walk through a narrow hallway down from the end of the hall to get to assigned corner room which was extremely small. There was a dirty cup on the floor next to the bed and the bathtub had mold growing around the faucets. The sink was clogged and barely drained. Its a good thing that we were so busy we didn't have to stay in the room much because it really was depressing. I must say the Milford Club was very nice and the attendants were very friendly and helpful. Our next visit to New York City will not have the Milford Hotel in our plans.	
Dec 23 2008	Basic hotel great location great low rates	We stayed at the Milford Plaza for a long weekend Dec. 2008. We chose this hotel because it's location was central to the city (near a subway station) and because the price was cheap on Expedia.com for $129.00 per night. The hotel room was small and basic with a tv, bed, nightstand, and desk. Bathroom was small but worked well for two people. Windows overlooking the city were loud at night and we needed earplugs to sleep. But, this is part of it!  It was convenient to many of the nearby theatres if that is what you are going to NYC to do. For us, we never stayed in the Times Square area, we were on the subway each day to go north or south to the Met, Guggenheim, Central Park, Little Italy or SOHO to eat or do some sightseeing. If we go back we will probably get a hotel in a quieter part of the city. Times Square is the worst part of the city for crowding! One street over, and there are many little quaint romantic places that are very QUIET. Overall we enjoyed our experience and recommend you take the subways, we never got lost.	
Dec 23 2008 	Theater trip hotel	I booked a super special deal, $129/night, so the price was right -- AND you get what you pay for! The room with 2 double bed was quite small with no desk or table. And we could hear our neighbors talking. In Italian, which made the intrusion more charming than otherwise. The room was old, perfunctory and clean. The bathroom small, but clean. The view was that of a cheap NYC apartment, not a Central Park hotel. The club floor amenities were really great. This is one of the best, freshest, largest selection of continental breakfasts I've ever seen in a modern, pleasant dining room with computers, newspapers and televisions for guests. It was also nice to have access to the drinks and snacks there until midnight. The hotel is smack in the middle of the neon theatre district, and we were out and about a lot, so it was convenient and well located for us. The hotel security was good and the internet pretty good, but not great. At this price, I would come back here again for a theatre based vacation.	
Dec 22 2008 	Dubious .....	Having booked our trip 12 months ago and seeing the conflicting reviews of the hotel, I really wish we had not stayed at the Milford Plaza. On first impressions it is great and yes, they are going through renovations but still ..We had booked two rooms - one for me and my husband and a twin for our two boys. When we arrived we didn't even have rooms allocated - they had to see what they had remaining. Surely booking so far in advance we should have had rooms allocated. We were only separated by one level and the boys room was OK - bit small but they didn't seem to mind. Our room was a different story. It was awful and was right above a generator at the back on the 5th floor. We managed one sleepless night and then asked for another room and we got one on the 25th floor. It was a lot roomier and a whole lot better than the first one. Overall, it was adequate. Our room was kept clean although the shower heads could do with looking at.Location is the only good thing about this hotel I am sorry to say. It was a trip planned some time ago and I really wish we had stayed at a different hotel and we also paid nearly £1,000 per room - certainly not worth that kind of money.	
Dec 20 2008 	In need of revamp	This hotel is in perfect location for New York sight seeing and theatres,just a short walk from most attractions.However,the hotel is in need of a revamp.Rooms are small but comfortable with clean sheets and towels daily.Security is second to none.The shower in our room was like a Firemans hose wich went unrepaired in spite of our complaints.There is no bar or restaurant or indeed anywhere to even get coffee after mid day.Very little seating in the lobby and as check out is at noon and if like us you have a long wait for your airport pick up,it would be nice to be able to relax somewhere.If and when the revamp takes place this hotel will be a great place to stay.Recommend for drinks,Charlie Os bar across the street and Juniors restaurant round the corner for breakfast &amp; other meals.	
Dec 13 2008	Flea pit	My daughter and I stayed here for 5 horrible nights. On the first night I was bitten on both arms. While I was compalining another hotel guest came down to the desk with exactly the same problem. They moved us to another room on a different floor and that night my daughter was bitten. Also the bathroom never got cleaned and I was a bit dubious about the sheets! Although the location was great the inconvenience of the dirt and bites took away from the greatness of the location. If you do decide to stay at this hotel avoid the 11th 17th and 22nd floors!!	
Dec 8 2008 	Excellent Hotel for seeing everything in New York	Location was the best thing about the Milford plaza - 2 mins from Times Square with lots of pubs / restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Club Room is worth the extra cash if you aren't a big breakfast eater - pastries, fruit yogurts with juices, coffee's etc. Rooms were standard size for Manhattan. Bathroom was small - the radiator was extremely hot with steam coming off it. Rooms were serviced and clean sheets and towels every day. All the staff in the hotel were extremely friendly and very helpful. After all the reviews I'd read on places like Trip Advisor, I was expecting a dump. The hotel is in the middle of being renovated but I would only have one complaint -there's no bar in the hotel yet! Security is fantastic in this hotel - 24 hour security guards at the elevators and you can't access them without a key card.Overall a very good stay and I would have no complaints on the Milford Plaza.	
Dec 7 2008	Great Location Lousy Hotel	The location of the hotel was great but the rooms were very, very small and dirty and in need of updating. The bathroom had a cracked sink, black mould on the bathtub tiles, hair in the bathtub, and a hole in the wall by the bed. Would recommend paying a little more and staying elsewere. My friend had a cockroach crawl across her while sleeping!!	
Dec 4 2008 	Great location!	This hotel has a great location but don't expect luxury. The first room we were allocated was dark and tiny, we complained and were moved to a slightly bigger room. The beds were very comfy and the room was clean but in need of some renovation. The bathroom was okay but also in need of some attention. Reception staff were not over friendly but the concierge and security staff were helpful and quite friendly. Would I stay there again I doubt it. Also compare the rates being offered by the hotel direct to those of the travel agent as I feel we paid over the odds at £1000 per room for five nights!! Maybe these are NYC rates I'm not sure. Finally don't use the room phone unless you have to I had a phone bill of $60 for 2 calls to the UK totaling about 2.5mins.	
Dec 1 2008	Thanksgiving	We stayed at the Milford Plaza for 5 nights staff very helpful,rooms clean, beds comfy and located just off Time Square what more do you need for a stay in New York( plus it only rained on our last day!)	
Nov 29 2008 	Very Pleased with the Milford Plaza	We stayed at the Milford Plaza from November 13-16. The location is perfect if you want to be close to Times Square and the theater district without paying in the $300-$500 range, which many of the hotels in that area will cost you. There are a number of restaurants within a one block walk that are inexpensive with good food, such as the Celtic Pub, the Tuscany Grill, John's Pizza, and Smith's Restaurant.The hotel feels secure, as you have to show your room key to a hotel staffer before getting on the elevator. The elevators are plentiful and never required a long wait. We requested a quiet room away from street noise and the front desk staff was very willing to comply. Our room was indeed quiet and the beds were very comfortable. The rooms are small but clean. The bathroom was fine, except for the cold water faucet which put out a noise like a fog horn when the handle was turned. The only real drawbacks were that the lobby snack area is very limited in its choices (mostly cold food or snacks) and there is no public access computer to check e-mail unless you book the Milford Club, where you do have access to a business center and breakfast room. Problem is, they only have 1 queen bed in those Milford Club rooms and we needed 2 separate beds.Over-all though, you can't beat the price at that great location, comfortable sleep and feeling of safety, so I would definitely recommend the Milford Plaza.	
Nov 28 2008 	Don't expect luxury	For anyone wanting a luxury break this is not the hotel for you. The Milford Plaza is, at best, a 2* establishment with small rooms desperately in need of updating.We were given a tiny room with nowhere to hang our clothes when we first checked in. We told reception that the room was not suitable and requested a complimentary upgrade. At first we were told we would have to pay an extra $30 each per night but after refusing and standing our ground, we were eventually given a larger room free of charge. The room was clean and the beds comfortable and that's about all that can be said.As our week went on we soon found that a lot of the staff were quite rude (especially on the concierge desk) apart from one or two individuals. Also, Garveys Irish Pub (as advertised on some of the web-sites) is non-existant and the hotel's coffee shop closes at 2 in the afternoon.Anyway, that's enough of the negatives...the one thing the Milford has in it's favour is its location. 10 out of 10 for that, you are right on top of everything. With Times Square literally just around the corner you are just a hop, skip and a jump to all the sights.One tip: go out the side entrance of the building, turn right and keep going for 100 yards or so until you get to Juniors...a great place to have breakfast. Great surroundings, friendly staff, and huge portions!We did all the usual tourist sites and more besides.Take the subway to Ground Zero (only costs 2 dollars one way). The site is now being re-developed but you can visit the Tribute Centre and St Peter's Church which was opened up for the rescuers after 9/11. There are small displays inside the church and the whole thing is quite emotional. Whilst 'down this end' of Manhatten go to Wall St, Pier 6 to grab a sightseeing Helicopter ride, then go thru' Battery Park and catch the ferry over to Liberty and Ellis Island. All well worth doing. Try to grab a show while you are in New York. We pre-booked 'The Lion King' and got seats on the 2nd row from the front. The show was fantastic.New York is an 'in-your-face, larger-than-life' destination that is everything you see in the movies. It's a place that has to be experienced once in your lifetime. On the whole, people are friendly and it is surprisingly easy to get around on foot. Go and enjoy!	
Nov 24 2008 	Great location clean and compact	Just returned from a long weekend to celebrate partners 50th birthday. Hotel has scaffolding outside the first few floors although as far as we could see no building work was taking place. Room had an en-suite and was plenty big enough for 2 especially as we were informed that New York hotels were tiny anyway as they were such old buildings.Rooms were cleaned daily and bed made. Bed was queen size and was really comfortable and room was quiet even though we were situated next to the lift...Location was superb and had everything close to hand. Really couldn't fault and would definately go back.	
Nov 23 2008 	good value for the price	This hotel is well located and the price was right. Although the room was small, we did not spend much time there except to sleep. We found it comfortable and adequate for our needs. The free continental breakfast and free internet was a big plus. We would stay here again.	
Nov 22 2008 	The Milford was great	We stayed 4 nights at the Milford Plaza in one of the Milford Club rooms. This meant we had access to a lounge where breakfast was availiable, free internet usage too. The hotel is being renovated so the room we had was old but it was roomy and clean. Great view from the room up 8th Ave (we were on a corner). For NY standards it was good value for money, would recommend paying the extra for the Milford Club. The location was terrific, a couple of blocks from Time Square. Would highly recommend.	
Nov 22 2008 	Fantastic Location	Spent 4 nights 5 days in the Milford Plaza in New York - it was our first time to New York and we were not disappointed by either the hotel or the City.RoomI was a little sceptical to start with after reading so many bad reviews about the Milford Plaza but I need not have been - on arrival we were greeted by very helpful recpetion staff, we were even asked which floor we wanted to be on, we requested the 20th floor wth a view, two double beds (3 girlfriends), we were not disappointed. Yes, the rooms aren't massive but they were plenty big enough for the three of us, our bags and shopping etc. The view was brill and the room clean and tidy. Each day the maid came and cleaned and made beds up etc...Location what can i say.... the location is fantstic - so close to the theatre district, time square, empire state, grand central and the bus tours....after a few days of settling in you do realise just how close everything is and how easy it is to get to other places - we were blown away...New York itself if very busy, lots going on and its true i dont think the city ever sleeps. There are plenty of restuarants, bars and delis near to the hotel - Carve is great for breakfast. One place i would avoid though is Roxys in Times Square not a good meal at all, over priced and food greasy and stale ugggh....Be careful with the electronic shops along some of the streets, we got duped into buying what we thought was an IPOD but turned out to be a MP4 player, the hotel were really good in giving us advice on what our rights were and how to go about trying to get our money back, thank you! We did manage to exchange for the right goods but may not have been brave enough to try if the hotel reception staff had not been so helpful.Security at the hotel is great too - staff are on hand to ensure no unathorised entry into the lifts, you need to show your room key each time you pass them...At the end of your stay you can leave your bags in the baggage holding room for $3 a bag and arrange to collect them when you want to, this is great if you have a night flight and dont want to be carrying your luggage all around the city....The doorman will even arrange a cab for you too, dont forget to tip...One thing I did find strange and took a little to get used to was the price of things, the price that is shown does not have tax on top, so when you get to the till to pay they add about 8% onto the price...and they always add a surcharge on in restaurants for the tip too, although you dont have to pay this if you dont want to.Must visit all the usual sights, Emprie, Rockerfella Centre, Central Park, the bus tour also is great for showing you where/what places are, as there are no signs to tell you where anything is, you only have your guide books, also if you visit Grand Central Station there is a Craft/Christmas Fayre on with some really fantastic shops, hand made jewellery etc well worth a visit but its only there until just before Christmas...I would definatley recommend a stay - yes the hotel in places could do with a lick of paint, but your not going to New York to stay in your room, the location is to die for and the staff very friendly - all in all a very good few days was had and we would definatley stay there again.	
Nov 21 2008 	Its the 2nd best value in nyc after the statten island ferry	We stayed at the mph for the Calzaghe fight from the 6th to 10th Nov. This is my 3rd visit and my 3rd stay at the mph. Its great value for money, location is spot on and the security wonderful.Yes its busy and yes the rooms are smaller than you might expect but they are clean and generally the staff are good.A bit of advice after you have made your original booking keep checking the website for room rates, I did and saved myself over $500 when occupancy rates dropped and they were offerring discounts. Also the Milford Club status is well worth the $8 extra we paid per night for the breakfast alone.I'd reccomend it to anyone and if you do have a problem just tell them, they will soon sort it	
Nov 21 2008 	So disappointed	Just back from stay in the Milford Plaza. Booking stated that I had Superior room, that was certainly not the case. Room was dirty bathroom was covered in mould and room had a strange odour!!Dirt streaked up the walls and on to the ceiling in the bedroom area and carpet did not look as though it had been hoovered.Reception did give a replacement room and although this was much cleaner had a problem with small cockroaches. Stayed in the Milford 2 years ago but was under the impression that rooms were being upgraded then, so was very disappointed to see that nothing has changed. Location of the hotel is fabulous and is central to all the sights so I don't understand why standards are so low in this hotel.	
Nov 21 2008 	Brilliant location	The rooms at this hotel are clean and tidy. The ststem for the lifts is excellent, you use a keypad to select the floor you are staying on and it tells you which lift to wait at. That lift then takes you to your floor. The position of the hotel is brilliant, very close to times square, with most of the attractions close within easy walking distance. Having read some of the reviews on this page, we were a little worried, the hotel is slightly tired but as I said, clean and tidy, this also one of the cheaper hotels so close to Times Square. We had a deluxe room with two double beds on the 21st floor, which had a wonderful view over the City to the Hudson River. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay.	
Nov 20 2008 	spotless and safe and perfect location	stayed in the milford plaza for 4 nites,14th - 18th of nov,the rooms were perfect and clean,for the price of the rooms you cant go wrong,if its shopping and broadway you are going to new york for then this place is a must,security in the hotel is great,you cant get to your room without showing your room card to security,our rooms were cleaned everyday and towels changed,times square is 1 min from it,the stie seeing tour starts 1 min from the hotel,central park is 10 mins away and the main bus station is 5 mins away--handy for when going to woodbury common,we had all our site seeing and shopping and broadway shows organised down in reception,we paid 200 dollars a ticket to see wicked,worth every penny!!!!!	
Nov 19 2008 	Great location poor service dirty rooms and unpolite security staff	The location of this hotel is great BUT I had a lot of problems like getting charges for calls I didnt made, which was fixed, then one guy of the security staff was not polite (a big black man) He started yelling at me because did not showed the hotel card as soon as he asked for it, the reason was I was handling a lot of bags so could not stop but any way it was a really uncomfortable situation.Also the room was not clean at all, the bathroom was not cleaned from previous guest visit..... I would never come back.	
Nov 17 2008 	Location location location	There was nothing special about this hotel except the absolute fantastic location. My sister and I were there to see Broadway shows and you couldn't get any better than this. The room was small and obviously not one of the remodeled ones. Paint chipped, no water pressure for the cold water from the sink (makes it difficult to brush your teeth), the door didn't close easily. The bed was fine and the room overall was clean. No soda machine on our floor and I had to go to 5 floors before I found one with what I wanted. I did like the security and how they checked for your room key. No problems with the elevator. I've stayed in better hotels in NY but again, if you want a perfect location at a decent price, you can't beat it.	
Nov 14 2008 	Don't be afraid to stay here!	Wow! I was very skeptical to stay here once reading the reviews... I do have high standards, and do look to others reviews to avoid making mistakes... Having read and reread some terrible stories of what a misery this hotel is, I was more than hesitate to try the Milford Plaza. Tiny Rooms, Slow Elevators, Rude Staff, Mold, Bugs, Etc... None were true! None were Rude! This is a hotel with a great location and an excellent staff. They check that you have a room key everytime you go to get on the elevator and that equals security to me. The escalator was under repair, but at least there were men there to work on it, rather than just an Out of Order sign... As for the elevators being slow, they work on a system that is different from most. Press the button for the floor you are staying on, and it tells you what elevator to wait in front of. In less than a minute that door opens and you get on... Not too hard huh? The room size was standard for NYC. Loud noise outside the building? If noise bothers you, maybe another vacation is more your speed because NYC is a busy, loud, living city. Noise is not something that your hotel can stop, so please be realistic. I find that someone who wants something for nothing will naturally be dissapointed when nothing is given. A vacation is what you make it, and if you want to stay right in the middle of all the action, then Milford Plaza might just be for you. Great Price, Clean Rooms, and a helpful staff all combined to make my stay just perfect for me!	
Nov 14 2008 	Great place! Excellent Location!	Let me start by telling you, DO NOT go by the negative reviews, thats what I did. I was too filled with dread with what this hotel with would offfer after I read the negative reviews but I still took a chance and I absolutely do not regret it. Its very simple, you get what you pay for. The rooms are not big but they arent as small as we thought they would be. It was a perfect size for my husband and me, the bed was queen size, clean and comfortable. The bathroom is small but clean and linens and towels were changed everyday. There was also an iron and ironing table in the room. The staff mind their own business but are helpful if you ask for assistance also the security in the hotel is top notch. But the best part of it all was the location. You walk 3 minutes to the next block and you are in Times Square, 2 blocks to Port authority Bus terminal and the subway, 3 blocks to restaurant row. What more could one ask for. If you are in NYC to shop and eat and party, then Miflord plaza is the place for you, dont do go there if you're looking for something pretentious. The only thing I thought they need to provide in the room is a hot water kettle to make coffee when you wake up, other than that I was satisfied with my stay.	
Nov 12 2008 	Excellent Stay at Milford!	We stayed here from Oct 31-Nov 9, 2008. Little leary due to mixed reviews from other travellers but very pleased upon our arrival. Easy check-in, large room (compared to most downtown hotels in large cities ie.San Francisco), awesome staff. We had a &quot;Milford Club&quot; room, I don't know if it made a difference in size. It does give you access to the lounge which offers free snacks, beverages, internet and continental breakfast...go early if you want bagels! Other offerings: toast, croissants, pastries, cereal, donuts, apples and oranges. After breakfast, there are granola bars, nuts, cookies, chocolate bars, chips and fruit to choose from. Our linens and towels were changed daily, sometimes they even left twice the amount of towels. Plenty of room for our large suitcase to be left on luggage rack by the bed and we left the other one in the closet. Two closets stocked with hangers (hooks at very back of closet to hang jeans on too) and there is a large dresser as well. Tub and shower in one...water a little touchy...be prepared for extra hot bursts and sometimes cold ones too &amp; toilet area was a little cramped. Bed is SO comfortable even with construction outside and window open we slept very soundly on the 23rd floor. VERY close to Times Square, Hell's Kitchen, Broadway shows &amp; Subway system. Based on time of year and all the things going on in NYC our $365 CDN incl taxes on average per night was well worth it. Only complaint, elevator was a little slow at times do to the system they have. You punch in your floor number and it tells which elevator to go to and you WAIT. Sometimes, after you punch your floor in once, you can punch in a floor higher and then your floor &amp; trick it into sending two elevators up. Also, if you're checking in &amp; escalator not working...go to security on ground level to take elevator to registration or you may walk up to that level with bags...do not ever count on escalator working.	
Nov 12 2008 	Great Location but That's It	Location is terrific. Room was dated but fairly clean, except for mold in the bathroom (the exhaust system doesn't work too well). Bed was OK. Front Desk staff were extremely unfriendly. Charged a porter charge, though no-one ever helped with our bags. No coffee maker in the room. Internet as additional $10/day. Charge to keep your bags for an hour after check-out. I wouldn't stay here again.	
Nov 11 2008 	Do not stay at this hotel unless you want to catch scabies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	It should have been a sign that when I had to change rooms 2 times - once for being dirty and the second for seeing bugs in the bed - that this was not going to be a pleasant experience. In fact it has caused me some serious distress because I caught SCABIES from sleeping at this hotel!!!! DISGUSTING. I took me several weeks to figure out what was wrong with my skin and by that time it had spread over my entire body. I am MISERABLE because this hotel cannot do its job and keeps its rooms clean. The hotel did comp me my stay for the inconvenience of changing rooms twice but it was completely not worth it for the misery that I am in. AVOID STAYING HERE AT ALL COSTS.	
Nov 11 2008 	Way Better Than Expected	I was really hesitant to book this hotel after reading the reviews, but I saw a special on Travelzoo and booked it. The rate was $179.00/night with a substantial breakfast included and access to the club room which had snacks, coffee, tea and sodas until midnight. The rate also included free internet in the room and computers in the club room. My room was was a good size and clean. The staff was very professional and friendly. My one complaint was that the walls were very thin and could hear people in the hall.The location is excellent and is accessible to anywhere in the city; lots of buses, subway lines and walking distance to many great sites. I stayed here for a work trip, but would stay here again for fun.	
Nov 8 2008	MIlford Plaza	I stayed at the Milford Plaza in New York City. The hotel is in a great location, only five minutes from Time Square. You will never get lost going to the hotel at night as all you have to do is find Time Square. The hotel was very clean and the rooms are the perfect size for two people. There are not enough elevators for all the guest. as had to wait for a least 5 minutes going to my room at night. But for under 200 a night, that is a price that i will pay to stay at a nice clean hotel in New York City.	
Nov 8 2008 	Give this place a chance we had a great stay!	I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Milford Plaza and can say that after reading the mixed reviews was a little worried, all I can say is that I felt I had to write a review to clear up some of the issues written about.1) The location is perfect, come out the main entrance, turn left or right, and left or right again and you are in the middle of Times Square! Also Central Park is around a 15 min walk at a slow pace.2) We had a twin room and it was adequately spacious, the other 2 of our party were 2 rooms along from us, and their room was laid out slightly differently and looked a little smaller. This is the thing, as we walked past rooms where doors were open, the sizes of the rooms differed and I think it's luck of the draw whether you get a good or bad sized room.3) Yes the decor is slightly dated, but not sure about some people who have commented on this, but I wasn't there to look at the 4 walls of the room, I was there to see the sights of NYC, so it didn't bother me in the slightest!4) The beds were V. comfortable, and had clean sheets EVERY day, I have stayed in 5 Star hotels that haven't had that.5) The bathroom did have a small amount of mould on the tiles, BUT the bath was NOT dirty, was clean and had Fresh towels EVERY day.6) The Staff were very friendly &amp; helpful.	
Nov 7 2008 	not bad reasonably priced	Stayed at the Milford Plaza in April and I would rate it so so.location - top drawer right next to Times SquareVFM - good vfm considering locationrooms - so so, a little small and slightly dated but clean enoughStaff - very good, very friendly and always keen to help.top tip - start your night with a quick beer in the irish bar attached to the hotel	
Nov 6 2008 	Shabby and definately not chic (but great location)	a dump of a place to be honest, not dirty but run down, depressing, tired, massive, impersonal, but I will say the beds were comfy (although very soft), and the location was amazing. However, coming back to this after intense days in the city makes you want to cry its that crap. The bath was tiny as well. If I'm going to new york I want to stay somewhere far better next time. And it isnt even cheap!	
Nov 5 2008 	I must have high standards	We booked this hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor's website. With such good ratings we were sure we'd paid (a lot of money) for a really great hotel room.What a disappointment :o(We couldn't open our suitcases on the floor as there wasn't enough space, the shower and bathroom were weeny and the shower ran boiling hot to freezing cold at will, the escalator was broken (we went back for one final night at the end of 2 weeks and it was still out of order), drinks machine broken, one of the lift's broken (making getting down in the morning a very long process) - all for something like £190/night. I get the point about the location but for £190 I expect the moon-on-a-big-shiny-stick...I know there are better deals in NYC from listening to other people's recommendations.. and next time I will use them..	
Nov 5 2008 	The Smell	On a recent trip to the states for a week I stopped in three hotels over the 7 night period.....and this was by far the worst.RoomsTiny and there was quite a strong smell of mould. The wallpaper was an off yellow, looks like it's not had decorating done since the 60's...ReceptionThe escalator was broke... no big deal, the queue to check in... not such a big deal, the fact the most of the ammenties in the hotel where either broken or unavailable... annoying... but this is NYC and you're not there to be the hotel.. but come one, for £150 + per night you expect something.The Location is good is you want to step out the hotel right into the busiest place in the world...which some kinda goes hand in hand in stopping anywhere near Broadway Time Sq...All in all I was hugely dissapointed with this hotel, easily the worst I have stopped in, I do plenty of research (normally via this site) and usually end up somewhere pretty decent... but people saying it's a bit small, a bit smelly a bit out of date, don't really do this place justice...If you can anything for the same money or plus 10-15%.. Go for it.I am 27 and I visited with my girlfriend for two night out of seven in the USA...	
Nov 3 2008	Cosy but very comfortable	Although very small our room was perfectly clean and very comortable; the bed, in particular, was just right. Linen was changed daily and the bathroom, again, though small, was more than adequate. The location was perfect and the staff very friendly and helpful. We would happily return there and would have no hesitation recommending this venue to other travellers.Enjoy!	
Nov 2 2008 	Location is everything	As others have said the location of this hotel is key, it is so central - close to Times square, 2 blocks to the Port Authority bus station ( to catch the bus to Woodbury common) and an easy walk to Macys etc.The rooms are small, there was 3 of us so we booked a superior room, but this was still small. Also we were on the 10th floor and the first night there was a lot of traffic noise and general hotel noise, but you are in the city that doesn't sleep so to be expected. We stayed here years ago also and not a lot has changed. There is a major refurb planned for this hotel so expect that there will be some changes in the future.Security is tight and the staff are fine.The hotel is next to the theatres and we stopped outside &quot;all my sons&quot; and got to see Katie Holmes and John Lithgow so was good for star spotting, the cops that control the crowds here are worth hanging around for just for pure entertainment value!Juniors is worth having breakfast and dinner in if you want good value and decent food.Overall would stay here again, looking forward to seeing the changes in the hotel once the refurb has taken place.	
Oct 28 2008	Perfect location.	Stayed here Nov 04, Nov 06 and going back this Novemeber.The size of your room can be a bit of a lottery from normal american size to teeny.Hotel was clean and comfy enough with perfect location for a short shopping trip.Other reviews are correct bathrooms and furniture needs updating but from what I have seen the hotel are doing this a bit at a time.	
Oct 25 2008 	A bit shabby but great location	This Hotel has a great location but the rooms are very small and especially the bathrooms need an urgent renovation!The cleanliness of the rooms is not corresponding with the price you pay for the night. It could be a lot cleaner!Service is average and for almost everything you have to pay extra. Security is good. Every guest has to show his room key, before you are allowed to enter the elevators and a small safe is included in every room.All in all this hotel is okay for everyone who prefers a good location but is not looking for luxury.	
Oct 24 2008 	Decent place excellent service	I, too, had low expectations due to the reviews I had read on here, but was pleasantly surprised. Originally booked by my husband's employer for us with 2 double beds, we held out for 1 queen on a lower level and were given a corner room on the 6th floor. There was plenty of room for our 2 large suitcases, a stroller and car seat. The bathroom was cold and the shower wasn't great but it was clean. Sure, it's an old building (under much-needed renovation) but the location is amazing (steps to Times Square, bus station and subways) and the security and other staff were more than helpful and always friendly. We required assistance regularly as we needed to access a password-restricted elevator often for our stroller. I had a problem with the soda machine and it was resolved quickly. We felt very safe and overall quite comfortable for our 4 night stay with an almost 5 month old. It was no luxury hotel but it met our needs and, really, who spends all of their time in their room in NYC??!	
Oct 24 2008 	Milford Plaza New York Top Location.	Date at hotel 18th Oct - 22nd Oct 2008.Reviewer - Kevin, from the Holywell area of North Wales.We stayed at this hotel for four nights to celebrate my wife's birthday.The hotel could not have been more central to all the main attractions of New York. Times Square 200 yard walk, Empire State Building 10 block walk ( 15 minutes). theatres galore on the doorstep.There are some alterations taking place at the moment that do not affect the guests. The main foyer is first class, and staff members go out of their way to make sure you are looked after.. The security is tight but that is the same all over the city. The rooms however need a lick of paint but that small problem did not ruin a brilliant stay. You are so busy anyway that you do not spend a great deal of the day at the hotel. There is also a souvenir shop and a cafe that sells superb coffee and croissants in the morning.. Hoping to go back for another visit and will certainly consider using the Milford again.	
Oct 24 2008 	Great Choice!	I was there last september for vacations. The location is great, you can walk to Times Square. About the rooms, is right everything is told here, the rooms are small and the furniture old. But if you are going to new york for seightseen and walk arround, you just get to the hotel to sleep, so who care! Prices? I little bit overrated, but in this hotel you are paying for location not for ammenities.	
Oct 23 2008	Very disappointing	Visited this on an escorted tour - not a hotel the company normally uses. The location is amazing, short walk to Times Square in one direction and 'Restaurant Row' on 46th St in the other. The public areas are smart. But we insisted on moving to another (cheaper) hotel. We could just about have put up with the tiny rooms, although nowhere for cases, etc without tripping over them, very little drawer space, bathroom a bit tatty, no coffee machine - but, one floor down from our window were four NOISY air conditioners, which disturbed us in the night even when wearing ear-plugs (and I normally wear hearing aids in the day!). The constant drone was quite literally unbearable. This would not apply to all rooms, but others in our party were equally disturbed by traffic noise.	
Oct 21 2008 	Perfect hotel to stay in New York	Ok.. so before I went I was a little dubious about the hotel from some of the reviews but those that complained must have either had a one off bad experience of their expectations are a little too high!! The Milford Plaza is a lovely hotel which is not the most modern but certainly not something to moan about. Our room was lovely and clean, bathroom included. The rooms werent as small as I imagined, we had plenty of room to put our clothes &amp; toiletries. Everyday we got back from a hectic day of sightseeing to find our room cleaned and bed made.. hotel concierge would help you in any way they good and always finished off with 'have a nice day'!There is a small coffee shop which serves breakfast.. but hey your in new york.. go out to a proper diner and have a real american breakfast!! This hotel cant be beaten for location, step outside the front door and you can see times square!! Also restuarant row is just two blocks away.. Perfect!!So to sum up, Milford Plaza is a great hotel for tourists visiting New York, and brilliant value for money! For those of you looking for a hotel room that is the size of your apartment then spend your money on the Waldorf or the Plaza but you wont have as much shopping money and lets face it.. who would want to shop in New York!! Have fun..	
Oct 21 2008 	Great location great price great way to experience NYC	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Milford Plaza just this past weekend.The 17th till the 19th. It is a basic room but very clean and a little bit bigger than the usual closet size nyc hotel room, so we were pretty happy with it. The security at the hotel is amazing and we felt quite safe there..you had to show your room card before going to the elavators to go up to your floor.The locations is fantastic.Just 1 block from time square and 3 from 5th ave &amp;st.patricks cathedral and rockefellar center!You can also walk to the empire state building and central park, just have your walking shoes on!! there is a great restaurant just around the corner called juniors, they have great breakfast and lunch.Overall this hotel is very accomadating, clean,safe place to stay while visiting fabulous NYC! :)enjoy it!	
Oct 20 2008 	Dingy dingy dingy	I stayed at Milford Plaza this past weekend. Very disappointed. This facility needs to be REFURBISHED very soon. Just gut this oldish building, and start over. The room was SMALL, which is OK, but then, when you are paying in the order of $300 a night, you should not have to put up with a grungy bathroom with old, old, old fixtures, and: catch this: MILDEW around the bathtub. I just snuck in the bathroom for a quick shower (eyes closed). That's not my idea of a relaxing weekend in New York.A buble bath is out of the question in there, at least if you are like me, a fan of clean and posh bathrooms.Ah! and I nearly forgot: NO individual temperature control in the room. They turned on the heat, and there was nothing I could do about it. I am a hot person, I rarely heat my bedroom, and I just had to sweat and sweat in there until it was time to leave.First and last time at Milford Plaza. I am sure I can do much better in New York.	
Oct 20 2008 	Great lolcation	The Milford is about to be renovated and the rooms are fairly tired. Small rooms and very small bathrooms, but I believe this is pretty standard for NY hotels. It is in a great location though, we walked to most places, right around the corner from Times Square and close to everything. Would definitely stay there again.	
Oct 19 2008 	Take care!	If you want to stay &quot;on stage&quot;, go ahead. It is located in the heart of Braodway, too close to Times Square. But take care: the room is too small. And if they offer boradband weireless internet, do not belive. The service is not free(about $ 13/day) and it is slow (less than 30 kbps). The staff always seems bored. Good trip!	
Oct 18 2008 	Great Location	I stayed at the Milford Plaza with a friend in March 2007 for 4nights. Hotel at that time needed a good refurb, but everything else was great. The location for exploring this great city is fantastic. Opposite the hotel was a restaurant called Charley O's. This was quite expensive but served fantastic food. The room we had was very basic but we did arrive at the hotel very late at night. Room was clean and only spent a few hours in it sleeping after a hard days sightseeing and shoppping. All in all a good base for a stay in New York City.	
Oct 17 2008 	The perfect location	God I love New York, I would live there if I could.I went to the Milford Plaza twice in two months. It is the greatest location. I see Times Square from the hotel room window. And the plus, you can go there by car, and they take care of your car for the whole week. It's an old Hotel with lots of charm. We did the tour bus (a must) and two Broadway shows, Hairspray which was great, but RENT was absolutely the greatest . I loved it .Can't say enough or explain enough how I feel about New York City. All I can say, I can't wait to return. I'll be back in March or April 2009 and I'm dreaming about it.	
Oct 17 2008 	Ideal for Times Square	We chose this hotel as a base for our stay on the recommendation of a friend. Hotel is undergoing upgrading and entrance is surrounded by scaffold. Rooms are a little smaller that European and other US hotel rooms you find, but this is a New York standard I believe. We upgraded to Milford Club which gives you &quot;free&quot; breakfast, all day drinks, daily paper and internet access in the 3rd floor lounge. Breakfast is nothing special, but is a good way to start the day. Our bed clothes were a little dirty when we arrived, but a call to housekeeping had the problem solved in a few minutes. The beds were very comfortable, or we were just too tired to care, as walking is a big part of the New York Experience. The hotel allow you to leave bags downstairs in a secure area after checkout, for a very reasonable charge.	
Oct 16 2008 	Poor rooms ok location	Stayed here for just three nights and regretted it. In a country where everything is BIG, this hotel disappointed. The room was sooooo small, the beds were not comfortable, the shower had poor water pressure and dribbled out. The only plus was the location being in the Theatre District but after being to NYC so many times, I really need to find a decent hotel where the rooms aren't tiny and the cost of three nights was prohibitive! $1100 for three nights is far too much! I wouldn't stay here again and would not recommend it. Apparently the hotel is undergoing a refurbishment whereby the rooms are being made larger and occupancy decreasing from over a thousand to 800 so that may help things in the future but for the price I paid I was expecting more.	
Oct 15 2008 	Read this review for room choice and location information	The Milford Plaza is literally in the middle of everything. You can not get a closer location for anywhere close to the price. Two blocks to grayline, times square, one block to best cheesecake in town, four blocks to any theater. But beware, the rooms are small. Compare to motel 6. Queen bed, three feet around the bed is the room, the bathroom fits one at a time. However, the rooms were quite clean, but beware if your get a corner room. When the hotel was renovated, they made two rooms out of each corner. If you get a room that ends in 19 or 15, trade rooms, it is 30% smaller than most rooms, despite what they tell you. The hotel is quite comparible to european hotels. There is nothing extra, You sleep and take a shower there, that is it. The proximity is no more than a mile to anything in midtown. Hotel is busy all day and all night. You will feel very secure, private elevators, security. Try to get a high room, it will have less street noise.	
Oct 13 2008	Great location but that's about it	If all that you're concerned about is booking a hotel that is both minutes away from Times Square and the theater district, then you should book this hotel. If you expect any extras whatsoever, do not book this hotel. The lobby is beautiful. The rooms are very small, shabby and out of date. I travelled with a large group of people (we reserved a block of 10 rooms) and we all had various problems. One of our rooms did not have any hot water to shower with until our very last day (we were there for 3 days, 2 nights). Another room made the mistake of using her own hair dryer and blew out the electricity for several of our rooms on our floor. Luckily, the hotel was pretty quick to fix this problem. The rooms are so small that I had difficulty finding room to unfold the ironing board that was in the room to iron a pair of slacks. If all you are looking for is a bed to lay down on after a busy New York City day, then this hotel is fine, if you don't mind spending $300 + per night for that bed. But if you want a hotel that is up to date with more amenities than a hair dryer in the bathroom and an ironing board in the closet, book your stay somewhere else.	
Oct 12 2008	Accommodations are great	I was wary of staying at this hotel after reading reviews online. Do not let this stop you from booking this hotel. The location is great and the staff very friendly. The security is also top notch. You cannot get access to the elevator unless you show your room key. The room was cleaned every day with fresh towels.There is a good restaurant across the street called Smith's. I recommend checking it out. Great location to Times Square and Broadway playhouses. Ask for a room with a view. Overall a great experience and will stay there again next time in NY	
Oct 12 2008 	Hated this Hotel	The lobby is the only nice thing at this hotel. This hotel needs to update all its rooms.Bath rooms are not big enough to swing a cat in.Very very disappointed with everything this hotel offered.	
Oct 10 2008 	Location Location Location!	We checked the reviews before we booked but based on the hotel's location decided to stay for three nights. The reception area was bustling when we arrived and were able to check into our room at 9am. After showing our room card to security, we entered our floor number on the key-pad and a dedicated elevator (0ne of 8) arrived to whisk us up to the fifth floor. The corridor was a bit menacing and the bedroom door unwelcoming, but the room was fine. The furniture was basic, but the bedroom was clean and the bathroom seemed to be newly fitted. The bed linen and towels were freshly laundered and seemed to be changed daily. There was a room safe, which we greatly appreciated. The decor was a little dated, but the location outweighed any negatives - two minutes walk from Time Square! There is a coffee shop in the lobby serving fresh bagels, pastries and muffins at breakfast. If you want to leave your bags at the hotel when you check out - day storage is available at three dollars per item.	
Oct 10 2008 	Location location location	Ok, so the decor of the room didnt quite match up with that of the lobby, but the Milford is all about location - slap bang in the theatre district, 2minutes walk away from Time Square!!Our room had 2 doubles, remote for TV didnt work but who cares - you dont go to New York to sit in your room watching CNN (you could manually control the TV anyway). The room was a little dated, bathroom was fine. But ya know I wasnt expecting a five star hotel, cos youre sure as hell not paying a New York 5* price for it. If you want luxury go to the Marriott or the Hilton and pay $600/night. Otherwise the Milford is just fine	
Oct 9 2008 	Bad service good price	Three of us stayed here in january for a week. They wouldn't let us check in as we were only 20, and at no point while booking were we told you had to be 21. They left us stranded in new york for a day! Lady at reception refused to let us speak with a manager, nor would she do anything to help! Luckily i had a family member living in new york who was able to check us in. Room was small but good quality for the price, just don't expect much for the service.	
Oct 7 2008 	Great location cozy room recommended budget hotel	For my wifes first trip to NYC I booked the Milford Plaza for its location. Other reviews have already made it clear: you cannot beat the location of the Milford Plaza.The rooms are very small. The furniture is old. There is no place in the bathroom to put your hairbrush. But if you go to NYC and stay in Times Square and spend all your time in the hotel room, there is something wrong with your travel planning to begin with.The rooms are clean. The hallways are noisy. You may want to bring some ear plugs. The thermostat in the room has two settings: Way too hot, and Way too cold. The window opens up and lets in the air and sounds of Times Square if you want. The water pressure in the shower is fantastic, but the temperature can suddenly fluctuate from a little-too-cold to burning hot, forcing me to cram my 62 frame into a half-sized bath tub.The concierge, door man, and front desk were all very helpful and friendly.I would stay here again. The rooms are fairly priced for a small, clean, no-frills hotel room in Times Square.	
Oct 7 2008 	Fantastic location good hotel	The Milford Plaza is located in the heart of Times Square, at 2 minutes from the Theatre (We went to the Minskoff Theatre to see The Lion King ; Great) from the Subway, from most of the restaurants, from all the shops ....It is really great.Rooms are a little bit small but really clean. The bathroom is also OK. They provide a real good service.The hotel is old, but we enjoyed our stay here. A lot of renovation are in project. Ask a room with view on the street !	
Oct 6 2008 	Clean great location but worn and a little tattered	Paid $225 with taxes for 2 twin beds on a Saturday night. Excellent location for Times Square and Theatre District. Staff was polite. Sheets, room and bathroom were clean and towels were good quality. Room was small - just big enough for beds, TV, small nightstand/bureau and 1 dinning room type chair. It had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall which fit in with the outdated decor. Overall the room was a little worn and tattered including some peeling wallpaper in bathroom and mold on ceiling above the shower stall. But I have stayed in other budget New York City hotels for about the same money that were far worse. And signs in lobby promised big updates. Go stay there now since I am sure rates will go up once they are complete.	
Oct 4 2008 	Loved the Milford!	We visited the Milford Plaza hotel in NYC in March 2008. We flew with AA and we stayed for 5 nights/6 days.Checking into the hotel was really easy, even though the hotel foyer was very busy. Our bags were brought up to our room within 5 minutes of us getting there ourselves. When booking this trip, we upgraded to the Milford Plaza Club Room option, which allows you have breakfast in the Club Room every day, free internet access in the Club Room and also snacks and drinks were available in the Club Room daily.The breakfast was lovely, wide amount of choice including muffins, toast, with all different kinds of spreads, fruits, bagels including tea, coffee, hot chocolate and soft drinks. (No hot food) After walking around the city for the morning we would then come back to the Club Room for a soft drink and cookies and then go out again for the afternoon.The hotels location is brilliant, you are one block away from Times Square and across the road from the hotel is a subway station. The room was spacious and was cleaned daily. Good selection of TV channels for when you are in the room. Theres also drink machines on each floor of the hotel if you do require. The lifts can be annoying sometimes, I think we were waiting around 10 minutes for one once, but I wouldnt really let this ruin my whole experience of the hotel!! Security was also fantastic in the hotel you are only allowed in the lifts if you are staying in the hotel even when it was really busy everyone was asked for their keycards.The hotel was always busy with people coming in and out, at all times of the day so can see why lifts were in constant demand. Theres also a gift shop and coffee kiosk in the foyer.	
Oct 2 2008 	The Advice is Do Not Stay Here	The hotel looks like it began a rennovations project that began and ended at the lobby, never making it to the guest rooms. The lobby genuinely looks nice. But the guest rooms are terrible. It looks like a Motel 6 or worse. My first room smelled like a sewer. I am not sure where the smell was coming from (I think the plumbing), but it was pervasive. Also, I did not have a dresser to put my clothes in. I changed rooms. The second room had a dresser, but was missing a desk. (It did have a rickety chair in the corner.) Unfortunately, both dresser drawers were stuffed full of extra pillows and there was small debris at the bottom of each drawers, making the dresser entirely unusable. This room had two beds instead of one, but the comforter was stained on one of them. At that point I had lost interest in sleeping under the covers so I didn't check the other one. The closet rods in both rooms were peeling (paint). Everyone at my conference who was in the Milford said that they had some problem or another with their rooms. I don't know if the hotel is salvageable. The amount of rennovation it would take to make these rooms worth staying in is probably greater than the cost to demolish and rebuild. On the positive side, the hotel staff was very pleasant. But then they probably feel guilty each time they check somebody in. If this hotel were the only option I had to stay during a visit to New York, I would simply cancel my trip.	
Sep 29 2008 	Hated It 	I would never stay at this hotel ever again it was so dirty &amp; run down . no disabled facilities &amp; it was just the pits	
Sep 28 2008 	A clean room and a bed	At the Milford, all you get is a clean room with a bed. Very small rooms with nothing on it, besides the bed and an old TV set. There is no internet connection (although they tell you otherwise), so if you need it to work, you might want to consider staying elsewhere. Staff was very helpful and the hotel is right in the center of Times Square, if you are into the more tourist side or in a convention. For the price you pay you would certainly expect more than you get, but hey, you are in New York City.	
Sep 27 2008 	Do not go there!	I stayed at the Milford plaza, for 2 nights, with my mother and my daughter. Having read the reviews on trip advisor before I went, I was a little apprehensive to say the least. Well it turns out the reviews were right, I wish I would have listened!! My first impressions of the hotel were good, reception area was clean and tidy, staff were quite friendly. Then we got to our room, the smell of damp was really strong, there was mould on the curtains, damp patches on the peeling wallpaper, the bathroom needed a good clean, we couldn't even let my daughter use the bath as it was so filthy! We complained and were told we could move to another room, but we asked if we could see the room first, thank god we did. When we got to the other room, it hadn't even been cleaned, the bed was un made, there were dirty towels everywhere and the bins hadn't been emptied!! I could go and on about the things that were wrong with this hotel, the list is endless. My advice is just don't stay here!	
Sep 26 2008	Basic Hotel Great Location	I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and was a little apprehensive as to what we would find at the Milford Plaza, but I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find that the room was clean and the hotel location was fantastic.We stayed for 4 nights and yes the walls were very thin but we were so tired from all the sight seeing and shopping it was never a problem for us.A Broadway show is a must and the Lion King is right next door to the hotel as is the Phantom of the Opera and All My Sons.All in all we had a very enjoyable stay at the Milford Plaza the staff were very friendly, especially the security guys on the front desk, who were always willing to point you in the right direction.I would recommend this hotel to friends and family as it was a great base for a cheap price.	
Sep 25 2008 	Great place to stay for the budget minded	I booked my stay at the Milford after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. I knew what to expect for the most part and so was not disappointed. I had a double room and it was spacious enough for 2 people...although I can see why some would complain of the size...we passed the singles in the hotel and they looked no wider than a closet..so book a double if space is important to you. The only thing wrong with the room was that the outlets were very outdated and 1 looked to be to dangerous to plug anything into..but it's my understanding that the Milford is in the process of renovating the rooms so I'm sure they are well aware of the problems and time will fix that. I read complaints about the elevators...I can't understand why anyone would complain about that. It was very easy to figure out and their system made for quick service and there was never a crowded elevator. Hotel security is top notch. NO ONE through without a keycard. That made me feel very secure. Check in and check out was very fast and convenient and all the hotel staff were very courteous. I would definitely stay here again.	
Sep 24 2008 	The Milford Plaza New York: "Facilities just ok Location was Fantastic!!"	We stayed in the Milford Plaza for 4 days. Our trip to New York was partially for sightseeing and shopping. We were recommended the hotel by a family member. So on that alone I thought it would be fine, because we would have similar tastes.However, I am afraid to say that was not the case. Let me first get my issues dealt with and then I will tell you the pluses.The hotel is quite old. Being New York space is premium, but the rooms are tiny. My hugest problem was that you can hear the toilet facilities of your neighbouring rooms. We stayed as part of the Milford Club, which includes breakfast. It is not worth it. I have ate better breakfasts in hostels backpacking around Australia. Finally the Air Conditioning in the bed rooms is extremely loud, we used to leave it on during the day when we were out and turn it off when we would come back in, but because it was quite humid, during the night we would have to put it on. I ended up buying ear plugs!!!On a better note, the location is fantastic. We were 2 minutes maximum from Times Square. All theatres were within walking distance. If you wish to travel to Woodbury Common for a shopping trip, then Port Authority bus station is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The security in the hotel is excellent. You were not allowed passed security to the lifts until you showed your room key. This I found comforting as you do hear horror stories of big hotels. For location this hotel is fantastic, for a bit of luxury I am afraid not.	
Sep 23 2008 	Go somewhere else !!!	This hotel is really terrible: nasty, dirty, small rooms and extremely expensive.We checked in and, few hours later, we decided to get our room changed: we found ashes on the floor (non smoking room), hairs everywhere (bath tub, water basin, bed...) holes on the blankets and tents were black (they were supposed to be white). We got another room which was a little better but, trust me, if you are just a little allergic to dust, you're dead ! Next day we decided to check out as this was not a $ 400/night worth hotel room in Manhattan.We moved to Novotel, just few blocks away: lower rates and much better rooms !!	
Sep 22 2008 	Great hotel TERRIFIC location	I had I wonderful experience at the Milford Plaza Hotel and I recommend it to everyone! My friend and I asked for 3 things when we made our Internet reservation: To have the highest floor possible, twin beds and a room with a view. We got it all, 22nd floor, twin beds and an INCREDIBLE view!! It was my second time around in NYC, and I've never had such and impressive view. Location, of course, is perfect! Last time I came to NYC, I stayed in New Jersey and found it convenient, but not AMAZING as I did this time around. I wanted to be close to Times Square, I was right ON it (or so)!!! Valet parking was efficient and appreciated because it was my first time driving in such a big city, and let's say I never was scared once that my car might be scratched by the valet. I felt like I let my car in good hands. As for security, I LOVED it that our hotel room card was looked at everytime we checked-in. These guys were really nice and I felt in security. Our room was always clean and tidy, really, I can't find something to complaint about, and believe me, I'm REALLY picky when it comes to hotels!!! I'm planning a future stay in November or December, and I'll stay at Milford Plaza. I hope they manage to keep it as good as it is right now!!!	
Sep 16 2008 	Hated it	Just spent four nights at this hotel. One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The room we were allocated was a twin on 6th floor. When I walked in to the room, I said to my sister that I couldn't stay there and burst into tears. The room was tiny and smelled very damp. It was very drab and the furniture was dreadful. We went down to reception and were changed to a queen room which was marginally better. However, there was only one chair and no tea/coffee making facilities so we ended up one sitting on the chair and one sitting on the bed and then swapping. The impressive reception area gave a false impression of the state of the rooms which badly need refurbished. On the plus side, the beds were clean and comfortable and the towels were changed daily. security was excellent and the hotel was also in an ideal location for all attractions but nothing would make me stay in this hotel again.	
Sep 14 2008	Great Location	We have just returned from a 4 night (Sept 2 - 6) stay at the Milford. This is my second time to the Big Apple. I went with my sister and best friend and had an awesome time. Great location especially theaters and Time Square. The room was small and bathroom a bit outdated but you're only there to sleep and shower....we usually came back after 12 midnight anyways. Housekeeping was great....room always made and bathroom cleaned with fresh towels. Security was also very good you had to show your room key every time. Would I stay at the Milford again? Definitely....can't wait until our next trip:)	
Sep 5 2008 	Great Experience	Stayed at Milford over Labor Day weekend. We had 8 people in 3 rooms. All the rooms were fine. If you follow these reviews like I do this hotel has had a fair amount of bad ones but do not be afraid of it. It was fine. NY for me is being out and about so a hotel is a resting place, shower and storage for my shopping. Milford is more than that. If you like Times Square and the shows this hotel is so well placed. You are so close to everything and I love that. Security is good, it was easy to get area info. Security sent us to a diner (West Side) close by that was excellent. The rooms are older (furniture/bedspreads) and the bathrooms could use some sprucing up but honestly they were fine. I booked on Quikbook and the rooms with tax were $250. a night. Great price for a great location. Go confidently, go often and enjoy one of the greatest cities in the US.	
Sep 3 2008 	good value for the money.	The Milfoed gave us good value for the money at a good location with above average service in clean rooms. For my first stay in New York this was a pleasant experience. I would return for an other stay.	
Sep 3 2008 	would not stay there again	Will not stay there again.The room was dirty, the bins and bathroom/shower area had not been cleaned from previous occupants. The shower was mouldy and the room smelt damp The place looks like it hasn't been renovated since the 70s.When we complained about the state of the room that night at 2am in the morning security banged furiously on the door when I opened it they said the door was unlocked. I may have been tired but I'm not stupid the door was locked dead bolted and the chain was on..so why did they wake us up in the early hours on this pretence ? Seems strange considering we had complained about the maid earlier???At check in one of the staff was downright rude. It is near times sqr but so are other more modern hotels.Would I stay there again. No Would I reccommend it NoThe sad thing is this is my second time at this hotel I stayed there in 2002 and it was just the same.	
Sep 2 2008 	Perfect for the price and location	This hotel was the perfect hotel for its price and location. Yes, it is defnitely dated and yes, there were some things I'd like to improve, but for my money it was perfect. We were in NYC for the US Open, so we weren't planning on spending much time in our hotel room. We were one block from a Subway station and a couple blocks from the restaurants and tourist activities of Times Square. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and I felt secure at all times. The rooms were small, but I've never been in a NYC hotel that didn't have small rooms. The floor of the shower felt a little loose (like there was air between the floor and the shower), and there were some places in the bathroom where it looked like some caulk was needed. Overall, though, I would highly recommend this place if you're wanting a great location and hotel for an inexpensive (NYC, anyway) price.	
Sep 2 2008 	Fantastic staff	We stayed at the Milford Plaza for 3 nights and got a great deal, pay for two nights and the third is free. The hotel is older but it has character, rooms smallish but comfortable and clean. We had a problem at check in when it was discovered that one of our group did not have a confirmation number on his reservation. The front desk staff were very helpful and solved the problem and allowed the discount rate for the room. Elevators can be slow but that happens in all hotels.The location of this hotel is great, so close to everything.I would recommend you take a double deck bus tour . The night tour is great, also on the day tours, you can get off at many of the major attractions and get back on to go to the next one. The guides were very informative.Overall we had a great stay at he hotel and loved the City, we plan to stay again	
Sep 2 2008 	Bad experience	My husband and I stayed at the Milford from 8/24-8/29/2008. We have stayed at the Milford in the past and think that its location and rates are very good. However, this was not a good experience for us. When we checked in on 8/24, we got to our room only to find that the lights in the bathroom didn't work, the overhead door light didn't work, and the light bulb on the bureau was dangling off the lamp. It took an hour for someone to to come fix the lights in the bathroom, and we were not comfortable using the bathroom in the dark. There was mold on the shower tiles, the mirror had several smudges on it, and the flow of water coming out of the shower was very light. The final straw was smelling cigarette smoke during the night, on a supposed no smoking floor. The following day I requested a change of rooms and the reservation lady would not even consider it. She said changes could only be made in the morning. Well, we didn't come to NYC to hang around the hotel to wait for a new room so we didn't pursue it. I had to call security 2 more times during our stay to report the smell of smoke coming thru our walls. All in all, our stay was not very pleasant.When we checked out, I asked the clerk if there could be any adjustment on our final bill because of the aforementioned problems with the room. She went to speak to a manager and said that since we received a summer discount due to the number of days we stayed, there could be no adjustment. Apparently a discount now includes mold and cigarette smoke.We plan to visit NYC in the future but will not stay at the Milford nor recommend it to our friends.	
Aug 31 2008 	great price for the location	the location is excellent for the price. it's right in the middle of times square and close to all the theatres. the rooms were ok, old and small but clean enough. it's like your typical motel room that you pay $70 for. check in was smooth but the front desk person definately had some attitude problems but oh well. they charge you $1.25 every time you use their phone but nobody told me that when i checked in so i ended up getting charged quite a bit for just picking up the phone and i was not happy about it. next morning, 9am right on the dot, without knocking, roomservice tried to oopen our door and clean the room. when they realized we were still in the room, they closed the door but didn't apologize. if i ever visit new york again, i would probably stay there purely because of the price and the location.	
Aug 30 2008 	Great place...	For a first timer to New York, I was VERY happy we decided to stay at the Milford Plaza. First, I didn't want all my money to be spent on my hotel room. I wanted a clean, comfortable place to sleep between doing all the other things I wanted to spend my money on. The location is perfect for that. I also didn't find the room too small. Of course, we were there during perfect weather so we seldom were indoors anyway. The staff was helpful and prompt. I liked the security at the elevators and the coffee shop in the lobby area. I loved being close to the shows, the subway, Times Square, and some wonderful, reasonably priced restaurants. At busy times the elevators can be frustratingly slow, and the halls are stuffy and small, and you do have to go down the street to get breakfast, but I would stay again in a heartbeat.	
Aug 23 2008 	Fab Location!!	We've just got back from a 6dy/5night stay at The Milford Plaza (as recommended by a friend.) We booked our trip 12mths ago before finding Trip Advisor and after reading numerous bad reviews we were obviously concerned and apprehensive about our choice. However I have to say, that although we've given it a neutral/average rating it was far from being the complete hovel that we had read about.We booked a double room with view as we were visiting NY to celebrate my '0' birthday. The room/bathroom were a fare size although both needed a lick of paint and a good clean in the nooks and crannies. Our view was rather disappointing though, we looked out onto another high building, but in saying this I think it helped with the noise reduction somewhat (we decided not to ask to be moved.) Although there was a heater in the room we couldn't find any controls for it or any air conditioning. Instead we managed with the window open to the maximum 6inches and slept on top of the bed for our stay. But like most people say...you don't go to NY to sleep, and that is so true!! And at the end of a busy day sight-seeing it takes hardly any time to drop off, the least of your worries is where your sleeping!! The one bad problem that we had was with a 'drain kinda smell' first thing in the morning from the bathroom. This could be due to the age of the building, however we also smelt it on a couple of occasions in the streets around and about, so maybe it just wasn't solely a hotel thing. We found if we closed the plug holes before going to sleep this seemed to limit the smell the next morning. The check-in and out was painless and the baggage storage facility was convienant. The security both on the front of the hotel and at the lift area was excellant and reassuring to see. On two occasions we saw people either being refused entry because they were from another hotel 'visiting' friends or were causing a fuss. The staff were either very pleasant or indifferent-you just kinda took it as it came.Although the hotel has a small coffee shop, I have to say that I only saw this open on a couple of occasions first thing in the morning and by late afternoon it was closed!!!Of course most people mention the location, and they are quite right to aswell!! It's second to none. Within easy walking distance of most places, and if after a few days doing things by foot you're beginning to tire, you're close to the subway to.Recommended places to eat would be: Scarletto, Trattorio Trecolori (my personal favourite), Carve (fab pizza slices!!) Gigino and Pax Wholefood(lovely for breakfast.) Juniors although nice we found the food to be somewhat cold and hospitality lacking.Highlights of our trip were The Empire State Building and a Rickshaw ride through Central Park. We found Top Of The Rock views to be overated, and no better than The Empire State Building and Bloomingdales was also a big let down.If you were to ask would we stay in this hotel again? The answer would be yes. The location sells it!!!!	
Aug 21 2008 	Great Location	Hotel was in a great location for Times Square and Broadway - hotel is really dated and in need of total refurbishment - there were no restaurant facilities or any bar or lounge where you could sit in the evening for a quiet drink. The bedroom wallpaper was falling off the wall but the beds and bathroom area were clean. Just basically a bed and bath for the night, not somewhere to chill or have a pleasant evening.	
Aug 19 2008 	Pretty darn good plus great location 	Given the uneven nature of some of the reviews here, my wife was very reluctant to book at the Milford, as she's pretty fussy. She's glad we did for our four night stay (and never voiced a single complaint about the place), and so am I.Two unqualified great things about the place. First, of course, location, as everyone mentions. You're three-fourths of a block from Times Square -- close enough to walk to about 20 hit plays in about 2 minutes (seriously -- that block has the biggest concentration of theaters on Broadway), but far enough from Broadway itself that noise likely isn't an issue (we had an inside room on the 14th Floor, and it was quiet). Also, there's a subway stop about 100 feet from the doors, to get you to the rest of NYC. Being in midtown (on 45th Street), you're within walking distance of not just Times Square -- we also walked to the UN, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, MOMA, Carnegie Deli, Central Park -- heck, we even walked back to our hotel from the Metropolitan Museum of Art up on 83rd Street.And, of course, the price is way better than you'll find elsewhere in the area, especially if you can find one of many ways to get 15% off the listed price (for multi-day stays, etc.).Our two-double-bed room was a bit cramped (as always is the case with older NYC hotels), and the bathroom was small but manageable. Still, the room had nice, basic amenities -- blowdryer in the bathroom, suitcase stand, ironing board and iron, etc. It was perfectly clean with no smell and the staff changed all linens and towels every day. For a big hotel, the computerized elevator system was surprisingly efficient, with minimal waits. Every staff person we had contact with was extraordinarily cheerful and helpful. (This is New York City?) The big lounge area was a nice plus -- free continental breakfast in the morning (bagels, donuts, bread with an available toaster, fruit, juice, coffee, yogurt, cereal) and soft drinks in the evening. There were eight computers available at no charge with minimal or no wait and two big screen TVs (for watching Olympic highlights with my bagel). (The computers don't have printers, though.)As to some of the complaints about other rooms, it may well be that these are rooms yet to be renovated. I assume that you can be moved if you end up in one of the shabbier rooms. But the rest of the hotel is perfect for a modestly-priced jumping off spot for all of the city.	
Aug 17 2008 	What a fantastic location	What can I say apart from what a fantastic location this hotel has. It is less than 5 minutes walk from Times Square, about 20 from Central Park and all the others are easily accessable by the subway.The hotel itself is a typical 1920/30s style building and with that being said, the rooms are a bit small and look a little dated in some areas. Was that a problem? Not at all. How much time do you spend in your room when in NYC? The bed was comfortable enough and there was always a good supply of hot water despite the vast number of rooms.It was good to have an ice despencer on every floor, although the rooms could benefit from a fridge to keep drinks cool during the day. A sink of cold water and a plug solved that problem. The air conditioning and heating, I have stayed twice so experienced the 35C temps of October and -5C of March was good, keeping the rooms at a comfortable temperature all day.The staff were helpful, especially the concierge who organised a helicopter flight both times in a professional manner. You can also use the front desk to change travellers cheques with your passport, but be warned, they will only change $100 per room per day. Most restuarants will change the money for you though so its not a big deal.Hotel security is very good, you cant access the rooms unless you present your room key although waiting for the lift at busy times can take a few minutes. There is also a gym at the hotel but never made it there, too busy enjoying all of what NYC had to offer.Across the street is a wonderful breakfast restaurant, Smiths. They serve the whole schebang for about $10 and believe me, its enough to keep you going for a long time. Round the corner as well is Juniors who serve the best cheesecake I have ever tasted in my life and I know my cheesecakes!The question most people want to know is would I recommend this hotel. Absolutely! Been there twice and would return if I go back to NYC as it is a good base.	
Aug 17 2008 	Not a great hotel	decided to pay extra for a better hotel in NYC as we were there longer, going to buffalo after. well it was nasty and expensive the elevators had a system where you put your floor number in a it told which elevator to get in. huge waits at busy times of days it was hell.as for the room well lifed the lid to the toilet and it was nasty all black inside where the white had been worn away.bed were uncomfortable had neck pain for the next five nights.yes milford plaza has a coffee shope that u can use but as the write up says after your day out relax with coffee! rubbish closes at 2pm great startbucks is a block away but still.they only thing the milford plaza had going for it was great location. but again i would not stay here ever again	
Aug 13 2008 	Better than the reviews say it is	I was very nervous about staying at the Milford Plaza because of the bad reviews. The place turned out to be just fine. The location was perfect and the price was reasonable. We had a two double bed room (the Superior room) and the size was what you get in Europe and in non-business hotels. The check-in, check-out and security were great. The elevators were quick and the air-conditioning was good. It was clean, quiet, safe and comfortable. It is older--but I refuse to pay 500 dollars a night just to be in a newer hotel. I'd rather spend the extra money attending Broadway shows. All three plays we saw were within a 5 minute walk. There is a subway entrance 1 minute walk from the front door. My only problem was that the shower water kept changing temperature. But for a 300 dollar savings I can handle that!!	
Aug 9 2008 	A Nice Place	The room was small, but nice. After walking and site seeing all day, it was very convenient to have it close by so that we could rest, relax, and get energized. It's near everything! Location is ideal. Close to Times Square, Broadway, Tour Busses, Restaurant Row, etc. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We especially liked that they kept our luggage before check-in (free!) and after check-out ($3.00 per bag). Our only complaint was that the room/bathroom was not the cleanest. Everything needed a good deep cleaning! Oh, and the shower would shut off unexpectantly and the hot water would run out. We had to be quick! If we weren't quick enough, we had to finish washing up in the sink	
Aug 8 2008 	great location for the price!!!	NY's hotels are very costly, and Milford Plaza was the best rate for location.room very very small. no coffee maker in room, and no fridge. no airconditon in elevator and hallway.no blind in washroom. very old building and smelly.facut in washroom was difficult to wash hands since the sink was tide and no room to get hands under facut.very noisy location ask for top top floor.staff was very very good!!security is top top top!!!clean entrance but not as cold as it should be for hot days.do not get ticket for shows at the hotel there is $40 broker fee, get it yourself via theater or other 1/2 price .must take the 72 hours all loops tour and for $10 more you get 3 days for total of 59$ best best deal in town!!best food and price at Pizza Villagio Cafe at 58 and 6th!Europan is another great Cafe next to hotel , good coffee and food!!!Subway is safe and easy to travel on, must try it.we had a great great time !!!	
Aug 7 2008 	Great Experience	Because the Milford Plaza Hotel offered room rates anywhere from 50 - 75% lower than the large majority of hotels in Manhatten I was a little concerned about what I might get for the money. So, I did a lot of research on various web sites seeking as much information as I could on the hotel. I found a number of mediocre to poor reviews of the Milford Plaza and a number that indicated it was a good value. So, I went ahead and booked our room, still being concerned that it might turn out to be an awful experience.I found the hotel to be old (as are a large number of the hotels in Manhatten) and currently undergoing exterior maintenance. Passing through the front entry, I was pleased with what I found. The lobby, reservation desk, conceirge area, snack area and little shop were all very clean, well apportioned and neat. I found all of the staff to be very helpful and courteous. The reservation desk was manned by five clerks and the conceirge desk by two... all very helpful.We got to the hotel early so our room was not ready (as I expected) but they checked us in and stored our bags so that we could go out and do some siteseeing while we waited. When we came back 3 hours later they quickly got me my keys and bags so that we could go to the room.The room itself was old and small. We had a room with two double beds and there was countertop area adequate for laying out only one suitcase. The size of the room, however, was not an issue for us as we, literally, were only in the room for short rests and to sleep.The air conditioning was fine. The bathroom was small with very little space to lay out toiletries. Again, this was not troublesome for us. There were eight elevators, all running very effieiently... I don't think we every waited more than one minute for an elevator going up or down. There was security at the elevators to ensure that you were a guest at the hotel.The location was excellent. It is one block from Times Square and no more than 1-3 blocks from 90% of the broadway theaters. It was 1/2 block from one subway station and 1 block from another. There were dozens of dining establishments within 3 blocks ranging from McDonalds to high end restaurants.Despite the hotel being old and the room being small, I was very pleased with our stay at the Milford Plaza. These things were trivial when you consider we saved anywhere from $150-$300 on the &quot;average&quot; nightly rate of a hotel on Manhatten.	
Aug 4 2008 	Second stay at the Milford	This was my second stay at the Milford. I was also there in 2006 with 2 girlfriends. I chose to stay there due to the great service I received the last time I was there.My stay was from 7/17-7/23 this trip. While I too was a little disappointed that the escalator was under repair I understand that the hotel is going through a remodel and this is understandable. There were only 19 steps to the lobby area so it wasnt too bad. The doorman tried to carry my bags upstairs for me but I refused. The new elevator system worked excellent for me. I had to wait about 2 minutes once for a car during a very busy time and all the other times I had no problems. Check in was a breeze and the staff lady was polite. I used the Summer in the City pass to upgrade for free to the Club Level with access to the lounge. I definitely recommend the club accommodations to everyone. Free soda and water all day, a variety of snacks laid out all the time and free internet access were awesome. The breakfast put on by the hotel in the lounge was fantastic for a free hotel breakfast. It should be noted that the breakfast only comes with the club package. I would say I definitely got my moneys worth out of the free water. It was in the upper 90's this week so I drank my weight in water from the lounge on a daily basis.My room was on the 4th floor, room 419. It was clean and decent for a room in the city. Not the best view in the world (the air conditioner outside) but it was a room to sleep in. How much time do you spend in the room anyways? Fresh towels were laid out every day and the cleaning ladies were efficient every day of my stay. I had no problems with the water temperatures or water pressure during my stay. I took an average of two showers a day due to the weather being so hot. The air conditioner wasnt ice cold, but it got the room at a comfortable temperature. Seeing as I stayed by myself I felt very safe that guests had to show their key before getting on to the elevator. I found the security staff very friendly in what must be a pretty boring job. One night I accidentally left my door to my room open and a security guard knocked on the door to let me know I had done this. It was nice to know that they check the halls nightly.For the price paid and the services received I think I established a good deal. I would definitely stay at the hotel again on my next trip to the city.	
Jul 27 2008 	Great Bargain	It took us about 3 weeks to choose a hotel, especially after reading all the bad reviews on Trip Advisor. We booked the most expensive hotel that we could afford with our budget. And even then, we chose to updgrade to the Superior Room. Location - Great. Hotel Service - normal. We didn't have any extra requests.Breakfast - great. Superior Room included free breakfast of muffins, cereals, yoghurts, juice etc. There was no contentinal or hot breakfast. It was very simple. There is free use of computers/internet. There were also free snacks. Room - noisey aircon: it was a low humming noise. Superior Room was a corner room overlooking 45th and 8th (if I remember correctly). Bathroom window opened about 3 inches. Comfy bed. Black out blind was broken (I mentioned it on check-out and we didn't have to pay for our in-house movie). I would have complained eariler but I had my trusty eyemask. Elevators - really cool. 8 elevators. Security - good. Conceirge - very helpful. Left Luggage - also very helpful. Cleanilness - average (well, it is an old hotel so there's bound to be some dirt/mould.) Luggage - There was plenty of space for our 2 suitcases. As we had upgraded to a slightly bigger room, it was much more comfortable. I had a peek into a twin room that was being cleaned and I honestly don't know where the guests were meant to store their luggage. It was tiny. I didn't get to see a regular double room. Eating Out - 9th Avenue has loads of brilliant restaurants. We ate there every night. Our Advice - upgrade to the Superior Room if you're staying more than a few days at the Milford, it'll be much more comfortable for you and your luggage. And book the most expensive hotel that you can afford with your budget.	
Jul 27 2008 	Box in the Sky	While not the largest room I expected for the price I paid, the location of the hotel proved to be exceptional. Do not drive to this hotel. Take a train into Penn Station or Grand Central; the walk is no more than 15 minutes to the hotel from either station. If you are looking for good New York City pizza, do not go to Famiglia. Do not be weary of the subway. The efficiency and low cost make it an essential benefit to the New York City tourist. Do not be discouraged by how far this hotel is from desired attractions. Access to almost every subway line more than makes up for it!	
Jul 25 2008 	An excellent base for sightseeing	Just off Broadway, this hotel is in an excellent location to sight see in New York. I wouldn't choose this for a romantic break, it is more like an adult backpacking hostel, to be used as a base. We had problems with our booking which had been made on a travel website, the hotel didn't have any trace of it, but they honoured it, giving us it for the price originally quoted. The rooms were small but clean, and fine for what I was looking for, somewhere to sleep, shower and store purchases. We didn't eat in the hotel, but there were plenty of places nearby. If you want to shop, eat and see a show I can recommend the Milford Plaza.	
Jul 22 2008 	You will be sorry........	This hotel has some serious customer service problems....hence..Booked room 3mths ago, after a long day of travel, no room, waited another 40mins for them to find us a room which was on the 4th floor very close to a loud generator. We got moved the next day to another room but no apology. Gift shop sells international stamps at .94cents for postcards which is fine but they charged us $1.20 per stamp, service charge as they put it. Coffee shop, make sure you introduce yourself to the bald headed cashier, never met anyone as grumpy and as rude, never ever said thank you. The kicker is; a $3 charge per luggage if you need to store it if your flight is later on during the day after you checked out. Most major hotels store them as a courtesy for their guests. This hotel gouges you for whatever they can get you for. The hotel is dirty, carpets are soiled, and it smells damp. The maids are very friendly and greet you every morning, wish the rest of the staff is like them....security guards think they're &quot;gods&quot;. I would never stay here again.....period!	
Jul 19 2008 	Central Perk!!	We stayed here on our second christmas is Newyork, and despite its tarnished appearance it wasn't all that bad!!The room we were located in was one of the old style rooms, that had yet to be updated and this showed, the 1980's decor and the neon red sign located right outside our window gave the whole room a gangster movie theme, and i half expected the mafia with violin cases to burst in at any point!!The staff were friendly and efficient and the complimentary breakfast served in the club lounge, which had been updated and looked sensational was a welcome start to the day.Cant fault it on location right next to time square!!	
Jul 14 2008	Milford Plaza...Overrated In My Opinion...	THIS HOTEL IS AWFUL....definately in need of decorating and a total revamp altogether....the halls are so scary...looks like something out of a scary movie BUT hey we were hardly in the hotel. The hotel security guards were always smiling, reception staff all looked depressed. The hotel is poor but the location is very good, in the centre of Times Square...but regardless of where you stay you have everything very close to you anyway. New York is amazing, i will definately go back asap. Make sure you bring extra cash with you for tips...you'll end up leaving so many tips everyday.DO NOT EAT AT APPLEBEES IN TIMES SQUARE...the food is disgusting...everything about it is WRONG!!! Save a belly ache by visiting RED LOBSTER....lovely food. If you don't mind listening to the music in The Hardrock Cafe then that is another place you will have to visit...food is very good. Try not to eat at those pizza places (Sbarro)...look better than they taste...they are always busy in there for some strange reason?! Be aware that you will be in for a lot of walking on your trip and by the time the evening comes your feet will be too tired to do anymore. Try to book at least 5-6 days, 4days is definately not long enough.We visited madame tussuads...but if you've been to one before then i wouldn't recommend going again...good but not great.shopping for us females is not as good as i thought (BUT there is a H&amp;M on every block..nearly)..unless you go to Woodbury Common (definately worth the trip...go there first) or unless you buy endless amounts of make-up-yes, guilty!shopping for the guys is really good, you'll spend everything you have...and probably more.I think Macy's is overrated...unless your a guy. the New York fashion is not the same as London's fashion...the clothes are more expensive for women in New York than London but its the other way around for men. Century 21 is like Tk Maxx...you really have to look through EVERYTHING to find something...not as cheap as i was told, a complete mess and staff were soooo miserable.Central Park is amazing...you HAVE to visit. The Natural History Museum is much more exciting in London...don't waste your money here. FAO Swarchtz TOY SHOP is also empty and overrated. People in New York are very friendly, you do find in shops that staff sit there on their mobile phones whilst helping customers!!! Very odd i have to say but didn't bother me. Be prepared for the 3hour wait if you are planning on visiting the Statue of Liberty. China town sells nothing but tat...everything is extremely tacky and well over priced...jus dont be fooled but visit if you have time. Little Italy really is little...tiny...i thought there would have been more of that area...clearly not. Taxi's are cheap if, like us, the cost is split between 4 of you...otherwise pricey.OVERALL...I WOULD DEFINATELY GO BACK but NOT TO THIS HOTEL....even though not much time is spent in the hotel i would still rather much be in a cleaner surrounding and i would pay that bit extra. I have rated this HOTEL as 1 star not New York.If you would like anymore info on my review then please get in touch. Hope you have a nice time. BRING ON NEW YORK 2009!	
Jul 11 2008 	Fine for me but wouldn't stay somplace else next time.	Here is the review of The Milford Plaza as I gave to my friend:I thought it was fine, my boyfriend hated it. It was small, but clean. The walls are thin and you hear everything when people are talking next door, but we slept peacefully through the night. They held our luggage when we arrived at 9:00 a.m. but couldn't check in until 3:00 p.m.The Milford Plaza is right in the middle of Broadway, which is nice (we saw Morgan Freeman!) but it is SO crowded, and all the restaurants are corporate chains. There are like five Friday's, seriously! You can walk up to 9th Avenue and there are some nice cafe / restaurants, but it was $7.50 for a bottle of beer and they automatically charged us 18% gratuity...the total bill was $75 for $54 in food! Near the end of our stay we found a bar down the street towards 9th Avenue called Irish Roque and they had $3.00 domestic bottles.If we were going to do it again, we would stay in Soho, Chelsea, or Greenwich Village and take the subway into upper Manahattan for the sights. Everything is less crowded in these areas, the food was more reasonably priced, and there were way more quaint restaurants to choose from.The Milford Plaza is definitely closer to the museums and Central Park, etc... but the subway is easy to navigate, and the experience of dining in Chelsea or Soho seems way more like &quot;authentic&quot; New York.	
Jul 11 2008 	Horrible	While I agree that the hotel is ideally placed and is relatively inexpensive that does not justify the condition of the hotel. We moved rooms soon after arriving - the first was filthy, particularly the bathroom - and the second no better. One of the housekeeping staff told me most rooms were in the same state. I felt like wiping my feet as I left the building.While reception and concierge staff were generally polite, the same could not be said of the security staff. While the idea of checking you had a key card prior to entering the elevator is a good idea, I engaged in a futile argument with a security man when explaining the key card was already with my son upstairs. He was rude and arrogant. In fact, some of my experiences in NYC, particularly the taxi trip to the airport - ripped off by an arrogant,foul-mouthed nutter - made London seem civilised.	
Jul 10 2008 	Great Location...	I have just arrived from Milford in wich I stayed for 7 days in the 26th floor.The hotel is in renovation and it's really very big, but I found it in a fantastic location, in the 8th Av, just behind Times Square. Remember that part of the city never sleeps.In my point of view the elevators system is good and the security that checks everybody that reaches them, makes me feel safe in such a big place.I had breakfast one day at the small coffee shop they have in the 1st floor hall, and it seems ok (but I prefered the Pizza Villa in the corner of the 8th Av and the 42nd street - they had everything and fresh).About my room, it was probably renovated in the 70's.I know that maides went there everyday and they try to clean what was right in front of us, but the ceilings, corners, are forgotten places in years.The smell of old things without ventilation always welcomed us every night.Regarding that in NY you need a place just to sleep, I found the beds ok, the sheets clean, and all the security confortable.(I stayed 1 night at Wellington, and I left and return the hotel a few times without any check or confirmation if I was there...)So it was not so bad and concerning the location and price, I think it's a reasonable option.	
Jul 8 2008 	Location location location	This hotel had the best location for everything we wanted to do. It was right off of Times Square, and footsteps from the theaters. The subway stations were within two blocks and there were great restaurants right around the corner. The room we had did need some upgrading as the bathroom was dingy with some peeling paint, the television did not work properly, and the hallway smelled musty. With the anount of time we actually spent in this room, these problems were not that big of a deal. One of the other great things was the security, I liked that you had to show your room ID in order to get to the elevators. It made me feel more secure. Overall I would stay here again and would recommend it for anyone who wants to be right in the heart of NYC!	
Jul 7 2008 	Right in the heart of Manhattan!	We had never been to NYC before as a family. I had heard from a friend who stayed at the Milford Plaza that this hotel, although not fancy, was right in the heart of everything. She said she had a pleasant experience there last fall, so I took her word for it, and booked with them.We weren't disappointed. The hotel room was small but adequate. The bathroom was small but clean and functional. Everything was clean so we were happy. The beds were also comfortable and we couldn't hear any noise from outside, so we were very happy! The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly.We were surprised at how friendly everyone was in NY! We really enjoyed our stay, and would recommend the Milford Plaza highly. It is right next to Theatre Row; the Phantom of the Opera is just round the corner from it. There is a good cafe just across the street, where we had a delicious and cheap breakfast every morning. There are many places to eat nearby, including Restaurant Row on 46th St.We had fun!	
Jul 2 2008 	good location but some problems!!!	Good location for sight seeing and shopping. I had booked for two beds and had the confirmation by e-mail as well as contacted them days before arrival, but found out when I had arrived they had only 1 double bed!!!! They ASSUME because there were 2 people that we would be sharing the same bed!!! They do not know who the other person was so do not change my booking plans!!! The room was very small and you can hear your neighbour talking. As you walked in the hallway, it had a horrible smell coming from the carpet. But the best part of the hotel experience was the staff. They were very nice. Too bad the hotel itself did not reflect this. My family and I had agreed not to have future stays at this hotel!!!!	
Jun 30 2008 	Great Location But Hotel In Transition	I have just returned from a 5-night stay at the Milford Plaza. We have stayed at this Hotel 3 times previously. The hotel is undergoing renovation work at the moment and you can tell. However, the location is fantastic, just around the corner from Times Square. The first room we were given, the window was open and wouldn't close but we were given an alternative room straight away. The room was small but comfortable. The staff were really helpful and friendly. Overall, I would stay here again - it is ideal as a base to explore this amazing city. I can't wait to see what it looks like when the renovation work is complete.	
Jun 24 2008 	Great place to stay!	Great location and we had terrific service from everyone working at the hotel. You must go there knowing that you are not staying at a four-star hotel. If you are looking for a decent place to sleep at night at a reasonable cost, this is the place to go. It's true that some of the rooms could be renovated, but to us it wasn't that big of a deal. We were hardly in the room anyway. Go to NYC with an open mind and just take it all in! We had an awesome first visit there!	
Jun 20 2008 	Great Location.....that's about it!	This hotel is in the perfect location! It's very central! It's literally behind Times Square and close to Broadway Theatres.The rooms are tiny, if you ask for a twin room in most American hotels they give you 2 double beds, but here we got 2 singles which we weren't that impressed with. And we couldn't even fit our suitcases on the floor to open them.On the other hand we were looking for the cheapest hotel in New York as we were on a budget and this is what we found so you basically pay for what you get...I would stay here again purely because of the location and because you won't find anything cheaper that is better.	
Jun 20 2008 	great location acceptable room good deal for NYC	My wife and I stayed at the Milford Plaza from June 5 though June 9, 2008. Booked the room through priceline for $200.00 a night. Cheapest hotel I could find in the theatre district and far less for the room than on other travel sites. I had great trepidation prior to arrival at the hotel based upon various prior traveler reviews. However, upon check in was pleasently suprised when I was upgraded to a higher category room. The room was located on the corner of the building with two windows on adjacent walls and a partial view of the Marriot Marquis and the theatre district. The hotel itself is old but in a great location. Just steps from the theatre and times square and very close to the Subway. The room had been refurnished and was more than adequate. The furnishings were no worse than in a days inn / la quinta type property. The bathroom was adequate and the closet was huge. The entire floor had apparently been redone and while old was clean and more than acceptable. The service at the hotel was ok although i didnt ask for much. Security seemed to be very good with their checking for an ID each time you used the elevator whcih incidentally only goes to the floor that is requested. In all an excellent stay and much better than I would have expected based upon fellow travelers review. Do not hesitate to stay here for the price it is excellent.	
Jun 20 2008 	Perfect Location	This hotel has the perfect location for anyone who is going to New York City to see the major tourist attractions. The hotel is clean, and very friendly. The Concierge had great advice. The location is amazing. The Hop On Hop Off buses are just around the corner which was a great cheap way to see the city. The option to leave your luggage after check out completely made the trip.	
Jun 19 2008 	Terrible service	I had the worst experience in this hotel. I would never go back and when I hear of people going to new york, I go out of my way to ensure that they know not to book this hotel.I am a 24 year old woman who went with a friend for some shopping. They refused my credit card, which was mastercard, for no valid reason. According to my credit card company they didn't even try to put the transaction through the card. I was treated in the most disgraceful way by the reception staff, who nothing short of accused me of having a stolen card. Asside from this appaling treatment the quality of the accomodations is very poor, I would advise staying a little further out of the centre if your budget is tight or increasing your budget to afford a hotel that treats their customers with respect. I would recommed the hotel wolcott or hotel pensilvania as local alternatives.	
Jun 18 2008 	Good location	Good location - hotel is nothing special and popular with airline staff but just located off Times Square it perfect for exploring the city. Random bar downstairs but just round the corner from Broadway. Good transport links no dining facilities as I recall but good value and clean. Worth it for anyone looking for just bed and board!	
Jun 16 2008 	Great Location Poor Accomodations	The Milford Plaza is in a great location at 44th St and 9th Ave. Many Broadway theaters are literally around the corner. That's about all that is good.Our room was very small, maybe 8' x 9', and located behind the elevators. The room exit, through a long narrow passageway from the door, was partially blocked by furniture that did not fit the small space in the room (probably a fire code violation). The view of the television was blocked by the bathroom door. The &quot;closet&quot; was about 12&quot; deep. The bath was smaller than on a cruise ship and far less well designed. The shower had mildew in corners that had been partially covered with caulk and regrew through the caulk. Apparently, bleach is not a known cleaning product at the Milford Plaza. In general, the housekeeping was poor.The bed was soft and saggy. The furnishings were well worn, poorly selected for the space available, and ugly. This is not what one should expect for $300 per night, even in New York.	
Jun 11 2008 	Came home covered in bug bites!!!!	Our stay at the Milford Plaza was terrible!!! For $239.00 a night we expected the room to be clean at least!!! The walls were dirty, the bathroom was filthy, the bedspread had 2 large stains on it and the mattress was about 100 years old!!! We were so disappointed when we checked in, but decided to make the best of it. On the 3rd morning I woke up with a large bite on my right shoulder. It was itchy, but I just ignored it!! By the time we left I had been bitten on the top of my head too. I was at the doctor yesterday and both bites have turned into infections (this is less than a week after we were there). I am now on antibiotics. My doctors says it is NOT bed bugs as they leave track line marks as they bite. My bites are from a spider or other large insect! Yuck!! You couldn't pay me to stay in that hotel again!!!!	
Jun 11 2008 	Location location location	What can i say, you don't come to New York to stay in yoru Hotel!stayed for nearly a month at teh Milford over christams/new years in jan 07 and found the hotel fantastic!There were 3 of us in a room (2 double beds), and we had a view pretty much of the brick wall - Yep the rooms are tiny, but clean and serviced daily, polite helpful staff (generally), felt really safe and secure in this hotel and the location out ways any downfalls it may have!If your looking to spend your whole trip in your hotel stay somewhere else- and only because the rooms are small. But if you want to stay in a safe, clean hotel in teh heart of Timesquare and New York this is the hotel for you!We were on a theatre trip and the location to stumble out of bed and down to teh tkts booth (literally down the road) and then back to get ready for a day of sight seeing was amazing. Allowed us to pop in and out of teh hotel all day with shopping etc!Reccomended many friends to stay here and would def stay again! (no one has had any complaints!)	
Jun 10 2008 	Reliving the times....	We stayed at the Milford for 6 nights; June 2-8. As with many of the hotels of this era, the atmosphere has been maintained, while any updates keep with the present. What people have to realize is that it was built in 1928. Space was limited, but patrons weren't as spoiled as they are today; wanting everything. The hotel impressed the hell out of me. From the outside, in, I couldn't have been more pleased. The lobby is spacious, with there being 3 front desk personnel on handling check-ins/outs, so there was no undue waiting. The security ensured that anyone NOT supposed to enter the elevators didn't. You have to show them your room key. The elevators were designed to take you right to your floor; not multiple floors. I liked that. The rooms were big enough for us; three adults with two double beds. Our room was kept comfortable with the air conditioning. You could hear the traffic outside, but I liked that, and what is one to expect when staying right near the theatre district. That's what it's all about, isn't it? The hotel offered a well equipped fitness area, with all the devices one could want. TV monitors were attached to the bikes, and treadmills, so you could watch while you exercised.I was welcomed by a 'good morning', EVERY morning when I headed to and from the fitness area. The cleaning personnel was friendly, efficient, and accommodating.There was a kiosk in the front lobby that offered patrons coffee, fruit, pastries, and anything else needed to get the day off on the right foot.As mentioned, the location was ideal, for theatre goers, barhoppers, and those looking to spend the night on Times Square. Don't let the maps deceive you. The only times we took the subway were to go north to the Bronx for Yankee Stadium, and south, to catch the ferry going to the Statue of Liberty/Ellice Island. Otherwise, we walked everywhere. The location the hotel offered that option. Room rates were in line with a Manhattan hotel of this type and location. One word of caution to those trying to 'sneak' others in, and avoiding having to pay. Forget it. Security is of the utmost importance, and upon checking in, front desk personnel asks for identification. Overall, we were very satisfied with our accommodations, and found ourselves asking each other how we could have found such a nice hotel so easily. I highly recommend the Milford Plaza.	
Jun 10 2008 	Comfortable hotel fantastic location	I stayed at the Milford Plaza over Christmas. First things first, this is a 2 star hotel, don't expect anything more. I was more than happy with the standard of accomodation. The rooms were clean, not the nicest of decor but you get what you pay for. The hotel couldn't be in a better location. Just a block away from Times Square with everything on your doorstep including the theatres. There was a coffee shop in the hotel where you could grab a hot drink and some breakfast before heading out for the day. I really didn't spend that much time in the hotel so all i wanted was a comfortable bed and a shower and i got just that. Why should you need anything more in New York?Just one tip, if you get a phone card, don't use it from the phone in your room as you get charged a connection charge everytime.	
Jun 10 2008 	I was skeptical	After we had booked the hotel, I had seen some bad reviews of the hotel. I was a bit nervous when we got there. But after easy check in, I started feeling better.We then went to the elevators which I had heard were very slow. We NEVER had one problem with them at all.As we all know hotel rooms in NY city on a whole are small. This room was not bad. The bathroom was a bit small but for the amount of time that you spend in there, it was not bad. The room was very clean.The staff was very friendly. The location of the hotel is great! It is within walking distance to many restaurants, shops &amp; theaters.I would highly reccomend this hotel
