	Greatest hotel staff that I have ever encountered	I have traveled all over the world and have never stayed in a hotel where EVERYONE was as sincerely nice, attentive, efficient, and kind as the staff at Hotel Chandler. The rooms were very lovely and comfortable but the people who run this hotel really know the secret to success and that is making the traveler feel comfortable and cared for. I would never stay anywhere else after this positive experience.	
	First class hotel with first class staff	My wife, I and 2 friends stayed at the Chandler over 19/11/2009 until 23/11/2009. From the time we arrived to the time we left, all of the staff were friendly and very helpful, with the reception staff always on hand to help with any of our requirements, such as completing the online check in for our return flight. They were very knowledgable about New York, and were on hand to point us in the right direction with helpful hints and tips. The hotel itself, is quiet, with a sophisticiated feel, and while the lack of restaurant facilities could be seen as a drawback, you don't stay in New York to eat at your hotel! What it does have is a tidy little, and very welcoming, bar. Location is great in that you turn left walking out of the hotel, 50 yards to 5th Avenue, look right and up and you're staring at the Empire State. It has to be said that it's in a near perfect position for exploring midtown and downtonw, and all places in between. The room was spacious with plenty of wardrobe space, and a nicely sized bathroom with a great walk in shower. It was very hot in the room, but the air conditioning was on hand, but it did strike us odd that it should be so warm in November,The weather whilst we were in New York was absolutely perfect, and I'm not sure whether the Chandler will take the credit for that, but if they want to we'll let them!!!Highly recommended and we'll stay again.	
	Good location great rooms	Our eleventh visit to New York but our first at the Chandler. We have stayed at many hotels in the city including big chains such as Novotel, Radisson as well as some independent boutiques. The Chandler is a four star independent and is simply the BEST hotel we have used in New York. It is a three minute walk to the Empire State Building and Macy's, so close to mid-town Manhattan but in a pretty quiet location. The room that we had on the tenth floor was immaculate and really modern. The bathroom was new, contemporary and again spotless. No bath but big glass double shower cubicle. The room wasn't huge but was big enough with plenty of storage. Good sized wall mounted LCD TV and a good quality I-pod docking station. We had one breakfast free of charge that was ok, usual thing - juices, cereals, breads, pastries etc. The hotel provides free tea and coffee making facilities in the foyer all day which is a nice touch.We chose to take breakfast on other mornings at a deli around the corner on Park Avenue rather than pay the hotel prices. We found the front desk staff really helpful, courteous and polite. When we booked we had requested a double room, non-smoking on a high floor and that is exactly what we got but with an upgrade without even asking or having to pay more. We found the hotel quiet, relaxing and in great condition throughout. All in all we genuinely feel that this is the best hotel that we have used in New York and it will be our first choice when we (inevitably) return in 2010. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Dave and Jacqui.	
Nov 23 2009 	Great hotel in small package!	I had just stayed somewhere else in NYC the night before and my friend referred to it as &quot;dressing up a pig&quot;. He was right. But The Chandler hotel was a nothing like that! It was great! The staff was really friendly, the lobby was very nice and the room, while small, was very clean and well put together. Even the hallways in the rooms were nice. I just really liked this place. I've stayed at a few different places in NYC over the past several years and so far, this is my favorite one. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a 4-star hotel that is not in a hugely touristy area. The rooms are very small but it's a nice trade-off when you can use another hotel and get a larger but not as nice room. Thanks for rescuing my trip!	
Nov 19 2009 	Friendly helpfulwelcoming.	A friend and I stayed in the hotel Chandler for a shopping/sightseeing trip and could not have had better service. Everyone was polite,and made the effort to welcome us personally when ever they saw us.One of the doormen even went to the end of the block in the rain to hail us a cab. The rooms were very comfortable and a welcome relief when we shopped til we dropped!!! The location was ideal, round the corner from the Empire State Building and central to most shops and attractions. We both would definately stay there again.	
Nov 19 2009	Three star hotel three star service four star amenities	I took my 10-year old daughter to NY for our first &quot;girl's getaway&quot; and chose this hotel for its central location, easy access to the subway, and reasonable rate. I read reviews before we went and stay in NY frequently. It is your average NY boutique hotel. The service is very average. We took our bags to our room ourselves, no one offered to help and we took our things downstairs the same way when we left. The sixteen dollar breakfast is not worth it. Go around the corner to one of the many bakeries or coffee places. They were painting the lobby ceiling during business hours and had drop cloths and &quot;CAUTION&quot; signs out. There was just no NY panache or pizzaz about the experience. There is free coffee in the morning. The rooms are small, but really on par with what you would find at The W or Chambers or SoHo Grand. I thought the bathroom was fine. Clean, small, GIGANTIC YUMMY SOFT FRETTE TOWELS THAT YOU COULD TAKE TO THE BEACH! Frette sheets and comforters. Bed very comfortable, but not as comfortable of the Waldorf, which is a whole other world, but they are my yardstick for comfortable beds in NY. Nice Aveda toiletries. Turn down service happened on night 2, but not night 1 (?). Chocolates. Our room was quiet even though we were only on the 6th floor. We were on the back of the hotel. The front desk upgraded us to a better room on our arrival without my asking, but the woman on the desk was on the ball. Overall, service very inconsistent. No one is smiling for some reason and there is a &quot;flat&quot; atmosphere to the entire staff. Elevators are fine and work well. Staff helpful with directions, but little else. This is a three star hotel with inconsistent service and four star amenities. If you stay in NY a lot and need a comfortable affordable place to stay mid town this is fine. I probably will try something else next time. If you are going to take cabs the whole time and spend most of your time uptown, then you are better off paying a few extra dollars a night to save on cab fees. If you use the subway, this works well.	
Nov 19 2009 	Great	We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Chandler, exellent location on a quiet street, near Empire State Building. The rooms were small but nice and clean and the staff were great.I would highly recommend this hotel if your going to New York, and we will make this hotel our hotel when we travel to New York.	
Nov 16 2009 	A Nice Surprise	As a recent resident of NYC, I am very familiar with the local hotels. You get the ridiculously overpriced trendy/new boutique hotels in hot neighborhoods...The classic 'famous NYC' hotels, the too-good-to-be-true holes in the wall and the horrific tourist traps. Since I now live in CT and commute to the city for work, I needed to stay in Manhattan for a business event. Even with my 'corporate discount', most hotels were still in the $350 - $550 a night range and over my budget cap. I decided to look on hotels.com and saw a 4 star boutique hotel called The Chandler. So I did my homework, looked at reviews here, checked out the website, maps, etc. I wasn't crazy about staying in midtown, but I figured at $219 a night, I couldn't go wrong. It was close to Park and the subway if needed, but more importantly, the rooms looked clean and updated. I had to laugh at some of the reviews from tourists who have never been to NYC... complaints about the street noise, thin walls, narrow halls, tiny rooms. Sounds like my old apartment! I knew what to expect in that regard, but I was shocked when I walked into a modern, immaculate lobby and was greeted by the doorman and front desk person right away. There was a slight issue with my reservation made on hotels.com, but that was their error. They had not sent the reservation to The Chandler, but there was still room. They even upgraded us to a deluxe room. As I walked down the hall, I thought to myself &quot;This is the first time I've been in a NY hotel that didn't smell of smoke, mold or that musty odor that you get when you walk through an older building.&quot; The carpets were new (and no stains!) and the room was small, but normal by NY standards. The bathroom was clean and had new fixtures. Aveda products, which are always nice. The beds were SO comfortable that you sink into the pillowtop mattress and soft sheets like it's a big marshmallow. There was some street noise, but nothing out of the norm for any city. It didn't keep me up at night and not once did I hear anyone next door or walking above me - something I never got used to in my old apt. The only issue I had was the $16 continental breakfast downstairs. I opted to eat in the library area, read the paper, have a cup of coffee and some fruit. They had a waiter on staff to serve you coffee (a pot no less) and if I chose to order eggs or something from the menu, that was offered as well. I only had the coffee, a scone and some sliced fruit from the buffet and it was $16. I think they should either comp this or make it $10 (unless someone pigs out and takes 1/2 of the baked goods from the table...it would be reasonable). They had an older computer if you needed to use the internet and the library was stocked with local papers. A very nice atmosphere. I was concerned that the location would be in a 'dead area' meaning industrial/everything closes at 6pm, but there were several restaurants around the corner and a coffee shop. Getting a cab was easy too, so no need for the subway. I can't say enough about the staff though. Attentive, helpful and friendly. Something you don't see a lot of here. I have already recommended The Chandler to friends and co-workers who have family or friends coming to town who don't want to stay in Times Sq or overpriced downtown.	
Nov 3 2009 	Comfortable and cosy two blocks from the Empire State Building	We had a great time in New York with our 16 &amp; 18 year old kids, in no small part due to this great little boutique hotel. We selected it on the internet mainly using the reviews here and if anything it was better than we had hoped. It's perfectly located right slap bang in the middle of Manhattan. Empire State around the corner, walkable to Times Square and perfect for transport everywhere else. For a family, using cabs was very economical - easily half the price we'd pay back home in London. We used them a lot. The Rooms weren't huge but plenty big enough very comfortably furnished, terrific beds, &amp; warm fluffy white toweling bath robes. Housekeeping service was very thorough. No tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms which we tend to expect back home but don't seem to be common in the USA - but there was complementary tea &amp; coffee in the lounge which did the job almost as well. We knew there would be no restaurant in house but there was one next door - but we wanted to go out to explore the New York breakfast elsewhere anyway. The staff were very attentive and helpful to anyone looking for tourist or travel advice. The room rates were very competitive too given the location. All in all I'd certainly come back and would recommend it without reservation.	
Oct 31 2009 	Fantastic Hotel in a great location	We booked this hotel on the basis of the reviews in trip advisor and also because it worked out cheaper than our usual hotel (Intercontinental The Berkley) at this time of year.We checked in without a problem and were put in a room on the 4th floor, 425 (smoking floor), the room smelt a litttle smokey so we phoned reception and they said we could move room and that they would provide free breakfast the next morning due to the inconvenience.Our new room 825 was laid out the in the same way but smelt fresh and of course clean. We had a fantastic 6 nights stay here, the free tea/coffie in reception was nice as was the free internet in the communal lounge/TV room.The location of the hotel was very good in a very quiet side street, just around the corner from 'tacky central' (the empire state building). Just a 10 min stroll to Macys and 15 mins to Times square.The nearest subway was on Park avenue at 33rd street (there is an entrance on 32nd street) making the 3 block walk (2 East and 1 North) very convenient at 5 minutes.I have stayed at the Waldorf, Regency and Intercontinental hotels (all 4 star) in New York and I would stay here next time I visit. it is a much smaller/friendly hotel than the others and with the same level of comfort for less money.	
Oct 29 2009 	A Welcoming and reasonably priced hotel	As expected, we arrived early and the room was not ready, so we walked to get some theatre tickets at TKTS. On return, we discovered the room did not have a bath (tub) - which is something we value and assumed would be commonplace. Although full, they suggested that we use the allocated room that night and then they would review the situation in the morning. In the meantime, would we please enjoy a free breakfast the next day. Next day, Mille had arranged an upgrade (at no extra cost) to a room with a tub.The hotel staff were so friendly ( The Concierge booked us into Sardis and Anne checked our other reservations and Walter was on hand in the evening for any other arrangements.)Their courtesy and kindness to us was so unexpected when one hears other stories of New York hotels. The door staff were forever getting bags and opening doors- always with a cheery smile: they were also able to get a cab on a rainy morning which is quite a feat.Overall, a much better stay than we have had at other hotels ( including the Waldorf Astoria). The 24 hour self service coffee/tea arrangements and also ice- all at no charge- are much appreciated.Thank you again to all the staff. Would unhesitatingly recommend it to our friends.	
Oct 23 2009 	A Nice Stay	I'd never heard of Hotel Chandler before, but it was a nice stay. One block toward Broadway (going west) was a Dunkin Donuts and subway and around the corner heading east was a tasty cafe place sort of like EuroPan that you find around the Times Square and surrounding areas. Chandler offered complimentary tea/coffee and computer use all day (1 computer) and a breakfast and bar area (you pay). A short walk to Broadway, Macy's, Manhattan Mall, and the 34th/35th street shopping district. Close by was also a cool bar called Tonic (the east location, not Times Square). It had a very cool roof top, but beware inside Tonic is very dark went during the day on a Sunday and it was dark, don't wear shades (sunglasses). Chandler's bathroom was small, but the style/decor of it was very nice and offered great light. Beds were comfy and the in-room safe a nice addition. Give the Chandler a try.	
Oct 20 2009 	A clean and comfortable stay with a helpful friendly staff.	I can't say enough great things about the Hotel Chandler. Great beds, very clean, friendly staff and an all around pleasant stay.	
Oct 18 2009 	Bad Location Poor Service Don't get the breakfast	It started when our check-in was delayed and the staff kept giving different reasons. First, the previous guest hadn't checked out, then the room wasn't clean, then engineering had to attend to the room for some mysterious reason. The irritating part was first being told to check back in an hour. Sat in the lounge, checked back in an hour and were told &quot;not yet, come back in an hour or two&quot;. We went to lunch at the only restaurant we could find, which was 5-6 blocks away. Not too bad of a walk except when you didn't arrive in sensible shoes and your walking shoes are being held hostage in the luggage room. Came back two hours later and was told &quot;engineering had to be called in to take care of a problem&quot; and it should be another hour. Sat in the lounge worrying that we wouldn't get into our room in time to quickly freshen up and change clothes in order to make our dinner reservations and get to a 8pm theater show. We finally got into our room at 4:30pm. We were back downstairs by 5:00pm. Asked the doorman to get us a cab and he told us it would take at least a half hour at that time of day. We walked to the corner and hailed our own cab in a couple of minutes. Came back to the hotel, looking forward to a well-earned martini after a dificult day of traveling, only to find the bar closed. Despite the fact we were there during the hours posted on the door. Just thought we got off to a bad start and called it a night.The first day made the mistake of going into their &quot;restaurant&quot; (only serves breakfast) for breakfast. They had a skimpy buffet set up. Bagels, two kinds of dry cereal, yogurt, fruit and some pastries. Similar to the &quot;free&quot; buffet at a &quot;Days Inn&quot;. Made the mistake of only glancing at the menu and saw the buffet was $16. I asked if I could get something other than the buffet, like scrambled eggs and bacon. Our waiter said &quot;sure&quot;. Knowing the buffet price, I was prepared to pay a similar price for the eggs and bacon and asked if I could have a pancake instead of toast.. I believe the eggs, bacon and pancake all came out of microwave or possibly were cooked a few days before and just sitting out somewhere, because despite being the only customers in the restaurant, the food came out at room temperature. The eggs were dry, small pieces (unlike any scrambled eggs I've ever seen), there were 3 narrow strips of cold, dry bacon and the pancake was like rubber. My friend opted for the buffet, but after scanning the selections only came back with a small cup of yogurt and a muffin. My friend finished her yogurt and was in mid-bite on her muffin when the waiter came and took away her plate and silverware. Leaving her nowhere to set her muffin down and heaven forbid if she wanted another cup of yogurt. (Silverware was not at the buffet, only on the table.) The bad news is that I paid $25 for my dried eggs, bacon, and cold pancake. The good news is that my friend wasn't charged $16 for the 4oz yogurt and mini-muffin that she had. That night seeing people in the bar with drinks and gathered around the door outside, we felt that the bar was open. We sat in the bar for a half hour and no bartender appeared. The people in the bar were very young, seemed a bit overserved, and I don't believe they were staying at the hotel. Maybe they let themselves in and made their own drinks? The next evening we saw someone behind the bar and a couple of people sitting on stools (once again looked like young, rowdy locals), but figured if we went in there something would go wrong (like a receiving a bad, expensive drink or maybe we just missed last call). The bar also was very tiny. About a dozen people would make it crowded.The room was fine. Nicely decorated. The maid service was good. I think my main complaints are:The bad location. Nowhere close to get a cup of coffee, a bottle of water, a quick bite to eat or a drink. The hotel does have 24 hour complimentary coffee and tea service in the lobby area. The coffee was good enough. But I was dying for a &quot;Starbucks-like&quot; place to get a serious cup of coffee.andThe poor service people. When we asked questions at the desk such as where is a nearby restaurant, or when is the bar open, we were first met with a blank stare and then a &quot;I don't know&quot;. I almost felt like I was in a foreign country that spoke a different language due to the lack of response. The restaurant was almost comical with the snatching away of the plate and then they very quickly brought us our check to sign before I was done picking at the eggs. And on top of all that, on the way out the door, we were questioned about our name and room number ad the waiter franticly checked what appeared to be a hotel listing (as if we snuck into the hotel to eat the horrible $25 breakfast). I was getting prepared to present room key, photo ID, and fingerprints as identification, but the waiter found our name on the list and all was fine. Did I mention this is a small hotel? Not like he had to check hundreds of names or rooms. It looked like the hotel may have been recently remodeled or opened and maybe I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that the majority of the staff is inexperienced?If you need a room and are in no hurry to get it and need nothing else, it's an okay place to stay. Otherwise, it's horrible.	
Oct 14 2009 	Wonderful boutique hotel great location	We travel to NYC from Toronto twice a year. This was our first time at Chandler Hotel. It was an excellent place to stay and we would recommend it. We walk as much as possible and it was an easy walk uptown to the theatre district , Fifth Ave shopping, or south to SoHo and Canal St. Staff were friendly and attentive. The computer in the library meant we didn't have to bring a laptop (this trip was for a holiday)	
Oct 13 2009 	Wonderful Anniversary trip to New York!	My husband and I booked the Hotel Chandler for our silver Wedding Anniversary trip to New York based on the reviews on the website and we were not disappointed. The hotel was lovely; spotlessly clean, very helpful staff, beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and toiletries - we really felt pampered. We had a queen deluxe room to the rear of the hotel which was dark due to the high buildings nearby , but this did not spoil our visit - the views of New York while sightseeing more than make up for this!The location of the hotel was great, close to restaurants, bars, subway and attractions such as the Empire State building, Flatiron bulding and of course Macys!Although breakfast was available at the hotel ($18), we walked round the corner (50 yards) to Feastra deli where breakfast could be purchased for a fraction of the cost and the food was excellent.We will certainly return if visiting NYC again and would recommend to friends and family.	
Oct 12 2009	Great location great hotel	We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend at the Chandler. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the room was immaculately clean and very comfortable. The location places it within walking distance of Times Square and Penn Station. I was extremely pleased with the service received for the price we paid..	
Oct 10 2009 	NYC Stay	Recently stayed at the Hotel Chandler after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. We found it to be very well located, in the middle of Manhattan (2 blocks from Empire State Bld) and 3 blocks from the Subway. Service was nice. Room very clean. The bathroom did have a small mold issue.	
Oct 9 2009 	Very varied	It's very hard to review this hotel. We turned up very late from our flight. We were told our room was no longer available and that we'd been downgraded. Our room was absurd, the bed was only big enough for one, the room stank of smoke and looked nothing like the rooms in any of the pictures - it was like entering the servant's quarters! To compensate we were upgraded to their best room in the hotel which was genuinely incredible, gorgeous sheets, bathroom and sitting room area - we loved it!	
Oct 7 2009 	2nd time around: and as nice as the first time	this was our 2nd stay at the Hotel Chandler and it was still as nice as the first time. It's location is great, the receptionists and door men are very helpful and friendly.Upon booking we asked for a room with a view to the street, which we got.	
Sep 29 2009 	wonderful hotel	went with my wife and 4 friends for 4 nights stay at the hotel chandler and have to say what a wonderful hotel. OK yes rooms are a bit on the small size cannot comment weather they are smaller or the norm for hotel in new york as it was our first visit to big apple. but i will definitely be going there again and will stay at the same hotel i will also pass on to any one who asks, my friends all said same thing. hotel is about 200 yards from empire state building just around the corner. decor in every room was beautiful as was the dinning room and reception. shower was very nice as has been mentioned by other. towels were changed every day. and all staff were very helpful and friendly.	
Sep 27 2009 	great hotel in new york city	we booked an internet breakfast special at a very very reasonable price.... at checkin we have got a free upgrade to a junior suite.... the room was completely new renovated with a sleeping and sitting area with 2 tv flat screens, a very modern bathroom, a very comfortable bed and untypically for new york: very quiet!!! breakfast buffet was available from 7 am to 12am... with fruits, yogurt, muffins, bagle, toast, bacon, eggs, orange juice,.... staff was very friendly and helpful.... great location (just around the corner of empire state building) and close to 3 different subway stations... will come back for sure!	
Sep 26 2009 	Great Location at a brilliant price	We love NY and have always stayed in the mid-town area as its central. We stayed here in the last week of August 09. It was clean and the staff were very helpful. The bedrooms were a nice size, suitable for tourists who spend all day out. The only downside was the outdated pc that was available downstairs for guests. It kept having problems and needed staff to be called to sort it out. That being said, they responded right away. Very near to lots of tourists spots, could easily walk up or downtown from this location. We were pleased with this hotel,	
Sep 22 2009 	nice hotel friendly staff good location	Nice hotel with friendly staff, rooms are small but good, comfortable beds, nice bathrooms with great shower, liked the Aveda products. Handy mid-town location. Booked on hotel website and got reasonable, discounted price (180 US$ for kingsize room, no breakfast). Free wifi. Free tea/coffee 24/7.	
Sep 17 2009	Beautiful hotel great location fantastic service!	My sister and I recently made a trip to NYC and stayed at Hotel Chandler for 8 days, and could not be happier with our experience. From the time we checked in until our last day, the staff was beyond helpful, knowledgeable, courteous, and professional. Day and night we were greeted with smiling faces from the entire staff, who were ready and willing to assist with anything we might need, from opening a door to hailing a taxi, to looking up information on the subway system for us or suggesting a restaurant. The room itself was impeccable, and was fully cleaned and supplies replenished every single day and our beds turned down each evening. The location was amazing, with everything from the subway to attractions such as Times Square and the Empire State Building only blocks away. I would highly recommend this hotel, and would absolutely stay there again!	
Sep 10 2009 	A gem in the heart of Manhattan	Stayed here over a busy Labor Day weekend. Despite this the hotel still gave us a very quiet room (as requested on our booking), with absolutely no traffic noise. Have to agree with all the other reviewers here ; superb central location in Midtown Manhatttan, friendly helpful staff and good quality, clean and comfortable rooms. They even turned the covers on the beds down each evening, which was a nice touch (something I haven't seen for years in most other hotels !) Thoroughly recommended !!!Ian and JasmineCambridge, UK	
Sep 8 2009 	Absolute Perfection!"	Great place. Staff is friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable, quiet and wonderful! I booked a package that included breakfast. This is the way to go to avoid spending the $16 per person for breakfast, which really wouldn't be worth it. Our room was at the back of the hotel (third floor) and there was no noise at all from the street. All in all, a great place in NYC!	
Sep 5 2009 	great value for money	The hotel is fantastic! The service is excellent, beds comfortable, it is quiet, but located in lower Midtown, between Madison and 5th, so you can easily walk around Manhattan. It's a great hotel for exploring one of the best cities on earth	
Sep 4 2009 	Camera was STOLEN from Hotel rom !!	My photo camera, chord and converter was STOLEN from hotel room due to the fact that the window couldn't be locked - only closed...Reported it missing to the hotel, was told to wait while they &quot;checked&quot; it out and HAD TO ask each day how the case was going..They didn't believe us when we told about the unlockable window, the same window that gave out and fell onto the nearest table..2 days after it went missing the &quot;brains&quot; said we had to contact the nearest Police Department, got an adress and found out that they sent us to a Police Department far away from the Hotel..Still awaiting the final outcome of this case...NOT recomended at all...Thanks for nothing....:(	
Sep 2 2009 	A little gem right in the heart of things	This was my fifth visit to New York. I've stayed in the best hotels, and I've stayed in the worst. This definitely falls somewhere in the middle at a VERY reasonable price. It's small enough that the staff get to know you but has all the amenities of a big hotel. The 24 hour coffee and tea in the lobby is great and the staff are very friendly. Tucked away from the noise, but within a stone's throw of The Empire State Building, this is DEFINITELY where I'll be staying on my next visit (unless I win the lottery in the meantime that is!!!) Book with confidence.	
Aug 18 2009 	It's ok	If you don't want to spend too much money for a hotel in NYC and don't care about a view, or room to move, and no amenities, here it is. The beds were comfortable,though	
Aug 16 2009 	Great hotel in a great location	This hotel is a great find. It isn't too expensive for the excellent location - right around the corner from the Empire State! The staff are very courteous and always spent time ensuring you knew exactly where you were going! We were able to walk to Times Square or could take the tube to wherever we needed to go. The rooms are a decent enough size (especially for NY) but a bit of a squeeze with two cases. The bathroom was a really good size though. Fresh tea and coffee are available downstairs in a little sitting area/breakfast room. There is a tv and books in there, plus free internet access. Overall this was an excellent choice. It was perfect for our 6 night break.	
Aug 16 2009 	Abusive Staff	There was a miscommunication between the night manger and myself. With good intention I attempted to suggest a way that he could have made himself better understood to me. Rather than accept what I had to say or just let it go. This individual continued to argue his point with me for about 10 minutes. I had repeatly asked him to stop and he just continued to argue and try to make riduclous analogies that did not make sense. I travel often and have NEVER experienced such unprofessional behavior from a staff member. I was not prepared nor inclined to do battle at 7am.The room was fine a bit small and we were awoken by a garbage truck outside at 4 am, but that is NY. As a native New Yorker, there are better areas to stay. Try the Lower East Side or East Villiage where you won't be taken advantage of for being a tourist.	
Aug 9 2009 	Great Location and quaint hotel	Choose this hotel after reading the reviews. They were accurate. Rooms are small but well appointed and clean. The front staff were friendly and helpful. We especially liked the list of restaurants the hotel gave us to guide us in our choice of restaraunts. We choose a restaruant from each level and all were good. Central location and easy to get to all main attractions.	
Aug 8 2009 	Great Hotel	Small rooms, but very well decorated. Very clean and organized. Beds were so confortable and soft. Hair dryer and built in ironing board were a nice touch. The staff were very friendly and help full. The room prices and Hotel location were great for Mid Town.  On the negatives, we needed a Cab to accomadate 5 passengers to go back to the airport. The Front Desk did not seem to make much of an effort to handle this request. It seems they have agreements with certain Cabs for pickups. We had to take care of it ourselfs. Also, I had the breakfast Rate on my room. I noticed the price at the door to the dining room was 17$. I ate there for 3 mornings and the only things I saw put out were cereals, fruits, and pastrys. I did not find out until my check out that I could have ordered eggs, pancakes, and waffles. The waiter never once mentioned this to me or any other diners present. I mentoned this to the Front Desk and they just shrugged it off . Also, when I told the waiterthat there were small flys inside the fresh fruit container, he just laughed , shook them off and keep on working.  These are small problems in detail. I would still stay there again when I return to the City. I would recomend it to all my friends. Just make sure that you &quot;order&quot; eggs and pancakes each morning with your breakfast.	
Aug 7 2009 	Great location away from the hustle and bustle.	Nice, clean hotel on a not so busy side street, but close to subway entrances and bus stops. Only one train stop from Grand Central Station, walking distance from the Empire State Building, and close to Penn Station. Restaurants nearby, including a very good one directly behind the hotel on E. 30th - Ravagh Persian Grill, go around the block in front of the hotel to E. 32nd for Sushi. Other options abound, pizza, subs, Dunkin Doughnut, snacks, etc. The staff was awesome, always a friendly smile and upbeat attitude. They make you feel special. Negatives, no vending machines on the property, unless you want to buy the snacks/drink in your room (and I don't have to mention what that would cost!!!). No ice machine; however, the staff will run a bucket up to your room in no time. Free Wi-Fi, free toothbrush/toothpaste and other hygiene type items. The street in front of the hotel is nothing to write home about, but it has a safe feel. If you're on the back side of the hotel the view is significantly less than desirable, best to erase that memory. The rooms are small; however, the beds are very comfortable, the AC worked well, flat screen TV on the wall most certainly freed up space from the CRT days. Two guest elevators that worked well. Negative - free coffee in the lobby is very, very weak; however, hot water is available and a nice assortment of teas. Buffet breakfast was included (if not included you'll cough up $16) with one of our rooms, but appeared to only consist of bagels, toast, pastries, cereal and fresh fruit (more continental than buffet). On the last day (after we ate) we found out that pancakes, french toast and eggs were included (all you had to do is ask). Well, trust me, that was the best kept secret of the hotel, not a single guest in the dining area took advantage of the cooked to order items over the four mornings we ate there. Bottom line, we like the place and would certainly come back for the price we paid, one room with a queen bed ($149/night average), our other room had two doubles, and the breakfast ($179/night average).	
Aug 7 2009 	Excellent location good room value for money	Here for 5 nights in June and would be happy to stay there again. The location is very convenient for the subway and the Empire State Building. The room was comfortable and a high standard (if a little on the small side for US) We liked the ipod dock and the walk-in shower. The room was incredibly quiet, the downside to that was the complete lack of view (looked out onto a well between other buildings, some with boarded up windows, couldn't see the sky). Free tea and coffee in the lobby is a nice touch. Staff on the front desk were friendly and helpful. Breakfast a bit over-priced, you can get hot food but you won't be offered, you need to ask! Better to go out if you have the time.	
Aug 7 2009 	No surprises and that's very Good!!	We're a little late in posting this review, but wanted to share our endorsement of the Chandler as a very crisp, comfortable and convenient choice when in Manhattan. The room was exceptionally comfortable [we upgraded to a Jr Suite] and the finishes were relatively new. The staff was helpful, but not over-eager, if you know what I mean.Location makes it easy to transition from lower Manhattan [where our son lives] to the Upper East Side. We would recommend the Chandler as a good choice, and would definitely stay again.	
Aug 4 2009 	In the heart of the city and easy to get to the bus and subway and trains	great location, however, the rooms were small. I loved the shower that was centered in the ceiling and the water came out hard, great for rinsing. My husband did not care for it. He preferred the shower head to come off. The bathroom and room was extremely small. House keeping was very attentive if you needed anything. The front desk and bell boy were short and sweet.	
Aug 2 2009 	Brilliant Location and Friendly Staff	My boyfriend and I recently stayed in the Hotel Chandler on a trip to NY. Staff were superb and the room was excellent. Regarding the location it was spot on. Close enough to all the main attractions but on a quiet street so a good nights sleep was never disturbed. I would highly regard this hotel and will certainly stay in it again if I am ever lucky enough to return to the Big Apple :)	
Jul 28 2009 	Compact but Classy	After taking ages to pick a hotel in New York to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary i decided to to plump for the Chandler after a lot of groundwork, we booked a Queen Deluxe which was at the front of the hotel and except for the first night due to the garbage men it was fairly quiet and peacefull. At first i was disappointed with the room as it was a lot smaller than i had imagined but after seven nights there we were won over by how nice it was with a comfy bed, great shower, lcd tv and nice decor and when you go to NY you hardly spend anytime in the hotel anyway but its still nice to come back to a decent room. The hotel staff were very helpful and nothing was any trouble for them from getting taxis for you and giving advice on the subways. We only had a couple of drinks in the hotel and they were only $3/£2 for a bottle of beer and $5/£3.50 for a vodka and mixer between 4pm and 10pm, For breakfast we just went to the small delis near the hotel on 33rd st and we got ours for about $12 for the two of us, go out of the hotel and turn right then left and you will find them within a couple of blocks. The biggest plus for the hotel is its location, just around the corner is the empire state building and many of the other sites you would want to see are all in good walking distance and taxis are quite cheap if you want to go further afield. We were also lucky that we caught the 4th july fireworks on the hudson river which were pretty amazing (almost as good as Edinburgh at New year !) We would also recommend the Broadway show Rock of Ages, great music and very funny.	
Jul 28 2009 	Wonderful hotel and location we strongly recommend Hotel Chandler	My wife and I spent our 4 night honeymoon at the hotel chandler during May and we would recommend this hotel to anyone else looking to spend some time in NYC. The staff were very professional, warm and helpful. Our room was at the rear of the hotel and was clean, beautifully furnished and very quiet. We even managed to use the gym (in an attempt to burn off the cheesecake and Margaritas) and found it to be small but perfectly formed. Speaking of which the adjacent bar is a good place to start your night, if you hit the happy-hour. Free tea, coffee and web access in the lobby were very welcome. Our top tip: The hidden gem that is The Sun Roof Bar at La Quinta Inn, 17 W 32nd St (between Fifth Ave and Broadway). It's about 2 mins walk away and has the best view of the Empire State....plus free popcorn.	
Jul 20 2009 	Absolutely nothing to complain about : perfect	We stayed at Hotel Chandler for a week and enjoyed it very much. The location in midtown Manhattan is perfect for people citytripping in NY. Two blocks from the metrostation, a short cabdrive away from most points of interest, very nice restaurants you can walk to (around Grammercy park),... It couldn't be better! The staff was very friendly, efficient and correct. Our room (Queen Deluxe) was spacious, tastefully furnished, perfectly clean, with a big flatscreen TV, airco, ipod-dockingstation and a very nice bathroom. It was situated on the second floor at the back of the building, it was very quiet at night. We also never heard noices from other rooms. I would absolutely stay again at the Chandler and recommend it to everybody! We only payed 109 euro per night via Expedia wich is very cheap compared to the prices we payed for lesser hotels in Boston, San Francisco, Paris,...	
Jul 11 2009 	A Lovely Place to Relax	I have just returned from two nights at the Hotel Chandler and I have to say that it is a wonderful hotel. I had a delux queen room that, while small, was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. As mentioned in other reviews the showr is fantastic and the Aveda bath products can't be beat. And, of course, the location is unbeatable in terms of convenience to Times Square, subway lines and restaurants.One minor quibble that I mentioned as I was checking out (and the desk clerk made a note of this) is the mini-bar could have been colder.	
Jul 10 2009 	Great location in NYC	My girlfriend and I spent 5 nights at this hotel during our first trip to NYC and were quite satisfied. As others have noted, the room was very small (just enough room to walk around the bed and to the washroom), but the decor was updated, updated, and classy. The A/C, included internet, and large TV made the stay very comfortable as well. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is great - it's about 2 blocks from the Empire State building, about 6 blocks from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, about 15 blocks from Times Square / Broadway Theater district. Definitely recommended for anyone visiting NYC.	
Jul 7 2009 	Great location	If you need a place in the city JUST TO SLEEP, Hotel Chandler is the place. We arrived way earlier than expected and was offered 2 choices of available rooms. Staff very friendly and went above their call of duty for various questions pertaining to the city. One thing to mention is the room WAS vey tiny; but when you are in New York City; no need to hang out in your hotel room...It was a very comfortable bed to sleep in and bathroom was very spacious. Definately stay there again.	
Jul 2 2009 	Pleasant stay at a great price	I booked this reservation through Quikbook a few months in advance and got a very good deal for a Deluxe Queen room ($120/night). The hotel did not disappoint me. The public areas and rooms were tastefully appointed, well maintained and clean. Staff were very friendly and professional. I have only a few minor complaints about the property--but wouldn't want anyone to take these too seriously given the otherwise fine nature of this property. First, there are no coffee makers in the room, but coffee is available gratis 24 hours in the lobby. A minor inconvenience. Second, there are no ice machines or buckets available for guest use--one needs to contact the front desk to have ice delivered. This was more annoying (and costly in tips). Third, the electronically monitored honor bar in the room is tacky and unnecessary IMO. Lastly, while I had a Deluxe Queen room, it was definitely one of the smallest of that type (less than 200 sq ft, where most are 225-250 sq ft), so be aware of your room type when you check-in and try to request a larger sized one if that matters to you. The location of hotel is terrific: easy walking distance to many great attractions and neat Manhattan neighborhoods (Murray Hill has lots of great restaurants nearby). Thank you, Hotel Chandler, for a wonderful stay in NYC at a terrific rate.	
Jun 29 2009 	Simply brilliant	The service, both by booking prior to our stay and at the hotel, was great and personal - something you rarely see nowadays. The concierge was fantastic and the room was clean, well designed and had wonderful Aveda goodies. Our room on the 9th floor was fab. In the city you don't expect amazing views but frankly it didn't matter. In terms of room size, which was most adequate, it is around the size of a European room, and I think that for Americans used to Marriots and other chain hotels this may be why some 'okay' reviews were posted.We are going back.	
Jun 29 2009 	Hard to fault	We read numerous reviews of NYC hotels before picking one and were not disappointed with the Chandler; good price, clean room with ipod docking station, flat screen tv, free wi-fi and air con, big bathroom with walk in shower and bathrobes, easy walk to the Empire State building, Times Square, Macys and Grand Central station and will definitely be staying there again and recommending it to others. Also the Thai restaurant opposite the hotel is good and cheap after a long day seeing the sights.	
Jun 25 2009 	Okay choice	With all the choices of hotels in NYC, it was hard to decide on one, but I went with the reviews. I agree that the location was great, staff nice, bed comfy; however, the room is REALLY small and ours (third floor - NOT RECOMMENDED) continually had a/c problems. We had initially been upgraded, but when we found the room next to the elevator, I went back to the front desk and asked for a quiet room. They put us on the third floor (ever heard NY street noise while trying to sleep?) in a tiny, tiny room. So, does that mean take what you get? Maybe, but I'll try somewhere else next time.	
Jun 24 2009 	You will not be disappointed!	Booked this hotel from reviews only, was NOT disappointed. Rooms were not that small!! Bedding changed every day, everywhere you went in the hotel was clean. We stayed for 7 nights and after walking round NYC all day it was the perfect place to stay! Staff were very pleasant and very helpful. Also location was perfect, Empire State Building at top of the street, Times Square less than 10 minute walk! 10/10Turner family, Thatcham Berkshire. UK13-20 June 09	
Jun 16 2009 	Great Hotel	I read all the reviews before book in this hotel, and now I can say that every good comment was true. The hotel is great in all sense. The location was very good, just two blocks from the Empire State and very close to the metro station. I had a Deluxe King Room, and I can say that the room was big enough for my wife and I. The bed was fantastic and the bathroom amazing, with clean towels everyday and a very strong shower. I stayed in the hotel for 7 nights and I have nothing to complaint about. The staff was friendly and very helpful all the time. This was my second time in new york. The first time I was in Wellington, but Chandler is much better in every sense.	
Jun 16 2009 	Charming Euro-style find in Midtown at a great price!	Although I only stayed at the Hotel Chandler one night, I've been recommending to friends as an alternative to the chain hotel experience. Lovely (albeit) small rooms with generously sized bathrooms. Bathrooms feature a large tiled shower with great water pressure, Aveda bath products, and comfy robes that reach to the ankle. Bed and linens were clean and fresh. Good Midtown location - was easily able to walk to my meetings at 26th and Lexington. Hotel staff is first rate - they even printed out a travel receipt I needed from the 'net. The only very small problem was a mini-fridge that didn't seem to be cold, and had no visible means of adjustment, but that was a very minor issue. I look very much forward to staying at Hotel Chander again!	
Jun 11 2009 	Good things come in little packages	We recently stayed at the hotel Chandler on a 5 day trip to New York. The hotel was perfectly positioned in mid town Manhattan. It was a two minuted walk to the Empire State Building and within 5 minutes of Macy's. The hotel was an excellent find and the staff extremely friendly and very helpful. The rooms are small but well equiped with hairdryer, irons etc. The hotel was clean and very well presented with its own bar, which offered reasonably priced drinks. So if you are looking for a base in New York this would be an excellent choice. Wouldn't recommend the breakfast, very basic and quiet expensive. But there are plenty of places to have breakfast close by, so no really issue. Would definately recommend this hotel!!	
Jun 10 2009 	The Perfect Hotel	The reviews don't lie. This hotel was prefect in every way. The rooms were immaculate, comfortable beds, beautiful tiling in the bathroom. I'm a very picky person and this hotel met all of my expectations.The staff were very helpful and the bar next door with their &quot;Fight the Recession&quot; drink specials was a great place to relax for a beer or two before heading out for the evening.The location was great with the subway nearby. Walking distance to Time Square, Central Park and a block away from the Empire State Building. The room was also fairly big for New York standards.I would have no trouble recommending this hotel to anyone.	
Jun 9 2009 	Agree with all recent reviews	After a month in France, we ended our stay at the Chandler. We had a great rate and found this hotel to be terrific. The extras like robes, nice shampoos, great shower, free wireless, sauna and workout room etc. were appreciated. The staff (all of them) were helpful and really pleasant. Our room was small (probably because of our good rate!) but do-able. The hotel is near the Empire State building and a short walk to Penn stations and metros. I missed the neighborhood feel of the upper west side where we usually feel but the hotel itself met all expectations.	
Jun 8 2009 	Couldn't ask for a better place to stay in NYC!!	My daughter graduated this past weekend at Madison Square Garden from Veterinary school. Our family had never been to NYC and were nervous about what to expect. She booked the Chandler when she saw one of her friends she was graduating with had done so ,and I can't tell you how happy we are she did. We drove in easily and parked in front of the hotel where we unloaded our belongings and gave the key to our large SUV which was valet parked for us..cost=$50.00/24hrs d/t it's size. We checked in easily and entered our rooms on the 8th floor 830 and 831, which are perfect for family members as there is a short hall between the two rooms with a door that can be locked so that the room doors can be left open if wished say for small children. My husband and I had a most comfortable queen size bed in a comfortable room with an amazing shower. Clean can't be emphasized enough..and I am a nurse germ a phobic! Our daughter who is 25 and son 17 stayed in the adjoining room which was larger with 2 lg size full beds...each bed could sleep 2 adults comfortably. They both were able to use their computers to stay in touch with friends and make plans for the graduation festivities.  My husband treated us before and after dinner to the little but nicely appointed bar in the hotel where the bartender couldn't be nicer..or cuter I can say! He also went there on his own to chat with the bartender over a Corona or two.. The gym is small but clean, and I ran on the sturdy treadmill easily. One thing you should be aware of is the items in the room that are for sale. We didn't have a price list and picked up items to see if there were prices underneath which our bellboy said there would be..I asked him if we lifted the items would we automatically be charged...he said no....but later in one or the rooms a price list was found and a note that items held for more than 20sec would be charged! A water bottle was charged to our bill, but was removed when we told the clerk we hadn't taken anything. I thought this would be our one and only trip to NYC, but after our comfortable stay at the Hotel Chandler, we will be back o take in more of the sights:) My family has traveled a lot and this was one of our most surprisingly enjoyable stays!	
Jun 8 2009 	Great hotel in a handy location.	I stayed with my sister for 3 nights at the end of April 2009 in a standard room with 2 double beds. After comparing a few sites we found the best rate on the hotel's own website (it also included breakfast!)Service-We checked in a couple of hours early so our room wasn't ready but staff were extremely helpful and courteous and made us feel welcome. Our luggage was safely stored whilst we explored the area and we were advised that our room would be ready by 3pm, which it was. The standard of decor in the rooms and hotel in general was high. Our initial room on the 1st floor (US 2nd floor) overlooked the rear fire escape which was disappointing, but the next morning we asked if it was possible to change to a room with a better view and were moved to a lovely room on the 8th floor. Again staff were extremely polite and helpful.Room-The bedrooms were high spec. and a decent size - not massive but plenty of space for 2 double beds, 2 armchairs and a coffee table (in the bay window area) along with a wardrobe/dressing table unit incorporating a large flat screen TV. The room also usefully contained an iron &amp; board, a minibar and an alarm clock/radio which was also an iPod dock. The bathroom was a decent size with a good shower and lovely Aveda toiletries. The room was spotless and didn't show any sign of wear, it had an overall feel of 'cosy luxury'.Amenities-Breakfast was included in our rate. This was not bad as continental breakfasts go but probably not worth paying extra for (think it's around $16) - it included fresh pastries, muffins, fruit, hot drinks, juice, scrambled egg &amp; bacon - there were also free US newspapers.There was a small gym which appeared to contain modern well maintained equipment, and seemed quiet, but we didn't make use of this - too much else to do!Location -We found it really handy-easy to walk to from NY Penn station (it's on the same street) also walking distance from Empire State (just round the corner), Grand Central Station, Times Square and also close to a subway station to get down to the south of the island or up to Central Park.As a comparison we stayed one night in the Hilton 6th Ave (part of a package), after staying in the Chandler. Again in a twin bedded room but we calculated at roughly double the price for a night, without breakfast. The room was larger but that was the only advantage, the decor was of a similar standard. The staff whilst not unfriendly, were impersonal and rushed and the hotel felt soulless after the Chandler. In future I would always choose the Chandler over the Hilton.	
Jun 7 2009 	a bit better than average	Hotels are all about expectations and which standards you are expect to find in a hotel. I think the Chandler hotel is overrated on Tripadvisor. We stayed there for 4 nights in May this year. The room on the 11th floor was real cramped. You almost could not walk around the bed! Yes, the bed is comfy and the bathroom nice with all amenities you need.I would not label this hotel upscale. It's clean, kind of classy and staff are polite and offers good advice and service. If you expect pampering, grandeur and impeccable service I would look elsewhere.	
Jun 6 2009 	GREAT STAFF and a BEAUTIFUL Hotel	Stayed at Hotel Chandler while on a &quot;girl trip&quot; to NYC. Stayed on the AARP rate, but was treated as if we were royalty. From the bartender (in the oh so cozy little bar on site) to the housekeeping staff -- EVERYONE was so friendly and so helpful. The front desk staff were generous with their time and with their smiles. The breakfast seemed a little spendy at first, but the quality (not to mention the quanity) of food was so good that we ate there every morning. The hotel is beautiful and is in a great location. We'll all look forward to returning.	
Jun 3 2009 	Good choice	My wife and I stayed at Hotel Chandler early April, and we were very pleased having chosen this hotel to stay at. The people working at this hotel were nice and helpful. The location was nice, in central Manhattan, very near to the Empire State Building. Hotel Chandler is not the most luxurious hotel in New York, but offers nice clean rooms with more than just the comfort you need. We had chosen this hotel because of the great reviews on this site, and because the room rates are fairly affordable compared to the rates of many other NY hotels. We made a great choice. If we revisit NY, we will definitely check out the rates and availability of this hotel. And if the prices are still right, we will return here for sure.	
Jun 1 2009 	It does what it says on the tin	My housemate and myself have just got back from a 5 night stay at the Hotel Chandler and it was fantastic, exactly what is says on the tin! We arrived in the late afternoon and the receptionists were lovely and very helpful and we straight to our room. The reviews are spot on, 2 double beds which were very very comfy and a fab bathroom with excellent shower, heaven after a long flight. The rooms are not as small as i thought and it was very quiet, we were on the 8th floor at the back, so no major view but who cares. The bell boys were very good and we had taxi at the ready when we needed them. a great location to as well. I would definately recommend this hotel and would go back. Room service were keen, though we did not get the chocs or newspaper!!	
May 29 2009 	All that we could ask for!	My sister and I were visiting New York City for the first time and the selection of possible hotels was overwhelming. After much research, we settled on the Hotel Chandler. We had a Junior Suite which had a king size bed as well as a pull out queen size couch. The room was very comfortable, well decorated, and spacious enough for our needs. The bathroom was small but cute with a good shower/bath, soft bath sheets, great soaps and shampoos as well as comfy robes. There were two flat screen TVs mounted on the walls and two blow driers provided. Staff were accommodating and friendly, especially considering how elementary some of our questions were. Housekeeping staff were available always and quickly answered our requests. The doorman was helpful and anticipated our need for cabs! Very clean and a lovely room; we would definitely stay there again. I had heard to expect noise at night but was pleasantly surprised with the quiet area the hotel is in. We slept like logs every night! The location is near to the Empire State Building and Macy's; it is also within walking distance to Time Square and Grand Central Terminal if you don't mind hoofing it. When we were tired we did take cabs which are amazingly affordable. There are also eating places including Starbucks and cafes nearby. Our favorite spot was Vezzo which has thin crust pizza to die for! If you like Chinese, the Grand Schizwan is also close and good.	
May 28 2009 	Brilliant hotel in great location	This was our first visit to NYC and had booked hotel Chandler as it was a good price and in a great location. All of the positive reviews on this site are correct - this is great place to stay.We didn't spend too much time in the room, but when we did we found it was very comfortable, quiet (even though near a lift) and the air-con did a great job. The staff were great, didn't have to deal with them much beyond check-in/out, but were very helpful and arranged a taxi for our flight back.We stayed in a superior queen room, which had a flat screen TV, a safe (free to use) and was able to access the free wireless connection. The shower was brilliant and the bed very comfortable. Several people on here have said the rooms are small - although they're not massive, they're more than enough for two people plus luggage etc.We went in the bar only once, but it seemed nice and a beer was onlt $2 in happy &quot;hour&quot;.Everything we wanted was walking distance from the hotel. Empire State is about a 2 minute walk, and Times Square and central park were not too much further. We only used the subway once, but found it easy to get to.Would definitely stay here again.	
May 28 2009 	Made our trip a complete success!!	Our trip to New York and the Hotel Chandler was fantastic largely in part to the wonderful, helpful staff and the cozy, quiet room we had. The hotel's location is terrific! Very close to the subway and less than the advertised two blocks from the Empire State Building. The staff at the front desk were ALWAYS friendly and very helpful with all of our needs and questions. I know the next time I'm in New York exactly where I'm staying and all my friends will know where to stay too!!	
May 25 2009 	Beautiful Hotel in a great location!	My husband and I are just back from a wonderful 3 night stay at the Hotel Chandler. It was booked as a surprise for my 30th Birthday and couldn't have been better! We found the location to be excellent. We were close to the Empire State Building, Flatiron district, Greenwich Village, Macy's, 5th Ave etc Our room was lovely with a fantastically comfortable bed, LCD TV, Aveda products, dressing gowns etc.The staff were very friendly and efficient and were happy to answer any queries, provide maps etc We rarely spent any time in our room as this was our 2nd trip to NYC and we still had loads to do, however, the hotel had a wonderful ambience, and I would highly recommend it. The last time we visited NYC, we stayed in the Times Square area but staying at the Hotel Chandler gave us the opportunity to explore the Midtown area more and we weren't constantly drawn to the hustle and bustle of Times Square!!!Having read previous reviews, I can understand people's annoyance at having rooms located right beside the elevators as noise definitely travelled within the hotel. Thankfully, this had little impact on our stay and we would definitely stay at the hotel again!	
May 20 2009 	Sweet boutique hotel in great Midtown location!	My friend and I went on a girls' weekend to NYC and stayed for four nights at the Hotel Chandler. We loved it - the hotel was nicely located in a quieter side-street in Murray Hill, a lower part of Midtown north of the Chelsea/Flatiron districts and a stone's throw from the Empire State Building. Times Square/Theatre District was only about a 15 to 20 minute walk.The staff were very polite and accommodating (although never really specific on the great spots to eat - I don't think they live in the area, but they did provide a sheet list of some recommended places). We were always greeted when we came and went from the hotel.We stayed in a Deluxe room with two small double beds, which was great. The beds were nice, great sheets, very clean. The bathrooms had wonderful Frette towels (although we didn't have the nice shower head, for some reason). We didn't notice any noise from the hall or other rooms, and although the A/C was a bit noisy, we were usually so tired we blocked it out. There was a lot of closet space and lots of hangers, which is not always the case with two women travelling! The rooms were not that small - most people need to remember that many NYC buildings have smaller rooms, but we never felt cramped in the bathroom or in the bedroom, even with having our luggage beside the bed. The radio/iPod dock and flatscreen were nice, as were the Aveda amenities and Frette towels and bathrobes. The minibar was a bit dusty, but with so much great food at your doorstep, it's no surprise.The staff were great about accommodating us for late checkout (first come first served, though) and we had no trouble having our luggage stored. We didn't get a chance to check out the bar, but it looked really cozy.The rates were a fantastic value for this location, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. I can't wait to go back!	
May 19 2009 	Could this hotel be any better?	What a fantastic find this hotel was. Great room, fab LCD tv, ipod dock, loads of storage, amazing shower (had difficulty getting out of it it was so great). Towels &amp; robes so fluffy - great touches with Aveda bathroom products. Staff couldnt have been more helpful - really good location. I wish I was back there now.	
May 17 2009 	Perfect Location!	First off, I have to say this - People looking at reviews of hotels should make sure they look to see how many &quot;contributions&quot; a reviewer has made before taking too much value on what they say. Too many hotels are putting in their excellent reviews with made up people so just be aware that one contribution could mean fake review. I would dock Hotel Chandler for that since they do have an exuberant amount of one time contributors leaving reviews ALL the time but since they really did such a good job to make my stay excellent I won't. This really is a great place for the price. I booked a room at 40% off and that made it $199 per night and I think that is a reasonable price for this boutique hotel.The service was excellentRooms were cleanBed was comfy Air Conditioner was great (not loud as someone previously stated ) The room is small but just the perfect amount of space with everything you need.The only thing I would fix is the shower drain didn't drain fast enough for the amount of pressure coming out. Standing in a pool of water is not fun at all in a hotel room. I have seen this complaint before so it didn't shock me too much but it did gross me out a bit. The only way I can see fixing the problem is putting a low flow head on the shower so not so much water comes out. I love the shower head so that is too bad. We were in room 1023 and it was bright and refreshing, quiet and comfortable.We had dinner at an absolutely wonderful fine Vegetarian Restaurant around the corner called Hangawi - very romantic and tasty Korean food.We ate breakfast at Keko's just around the corner and loved the ambiance as well as the food	
May 14 2009 	Great location lovely staff	Spent 3 nights here recently - what a lovely hotel! Smallish and very serene, but really easy to get everywhere and close to the subway. Spent first night in a room on the 2nd floor which we found a bit noisy, got a room change no problem (8th floor, back of building - v quiet, bay window, lots of light, spotlessly clean, stylish decor). All the staff (particularly one of the concierges) were lovely - really friendly, polite, lots of helpful answers to questions. Free internet access in library, free newspaper at breakfast, and free hot drinks all day in lobby were nice touches.I have stayed in some of the larger hotels in midtown, and this hotel completely outclasses them!	
May 13 2009 	What a gem!	Stayed here for 3 days+ the location just off 5th Avenue+31st Street is fantastic,within walking distance of Penn Station,Empire State,Times Square etc.The hotel is quiet+tranquil,virtually no noise in the hotel or outside.The staff are very helpful and upgraded us to a Deluxe suite without us even asking.The room was fantastic with enough room to hold 2 huge cases,us+ all the shopping+more,air-con was very effective and the bathroom huge with big double-size shower.Great Aveda toiletries too. We will only stay at Hotel Chandler if we visit NYC again! Visit 'ICHI UMI' the Shushi buffet in the next street if you like seafood-62 different types of sushi plus all the main courses,its incredible!	
May 13 2009 	Great choice	Apart from being kept awake on the first night be noise from an adjacent electrical cupboard this is a great hotel. Our room was switched without any problem and after that we had complete silence which considering the hotel location is quite amazing. If you want quiet ask for a room over the courtyard as I suspect those on the road side would be noisy. The staff were very helpful and courteous. Moonstruck dinner worth a visit - also Jackson Hole for burgers and La Giara for Italian both on Murray Hill.	
May 6 2009 	Some Good Some Bad	First of all the positives of the Hotel Chandler. The location is excellent - smack bang in the middle of Midtown Manhatten which in my opinion is the best area to stay if visiting. Just off 5th Avenue as well so could be any more central. Staff were very good and polite especially the guys doing the breakfasts. Rooms were spotless and cleaned very well everyday. The price was very reasonable as well. Free internet access on the computer in the lounge was also good.The negatives were that the rooms are very small (but probably to be expected for the price paid). It was mega hot when we went but unfortunately the air conditioning sounded like a V8 engine so we had to choose between being absolutely roasting hot or putting up with an extremely noisy Air Conditioning unit. We also lost sleep due to very noisy neighbours stumbling in drunk at 2 in the morning but obviously this was not the hotels fault - sound proofing between rooms was good but any noise in the hallway could be heard coiming through the door.Also, phone in our room didn't work when we tried phoning the UK and we thought nothing of it until we were charged $10 a time for attempting to make phone calls.All in all there are pros and cons. Would be a good hotel in winter but it's far too hot when it's warm weather due to rubbish air conditioning. If you get a cheap internet deal it's an ideal location and if you can put up with small rooms it's great.	
May 6 2009 	Welcome respite from the Big Apple	Stayed 3 nights at the Chandler for a friend's 50th birthday after having read the countless great reviews which overall are a true depiction of the hotel. The service was generally very good and special thanks to Millie Front of House Manager who was a star and sorted out a complimentary bottle of the most delicious red wine to celebrate the special birthday. Rooms very clean and the beds are the most comfortable I have slept in. The room itself was also very nice (Room 931) at the back of the hotel with a view. Any problems/questions we had were sorted almost immediately. The bar is a good place to have a drink before going out (Happy Hour until 8pm) or for a nightcap and lots of locals drink here too. Try the Black Duck on E 28th Street for great upmarket food and service at a reasonable price and there's also live jazz on a Friday night. Other must is cocktails in one of the bars overlooking the Grand Central terminal. Beautiful buildings, fantastic people watching and buzzing atmosphere especially at rush hour.	
May 5 2009 	Great hotel Great Location Great Service	We just got back to the UK from a stay at the Chandler. It is in an ideal position - the Empire State Building is just two blocks awqay, and you can walk to Times Square, Macy's, Madison Sq Garden, Grand Central, and it's just a couple of blocks from the nearest subway stations (33rd St, line 6 is highly recommended - takes you just about anywhere you need to go). We had a room on the 8th floor which was very elegantly decorated, fantastic shower, and a massive plasma on the wall. The staff were very courteous and helpful and the allday free coffee was great, as was the complimentary use of the internet in the lounge. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and would return tomorrow (if I'd not spent up!). Eat dinner at the Crooked Fork - I think it's on 30th St but ask the concierge - it's reasonably priced and fantastic food. Breakfast at Moonstruck Diner which is further east on 31st (3-4 blocks)	
May 4 2009 	Great hotel with fantastic staff in an amazing city!	We are currently writing this review from the hotel's free internet near the lobby as we wait to head back to the airport. We have had a great stay at the hotel - the staff are unbelievably helpful - recommending great places to eat and even offering to print out our boarding passes for us after we checked in online! The hotel room is small but has everything you will need and the hotel is in a great location for exploring the city! If you like steak we would totally recommend a restaurant called Keens - the staff were lovely and the steak was amazing! The Brooklyn Diner just off Times Square is pretty cool too! Can't wait to come back to this city as there was just too much to fit in to the time we had here!	
May 2 2009 	Overall ok - loud music spoilt the first 3 nights!	We stayed at Hotel Chandler for a week over easter. The Positives:-Location was central -It was clean-Hotel staff were polite -Rooms were well furnished -Our second floor room was very quiet  see belowThe Negatives:-We requested a low floor room and were given a first floor room above the bar. The music was so loud the floor vibrated, and it went on until the early hours every night. We struggled for 3 nights with little sleep and then had to be moved in the middle of the night - as we just couldn't take it anymore! After our departure I emailed the hotel and suggested we were refunded for just one of the nights that involved no sleep and a move of rooms at 3am! The hotel responded 'The hotel have advised it is stated on their 'More Hotel Information' that the hotel hosts live entertainment most nights which would involve loud music.' So beware if you are on the first floor, particularly room 225. -The area around the hotel is not great. We didn't find any nice bars or restaurants near by. Each night we had to walk a distance or taxi it. (The area around the hotel, like the rest of NYC, did feel safe.) -Over the course of our 7 night stay we had 2 deluxe rooms and one standard room (due to being move because of noise.) All were very small in terms of square foot (even for NYC -It was expensive; it worked out at 200 pounds a night inc tax. Overall if you get a high floor I am sure you would be happy with your stay. It is an average hotel in a reasonable location.	
Apr 30 2009 	When I'm back in NYC I'll definitely go to Hotel Chandler.	I just got home from a five-night pleasure stay at the Chandler. I had a fabulous time. The staff was so friendly and helpful. I checked in one afternoon and the next morning when stepping out for a paper, the gentleman at the desk greeted me by name. The rooms were tidy and comfortable and the wide-screen television was nice. I'd definitely recommend!	
Apr 30 2009 	Great Hotel in Good Location	We stayed here for 5 nights from 20th April after reading other comments on Trip Advisor. We could not have picked a better hotel, in a great location just a block from the Empire State Building. The young staff were excellent and could not have been more helpful.The hotel was spotlessly clean and the free coffee and tea available all day was an added bonus as was the free internet access. Sure the room was a bit on the small side by European standards but this is New York. We would certainly stay here if we visit New York again and will recomend it to friends..	
Apr 29 2009 	Another positive revew	Not much to add to all the previous positive reviews (on which I relied when making the booking). I shall just say that the front desk staff at this hotel are amongst the very best I have ever come across. They are extremely helpful and, what is more, there are always two on duty so you never have to wait long if you want to see them.	
Apr 28 2009 	The walk to/from Madison Square Garden is HELL (at night)	Lovely hotel, bed, shower, all that. Two complaints: weak batteries in remote and very LOUD flush for toilet. Man at desk said no street was really nice to walk to Madison Square Garden (though he did suggest a good pub en route). After the show Saturday night, the very short walk back (from 8th Ave to the hotel between 5th and Madison) was AWFUL.Prostitutes, would-be thieves, disgusting people, catcalling people, harassing people, just very scary for a city-savy person such as myself. Man, you need game-face to walk these NY streets.Given what I paid, I don't want this nighttime neighborhood around. WHAT is going on in NYC with these disgusting, scary people about at night. I almost checked into the closets hotel to MSG just to get away from it all.	
Apr 24 2009 	The perfect value for money location in Manhattan	After reading review on Tripadvidor decided this was the hotel for us. We were not disappointed. Our room was clean and well furnished with a window that could open onto the street. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linen and toiletries in the bathroom were of a good quality. The rainfall style shower was fantastic after a long day of sightseeing. Staff were helpful and friendly. Did not have time to avail ourselves of the complimentary wine in the evening - we had too much to see and do. The hotels location is perfect in our view for getting around Manhattan - not too far from anything with easy access to the subway. The fact that we could just slip down to the end of the street to watch the lights go out on the Empire State Bldg for Earth Hour was magical.Wi-Fi internet access in our room was fabulous and allowed us to keep in touch with our family in Australia.	
Apr 18 2009 	Great location great hotel!	Stayed here during the Easter holidays, fantastic location just off 5th Avenue. We had a view of the Empire State Building from our hotel room! We had booked a Superior King room, still small by European standards but perfectly adequate. Every facility we could have asked for was in the room, and a really great shower in the bathroom. All the staff we met were very helpful and would do anything they could do to help. Breakfast was included in the price of our room, it was fine, but a little variety from day to day would have been nice! Would highly recommend this hotel, and would stay here again if in New York.	
Apr 15 2009 	A Little Gem in a big City!	My friend &amp; I chose to stay at the Hotel Chandler after reading some of the reviews here, it's a little gem, all of the positive things people comment on are absolutely true. The staff are very obliging, we were upgraded which was a pleasant surprise &amp; the room was lovely &amp; clean. Ideal location, just 5 mins to get to the Empire State Building/Maceys &amp; nearest subway. I would def. recommend this hotel.	
Apr 10 2009 	Disappointing	We stayed here for 2 nights on our honeymoon. The room was a superior room on the 11th floor right next to the elevators. We were disappointed. The room was really small and you could hear everything from the corridor (including the elevator). No view, we could only see a brick wall outside the window. The bed was really comfortable. There was a turndown service but we didn't get any chocolates. Coffee and tea was available in the lobby, that was nice. We also enjoyed the complimentary wireless internet access.	
Apr 10 2009 	new york trip	My husband and i stayed at the chandler for four nights at the end of march. we had a room at the front of the hotel , the standards of the room were very good ,not massive ,but big enough for a few days stay. My only real complaint was there was no tea/coffee facilities in the room ,but there were free ones available in the hotel lobby(not much good when you get up in the morning). The staff were friendly compared to most others we meet in new york. The only other think was the noise at night (yes i know we're in the city) but if you don't like alot of noise maybe ask for a bedroom at the back of the hotel,no views but not in room much anyway. The hotel in about two blocks away (easy to walk) from penn station if you are traveling via newark costs around $15 each way but easy to useand frequent. The gray bus tours are excellent for touring we did day and night , take hat and gloves as it was freezing this time of year. Food we found was a problem as it was either fast food or expensive resturants i can recommened Juniors by time square good food, big portions but not the cheapest.	
Apr 3 2009 	Highly recommended for central location at reasonable price	It would be hard to better this hotel at this price in central Manhattan. The rooms and hotel in general was impeccably clean, a great shower, comfortable bed, good TV, and - most helpful - free wi-fi internet access. Little touches such as free NY Times and little chocolate provided daily were a nice touch (though, curiously, these stopped halfway through my 9-night stay). A nice reception room, with TV, sofas, newspapers, and computer with free hi-speed internet connection. Front of desk staff were always friendly and helpful. Incredibly the room was always quiet, which was surprising given the location. Breakfast was good but quite expensive so I generally made use of the numerous cafes in the area. Subway stations close, but I found I walked most places - both uptown and downtown. Highly recommended.	
Apr 1 2009 	Not bad...not great	The Hotel Chandler is very good overall. Superior room. Got a good price. The front desk is very helpful. The room size is typical for NYC, but the bathrooms are smaller than average. Also, the pipes in the bathrooms made a lot of stranger noises. Lots of noise can be heard through the walls from the hallways and other rooms.	
Apr 1 2009 	Great Pick!	I recently stayed at Hotel Chandler for a business trip to New York. Typically I travel with my husband's company ( much more substantial travel budget than my work allows). I am used to staying in pretty nice hotels in NYC and know what neighborhoods I like. My job permits far less spending when I travel so I took a gamble on Hotel Chandler and it paid off! The price was excellent, and the hotel was great. I have stayed many times at a well know chic chain up the street and here the rooms were bigger, the beds were nicer and the staff was more accomodating. The hotel was generally quiet, sometimes I have found the rennovated older hotels not to be so. Not much street noise either. The location was perfect for someone who likes to walk to all the attractions, but also close to the subway. I would certainly stay here again for business or with friends.	
Mar 30 2009 	A great find!	We booked a &quot;superior&quot; room for three evenings and were quite comfortable. The front desk staff helped us with luggage and took our car to valet parking, which was available to us within 10 minutes of asking. There was plenty of closet space &amp; drawers should you need to unpack any belongings. As mentioned in previous reviews, the shower is large and the Aveda products were restocked daily. I liked the little blue tiles and 20s style design of the bathroom. The bed, pillows and comforter were all very clean and comfortable. Location was extremely convenient and it was a nice resting spot between adventures. Our only disturbance was the fact that we were on the second floor and able to hear the noise of the hotel bar, on the first floor. I suggest a higher floor. The bar seemed nice, with a street front door, but we didn't have time to stop in for a our complimentary glass of wine. Took a peek in the gym which was small but fully equipped, with a sauna. Check out went smoothly with no hidden charges. Overall I recomend this place and will be back again.	
Mar 20 2009 	Absolutely Terriffic! Not a Flaw!	Let me start by saying, &quot;We don't cut corners on anything&quot;, otherwise, we just stay home. When traveling, we want to be pampered and feel special. That is why when we travel, we always book 5 Star Hotels. This past week we were meeting my daughter in NYC, to take in the St. Patrick's Day Parade and enjoy another NYC experience. However, my daughter did not want to spend the usual $400-$500 a night, in NYC, and, in this recession, who could blame her. I searched Trip Advisor...I will NEVER travel anywhere, unless I check Trip Advisor, and search the reviews and photographs. I found good reviews for the Hotel Chandler. The rate was $189.00 per night!. I was quite skeptical, and did not want to stay at this hotel. Based on the price alone...I was very uncomfortable, to say the least. But, in lieu of my daughter's request, decided to take the chance, and we booked the Chandler Hotel for two nights. All my fears were disolved when we arrived at the hotel. GREAT! is all I can say. Really GREAT! Beautiful Contemporary Hotel. I was really surprised...There ARE lovley hotels in the city at reasonable prices. The staff could not be nicer. They were very accommodating and congenial. Valet parking, to boot! The photographs on-line, are EXACTLY the same in person. The hotel is a trendy contemporary, with nice woods and marble accents... they did not cut corners anywhere in this hotel. A lovley wrought Iron Staircase, for those who choose to take the stairs, marble public restrooms with choice toiletries, and a smart dining room. &quot;They did not skimp on the decor, either&quot;. The Bedrooms were lovely, not large (12x16), but well appointed, extremely clean and well maintained. A VERY comfortable bed with down pillows and comforters, and chocolates on the pillows at turn-down. Dark wood cabinetry and silk draperies. Very nicely done. The bathroom was not large, but a nice size, and the shower with ceiling rainshower ...nice touch. They also provided plush bathrobes and slippers, internet, and flat screen TV, and room service!. Surprisingly, the hotel was quiet. The hallways and elevators were well kept and nicely appointed. I've heard people say &quot;When you travel, and are on the go, a beautiful, expensive room is wasted, as you are not in it long enough to enjoy it&quot;. I disagree completely. I want to feel great when I step in the room. &quot;Travel, is a total experience, from the moment you leave your home, until the moment you arrive at your destination. I will definately return to the Hotel Chandler. I feel this is a 4 1/2+ plus hotel. Thanks again, to Trip Advisor!	
Mar 12 2009 	Your best bet in Manhattan!	I recently returned from a four-night stay at the Chandler while visiting friends in NYC, and I will echo the vast majority of reviewers here that rank this gem among the best Manhattan hotels.Everything about the stay was top-notch. The staff were friendly, helpful (yet unobtrusive), and took every opportunity to make me feel at home. Case in point, after a nightmarish travel day, I was graciously upgraded to a Deluxe King room. The housekeeping kept the whole place SPOTLESS, the room was immaculate every evening upon my arrival - you can definitely consider it &quot;barefoot friendly&quot;.The room itself was great (considering its size), the layout was just right. The plush chairs, flat-screen TV, in-room safe, iPod dock radio, work desk, blackout blinds, and spacious armoire were all appreciated and each got put to good use. The decor is warm and inviting, with a very comfortable bed to rest one's weary feet after a long day's walk. Then, in the morning, a powerful rainfall shower and free copy of The Times helped start the day right.The location is ideal: the ESB looms over you from right around the corner, Macy's, MSG, Penn Station, and Times Square are all within a 15 minute walk. Neighbourhood cafes and pubs abound (try the Oxford just up 5th for a great breakfast), while the 6, N, R, and V trains are all within three blocks to take you anywhere you want to go. For all it offers, thankfully, the neighbourhood still provides a quiet night's rest.To sum up, the Chandler's &quot;bang for your buck&quot; is very tough to beat. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to any NYC visitor, it certainly helped make my first trip a memorable one. Thanks again to everyone there!	
Mar 9 2009 	Nice New York All-Rounder	So quite where the (few) negative comments about the Hotel Chandler come from is anyone's guessing, as this must be one of the few true hidden gems in NYC.A superb compliment of staff, clean, tidy and well-decorated rooms, awesome location and a real attention-to-detail ethic make the Chandler a well-advised stay in New York.We really couldn't have asked for more. Devoid of the sterile chain-tel atmosphere that blights many of it's similarly-equipped but hideouly overpriced competitors, the Chandler enjoys a true uniqueness you're going to struggle to source anywhere else in mid-town Manhattan.A hotel that I, as a businessman, would have no problem recommending to both friends and clients alike.	
Mar 4 2009 	Great location friendly staff	November 08. Stayed 4 nights . Really nice hotel, rooms clean and well equipped. Staff helpful, great bar which had a recession happy hour all drinks half price. The location was fantastic short stroll to Macy's and the Empire state building. Staff advised us to use the underground to get around which we did and we felt completely safe and gave us some good recommendations of places to eat, go to Houstons it.'s not far from Bloomingdales well worth a visit. Will stay at this hotel again thankyou to those people on tripadvisor who recommended it.	
Mar 1 2009	a most enjoyable stay	I recently spent 6 wonderful days in New York and the Hotel Chandler only served to enhance the trip. From the check in staff to the bellmen and chambermaids, the service was faultless. As a former Hotel Manager I might be fussier than most, but I had no cause for complaint. The entire Hotel was spotless, the staff polite, friendly, and very helpful. Its the little things that make the difference and the Chandler goes the extra yard with things like the mints on the pillows and complimentary newspapers. One minor quibble would be the size of the bathrooms. A bit small but mine was equipped with the most powerful shower I've ever used. A Hotel well worth considering for your stay!	
Feb 25 2009 	Very nice hotel!!	From the moment we got there, the staff greated us cheerfully and was very helpfull. The rooms were very nice and trendy. It had everything we needed as well as great room service. One thing that i always use being a woman, is the blow dryer. Some hotels have awful ones but this one has the good ones that actually dry up your hair. Also, If you need a good night's sleep, you will get it there with those comfortable beds! Asides from all that, you are walking distance to many restaurants, attractions and shopping.I would definately stay there again and recommend this hotel to anyone!!	
Feb 20 2009 	Couldn't ask for much more	4 night stay with a mid-winter special rate and nothing but praise.Great location in terms of walking or hopping a subway. Staff were helpful and courteous. Room was small, but they tell you that, and besides, when I'm in New York I don't plan to spend long periods of time in my room.Special rate was much better than rack rate which certainly made this more desirable	
Feb 18 2009 	Great great great!	We have just got back from a 5 day Valentine's break. I found Hotel Chandler on the web and checked out the reviews on Trip Advisor. We arrived late on the Wednesday night, very tired from travelling, but it was a lovely surprise when we got there. The staff we're very friendly and helpful, and the room was lovely. The bed was the best bed I have ever had in a hotel, just like home from home. The next day we walked out of the hotel, and to the end of the road which wasn't far, and there was the Empire State Building in all it's glory! It was a great area, safe, clean and not too noisey and close to everything really. I ordered some wine and chocolate dipped strawberries for Valentine's day to be delivered in the afternoon, so when we got back it was a lovely surprise for my husband. They seemed to get everything just right, even the included breakfast was sufficient.I would recommend this hotel over and over, and if ever we go back to New York, this will be on the top of my list!	
Feb 10 2009 	Great location and value	My girlfriend and I just stayed here for the weekend and were very pleased with everything. The location was great (able to walk to Central Park in about 20 minutes), and the price was more than reasonable. We stayed in one of the junior suites and found the space in the room to be ample. I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to NYC.	
Feb 10 2009 	Perfect	My boyfriend and I stayed here at the beginning of Feb for 3 nights and had a lovely stay! Check in was quick and easy and the lady at the desk was very helpful and gave us maps and guides to have. We were also upgraded which was a lovely suprise. The bell boy was great and helped us in our room and opened up the maps to show us where we were and pointed out all the local points of interest and how to get there. The room was lovely, spotless, warm and welcoming. The bed was pure luxury and the bathroom was really nice. Cleanliness is what look for and really this place was spotless. The complimentary toiletaries were really good too. Turndown service was offered every night and a paper was delivered in the morning. All very cute little things that made the stay even more enjoyable. The hotel was at a perfect location....literally a minute walk to the empire state building and about a 7 min walk to times square. We didnt eat at the hotel but did enjoy the bar on one night which was very nice. The staff were lovely, especially the bell boys, all young and polite and overly helpful. On our check out they kindly held our bags and booked us a cab for later in the afternoon and helped us with what time to leave as there was a snowstorm and traffic. Overall we would definately go back to this hotel and compared to another hotel I have stayed in for a similar price I wouldnt even waste my time trying other hotels as this one was just perfect!Thanks Chandler for making our special trip even more special!	
Feb 2 2009 	Nice rooms; service and room service just okay	Hotel Chandler is in a nice, safe location. It's an attractive hotel and the bellman are fairly nice. I had reserved a king-sized room, so when I checked in to a lovely room with double beds, I called the front desk and asked to be moved. They said they didn't have any available king-sized rooms, but could put me in a queen-sized room. I said okay and moved to this &quot;room&quot; which was no bigger than a large walk-in closet, and the only window looked onto the brick wall only a few feet away. It was DARK. I immediately went downstairs and asked to be put back in my original room. The hotel staff were NOT very helpful. They seemed to enjoy playing this game with me. NOTE: IF YOU COMPLAIN, THEY WILL PUT YOU IN A WORSE ROOM!I put my room-service breakfast order on my door early the evening before, as stated on the card, and when I opened my door the next morning (when I was ready for the meal to be delivered) I found my card had not even been picked up! I had to call again and then wait 15 minutes for my breakfast to be delivered. The food wasn't very edible. They barely gave me enough coffee for 2 cups (and there wasn't a coffee maker en suite). Some of the $30 food I didn't even want to try eating - it wasn't very appetizing.The rooms are quite lovely. My original room had a view of the Empire State Building, and was decorated very well. Had a beautiful flat screen TV, an IPOD alarm clock and a stylish (though small), tiled bathroom. The Aveda amenities were nice as well. The other nice thing I took advantage of was the free glass of wine each night in the bar attached to the hotel. Overall, I would stay here again, but I would call ahead of time to make sure they got my reservation correct and put me in the king-sized room I had asked for.	
Jan 25 2009 	OK but only OK	I booked this hotel for one night upon reading the great reviews of it and was really looking forward to it but it didn't impress me that much. I stayed in two other cheaper hotels during my time in NY and actually preferred those. There was nothing significantly wrong with the Chandler but it did not feel any better than an average 3 star, and service certainly wasn't anything special. The room was fine, average size and the bed was comfortable. Even though I had requested a room on a high floor with a view of the city, there was no view at all and the bathroom had not been cleaned properly. This hotel was OK (and perhaps I was just unlucky) but I did not think it was worth the price and I would not stay there again.	
Jan 21 2009	Great Midtown stay	I decided this would be a good hotel for 2 friends visiting NYC based on the TripAdvisor reviews - and wasn't disappointed! Fantastic location, professional, courteous staff, and all-around a good stay. I tend to stay away from non &quot;chain&quot; hotels but Hotel Chandler was an outstanding choice.	
Jan 10 2009 	nice but no more than that	Stayed for 5 nights at start of year. This is our 7th time in New York, mostly staying at this time of year. The hotel was fine it was clean, the rooms were I think just too small! the bathroom was nice but also too small. If you are going to New York this hotel would be an okay choice, as it's location is good, although I prefere to be slightly further Uptown, but it is on the east side which is also my opinion better than the west. If you have booked the Chandler you won't be disappointed provided you don't expect 5 star luxury.	
Jan 2 2009 	great hotel at a great price	This was our first visit to New York and we were very pleased with our choice of hotel. From the moment we walked in we were made to feel very welcome in this fairly small hotel that feels family run. We had breakfast only once thought it was expensive though we only had french toast and tea it was excellent. The hotel is in an excellent position just being off 5th avenue and a short walk from Empire State, Macy`s and Madision State Garden. Our room was clean and comfortable, (beds were really comfortable) as was the bathroom with one of the best showers we have ever used. The reception staff were very helpful and polite, as were all the other staff from chambermaids to waiters. Would have no problem in reccomending this hotel as excellent and among one of the best we have stayed in. We stayed over the christmas period and we were surprised at how busy New York was at this time of year, be prepared to wait in plenty of queues to visit the major attractions, it took 3 1/2 hours to get to top of Empire State and this was at 8.00pm!!!!!!!! It was worth it but just be prepared. All in all had a great time in New York mainly thanks to having a great hotel to return to rest our weary feet. Many thank to all the staff at the Chandler.	
Jan 2 2009	Fantastic Hotel	My Daughter treated me for my first trip to New York. The Chandler Hotel was a great hotel and convenient for all the sights, in particular, the Empire State Building is at the end of the street, a minutes walk!! The staff at the hotel are polite and can't do enough for you. The rooms were clean and the beds were really comfy, just what you need after all the walking and sightseeing. I found that the rooms were a really good size and the shower powerful and equiped with everything you need. If you are going to New York for any reason, you wont be disappointed at the Chandler.	
Dec 29 2008 	Good option for New York	Perfect location for a hotel in New York and reasonable prices too.Located on E 31st Street in Midtown it's the prefect spot to take in all the sights. Right on the corner of the street you get a great view of the Empire State Building and is walking distance to The Rockafella Centre, Grand Central Station and the Chrysler Building. The nearest subway station is only a couple of blocks away on 34th Street. The hotel itself is great art deco building. The staff are really friendly and they serve free tea and coffee and a selction of fruit. Breakfast wasn't cheap though at around $18 but there are plenty of cafes on Park Ave to pick up a tasty bagel.The room was really clean and spacious with a flat screen tv, ironing board, hairdryer and best of all an i-pod docking station! View from the back wasn't great, perhaps there are betters views from the front of the hotel.I would definitely stay here again	
Dec 24 2008	Could this hotel BE any better!!!!!!!!	Our first trip to New York and we don't think we could have chosen a better hotel. Fantastic boutique style hotel, perfectly located! Room was lovely, cosy but not small! Bed was amazingly comfy (which was needed after hours of walking round the city!). Staff were really professional and so friendly! We'd go back there in a New York minute!	
Dec 23 2008 	Exquisite	Stayed at Chandler hotel for 5 nights. First visit to NY so wanted to stay in nice accommodation and wasn't disappointed. The Chandler is in a great location - two mins from Empire State Building. The hotel is spotless and rooms were very spacious. Staff are helpful and friendly. When we paid at the end of our stay the cost was more than expected as daily taxes were added on which we didn't know about but that could have been our fault for not reading the small print somewhere however watch out for that as it's adds up to a fair amount extra. Fairly expensive but really nice!!!	
Dec 14 2008 	Close to everything	The Hotel Chandler is close / walking distance to a lot of attractions. 20 min to Times Sq, 5 min to subway, 2 min to Empire State Building, etc. The staff was friendly and customer service oriented, which makes for a relaxing time in the big city. The rooms were very clean, newly renovated, and had some nice touches (big flat screen, high thread count sheets, naturally lit shower).It was probably pricier than staying at a big convention hotel (the Chandler had about 200 rooms, while the big Sheratons/Westins/Holiday Inns have 1000+ rooms each), but the furnishings, renovations, and &quot;boutique-ness&quot; allow a feeling of relaxation on what are usually whirlwind days in the city.	
Dec 7 2008 	Hotel Chandler - Highly Recommended!!!!	We booked this hotel just because we liked the name, the location was great and the price was reasonable, the pics of the hotel looked fab but they always do in the brochers or on the net but when we got there we were not disappointed!!!!!....Reception staff were friendly and extreamly helpful, we were upgraded when we got there (good times). We stayed in room 331. This was a twin room where me and my friend had very comfy double beds each. The room was clean and tidy. We had a plasma screen, free internet access which was really helpful to get in touch with family back in the uk rather than using your mobile phone and an ipod docking station to listen to our music. You also had access to the gym which we didn't use cus we were walking round the shops everyday!!!!The bathroom was spotless, with fresh towels everyday, robes and aveda products which were replaced once used.The room was cleaned every day and dressed down every night with a lil chocolate on the pillow which was a nice touch.Some may think that these should be a given but with the hotel rated as a 3* we were not expecting much but it was definatly more like a 4* hotel in the UK!The room was slightly dark so you would have to have a light on all the time but this could have been because the room was on the back of the hotel and maybe the time of the year..... but still not a huge problem!The location was fab, with the empire state only 5 mins walk away and time square around 30 mins. 5th avenue was just round the corner so again only around a 20-30min walk to the big designer shops like prada and tiffany'sI would highly reccommend this hotel and i will definatly be booking hotel chandler next year!!!!!!Thanks hotel chandler for a great first time experience!!!!	
Dec 3 2008 	Great Hotel in Great Location	We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Hotel Chandler Nov. 28  Dec. 01 2008. Front Desk, Housekeeping, and Bell staff were most efficient and courteous. The hotel location is great- just off 5th Ave. on 31st, with nearby access to major North/South subway lines  the F/Q/R at 34th/6th and the  #6 at Park/34th . These served us well as we had multiple shows to attend uptown (Carnegie Hall) as well as in TriBeca and Soho. The basic room (Superior with Queen bed) is on the small size  typical of NYC boutique hotels  but not so cramped that two people cant move about without constantly running into each other. Furnishings and amenities are top notch throughout (beds, linens, clothes drawers / armoire, flat screen TV, plentiful &amp; accessible electrical outlets, stereo radio with Ipod dock, bathroom fixtures  overhead shower-, upscale toiletries, etc). The in-room safe was appreciated (I wish more NYC hotels had this) and the provided bathrobes are a nice touch. Three phones might be a bit overkill in a room this size, but what the hey. The comfortable lounge area off the lobby has all-day complimentary coffee, tea &amp; hot chocolate, with a TV/DVD/Stereo and free Internet access. The two elevators are most efficient and we never had to wait more than a minute for one throughout our stay, regardless of time of day. Only small annoyances I might mention is that there is no ice bucket in the room (no self-service ice machines or snack vending machines in the hotel)  so unless you wish to splurge each time for room service or the mini-bar (with maxi prices), you might consider grabbing munchies and beverages from the many nearby stores / cafes on your way back to your room. Also, there is no in-room coffee maker, so be prepared to throw on some clothes and hit the lobby if you need your morning jolt of java, as I do. For comparison purposes, I would rate this hotel on par (or slightly better than) three other boutique hotels which weve stayed at in NYC; The Roger Smith, On The Avenue, and The Muse. We happened to catch a special rate for our stay (less than $200/night), which was an incredible value for such a fine hotel. Would definitely return depending on the available rate.	
Nov 30 2008 	Excellent place outstanding value	Very quiet, understated, elegant boutique hotel. Our queen room was small but well-appointed. Housekeeping was superb - as good as any property we've ever stayed at (which means that every time you leave the room for a while you return to find everything made up and every used item replaced). All staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We're big breakfast fans, and thought this hotel's breakfast was elegant, personalized, and fairly priced. All in all, a very pleasant place and a tremendous value, especially if you want to be in this part of town.	
Nov 30 2008 	Delightful	Delightful boutique hotel, centrally situated, just round corner from Empire State. Rooms beautifully decorated and bed very comfortable, with turndown service. Staff highly efficient, pleasant and very helpful. Breakfasts freshly prepared but a bit pricey.	
Nov 28 2008 	Loved our stay!	We spent Thanksgiving eve here at the hotel and loved everything about it. First, the staff is extremely efficient, courteous, and helpful. As frequent travelers, this is huge for us. Second, the hotel and rooms were delightful. The room, while cozy, was not cramped and beautifully appointed. Everything was new and modern and the rainhead shower was especially nice. The bathrobes and towels were fluffy and sooo comfortable! The bed and pillows were equally wonderful. Our room was quiet. We also liked having coffee and tea available at any time of the day or night.The hotel is a good walk from the theater district but it IS walkable. We'd definitely stay here again.	
Nov 25 2008 	I want to be a part of it!	What a great location! In between the Empire State and the Flat Iron building plus easy access to a few subways! The room was quite nice visually - looked recently refurbished, and like most NY hotels it was pretty small, but definitely better than some!! The bathroom was unreal, really spacious, and plenty of room for 2!!	
Nov 23 2008 	I Heart Hotel Chandler	My family and I stayed at Hotel Chandler whilst on a week long holiday in New York. Our experience there was fantastic! When we arrived and checked in the staff at the front desk were extremely helpful in ensuring that our party had rooms close together, they even upgraded two rooms in order for them to be close together. The rooms themselves were spotlessly clean and comfortable. The sizes of our partys rooms varied, some being smaller than others; but this is New York City and most hotel rooms are hardly huge. However my room was generously sized. I particularly loved the complementary Aveda (very good company) toiletries that were restocked everyday, alongside fresh towels. The hotel also provided a turning down service in the evening which supplied fresh towels, chocolates and a weather card for the next day. Also the New York Times was delivered each morning to your room.  During our stay one member of our party had a problem with their room, it was efficiently and quickly dealt with by staff. Staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly. They booked us tour and theatre tickets, made reservations at restaurants, and booked the taxis for our departure to the airport. They were also helpful in recommending great restaurants to go to such as Keanes, which sells a great steak and has an excellent atmosphere.  The hotels location was brilliant as well. Just around the corner is the Empire State (do not go up there whilst it is raining and windy, as we unfortunately did). The hotels Midtown location was great as you could walk to many of the sights. Walking around to the different sights in New York is recommended as you get a real feel of the city and see a great deal more! On the corner of the hotels street is also a great Vintage clothing store, which I heard has been visited by some of the stars.  Unlike some of the larger, well known hotels, Hotel Chandler has character. Like everything, there are a few areas that Hotel Chandler could improve in, such as the hotel's bar, which was small and the bar attendant was not very friendly, but it would be hard to find other areas to improve. Hotel Chandler played a huge part in making our trip to New York fabulous and memorable. We would highly recommend the hotel to anyone. We were very sad to leave and cant wait to return to New York City again!!!	
Nov 18 2008 	Below Average but excellent location	The Hotel Chandler is not 3 star ............ it is clean enough but very dated, the rooms are dark and dingy. Our room was directly across from the lifts so was quite noisy, and we kept the blinds closed at all times as we just had a view of the building next door only a couple of yards away.  We travelled with friends and when booking months earlier, asked if we could have rooms close togethere, we were on the 5th floor, our friends were on the 10th. The bathrooms are very small, and will only accomodate one person at a time, I reported a very sharp broken tile on the shower floor at the reception, and their &quot;engineers&quot; smeared it with mastic while we were out that day, although I didn't expect them to retile the whole floor, I did expect them to make it safe. On the plus side, the beds are large and comfortable, and the staff very friendly, and of course New York is awesome, luckily we didn't spend much time in the hotel, as their was so much to see and do. I have stayed in quite a few major cities across Europe and have stayed in much better places for a lot less money.	
Nov 14 2008 	Fantastic hotel!!	I booked the hotel for a birthday surprise for my Mums 60th and was so pleased i booked the Chandler.The location of the hotel is fantastic, just a couple of blocks to the empire state + macys. The rooms are great with really comfortable beds which are changed daily. The bathrooms are great too with double sized showers and towels which are so soft! And the Aveda products and bath robes are a lovely touch!The lounge with complimentry tea coffee and fruit is also lovely and great to use when you return after a long day sightseeing and shopping! This hotel is really fantastic and i would highly recommend anyone staying here! There a lovely coffee shops just a block away for breakfast, the Oxford Cafe was our favourite!All in all a fab hotel with helpful staff, great facilities and in a perfect location! I would definately stay here again on my next stay in New York!	
Nov 12 2008 	Great Hotel highly recommended	Wonderful Hotel, as New York city goes, our room was generous in size, spotless, with great bathroom and large walk in shower.turndown service every night, fresh linens and a nice touch, complimentary fruit, tea &amp; coffee all day long for guests in the lounge. Great staff, very friendly &amp; helpful, smashing location, just off 5th Avenue, near Empire State &amp; Macys , and walkable to selection on subway stops. Highly recommended	
Nov 5 2008	Great central place to stay!	My sister and I just spent a week in New york and would highly reccommend the hotel Chandler as a central place to stay. Its 2 blocks from the Empire State building and right off 5th Ave. Very very central! Its not cheap but definatly not as expensive as some of the others. We had a small room with 2 double beds but it was fully functional. The shower in the bathroom is amazing and the complimentary Aveda products were a nice touch. The staff were always courtious and helpful. The bellboys are always there to grab a cab for you, should you need it. The staff hand out maps on arrival too, which is great if you have never been to the city before. The only negative thing I could say is the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The hotel offers complimentary tea/coffee in the lobby but most people would'nt want to go to the lobby in their PJ's of a morning to grab a cup! We stayed on a room only basis but there are plenty of deli's nearby, most open 24hrs. I would advise people to avoid eating out in the area as it is overpriced and obviously geared towards tourists. Take a taxi to Greenwich Village in the evening for more variety and better value for money. However, there is a nice Thai place across the street from the hotel which has lovely food and inexpensive. All in all, the Hotel Chandler is a great place to stay and check out the city as most tourist spots are within walking distance.Take a city bus tour, a must for all the relevent info on the first few days of your trip. There are agents on every corner in which to buy tickets.	
Nov 5 2008 	Welcoming Chandler	My daughter and I have just returned from a four night stay at the Hotel Chandler. On the whole I was extremely pleased with the Hotel. The location was excellent for visiting Macys and Empire State Building- both only a few blocks away. The reception staff were excellent, both for friendliness and manner and were always willing to answer any of our queries. We were recommended to visit the Barking Dog restaurant for breakfast, which lived up to its recommendation. Also Keens restaurant which we visited for an evening meal- if you want a really good steak go there - pricey but good.There were a couple of niggles with the hotel. One was that there was a distinct lack of English Breakfast Tea Bags in the 24 hour tea and coffee availability- the first two days there were none. The minibar in my room was working, but nothing was remotely cool or cold and although a maintenance man came and looked at it, it was still the same when I left. Couple more tips.Guy and gallard is really good for breakfast, only a short stroll away, and we also ate at Artisinal restaurant- evening meal again pricey, booking recommended- but excellent food and service.We also went on a River Brunch cruise on Sunday, and I can thoroughly recommend this- again food and service were excellent- this was through world yachts and I booked before leaving England online.	
Nov 4 2008 	New York Gem	We have just returned from New York and stayed at one of the best hotels you could wish for. They were friendly and efficient with staff who were always willing to help and put themselves out. The room was beautiflully furnished and had a good range of cupboards, efficient air conditioning and a power shower that was a joy to use. Spotlessly clean and well maintained. The availibility of tea and coffee 24/7 in the dining room was a bonus, which we enjoyed especially after a hard day's sight seeing.	
Nov 4 2008 	very good Chandler	Just returned from a trip to Ny to the marathon and stayed at the Chandler . It was very good . Very helpful front desk who could'nt do enough . They were friendly and professional . Great rooms nicely furnished and very clean . Free coffee and tea available in lounge all day was nice Only a couple of minordownsides views from our rooms non exsistent and as there wasn't 24/7 room service tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been good . Overall a great stay PS. if you run marathons worth doing Ny crowds awesome !	
Nov 3 2008 	Lovely staff fantastic location	Choose the Chandler based on Tripadvisor reviews and it's location. Both are completely accurate. Unfortunately I was taken ill less than 12hrs after arriving and admitted to hospital for 36hrs. the front desk staff organised a doctor within 5 mins and he advised me to go to hospital. On my return to the hotel they couldn't do enough to help me/ us get taxis, open doors, hold lift etc.Bed lovely and comfortable, air conditioning could be better but I am trying again next October half term and will definately re book for the Chandler then.	
Oct 31 2008 	Fab Location	I have just returned from New york and stayed at this hotel . It was my first time there and I was very impressed with it. We were upgraded from a twin single room to a twin double which was so great after a long journey from Ireland .The beds are super comfy and the room was spotlessly clean . The hotel is located around the corner from the empire state building and approx. a 10 min walk from Macy's and tons of other great shops.Our only disappointment was the breakfast which is completely optional , however as we were pushed for time one morning we decided to have breakfast there . It cost $16 plus tax per person and they offered a very poor buffet selection. But I would definitely go back there again .Great hotel .	
Oct 22 2008 	fabulous location	Having, sadly, just returned from New York after 4nights staying at this Hotel I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the Chandler is in an ideal situation. It is spotlessly clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. We were 2 minutes from the Empire State Building and within walking distance of many tourist attractions. Can't wait to go back to the Big Apple and will defo stay here again.	
Oct 21 2008 	Great little place	We were pleasantly surprised by Hotel Chandler. We were expecting a cramped little place, with rushed staff, and maybe not the cleanest facilities, because of the relatively cheaper price we were paying for our room. We got the exact opposite! Wonderful attentive staff, and clean rooms with pretty nice amenities. The room was still on the small side but cozy and well furnished with an LCD tv, ipod player, and free wireless connection.It's also in a great location being just a few blocks from the Empire State building, Koreatown, and the subway station. It was very easy to hop on the train and head to other parts of the city.The only issue with the room was that temperature was hard to control. It was either hot and stuffy with the air off, or very cold with the air on. There seemed to be no way to find a happy medium.We will still definitely stay here again on our next trip to new york city!	
Oct 20 2008 	special place in Midtown	Stayed for two nights, booked a king room. Great location in Midtown, block from Empire State Bdg, next to Koreatown with its great restaurants. On arrival very classic pre-war building with gorgeous modern furnishings in lobby and marble staircase (has two decent elevators as well). Staff very friendly and helpful, VERY ATTENTIVE bellmen. Room not huge by most hotel standards, but reasonable by Manhattan standards. Also beautifully furnished, flat screen TV's, classic tile bath w/ aveda toilettries and bathrobes. Only neg was some noise from another room shower and outside revelry on Sat night.Most impressive was that I was upgraded by the manager from a standard room to a suite with King bed and pull out sofa bed (had wife and toddler with me) for no extra charge.	
Oct 15 2008	Birthday delight	My daughters have just returned home from their 4 night stay and are full of praise for the kindness shown to them by all the staff. Their room was clean and very comfortable. They especially loved the location. Both plan a return visit with a stay here.I received friendly e-mails from the reservations department and a quick, no fuss service when trying to organise my credit card authorisation during their stay. Thankyou to all.	
Oct 2 2008 	Fabulous Service+Convenient Location=Great Place to Stay	I booked a stay at the Hotel Chandler for a 4 night stay to go see &quot;Equus&quot; on Broadway and to have a romantic getaway with my partner, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the accomodations and staff of the Hotel Chandler. First, all of the glowing comments and reviews of the staff and their attentiveness and willingness to help are deserved. Their genuine desire to help and do anything necessary to make our stay as pleasant as possible was refreshing and wonderful. Just a few examples of the high level customer service they offered are: provided street and subway maps to us upon checking in without us having to ask for them, offered their printer for printing a work document that I needed from my email just by overhearing me talk about it with my partner in the lobby, reserved a cab back to JFK that was there early and waiting for us (the cabbie also was highly knowledgable and able to traverse city streets to avoid the horrible rush hour traffic on the LIE and Belt Pkwy), held our luggage for the entire day after we checked out until we needed to leave in the evening, always brought ice promptly and with a smile whenever we requested it, the complimentary turndown service was such a pleasure to come back to after dinner or from a fun night on the town, the complimentary 24 hour coffee/tea service was a blessing to caffeine addicts such as my partner and I, etc. I could go on and on with all of the little things that are done quickly, efficiently, and all with a smile that made our stay so pleasant. Another thing that the hotel has going for it is it's convenient central location in the city which allows you to feel relatively close to it all, while feeling secluded while there given that it is located on a side street rather than a major avenue. We did Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and 5th Avenue shopping all in one day and all on foot. The Empire State Building is literally just 3 blocks away! Quick tip, the thai restaurant located directly across the street is quite good and they will deliver to you directly in your room. The room and amenities were comfortable and nice. The wall-mounted flat screen was a touch of home that we appreciated, as were the Aveda toiletries and the iPod docking station on the alarm clock. The bed was very comfortable and the climate control worked relatively quietly and efficiently. There was plenty of space to store all of our clothes and sundries for our 4 night stay (and trust me, we aren't light travelers in that regard). There were only a couple of very minor things that kind of irritated us a bit. They almost don't bear mentioning, but I feel like this should be a balanced review. First, there are no ice machines on any floor of the hotel so you always have to call down and ask for a bucket of ice to be sent up. They always do so very promptly and with a smile, but it can make one feel like a bother when it's late at night or if you've had to ask for a couple of them already during the same day due to the previous ones melting. I tipped each time to alleviate my guilt and the porter usually always seemed surprised and grateful. Second, some sites show that the hotel has DVD players available for loan to you in your room and that is not the case now that they offer movies for sale on the in-room TV entertainment system. We just went to one of the multitude of small electronics stores scattered throughout the city and bought a cheap one to use, but it would've been nice to know that they weren't available prior to arriving so we could have brought one from home or made the purchase before getting to the hotel. Really those two very minor issues were the only negatives that I could find during our stay. Obviously the many positives far outweigh either of them. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to New York who desires quality accomodations in a central location operated by truly one of the best staffs I've encountered on my many trips domestically or abroad.	
Sep 30 2008	Loved Hotel Chandler	We just got back from 5 nights at Hotel Chandler and our stay could not have been better. We arrived on a Sunday morning at 7:00 after taking the red eye from San Francisco and was greeted by a great front desk staff. We were able to have our bags held and our valuables locked up for safekeeping while we started sightseeing and enjoying Manhatten. The service was fantastic from everyone we encountered throughout our stay. The bar was a great place to start and end our evenings and the computer in the library was a great thing as well. We will definitely return to Hotel Chandler since the room was lovely and it was such a great location in Murray Hill. Hats off to the management and staff for making our stay so enjoyable!!	
Sep 28 2008	Loved the room	Booked here at short notice because the price was right (for NYC). Very impressed with the quality of the room - which was a mini-suite.Will stay there next time.	
Sep 2 2008 	What a gem!	My teenage daughter &amp; I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August, and it was great! This was my fifth trip to NYC, and Hotel Chandler is my favourite hotel so far (previously stayed at Hotel Edison, Vincci Avalon, Eastgate Tower, and Park South Hotel).We had a queen room and, although it was smaller than some of my previous hotels, it was very well equipped, very clean and comfortable. There was a good sized wardrobe/drawers, a foldaway iron/board, desk/chair, table/chair, large flatscreen tv, ipod dock/radio/clock. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was average in size but spotlessly clean and stocked with wonderful Aveda toiletries. As I'm a light sleeper, I had requested a quiet room i.e. not overlooking the street, and we were given one overlooking a courtyard. It wasn't a pretty sight, but at least I wasn't going to be disturbed by tooting horns, sirens etc.The reception staff and doormen were all extremely pleasant (have found some a bit scary at previous hotels!). There was free use of pc in the library and best of all imo (I'm a tea addict), complimentary tea/coffee 24hrs a day. Plus a complimentary glass of wine in the bar Mon-Thurs between 7pm-8pm.The location is fantastic, close to Macy's, ESB, restaurants and various subway lines which take you all over the city.There was nothing I didn't like about my stay (apart from some noisy neighbours in the corridor at night but that's not the hotel's fault), and I would definitely recommend a stay there. I also managed to get a really good discounted rate by booking through Quikbook approx 2 months in advance.All in all, a very relaxing atmosphere and highly recommended!	
Aug 31 2008 	Excellent hotel great stay	The Hotel Chandler was my base for a couple of nights stay in New York for site seeing. Overall the stay was excellent, the staff where very good and facilities excellent.My room was a king room which had a large 6 foot bed, flat screen TV and nice big bathroom. The room was no large however considering this was a New York hotel was still a good size. The room quality was very high standard and I felt very comfortable in the room.The location of the hotel was very good for site seeing, a short walk to the empire state building and a 20 minute or so walk to time square.The staff at the hotel where very helpful and more than happy to help me plan my trips around New York.I would recommend this hotel to everyone.	
Aug 24 2008 	Loved the customer service	I selected this hotel after reading reviews from other customers.I was not disappointed as hotel and the service from the hotel staff was very excellentThere is a local diner called Tasty's which is round the corenr from the hotel and there is an excellent Thai restuarant opposite the hotel called Thai George. The only critising would be updating the bathroom in the room.The free tea and coffee was very handy in the evenings.	
Aug 20 2008 	Great hotel	Stayed here as part of our honeymoon and would totally recommend it. Plus points- the rooms are excellent and fairly spacious (in new york terms!). Our room was in amazing condition (plasma tv, ipod dock and speakers, everything spotless and new, etc...). The shower was massive but at the expense of the rest of the bathroom which was a bit cramped but that didn't matter at all;- the staff are really helpful and friendly. Our flight out of JFK was at 530am and they were great at checking us out and organising a taxi, even at that time;- its in a great location and is really central;- the bar next door to it is good too.Negatives - none!	
Aug 18 2008 	Loved Hotel Chandler	Stayed at the Hotel Chandler for 5 nights - 21-26 May 2008. No problems with check in even though it was 4 am! Room very clean, quite small, but big wardrobe and big bathroom (with beautiful Aveda toiletries!). Bed very comfortable. Location was fantastic - in a quieter area (which we wanted, not the hustle &amp; bustle like Times Square!), but close to lots of attractions.Staff very pleasant. Doormen gave us some tips on places to eat and a cool Irish Bar. The use of the computer &amp; internet in the lounge was great, and I had a cup of tea most nights from the lounge, which was complimentary.Loved New York and would definitely stay at Hotel Chandler again.	
Aug 15 2008 	Great price good location	Our company pushes this hotel since it is a very reasonably priced Manhattan hotel and to my surprise it is terrific. The hotel has nearly brand new appointments with flat panel tv's, king sized beds, alarm clocks with iPod connection, etc. Staff are nice enough, especially by NYC standards.It's not located in Times Square but what you sacrifice in location you'll appreciate in your wallet. I've stayed at other properities in NYC (Grand Hyatt, Doubletree on Lexington) and the rooms here are just as nice and you don't feel like you were taken to the cleaners in the process.	
Jul 30 2008 	Amazing	I just returned from my trip to NYC with a friend and our mothers. The hotel was amazing, very beautiful! The people who work at the front desk were very polite and helpful. To be honest the whole staff was.. The doormen were extremly helpful with everything and very very polite. They helped us to get taxis, and basically anything else we had asked or we didnt ask for but they thought would be nice. They were a very nice bunch of boys. I honestly did not want to leave and they made the experience alot more fun. I wish I could have gotten to know them alittle better and to be able to stay in contact with them. All in all the hotel was beautiful way more then I expected, perfect location for everything.	
Jul 28 2008 	Loved the Hotel Chandler	My daughter and I just returned from a weekend in NYC where we stayed at the Hotel Chandler. I was unsure of what to expect from this hotel, but was truly pleasantly surprised. Our room was upgraded to a king and was very clean and well maintained. The location was excellent and the staff was very pleasant and helpful. We were able to walk to all of the attractions in midtown Manhattan from this hotel. We had a terrific weekend and would certainly return to and recommend the Hotel Chandler.	
Jul 28 2008 	Perfect Hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Chandler from July 22nd-July 26th. The hotel was great. Great location in Manhattan for us. We were able to walk almost anywhere we wanted to go. We really liked the hotel for the location. A couple minutes to the Empire State building, and about a 5 minute walk to Macy's. Great locations around the hotel for breakfast too. Check out Caprice on 5th Avenue for breakfast. Yummy. The room was smaller than what we have been used to, but we were only in it to sleep and shower. It was nicely decorated, and very quiet. The hotel is a little worn around the edges, but overall really nice. The staff were very nice and very helpful as well. I would definitely stay again at the Chandler.	
Jul 25 2008 	Not so fond of Hotel Chandler	I travel frequently for work and am in NYC at least once a month. I recently stayed at Hotel Chandler because my client had special rates there.The staff was very nice --I'll give them points for customer service.The MAJOR dilemma with this hotel was the bathroom. I kid you not, when I say that I could not get into the shower. I'm not a large person (5'4, 125lbs) and the opening between the glass shower door and the toilet was less than 5 inches. The door literally HITS the toilet and you have to climb OVER the toilet to get in. I spent 20 minutes trying to get in to take a shower after an all-day flight and was beyond frustrated. I can't imagine what would have happened if I was larger, or not as flexible.When I did finally wedge myself in, I noticed that the shower head is smack dab in the middle of the shower--so you have to reach past it to turn on the water and are inevitably shocked by either HOT water, or FREEZING cold water. Also, there were no shelves or places to put shampoo or soap! I had to set my bar of soap on the tiles and the water pooled all around it (because the drain doesnt work well).**on my 2nd day staying at this hotel, I had to have mainenance come in and fix the shower door so that it opened in. They had to use brute force to push the door INTO the shower. I thought the glass would break.The bed was decent. Room service menu left MUCH to be desired. They did nice turn-down servicebut my door didnt lock from within and it was flimsy. I had a room right next to the elevator and I could hear the ding of the bell each and every time someone stopped on my floor. I could also see the bright hall lights because my door ended an inch or two above the carpet.All in all, I have stayed at MUCH better boutique hotels. This one is NOT worth it.	
Jul 14 2008 	Loved The Hotel Chandler	We stayed at the Hotel Chandler this past weekend, July 12th &amp; 13th 2008. From the time we arrived everything was better than expected. We received a very warm welcome from the front desk and even received an upgrade to a Deluxe Queen. The room furnishings were very nice and the bedding extra comfortable. The bathroom was surprisingly large and nicely outfitted. The staff was every bit as helpful as they could possibly be. We were on a tight schedule and they assisted with information about the theatre we were heading to. The weekend was extra special thanks to our experience at The Hotel Chandler. We will definitely be staying here again in the near future.	
Jul 13 2008 	Have stayed at this hotel twice in a year!	I've just returned back to the UK from NYC I stayed at Hotel Chandler in April 2007 and returned this week as a birthday present for my partner. He was equally impressed with the hotel. The hotel and service is fantastic, such a nice hotel to stay at, the hotel is quiet, which is just what you need when you return from a busy day of sightseeing round Manhatten. Excellent location too, just two blocks from Empire State Building. Would definately stay there again.	
Jul 9 2008 	Very very nice	Very nice hotel in the very centre of Manhattan. The rooms are cozy and clean and the staff was really nice and very very helpful. We didn't eat at the hotel but enjoyed the other facilities such as the library (with internet access), the fitness room and the free coffee not the least. This is definately a place I would like to return to.	
Jul 8 2008 	Very pleasant visit	Stayed at the Chandler Hotel for one night (July 4th). Very convenient if arriving by train - less than two blocks from Penn.Arrived before check-in, so went to get a cup of coffee. Upon returning, it was still before check-in (perhaps 2:30) but was told my room was already available, and had been upgraded to king at no charge. Room was on the small side (expected - it's NYC) but clean, bright &amp; well-furnished. Bathroom clean &amp; modern. I was pleasantly surprised by the free lobby computer &amp; fitness center. Location is great - mid-town, close to plenty of attractions. Entire staff was very helpful &amp; very nice. Upon returning to our room later that evening, we found the bed straightened &amp; the next day's weather forecast.Will definitely stay again	
Jul 7 2008 	Good NYC bolthole	We stayed in this hotel overnight when spending a couple of days in New York. It is situated moments from the Empire State Building and is very convenient for sightseeing in the city.First impressions were positive, the staff at reception checked us in early and took our bag for storage. We were then invited to have a complimentary tea or coffee in the lounge. Whilst there (although our room did not include breakfast) we saw the continental breakfast on offer and while perfectly adequate, I would recommend any fellow tourists who appreciate great food walk two blocks or so to Penelope's cafe - a truly delightful place which serves breakfasts to die for - 30th and Lexington if you're interested.When we returned much later in the day we picked up our room key and bag and headed upstairs. Although the room was small, it was ideal for a one or two night city break, and the bathroom had been recently refurbished. It was very small with no bath, but the walk in shower (which took up the space the bath would have filled) was ideal for the space. The bathroom fit out was great, very modern and pristine.The bed was big and very comfortable, and the room was well equipped with hairdryer and ironing board and iron. The only blip was when I was ironing my dress for the evening, the smoke alarm went off - the plug just beside the ironing board storage cupboard was placed such that the obvious place to iron was right under the fire alarm! The staff sorted it out promptly and the issue was quickly resolved. When dealing with limited space, this is bound to occur.All in all a good place to stay, the lobby is a little dark and gloomy but that is more to do with the location than anything else. Also, the music played in reception was a little lively when we returned at 3am - more like coming in to a nightclub than a hotel - perhaps we are turning into oldies but something more chilled would have been welcome!	
Jul 5 2008 	Lovely room good location	I stayed at the Hotel Chandler on a birthday trip with my husband in April. We found the location of the hotel very convenient - it's just off 5th Avenue, which makes it easy to find, and is within walking distance of many attractions. The street itself is a bit dingy, and there is a gap site opposite the hotel, but it felt perfectly safe. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. I particularly liked the room, which was very comfortable with stylish decor, a big flat screen tv. It was well lit, with good quality linens and plenty of storage space. Lovely shower room with a very powerful shower (which did get the floor very wet) and great Aveda toiletries. Certainly not a lot of space, but we didn't find it to be too small for our purposes. There's free coffee in the lobby. We didn't try the breakfast, but had more fun going out - would recommend Pax for breakfast, a couple of blocks away, but really good and cheap.Our only complaint was that we had booked a deluxe room through expedia. These rooms are larger and have bay windows. We were put into a small room, with no bay, and when my husband raised it at reception, they told us that we had got what we paid for, and there were just different room layouts. They had checked us in early, so we thought that may have been the reason, but they appeared not to have anything suitable available that day. They did offer to move us the next day, which would have meant repacking our suitcases. On a short trip, I didn't really want the hassle. So we stayed, and I did like the room, but as other reviewers have pointed out, it was lacking in daylight and the window faced an opposing wall. I can only imagine that a bigger, brighter version would have been even better. When we returned home and checked Expedia's website we found that we clearly hadn't got what we paid for. We were given compensation (much more than the supplement we had paid) after one e-mail to Expedia - so 10 out of 10 for them! Despite this blip I would highly recommend the hotel, and the city. Can't wait to go back!!	
Jun 6 2008 	A great place to stay	Our stay at the Hotel Chandler could not have been better. At arrival, we were met by a staff that was extremely courteous and helpful. From the doorman to the people at the front desk, they went out of their way to help us with transporation and recommendations for dining and entertainment, Our room was very clean and was as spacious as any that you will get in the City. The location on 31st and 5th was centrally located to the 4/6 subway and walking distance to Times Square. We would love to stay there again.	
May 29 2008 	We loved the Hotel Chandler	From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, our time at the Hotel Chandler was wonderful. The accommodations were lovely, and the staff was friendly and attentive to our every need.I would definitely recommend staying here.	
May 25 2008	Great hotel good price good location	I stayed at this lovely hotel in late November 2007 with my Mum for five days of Christmas Shopping and sightseeing. The LocationIt was a fabulous location just off 5th Avenue and a very short stroll from the Empire State Building and I would say it was walking distance from a number of the sights such as the Flatiron Building, Radio City, Macy's, Central Station and the Rockefeller Centre. We even walked to Central Park on one of the days in less than half an hour and Times Square in around 15 minutes. Alternatively there are a number of subway stops within a short walk.The RoomThe room was a reasonable size by New York standards; there was a large LCD TV on the wall, an amazingly comfortable bed, bath robes and a lovely bathroom with a power shower and large shower cubicle. There was plenty of storage for the length of our break and the decoration was subtle and modern. The toiletries were Aveda and replaced daily. We didn't have a good view or really a view at all but what does that matter when you wont be spending much time in your room.The Hotel ServicesThe reception staff were polite and helpful as were the bell boys. The room was cleaned and tidied daily. The only problem we experienced was an absence of hot water one morning (really not what you want in November), but the staff were very apologetic and the hot water was back on within an hour. The hotel bar was very quiet, if not empty, for the whole of our stay and is very small. The hotel restaurant only serves breakfast, which I cannot comment on as I never sampled it, however the hotel is very well located for a selection of restaurants for breakfast and dinner. There is a reasonable sized lift to all floors so moving baggage and heavy shopping bags up to your room is not a problem. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and had an amazing break here.	
May 21 2008 	Excellent Hotel!!	I've been to New York on March 2008 for four nights. The Hotel Chandler was like a pearl in New York. It was beautifully decorated and equipped and the staff were so helpful and professional. Our room was great very clean and comfortable. The room was a little small but perfet for everyone, lcd tv, mp3radio, alarm clock, safety box, refrigerator. The bathroom have a lot of accessory target Aveda and all linens are italian Frette, the shower was simply fantastic. The bed was very confortable after long walks. The location was perfect too near the subway and 2 blocks from the Empire State Building.The Hotel offers you all day coffee, tea, milk and fruits. The breakfast costs 16$ but outside there was a lot of shops. I think that if I will go in New York next time my choice will be Hotel Chandler.Monica	
May 20 2008 	Hotel Chandler a must!!!	My friend and I were extremely thrilled with this hotel! The people who worked there were super nice, the room was beautiful, the Aveda bath products were great and the location was fabulous! We were able to walk to many places and the subway was very close if we needed to travel any great distance. Overall, our experience was fabulous!! You must stay here if you want to be treated very, very well!!	
May 16 2008	Hotel Chandler - the jewel in New York's crown	I've been to New York twice before and I have to say that I've been disappointed with the hotels I've stayed in. However, this time I stayed in the Hotel Chandler and was amazed at this real jewel in New York. It was beautifully decorated and equipped and the staff were so helpful and professional and yet really friendly too. Our room was great - really clean and comfortable. The bed had fantastic linen and amazingly there were more than enough pillows! The location was perfect too. I will DEFINITELY stay in the Hotel Chandler when I go to New York in the near future. Sharon Weigall	
May 13 2008 	Good find	This is my third visit to New York and The Chandler Hotel has been the best hotel i've stayed in so far for the money we paid. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was small but very clean. I was worried that it may be too far away from all the main sights but we were only 2 blocks from the Empire State building and Macys and the red tour bus picks you up outside Macys. It was quite nice to be away from all the hustle and bustle.2 great places for breakfast nearby are Penelopes (30th and Lexington Ave) and Guy &amp; Callard cafe (31st and Park Ave South) although we did have breakfast in the Hotel once which was pleasant. I would stay here again.	
May 11 2008	Room quite modern - location ok	We arrived on a not particulary busy Sunday afternoon and felt a little bit dubious about the location of the hotel since it is down a dark unattractive street. Since the area was quiet it made it feel worse. The following days when things were busier it didnt feel as bad.When we arrived at about 1pm we were told we couldnt check in until 3pm but they had taken our details When we returned later the first room given to us was at the front of the hotel overlooking a building site on a low floor and was very dark.We complained but were initially told they didnt have anything better but after standing there a little longer they found another room on the 8th floor at the back which was much better. The room was fine although why they didnt put the flat screen TV directly opposite the bed I dont know.We never ate breakfast at the hotel but went to GUY and GILLARD which is 2 blocks down after turning right out of the hotel. They served great breakfasts and even better evening meals.	
May 5 2008 	There's better hotels	This was the first time I've ever stayed at this particular hotel in NYC. There are way better hotels in the city. The hotel is dark and glim. My Queen size bed was actually 2 twin beds pushed together which left a crack in the middle so i couldn't even sleep in the middle. I would've been better off with a single bed and not payed for the Queen size. When i asked the front desk what's good on their menu for room service, they said they weren't sure (I should've seen that as a bad sign). They said the hamburgers smell good when they cook them, so that's what i got. After I took 1 bite of it, the patty actually bled onto the plate. This burger wasn't cooked medium, it hardly was cooked at all. The same goes for the french fries that came with it. The bellmen don't actively try to get you a cab either.	
Apr 28 2008	Loved the Hotel Chandler	Our room was quiet and comfortable. Beds and pillows were perfect. Bathroom didn't have bath but super large shower. Towels were luxurious. Loved the Aveda products. Staff were super-friendly! We went to the 12/31 bar for our free glass of red wine. Excellent wine. Great atmosphere. Had breakfast buffet first morning - excellent service and food. TV room comfy - thank god for free internet. Loved the bellman and front desk staff. Helpful. Great location, close to everything, subway, Empire State Building, Sex Musuem and Macy's. Try the restaurant &quot;Bella Napoli&quot; around the corner, it's excellent!	
Apr 28 2008	april 17th 08 visit	Fantastic Hotel. Superbly furnished rooms.Bar area far too small. They might as well not bother with it.	
Apr 24 2008 	Excellent Location Friendly Staff	I stayed at Hotel Chandler with my sister. The location was fantastic, very close to the Empire State Building and a couple of blocks from Macy's but the street was nice and quiet. There was a subway nearby to take us to fifth avenue and we were a short taxi ride away from Broadway. The hotel was clean (although our room did smell of smoke a little) and very modern. The staff couldn't have been more helpful.I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would happily recommend it to anyone.	
Apr 16 2008 	Perfect NY Hotel	I can't say enough about this gem of a hotel. Small but luxurious rooms with top-of-the-line linens, Aveda products, and comfy beds. The staff couldn't have been nicer. They were so great to us from check in to check out. Great location, literally around the corner from the Empire State Building. Lots of great little restaurants and shops nearby and a quick walk pretty much anywhere. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone I know!	
Apr 15 2008 	Great little hotel in NYC	My husband and I along with another couple stayed at this lovey hotel over the weekend of March 29th and may I say it was wonderful. Not to mention that we had an outstanding rate of $180/night through Quikbook.com.Fantastic service and friendly staff. Rooms are small but I have had smaller at the Hudson for a lot more money.Rooms were clean, comfortable and well appointed. Lovely bathrooms with courtesy terrycloth robes. I REALLY enjoyed the stay and will return. If you can....try it!Diane from Philadelphia	
Apr 5 2008 	Great hotel for the price !	We stayed at the Chandler for my girlfriends birthday in March, it was great we loved it. We even got a free upgrade to our room free of charge, as they saw it was her birthday. The staff were great really friendly. Only a couple of small niggles, the room was well away from the lifts but we found that the door to the room was not well sound proofed, we could easily here peoples conversations as they let themselves into their rooms, so I would imagine that if you were near the lifts there would be so much more noise to contend with. Also our room face onto a brick wall so there was not much natural light let into the room. Apart from that the bathroom was clean and nicely decorated and although as with all hotels in New York the room was slightly small it was very luxurious, nice big TV and plenty of storage for your cloths. The bed was lovely and comfortable. We found the location which is mid town was ideal for the shopping, its just round the corner from Macy's and of course the Empire State, the subway way a couple of blocks away as was the 2nd Av deli ( highly recommend) For the price I would recommend this hotel.	
Apr 1 2008 	3 stars except for bed bugs!	I definitely have high standards when checking into a hotel, and my first take was that Hotel Chandler was decent for what I (my company) paid. Nice decor, and seemingly clean. It is very small, with cramped rooms and bathrooms, but that's expected in NYC. The bed was pretty uncomfortable, as were the pillows, and the tv/cable channels offered were few. My main problem was waking up with BUG bites on my back (5)! I'm pretty sure they were bed bugs, so I changed rooms. I only got 2 more bites for the 4 remaining nights there, but the first room I stayed in was definitely infested. If they could get this under control, it would be much more satisfactory, but I still probably wouldn't stay here due to the uncomfortable beds.	
Apr 1 2008 	Great but be careful which room you get!	We just stayed at the Chandler for a week (my mother and I for a holiday) and it was much as most of the previous reviews have stated. The rooms are small, but perfectly workable, and very luxurious - lovely Aveda toiletries replenished every day, spotless and clean throughout the whole building, big flatscreen TV on the wall across from the bed, IPOD dock, the works. The doormen and maids are all very friendly and helpful, as were most of the reception staff in our experience. (Though we arrived at 1.30pm, following a long flight, and be warned, we were NOT allowed to check in early and thus circled the area for a couple of hours until check in time! - they did store our bags though) Free internet access at the back of the bar, there was a gym and sauna sign just off reception though we didn't use it, free tea and coffee all day and a buffet breakfast (not part of the deal) if you want it.All in all a lovely wee hotel - close to subway stations and train station a couple of blocks away, and the guys on the door are tripping over themselves to help you or hail you a cab etc - only two negative points though, one pretty major in my opinion - a very significant proportion of the rooms in this hotel face onto a brick wall. That's it, a brick wall - our room was such, and therefore we got NO natural light into our room and would never have known the morning had come, or what kind of day it was, from looking out the window! It does not make your room a pleasant place to be for long periods, which may well be fine for a lot of folk. However, my advice would be, given that some rooms have a decent view, and some even of the Empire State, check what room you're getting before you arrive, cause it was full when we were there so they couldn't have upgraded us even if they wanted to.We also had a problem with the room service on the first day, we ordered a breakfast to our room and it arrived 45 minutes late and pretty cold. They said there was a problem with the cooker, but everyone downstairs was having hot breakfast when we went down! Other than these two points though, a generally good experience. Just make sure you get a decent view, and don't order breakfast to your room!	
Mar 20 2008 	Generally good	Excellent location, comfortable (but small) rooms and helpful staff. There was no gym that we could see though, despite it being advertised. I would stay there again, although it was too expensive to book two single rooms instead of a twin which was very disappointing. It was also very difficult to pay for anything by credit card in the bar - the staff insisted on putting everything on our room bill, even though we requested otherwise. They didnt seem to have faclities for taking a credit card separately. Other than that, the hotel was quiet despite being in a very central location. I would recommend asking for a room away from the lift though, as the &quot;bing&quot; noise went on day and night.	
Mar 7 2008	Great hotel	I stayed for two nights in January on the recommendation of a friend and it was great.Really friendly helpful staff - I was able to check in really early and get into my room before lunch. The room was really clean and there was an ipod dock and great flatscreen tv and movies. The location was good too. I'd happily go back and I'd recommend it.	
Mar 1 2008 	Rude manager	We stayed at this hotel in mid-January and while we found the rooms to be nice the manager was any thing but nice. To check in took us over an hour and a lot of attitude. We asked if we could get two double beds and were told because of the rate we got we couldn't without paying an additional fee. We then contacted Travelocity who contacted the hotel but the manager refused to give us the room even tough they weren't full. We ended up rebooking through Travelocity to get the room we wanted. The manager couldn't of been ruder. There are so many good hotels in NYC I wouldn't return to this hotel.	
Feb 27 2008	I wish I could move in!!	We loved our room! It was sooo cute, comfortable, and clean! The room and hotel was much better than I expected considering the low price and last minute reservation. We even got an upgrade to a deluxe king room with a view of the street and a late check out for free. The room wasn't big by any means, but the bathroom was very spacious. The flat screen tv and ipod dock was a nice touch too! The staff was also very helpful and gave personalized attention. We've stayed at chain hotels two and three times as expensive in nyc- yet this is one of my favorites. I will definitely be returning!	
Feb 26 2008 	KCoupletoNYC	We travel to NYC 4 to 5 times a year and finally have found our hotel we will ALWAYS return to. Rooms are small but very comfortable, attractive, clean, wonderful beds and linens, top of the line bath soaps, shampoos, huge towels.. etc. Rooms are quite,..service is fantastic...Doormen, desk clerks, servers remember your name. Comfortable, attractive lounge for meetings and relaxing while sipping tea and coffee served free 24 hours a day....wonderful during the winter months to have such a service. The Chandler is a small hotel in the middle of a huge city where you feel welcomed and are treated special. Easy access to shopping, Time Square, taxi's and many restaurants just steps away from the front door. Don't miss the little bar just inside the front door and visiting with the beautiful bartender where you can taste new specilty created drinks ever night.... Our last visit was a Christmas and The Chandler was by far the best bargain...check it out, This place is a winner!!! Can't wait to return!	
Feb 19 2008	Great place to stay	We stayed at the Hotel Chandler in Murray Hill New York in early December. The hotel was excellent, there was tea, coffee and other drinks free 24 hours a day. The room was good and Aveda toiletries was a bonus. There was a large plasma tv in the room. The hotel is near to the Empire State Building and Macy's, there was a bit of a walk to Times Square and Broadway, but that is what New York is about seeing things on foot. One of the best things was how quite it was at night. I would recommend this hotel and would go there again if I am lucky enough to visit New York again.	
Feb 19 2008 	Nice hotel with great personel	We stayed over on February 16th and had a very nice stay. Located in the perfect location to do everything possible. We plan on staying again. Personel was informative and the room was very nice. You will not be disappointed with your stay here.	
Jan 14 2008 	perfect and good value	This is the perfect midtown good value mid budget option. Excellent location near to flat iron building. View of empire state building from bed at no extra cost. Great comfy room, aveda products, lovely touches like chocolates and next day weather forecast on turn down.Free internet, coffee n tea, cookies, fruit in foyer. Nicest staffed foyer too. Front desk beyond friendly, any enquiry about local restaurants events etc would be met immediately with internet print outs and maps.This hotel is totally recommended without a doubt	
Jan 14 2008	Hotel Chandler was great	Our first visit to New York and we couldn't have wished for a better hotel. The room was clean and tidy, the bed was comfy especially after a day of site seeing. There was a safe in the room which we found extremely useful. Free tea, coffee and hot chocolate and access to the internet in the lobby when you needed it. Room was a bit on the small side however it was a base for bits and pieces and a bed to sleep in. Good size TV and also an ipod docking station. Recommend the hotel to anyone and we will be staying there again next time we visit.All staff were incredibly friendly and always happy to help when you needed it.	
Jan 3 2008 	Very nice!	My fiancee and I stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate our engagement in NYC. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this little hotel. The room was very clean and well appointed. The fiancee loved the soaps, linens, robes, etc. The ipod doc in the room was a nice touch as well. Hotel was very convenient for everything we wanted to do and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. Only problem I had was when leaving the hotel the door guy/valet wouldn't get me a cab. He tried for about 3 seconds and then advised me to head down the street (with all my bags, etc). Kind of annoying as the guy the night before had no problem running down the street to get one for us. I may not look like I have a lot of money, but I know how to tip so it was his loss.	
Dec 30 2007 	Perfect Hotel just off 5th Ave	We stayed in the Hotel Chandler in December 2007 and found the hotel to be in the perfect location. It was near to all the amazing places NYC has to offer but far enough away to keep the noise levels to a minimum. The rooms were small but there was plenty of room to leave all the shopping bags and we never felt we didnt have enough room. The most important thing to us in cleanliness and this hotel is spot on for being clean, the maids came in every day and changed the bed and cleaned the bathroom. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good base and a clean and friendly hotel, when we return to New York in 2008 we will most certainly use this hotel again	
Dec 29 2007 	Great little hotel	This a great hotel in a great location. The rooms are clean,tidy and are a standard size for any major city in the world. The bar &amp; bar staff are welcoming and it was a great place to relax after a long day visiting all the amazing places that New York has to offer. I have recommended this hotel to my family,friends &amp; work mates. We will be definitely be coming back to this hotel!	
Dec 24 2007	A Small Room for a Big Price	I have been to New York many times, but have to report this as one of the most disappointing of hotels. OK location just round the corner from the Empire State Building and a stones throw from Macey's, however the rooms in this hotel are tiny and for the price, simply not worth it, you can find better. Two wardrobes are packed into a miniscule bedroom, one of which is impossible to open due to its location facing the side of other wardrobe and right next to the bed. It's a no frills room, not even a coffee/tea maker in site.As for the view, well put it this way we didn't open our curtains for 4 days as our view faced a brick wall, so there was no natural daylight to speak off.Oh yes and the incentive they advertise of the wine and cheese party...........don't be tempted!&quot;cheese, we don't offer cheese&quot; was the announcement upon enquiry at reception. Wine consisted of one small glass, yes just the one was allowed by the stiff bar lady.....some party this was turning out to be! If you are staying for one night, then its fine, but for UK visitors on a break, it's hardly a sumptuous hotel for you to relax after a hard days shopping.....there's better value for money.	
Dec 24 2007 	Don't let the lobby put you off...	Finding good hotels in New York can be a bit of a mine-field, especially if you want to steer clear of the big chains. Arriving at the Hotel Chandler quite late on a Thursday evening, and wandering into reception, I must admit that my heart sank a little. It's not that it was untidy or that I was stepping over wino's to get to the desk, more that the whole space seemed a little 'tired'.The staff were courteous and we were quickly on our way up to the room, which was very good. Unless you want to pay through the nose, finding a hotel room with a bit of space in New York is not easy, but the room we had was well laid out and surprisingly spacious. Although the view wasn't so great.We didn't eat at the hotel, but with New York to explore, that's not really surprising. We left the hotel to stay with friends for a few days, when I realised that I have left a couple of shirts behind. Though it was difficult to speak to anyone on the weekend that could help, when i retrned to the hotel, the shirts had been picked up by housekeeping was were ready for me to collect.I would definitely stay again.	
Dec 7 2007	Yes we will definitely be back......	After reading some of the reviews i was a little nervous about staying at the Hotel Chandler (business trip and it was booked for us). However what a nice surprise!!!! A great hotel in a great location. We would not hesitate to stay there again. We had a deluxe king room on the 4th floor. It was very spacious, very clean, with a large walk in shower and Aveda toiletries. Actually the hotels website does not do it justice at all - it makes it look dated. Very comfortable bed with lovely linen and large soft white towels and bath robes. Staff were very friendly and willing to help out with anything. We did not eat in the hotel as we wanted to sample as many of the great restaurants as possible in New York. I cannot understand how anybody could complain about Hotel Chandlers location - you are a short stroll from the Empire State Building and Macys, not to mention the subway and loads of restaurants. All in all great value for money (for New York!!!), helped by the fact that it is a boutique hotel and not a chain. Yes we will definitely be back......	
Dec 5 2007 	Clean and modern	Stayed for four nights from the 29th Nov until the 3rd Dec. Very well situated, rooms clean esp bathrooms. Free tea and coffee available all day and a free New York Times delivered to your door every morning are a nice touch.Staff helpful.Would recommend this hotel.	
Dec 2 2007 	Great Hotel	Thought the location was excellent, practically underneath The Empire State Building. Plenty of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Rooms were clean, warm and comfortable. LOVED the art-deco bathroom. Helpful, friendly staff. An oasis in the middle of a briiliant city.	
Nov 27 2007 	Fantastic Stay	My son, mother and I stayed here from 21st to 26th November and we had a fantastic time. My daughter was asked to sing with her Choir at the Carnegie Hall. 44 children and 10 Chaperones from Scotland went to New York. They stayed at a much larger hotel but we chose to stay at the luxury boutique hotel, Hotel Chandler. I was encouraged to read many good reports on tripadviser prior to going. Once I had booked, I e-mailed the hotel with a few preferences to see if they could accomodate. They replied promptly and made reference to my e-mail upon check-in even though it had been several months since I sent it. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and everyone went out of their way to be helpful and ensure we enjoyed our stay.As for the location, it is excellent with the Empire State Building practically on your doorstep.The rooms were exceptionally clean and tidy. The comments about the size of the rooms is true but we found them more than adequate for the amount of time we spent in our room. They are also very modern with up to date movies available and ipod docking stations.Overall we had a brilliant stay at this hotel and I would highly recommend anyone wanting to visit NYC to stay here. Thank you to all at Hotel Chandler for a great stay - and my daughter was a star at the Carnegie Hall!	
Nov 13 2007 	Very good!!	A very good hotel, perfect service, the frondesk helped us vi everything from good locations to restaurans.The only thing that surpriced me was the lobby it dont representing the hotel, its to simple, the rooms have higher standard then the lobby,(normally its the opposite nice lobby and not so good rooms)Room almost 5 starCleaning 5 starFrontdest service 5 starLobby entrance 3 starLocation 4 starAbout the location, its nothing wrong with thea area, but its a &quot;little dead area&quot;. If you like walking, you can walk to centralpark and soho. its in the middle.	
Nov 12 2007	Outstanding hotel	Very clean comfortable pleasant hotel. Nice rooms, beds changed daily, evening time turn down on the beds is a great touch, nice but small bathroom, big powerful shower always hot. LCD tv on the wall is good. free coffee and drinks all day, great friendly staff very helpful with information about New York. just around the corner from the Empire state go early before 9am and beat the Q's. Value for money was outstanding. Stay again YES. EXCELLENT. Richard Elaine (UK). 2nd time in New York.	
Oct 30 2007 	a top class hotel in a perfect location. Michelle from Nuneaton	i have just returned from a 4 night stay at the chandler with my partner. The hotel was beautifully decorated and the staff were very pleasant, polite and helpful. The beds were changed daily and the rooms were small but very comfortable. We were less than a 5 minute walk from the empire state building and about a 10 minute walk from times square so the location was quiet but close enough to all major places and attractions. If i ever have the opportunity to visit New York again i'd definately return to the Chandler for the duration of my stay. A priceless gem in the middle of a huge city!!!	
Oct 21 2007 	Not really a boutique hotel	The hotel is well located, and in fact I believe that this is what you pay for it 300 $/night. I haven´t been in other NY hotels but I think the price/quality relation is not very good.- The room is tiny, old fashion decorated and with carpet. - The bathroom is small as well, the shower was a bit decrepit, and there is no space to leave the toiletries.- On the other hand, the bed was good itself and the plasma TV is fine.	
Oct 21 2007 	Loved the Chandler	Hotel was in a great location. The room was small, but very clean and comfortable. The bed and linens were very comfortable - the bathroom was great. Room was quiet. Overall a great place.	
Oct 18 2007 	Lovely Comfortable Hotel: Good Location	My husband &amp; I stayed for 4 nights during september. We were travelling from Australia and were quite shocked by the prices upon looking for a 'decent' hotel in New York City. I expected any room to be 'compact' in NYC, but was more worried about cleanliness and security. I found Hotel Chandler through Trip Advisor and ended up booking on the Hotel website, despite the couple of reviews that described it as being 'out of the way'. We paid $300/night plus taxes for a queen room. Lots of $$$, but it really was a lovely hotel. Yes, the room was small, but the quality made up for it. A clean comfortable bed, chic furnishings, wall mounted plasma TV, queit air-con, and clean bathroom with toiletries. The only thing it was missing was a bar fridge that you could keep your own stuff in. It had one of those mini bar fridges filled with stuff - but no good for anything else. The location was great for us. We did the usual sightseeing things: Empire State Building (2 blocks), Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Central Park, World Trade Centre Site. The really great thing we found was that quite a few of the Hop-On-Hop-Off buses ran &amp; had stops outside of the Empire State Building. So we were able to buy tickets from a sales guy on the street and jump on right near the hotel/empire state building. Also, the subway is close by - maybe 4 blocks?? at Madison Square. We walked around near the hotel quite alot at night, and always felt quite safe. I would head 'uptown' from 31st street however, especially at night. Downtown from 31st seemed a bit dead at night, so makes you feel a little uneasy, but we had no problems. Overall, we thought this hotel was great. Sure, it was still expensive (for an Aussie anyway!) but it was great and I wouldn't hesitate in staying there again.	
Sep 28 2007	Good central location; good service...narrow rooms	I stayed between September 17th thru 24th. Since the pourpose of trip was tourism, the Hotel is very well located, 31st St with 5th AV very close to the Empire State Building.Reception desk staff is professional and kind and it can be applied to the rest of personnel. You have the prompt feeling of being wellcome.The main problems of this Hotel are in relationship with room dimensions and furnishings. Since the front of the building measures no more than 30 yds, only a limited number of rooms per floor are externals. The room I ocupied was inside with views to an ugly courtyard. At least, the room was reasonably quiet.Since the narrow room dimensions, there's no enough furniture - drawers and/ or shelfs - to set your baggage and possessions,thus forcing you an acutely precise placing.Bed is very confortable and room service is excellent.Since I didn't utilize during my stay, I can't give an opinion about breakfast. Concluding: with a little wider room my rate would be 4* for sure and for that reason, I reccomend future guests to avoid to be booked in rooms numbered 30th: 830; 930; 1030; etc.	
Sep 27 2007 	First Time....Room Good.....Customer Service is bad!	This was my first time staying at the hotel and overall it was good. The room was small but it was clean. I had a room with double twin sized beds. It seemed awkward at first but I wasn't in my room enough to even care. The beds were extremely comfy. The showers had great pressure &amp; the hotel supplied robes &amp; overall I was good there.My only issue was some of my dealings with the staff. I checked in &amp; instead of using my credit card wanted to use cash. I was there on business travel &amp; my firm will pay me back immediately when I return if I use cash during my trips whereas, if I use my AMEX I have to wait almost 60 days for the actual bill to arrive and then for my firm to process it. It was like their attitude changed &amp; they made me leave a $200 deposit at the desk. When I asked the woman at the counter went on to give the me how many stars the hotel held &amp; how the room was equiped with things that &quot;IN CASE I TOOK THEM&quot; needed to be replaced. I wanted to remind her that they did have my AMEX on file from when I reserved it but I didnt bother. The second incident was when I'd gone out to dinner and returned around 10:00 to find 2 people from house keeping in my room. I have stayed in other hotels that give you turn down service but they make their presence known way before 10:00. It caught me off guard and I was a bit irritated because I hadn't secured any of my valuables. Nothing was missing but it still made me uncomfortable. The last incident was at the hotel's bar. I had gone down for a drink and the while waiting at the bar saw a woman on her cell phone sitting at one of the tables. After a 5 minute wait, she came over to take my order. Turns out she was the bartender. OK....I am not high maintenance and let it slide. She gets my drink and am enjoying it. She comes over and asks me if I wanted to order ALL OF MY DRINKS at once because she was about to close soon. WHAT THE HECK!! I politely paid for my drink &amp; hurried out to find another place that had better customer service.Overall, I would recommend this hotel. The morning staff was nice &amp; very helpful. But I think that some customer service is needed.	
Sep 22 2007 	Staff needs to be trained on customer service	This hotel ladies and gentlemen is a wanabe 4 star property. When I initially called the hotel to make reservations, I was put on hold and heard a lot about the hotel while on hold. Like thier 50 seat bistro, or the state of the art buisness center, both of which were coming in fall of 06. Mind you, I stayed here this month. Niether of those things exist. hmmmm. Well, I got there and the room was fine, if not a little small, but it was nice. Until, I was about to go to bed and mice came running out of the mini bar. When I told the front desk, the woman at the desk, Adrean, I think, was indifferent about it. She told me they were sold out and there was nothing they could do. OK. I'm from the city originally, and I've had worse in the apartment I used to live in but what bothered me was the absolute lack of guest service from the staff. My advice, stay somewhere else.	
Sep 13 2007 	OK with service issues	I checked in on September 4 and out on September 7. At the desk I requested a quiet room away from the elevators and not over the bar (I explained I was in town for business and quiet was key). Room 321 was a decent size for NY - I've stayed in larger, and I've stayed in smaller. It is really what you would expect for a NY hotel room. The room did not have an out facing window (looked over a dark alley - no sunlight), but I did ask for quiet and it certainly was. I should explain that I am from NY so basic street noise really does not bother me. I wanted to avoid neighboring room and bar noise and it was perfect for that.Here begins the problem. As the room was a bit stuffy I asked for a fan. The woman at the front desk, Tina, told me that the hotel does not have fans. When I told her I knew a previous guest of the hotel that had one, she told me should would check into it and call me. Of course, there was never a follow-up call. While unpacking, I decided to iron a few things. After a few minutes, the smoke detector went off and I could not get it to stop. I called the front desk and Tina said she would send maintenance up. The maintenance person came up (the detector had stopped at that point), and he thought he should change the battery regardless. I asked about the fan again and he told me to put on the AC and that he would check on the fan - that never happened either.Soon after the main. man left, the detector started beeping very loudly every sixty seconds (as it does when a battery needs to be replaced). I called down again, explained the situation, and the main. man came back up. He told me that the room was too hot and that I should leave the door open and let the ac kick in. I explained that it seemed like an old battery issue - he said no, it could not be. His other option was to take the detector out entirely and I told him that the NY Fire Department would not be very happy about that (and neither would I). The problem continued. I called Tina again who told me that the beeping was my fault as the room was too hot. She told me to give it a few more minutes to cool down. I gave it a few minutes and at 10:30 pm, after a very long flight, I really lost my cool (heehee, sorry for the pun). I went downstairs to the front desk and demanded that either they fix the problem immediately or I would need another room. I explained that the battery needed to be replaced and that they would have to check this - I would not accept no as an answer. She told me that the main. man was out buying me a fan (funny, because I never saw one and the fan never materialized).When the main. man resurfaced, he again insisted I was wrong about the battery. He came up to my room, replaced the battery, and wow - the problem was solved - no more loud beeping. This entire saga went out for about an hour and a half, and ended at 11:30 pm - ridiculous. Yes, the service at Hotel Chandler leaves a lot to be desired. I would like to make a reommendation to all front desk, hotel managers, and the like, that when a guest calls about a problem, that you should not reply, &quot;No problem.&quot; Clearly there is a problem and by saying, &quot;No problem,&quot; repeatedly, it does not solve the matter. In fact, it only angers the guest more. I find it interesting that the guest that commented just before me was given free breakfast for their eraly wake up call because I was offered nothing - not even an apology. I also find the comments about the bellpeople interesting because I did not see one during my entire stay (never needed one but just wondeing what the other guests were talking about). With all of this said, you really cannot expect much at this price range in NY. This is just about right for the money paid (just over $300.00 night). The room was decent at best, bed was comfortable, location very central, end of story.	
Sep 11 2007	Nice Quiet Boutique Hotel	This was a nice boutique hotel in Lower Midtown around the Murray Hill area. The staff was very nice and accomodating. Our alarm went off the first morning at 5:30 AM and when we complained to the desk, they gave us 2 free breakfast buffets. The breakfast included fresh fruits, coffee, orange juice, eggs, pancakes or french toast, bacon or sausage and other breakfast items. We decided to eat there the next morning also for $16.00 each.It was convenient and a bargain in NYC for a nice breakfast. They also have a small bar with Happy Hour prices. It is on a quiet side street two blocks or so from the Empire State building and Macy's. Not much else around there though. Not in the middle of all the action, but if you don't mind walking or taking a cab it is a pretty quiet hotel.No great views to the street but I liked that it was quiet.The rooms are small and the bathrooms don't have a lot of space for toiletries, but for the price it was a good choice for us. The bathrooms are nicely decorated and clean. You get toiletries, bathrobes and The New York Times each morning.	
Sep 10 2007 	London Lady	Brilliant Hotel. First time in New York and booked this hotel on the back of a few good reviews on this website. The hotel is quite small which is nice as it has a real family feel to it. The bellhop's are all extremely helpful. The reception staff were lovely and made us feel at home straight away. The room was a generous size for a New York Hotel and the bathroom was massive. The shower was amazing. Its in a fabulous location just off Fifth Avenue and one block from the Empire State Building. You have all the benefits of staying in the middle of Manhattan but as the hotel is on a little street, its very quiet at night. I read a few reviews about there not being tea or coffee facilities in the rooms which is true but there is free/coffee in the lobby all day long. The library is a nice addition and the free internet access is a real bonus. One tip, try the breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. The chef makes a brilliant cooked breakfast and it is well worth the $16.Would definately stay there when I go back .	
Sep 4 2007 	hated it	The room was cozy but small. Web site shows chairs in room but we had no chairs in our room. Staff was ok but it seemed like a bother when you asked a question. The third night we were sleeping and I heard a noise and my husband said it was the air conditioner blowing the blinds and I got out of bed and listened and it was coming from the desk. My husband got up and hit the censored snack tray and several mice ran out of the box. we called downstairs and they said they did not have any rooms my husband said we are not staying in this room. they had a room for us on the 12th floor that is for the staff we were told it was a full size bed but the next night they would put us in a regular room. so here we are at 130 in the morning going thru all our luggage to make sure no rodents got in. we go up to the 12 floor and it looked like it was straight out of a horror movie. It stunk of fish and the 1st room we seen the door was ajar with no handles. we go to our room and there was all glue on the floor we said no way my husband goes down with the bell hop and i try to lock the door but no locks are on the door and they wanted us to spend the night. Well luckily American airlines had seats open on the 645 am flight that morning(we went home 2 days early) we checked out of the hotel and they said we will waive what you took in the snack bar. we said what did we take and they said never mind and we said no what did we take and they said M&amp;M'S and we said it was the mice nibbling that moved the censor. We are originally from New York and this was the first time in a long time that we came back with out telling family so we could be on a mini vacation. We traveled all over the world and we never came across a hotel that had mice in our room	
Aug 30 2007 	Great Location.....Nice Rooms....But Noisy	Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel, the location was fantastic about a 2minute walk from the Empire State building, and various other attractions.......i read a few reviews on here about it being a little out of the way, i would have to disagree, it is 2 mins from ESB, 5 mins from Flatiron Building, about 10 mins from Crysler &amp; Rockerfellar Centre, 15 mins from Timesquare, and about a 20 min walk to Central Park...The rooms were small but very nice and the beds are really comfortable, the bathrooms are nice and the showers are great! The downsides to the Hotel was the amount of noise that came from the bathrooms, everytime someone flushed a toilet or had a shower (which people did at about 6.30am when we stayed there) we heard it and the noise would last for about 20 minutes, we were in room 332 and i don't know if it was just this room that got the majority of the noises but we struggled to get a decent nights sleep on a few of the nights due to the amount of noise coming from the tanks / pipes etc etc...our window also looked out onto a patch of land which was covered in garbage but we didnt expect a window with a view, this didnt bother us as if we had specifically wanted a view we would have stayed in one of the bigger hotels and paid a lot more money....The staff were really nice and friendly, maids service was good and they also did a nightly turn down service so we always had a fresh supply of fluffy towels and toiletries, the bath robes are a nice touch too.We stayed in a Deluxe Queen Room, i have posted a photo or 2 but they dont really do the room justiceI would definately recommed you visit the Heartland Brewery &amp; Rotisserie which is inside the empire state building, the meals there are fantastic, the staff are really good and they have loads of drinks to choose fromAlso visit Top of The Rock Observation Deck, in the GE Building at rockerfellar center, Central Park Zoo (the polar bear is brilliant), Circle Line Harbour Cruise, and the Gray Line open top tour BusWe went up the ESB and we bought the Express Pass tickets from their website and it saved us about 3 hours queuing, they are well worth the extra money, you dont waste any time stood in queues, they send you straight to the front of everyline and first ones in the elevators.Beware the roads are chaos and the taxi drivers in NYC will knock you down given half the chance	
Aug 27 2007 	Could not have been happier!!!	At first a bit worried since we, nor a lot of people that we know, never heard of Hotel Chandler, once we arrived we were more than satisfied. Everything from decor, ambience, the staff and the cleanliness of the lobby and rooms were top notch. Being that we were two friends looking for a great vacation in NYC, Hotel Chandler was the best hotel we could have stayed at. The staff, especially the bell staff and housekeepers, exceeded our expectations. We will definitley stay here again and hope that many others will as well.	
Aug 8 2007 	Perfect Boutique Hotel!!!	We booked this hotel after reviewing all the helpful reviews and for the location. This hotel is 4 blocks up from Madison Square Garden. It is 2 blocks from the Empire State Building. I don't know why people are complaining about it being out of the way-this is New York-you are supposed to be walking places to absorb the city! We walked from Penn Station to the hotel and checked in to an adorable queen bed room at the end of the hallway so only 1 neighbor but it didn't matter because we didn't hear anything outside our room. The room had black out shades-WHICH WERE FABULOUS! There is a turn down service each night and the complimentary products are Aveda. The staff was wonderful and helpful and there is free on site internet and a hotel computer to use. Overall we would definitely stay here again. We loved the location and had a great time. The hotel offers complimentary tea and coffee and apples in the back bar area all day and the bell staff is phenomenal!	
Aug 3 2007 	Excellent Hotel...A Little Out of The Way	Hotel Chandler is a nice, clean hotel with a very friendly staff. If you arrive early for check-in, you can have your luggage stored at no charge (which is rare in NYC). The free wireless internet is great. There is a turn-down service which includes shutting the blinds and shades. I have three complaints about the hotel. One, our mini fridge never got cold even though it was plugged in, so we were never able to have cold drinks and there is no ice machine in the hotel (which is a definite negative in the summer). The bathroom door could not close all the way (the door literally didn't fit into the frame). Most importantly, the hotel is a little out of the way. The only major attraction close to the hotel is the Empire State Building. So, as long as you are comfortable with taking the subway everywhere, you will be fine. The majority of the restauarants around the hotel serve sushi, Thai food, and curry. Overall, the hotel was a great experience, but I would have preferred to be in more of the heart of the action.	
Jul 28 2007	Better than Average!	We stayed at the Hotel Chandler for 4 nights. Our room was small, but nicely decorated with quality linens, thick towels, nice bathrobes, Aveda soaps, shampoo, conditioner. Good water pressure - liked the rain shower head. Only one small shelf in the bathroom which made it difficult to put out our toiletries. I have a hanging bag which came in handy at this hotel. Large thin flat screen TV, AM/FM clock radio with docking station for IPOD. Desk &amp; chair. 2 plush chairs &amp; small round table. Large comfortable bed. Iron/ironing board. Hair dryer was in the closet. There was no room to put it down in the bathroom.Small hanging closet. The bottom half housed the honor bar. There is an in-room safe. There were NO DRAWERS for folded clothing. No room for our empty luggage which we lined up against the wall. There was coffee, tea, apples in the lobby all day. NY Times newspaper at the door each morning. If you showed your room key at the hotel bar between 7 - 8 pm you got a free glass of wine. The hotel staff was very helpful with maps and directions. There is no ice machine, but room service will deliver a small or large bucket if you call. The hotel is conveniently located. We walked to many of the main sights &amp; took the nearby subway to Battery Park to take the ferry to The Statue of Liberty &amp; Ellis Island.  We enjoyed Central Park, especially Tavern on the Green. We ordered an exotic drink ($15 each) and oysters on the half shell &amp; a shrimp cocktail (really large shrimp) quite expensive, but this is a unique restaurant.	
Jul 23 2007 	Fab Fab Fab	Great hotel! On arrival the staff were polite and friendly and no problems with our reservation. The room was small but immaculate. Everything we could have needed was supplied.I would definatley recommend!	
Jul 14 2007 	Loved Hotel Chandler!	My husband and I stayed here for five nights and could not have been happier with the experience! First of all Hotel Chandler is in a great location... extremely convenient to all of the neighborhoods we visited. We were only a couple of blocks from the nearest subway which made getting around very easy! The people at the hotel were great! Very unobtrusive when necessary, and extremely helpful when needed. For example, our first night there we had just arrived in New York and were tired and hungry. We wanted to find a nice restaurant right by the hotel. Not only did they help us find a great place but also provided us with a full listing of restaurants in the immediate area. We were also able to get directions to different places from them and once when we forgot an address for a place in our room we called the hotel and they provided us with the info! Extremely helpful! Yes our room was small but beautifully appointed. Loved the coziness and color scheme and the bathroom was just adorable with all of the blue and white tiles! We love boutique style hotels and would definitely stay there again on our next visit to New York.	
Jul 1 2007	Definitely for the budget conscious!	I stayed for a weekend in late June. The location was prime, right off of 5th ave and walking distance to the subways. However, the rooms were TINY, even by NYC standards. The decor was nice and the rooms were certainly clean. Just be forewarned about slamming doors heard whenever someone leaves their room on the floor.	
Jun 30 2007 	Loved the Chandler	I just returned from a three night stay at the Chandler.I have long been going to NYC and have stayed at many hotels in the area , being most loyal to a hotel on 51st Street until this trip when I decided to broaden my horizons and try something new and different. I'm really glad I did...I really enjoyed this boutique hotel. The front desk staff and the doorman were exceptionally friendly and helpful from check in to check out. The room was nicely decorated and the linens, duvet and cherry wood furniture were an added bonus. I did not use the in room bar nor the snacks ( That would be crazy $$ )Room was quiet and secure and the size about what I had expected, certainly not too small by any means. Also very clean from top to bottom and maid service daily, very good and efficient.Location was A-1 in the Murray Hill District. Bar 12:31 extremely overpriced and did not use this facilty. Did have the breakfast buffet the first morning which was very good but so many other options nearby at a much more reasonable price. Having no restaurant within the hotel for lunch and dinner was not a huge issue for me as again, so much to choose from in the neighborhood and elsewhere.I will be staying here again, absolutely.Thumb up for the Chandler ****	
Jun 29 2007 	No complaints but a few hints...	Bullet points are so much easier to read, don't you think? Well, I do - so here we go:The Hotel in General:- clean- friendly reception staff- nice porters (not 'professionals', but nice guys)- reading room stocked with books and a computer- loan of electrical adapters, et al.- free coffee/tea in the morning.- free newspaper every morning- conveniently located: two blocks to the Empire state, three from the green metro line, 33rd St. station. Middle of a block between 5th and Madison, so pretty quiet.The bedrooms (or mine at least):-I was in room 523, which was close to the elevators (there was a closet between my room and the lifts), and which looks out over an interior courtyard (no windows looking into the room). -The bedroom is small. This is standard for New York apparently, so do not think that it is proper to the Chandler -There was an ironing board, an iron and a hair dryer-Lovely bed linens-A large flat screen tv-Pull down blind and wooden levolor blinds -Nice radio alarm clock that serves as an Ipod dock - easy to use-Lovely shower, great, loved it could have stayed in there all day  it was HUGE and had decent water pressure, amazing for the US-Nice towels-Great shower/lotion etc. stocked everyday-Individual, controllable heater/air conditioning-Automatic, free wifiMy own two cents about the Chandler-the bathroom had almost no shelf space, I had to leave everything in my toiletry bag on the desk in the bedroom-Water temperature left a bit to be desired from time to time, but not that big of a deal.-The shower was great, but the spout is in the middle of the shower and the switch to turn it on is on the far wall, so you had to be quick turning it on and getting out before the cold water came out (if you are like me and let the water warm up before you get in)-Street sounds were minimal, hall noises were not (ask for a room far from the lifts)-Room size: I had a friend with me for two days and it was a bit hard to navigate from one side of the room to the bathroom without having to climb over the bed.-More hangars please-Shut the bathroom door at night to avoid the bright street light glowImportant things to look for when booking a hotel (and staying in one) and general New York comments:-Business or pleasure? The Chandler is not the best if you are young and like going to bars and shopping. I did a LOT of unnecessary walking due to the calm location. There are no bars (except the one in the lobby) or restaurants in the immediate vicinity and if you are working in mid-town it is a 15-20 minute walk. The metro is a good 7 mins away and wasnt worth it most of the time.-How much time are you really going to be in the room? Sometimes it is worth it to pay less for comfort and more for location.-Individual, controllable heater/air conditioning is VERY important-Automatic, free wifi is really nice to have-Dont forget to see if the previous tenant had set the alarm for 5 a.m. to avoid rude awakenings-The view from Top of the Rock is better than the Empire State BuildingThere, done. I think!Oh, and most of the photos here are more than accurate	
Jun 19 2007 	Charming hotel	For this trip, this was the hotel that had the best price at my t. agent. My usual hotel asked for twice the usual sum for the night, so forget about it.I did not like the area much, it is a bit too south for me (I stay for business and prefer 40th to 46th area). But I did appreciate the room, very clean, lovely bed and pillows, nice bathroom. Of course it is not big, otherwise I'd go to a Sheraton or so, but I hate big hotels and this was just charming.	
Jun 17 2007 	You'd be hard pressed to find better value	Hotel Chandler is a friendly, reasonably priced boutique hotel. Some of the reviews here mention how small the rooms are, how far the hotel was from any subway station and how the traffic noise was distracting. I'd like to say that hotel rooms in Manhattan are small by comparison and our room at this hotel was adequate in size. The nearest subway is only two blocks away, any closer and the trains will keep you up all night. I didn't hear any traffic noise and frequently slept in undisturbed by the morning rush hour. This hotel is excellently situated; only two blocks from the Empire State, a short walk from the Flatiron district, Chelsea, Time Square, Macy's. The hotel boasts free WiFi, air conditioning, a gym, free morning coffee and New York Times and a friendly bar on site for early or late evening drinks. With several breakfast cafes only a short walk away and Anthony Bourdain's excellent Les Halles Brasserie only two blocks east on Park Avenue, you won't have far to go for something to eat. To sum up: the rooms are spotless, the beds comfy, the staff friendly and helpful and the location A1 and you'd be hard pressed to find better value.	
Jun 4 2007 	Good Spot in Murray Hill	Given the high prices of hotels in New York City, the Hotel Chandler is a welcome alternative. Its centrally located. The staff was responsive and courteous. My room was a decent size. And the cost was affordable. The elevators were a little slow, but since my room was on the fourth floor, taking the stairs was a breeze. Definitely plan to stay here again!	
Jun 4 2007 	tiny room great amenities	Just spent one night at Hotel Chandler this past weekend. Pros: Frette linens, Aveda bath products, very friendly staffCons: Absolutely the smallet hotel room I have ever seen in NYC (I travel to NY and stay in hotels at least every two months). Everything you need is in the room, including a luggage rack, but the queen room was so small there was nowhere to put the luggage rack. If not for the lack of space to put anything, the hotel was pretty good for the price.	
May 10 2007 	Best Hotel! Best Price!! We got a steal!!	The place was so clean! The rooms were very modern and it was minutes away from everything!We walked to Times Square about 10minutes and The empire state buidling was just around the corner!! Will go back for sure!!	
May 1 2007 	A treasure!	We found the Hotel Chandler on line and got a great rate for a long weekend in NYC. While I wasn't sure what we would find when we got there, it was better than we expected! Great room and Aveda amenities, very helpful staff, relatively close to the subway stations and local restaurants. Our room had a good size bathroom and was dead quiet, which made for great sleeping....when we arrived, the desk staff directed us to yummy all night Korean bbq down the street a few blocks which was awesome! Another night we walked to Les Halles, Anthony Bordain's restaurant, which I would highly recommend. About a $10 cab drive to get to B'way shows. A secret treasure in NYC!	
Apr 26 2007 	Excellent	Just returned from 4 day trip to New York staying in Hotel Chandler - the Hotel was excellent and the staff couldn't have been more acoommodating to us and our 22month daughter - Super Shuttle could learn alot from this Hotel in customer service. We are looking forward to staying here again in the near future.	
Apr 18 2007 	Loved the hot chocolate	Just returned from a girly weekend to celebrate being 40 and had a great time in NYC (despite the cold). Hotel was great - rooms stylishy decorated, staff very friendly and helpful. Lounge very inviting after a days shoping to put your feet up a grab a hot drink and check your e-mails! Handy for Maceys, Times Square and Empire State. Plenty of restaurants within a few minutes walk.	
Feb 24 2007 	More 'budget' than 'fancy'	The hotel looked interesting on the web, and I booked it through Expedia.ca after looking at the website. It was neat to have Frette linen and Aveda products, but the linen wasn't that great -- some of it seemed so worn out that the fabric was thinning significantly that there were almost a couple of holes in the bedsheets! Our room was really small, and really really really really hot. Although the vent kept on blasting cold air, somehow our room remained so hot and dry during our whole 4-day stay -- and it was right before Christmas! At first we thought it might be the fridge causing the problem, because it wasn't closed properly. However, it remained that way, and I was having trouble getting dressed to go outside in the room, because it was so warm. I had to go into the hallway to finish dressing myself. When we checked out, we asked about this problem, and apparently it was due to a NYC by-law and they had to keep the heat on...I'm not sure I buy into that completely, but the warmth definitely killed the stay for me quite a bit.The hotel isn't the closest to the subway, either. The nearest subway is about two blocks away. I didn't mind so much, because it was so warm in December that walking outside wasn't too bad. Overall, this became more of a budget hotel to me, because of the &quot;quirks&quot; that it had. The staff was friendly, and that was a plus. The breakfast wasn't too great -- there are better places to get breakfast in NYC for $15 or $18 per person.	
Feb 6 2007 	loved the chandler	I found this hotel through trip advisor reviews. It was great. Clean, nice towels and robes, free coffee and fruit, chocolates on the pillows with next-day weather forecast card. Good location too. I've found my nyc hotel!	
Jan 19 2007 	Ruined our memories ( Fantastic bell boys)	loved our time at this hotel, we were in nyc to get married and choose the chandler as our hotel to prepare for our wedding, our wedding ceramony was booked at 3pm on the day of our departure from this hotel, and they agreed to give us a late checkout, as no one was booked in the room, or so we thought!!!!!! when i returned home from our honeymoon in the florida keys i discovered that the chandler had charged me a further $80+tax for checking out late. whan i called to question this they said it was for a half day, they said we were still in the room at 4pm, hahahahahah. we got married at 3pm, strange. i have a receipt from our limo car that we used which states pick up time 2.45pm, a marriage certificate stating the time and date we were married, SIGNED by a minister (she must be telling lies too, huh? hotel chandler!!!) and 12 witnesses who were at the wedding. the member of staff who said we were in the room at 4pm, were you out the night before?????????? i have receipts with times, i have certifictes with times, all before 4PM!!!!!!!!	
Jan 8 2007 	Second visit was good	My husband and I slipped off for a weekend recovery trip (college kids home for the holidays!) and stayed at the Chandler again. Our room was smaller than on our previous visit but how much time are you planning to stay in your room when you're in New York City? Bed extremely comfortable; nice bathroom; windows actually open; very QUIET hotel. We really love the location- easy walk to the subway, bars and restaurants but not noisy or congested. For the price you can't beat it.	
Dec 20 2006	Hotel Chandler - Camera went missing	Left the hotel for dinner on a friday night leaving my camera on the bed. Returned from dinner 3 hours later and the bed was turned down and the camera GONE.No one in the hotel was helpful with the situation and basically intimated that i lost the camera. Never an apology and i'm still waiting to hear back from the General Manager. Saturday night we left the room and returned to find that our Ice bucket with an unopened bottle of wine, water and desert from the night before had been thrown out!It was getting to the point where i didn't want to leave the room.	
Dec 16 2006 	Brilliant hotel. Friendy and Helpful Staff.	Brilliant Hotel. Close to Empire State Building. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. Rooms nice and clean. Although the view from the window was of the fire escape, who cares about the window view when you're in New York? Would recommend and definitely stay there again.	
Dec 8 2006 	absolutely brilliant	Could not ask for a better hotel .Staff so polite and friendly and the location is in a prime location. Should me and my wife ever go back to new york, which we intend to do, we would definetly stop here again. Under two minutes walk from the Empire state building , and less than a ten minute stroll from Times square .Thanks Chandler for a great weekend. Would also recommend dining at Anthony Bourdains Les Halles, which is just around the corner for a great meal. The reception at the Chandler was happy to make our reservation	
Dec 5 2006 	An enjoyable stay	I booked Hotel Chandler for a stay in NYC to celebrate my husbands birthday. I had read the reviews about small rooms and rude staff. Anyone that stays regularly in big cities knows that large rooms come at a very high premium - you don't go to New York to spend excessive time in your room anyway. As far as the staff are concerned I really have no criticisms. The staff were very good. In particular, the door staff, who were friendly, courtious and helpful.My husband is more fussy than average about hotels, but even he was impressed.Our last stay in NYC was in the Wardorf Astoria. Can't afford to stay there every time, so it is good to have a more reasonably priced hotel that we are happy to stay in.	
Dec 5 2006 	Just great - Great Hotel	We (4 of us) stayed here for 4 nights 29th- Dec3.Apart from one piece of nightwear missing from our room - but was compensated -the hotel is just how it is discribed.We were lead to beleive that the bar prices were on the high side, but they do have a &quot;Happy Hour&quot; , well 2 to be precise, from 4:30 to 6:30 Mon to Thursday. Beer $6.Picky bits on the side.So this was used by us!The bath products and robe are very nice, but they all say that don't they?Staff are fine. Not too &quot;in your face&quot; with the pleasentries.Nearest tube down three blocks on 28th ST.---Great Place For Breakfast---&quot;Tasty&quot; is the name.Take a right out from the front of the hotel, and take the first right and you'll find it.The walk is only a minute, and the smoothies are great! Plus the sausage egg muffins and cakes! Sets you up for the day.For walking:Takes about 25-30mins to get to central park10 mins to Macey's3mins for Empire State Building.1 min for &quot;tasty&quot;	
Nov 25 2006 	Bed bugs at the Chandler	the hotel is nicely furnished, and the Aveda Bath Products and Frette linens do add a nice touch BUT there was one major issue during my 10 day stay there: BED BUGS. Try to avoid room 925, they are there. After counting 40 bites I had them change me to another room , but then I decided to simply change hotels. Naturally, the concierge claims to never have had any complaints of this kind.	
Nov 15 2006 	Highly recommended	We were hesitant about the hotel after reading the mixed reviews. Well after arriving and speaking with our friends who recently moved out to NY, we certainly were glad of where we were. When we arrived we were allocated a room on the 4th floor and discovered that it was a smoking floor. We returned to the front desk to advise them of the smell and after profuse apologies we were given a non smoking room by Emma who was very polite and helpful.The Ups-The hotel is in an excellent location. Within walking distance to tons of restaurants, shopping district, underground transportation and the Empire State building.-The service was excellent. Front desk staff were very friendly, efficient and polite (especially Adrene and Emma). I have never met a more attentive and nice staff in all my travels.-Rooms are fine, not spacious, but generally well appointed. Nice, comfortable bed with quality linens. Good bath ammenities. -Breakfast was great with plenty of items to choose from -- cereal, milk, yogurt, orange juice, pastries, coffee,tea, fruit and toast. Downs-Intenet access did not work.-There was no in room coffee.-Breakfast was great but not worth $18.-Valet parking did not include in/out. All in all we fully reccommend this hotel.	
Nov 13 2006 	Fantastic hotel will stay at again	I stayed at the Hotel Chandler for one week over Halloween and cant understand why some people disliked the hotel. I have stayed in many New York Hotels and this is the first that I would stay in again.The staff are so helpful, nothing is too much trouble, free tea and coffee on offer at all times of the day and night along with fresh fruit daily. Free internet access for all guests, chocolates and weather reports on your pillow every night a copy of the New York Times outside your door every morning...The room itself was very clean and very peaceful (a rarity in New York, however this could be due to staying on the 10th Floor) with more than enough room for two people to move around, the DVD player in your room was a nice touch too. The only downside was the prices in the hotel bar, but there's more than enough around to avoid it.I can't wait to visit again.	
Nov 13 2006 	Different opinions	I am afraid that I can't compliment the hotel and agree with the other comments further down. A truly mediocre hotel with slapdash service.	
Nov 6 2006 	great hotel	We stayed here for two nights last week (31st Oct and 1st Nov 2006) and were delighted with our choice of hotelthe room was so clean, the location so central, the bathroom was a delight and the weather updates left with the bed-turn down service were such a personal touchthe other reviews were very helpful and accurate as this is a wonderful hotel and we can't wait to return/recommend it to our friends and family	
Oct 27 2006 	Fab Manhattan boutique hotel	Just got back from a 3 night stay. Small room (bigger than Paris rooms though). Loved the bathroom -nice products,. large walk-in shower. Very clean and comfortable for a base. Front desk staff very helpful-happy to store luggage for a late flight home. Breakfast buffet seemed expensive so went elsewhere. Tea and coffee available in lounge but would've been nicer in rooms. Otherwise, excellent hotel, good location. No hesitation in recommending.	
Oct 26 2006	great srveice from hotel chandler	the staff were v.helpful &amp; curtious full of information you could change upto 100dollar travel cheques at the reception. rooms were v.clean, bathroom excellent.ok it was a small room i had, but ideal for a couple or single traveller. as you only going to sleep &amp; shower in it, not a problem, it was cleaned everyday air con excellent. super shower i'd like one in my own home. when it rained one day they gave me an umbrella as i was going out. it is in the ideal location right on 5th ave &amp; e31st st for sight seeing. right under the empire state building close to 34th street for shopping macy's etc. times square a stones throw away ,chrysler building,cgt, 5th ave shops, central park straight up 5th ave. the amazing glass cubed apple store.museum mile. metropolitan museum of art. guggenheim. hop on the grayline open top tore bus on 34th st .madison square garden midtowns many discount stores. levi's $19.99 a pair. easy access to lower manhattan straight down broadway/ 5th ave.flat iron bldg can be seen from 31 st/5th ave.lots of restaurants around all tastes catered for.	
Oct 25 2006 	Great NY Value.	NYC is known for its expensive, small rooms. This hotel was no exception on the room-size, but we got it at half the cost of other hotels in Manhattan.It is truly a boutique-style hotel with comfortable (although tiny) rooms with excellent bathrooms! The bed was really comfortable. This hotel had the best showers of any hotel I have ever stayed. Our rooms looked over a roof, but what do you expect in NY, a beach-front?The rooms were extremely quiet at night, and I only heard someone leaving their room once. I never heard anyone out in the halls talking or making noise, which is typical at hotels. I've read other reviews were people complained about the garbage trucks and noise in the street, but what do you expect? You are staying in the USA's largest city, not Bodunk, North Dakota.Great location, within walking distance of several subway stops and the Empire State Building and Grand Central Station. If you prefer to take a taxi, we saw the doormen running up to 31st and 5th to catch taxis to bring them back down to the front of the hotel (not many taxis came down 31st).The breakfast buffet (they actually prepared the eggs and bacon to order) is expensive to standards in other cities ($18), but is comparable to other places we ate breakfast at in NY.Negatives:*The carpet needed to be cleaned. My mom's bedroom slippers turned black from walking on the carpet in the room.*The hotel needs to install at least one ice maker somewhere in the hotel.*The hotel staff had stored linen carts in the enclosed stairwell landings, which, in an already small stairwell, seemed really unsafe.*Plugging in a computer was a little pain because you had to reach under the desk to plug it in. They need one of those lamps with plugs in the lamp like many other hotels have.*The staff in the restaurant were not that attentive.	
Oct 24 2006 	Reasonable price and Pleasant stay	I would stay here again in a New York minute. We were pleasantly surprised at our stay at the Hotel Chandler. We usually stay at the Waldorf Astoria and had not made prior resevations, so when we got to Manhattan and the Walforf was booked we started searching. We went to 8 other hotels and they were all booked. I had never heard of this hotel, but the location was great. On 31st street off 5th avenue. We got the last room available for a little under $300 a nite. It seemed a little small, but I think because of the oversize furniture. It was Very Clean, had nice toiletries (even robes in the room) and was comfortable. The door men were very helpful and curtious and the front desk was efficient. They even had valet service for $35 a day. The only con was when I asked for additional towels (there were only 2 bath towels in the room) They wanted to know why and how many people were in the room, but within the hour they had sent more up. We didn't eat at the hotel because only a block up 5th ave. is a Brooklyn Bagel where you can get a breakfast pastry and a coffee for $2.00.	
Oct 24 2006 	Fair Value	Hotel Chandler provides fair value for money with: -Very helpful, positive staffClean, comfortable roomGood locationWould have liked a little more storage space in the room.	
Oct 23 2006	Promising Hotel could go down by poor management	Hotel Chandler has potential to be on the above average rating; however, we got surprised by the poor management at the time problems were needed to be solved.I called the guest service to ask if they could tell the person vacuuming to stop because we were trying to get some sleep on our last Sunday morning at the Hotel Chandler. The housekeeper did but she was so loud that we even heard the discussion about the reason why she had to stop when she was told to vacuum.Half an hour later after we almost fall as sleep, the housekeeper knock at the door and she said: Housekeeping you need to check out! We end up deciding to take a shower and get ready to leave when we heard the pounding of the construction outside the room.We went to the guest service to check out and we told the front desk employee about what happened. He laughed and told us that we could go to Yahoo to write our comments because managers won't listen. We were so surprised with such an answer that we demanded to talk to the manager on duty. We talk to Erika who only gave us excuses!Oh! There was some &quot;white stuff&quot; on the floorOh! The housekeeper has a &quot;language barrier&quot;Oh! The owners want the construction to be finished ASAP and that's why people is working on a Sunday morning. She end up apologizing and wanted to give us an upgrade but we didn't accept. She gave us $40 to pay for the taxi. But the rate was a little bit more. With such a competitive industry we are sure that we could find another hotel that offers the same service but knows how to treat guest in a better manner. Besides that incident the service was great.Rooms are a little bit too small.Good location.	
Oct 17 2006 	Dishonest and truly mediocre	I'll be short so you can move onto a better subject...1. The hotel is so far from luxurious you'll be surprised at every turn, expect very little for a large price. It is so exaggerated on the website you'll wish for honesty in advertising.2. The price we booked at had been inflated by $45 a night with no explanation, apology, or recourse.3. Front desk staff was at times rude and at best apathetic.4. Our room looked into a back alley dump area for $325 a night.5. We heard quite a lot of our neighbours both in their room and when they were fighting in the hallway at 4 am.6. The linens are lovely and the soap is nice but it is a little sad that this is the only area I can compliment.In the end I had a fantastic time with my Mom in NY, but I would never, ever stay at this mediocre, amateur hotel again. I have learned my lesson and would suggest you go to another mid-range hotel, and get confirmation of you room rate in writing.I look forward to seeing this hotel change ownership because NY is pretty competitive and Hotel Chandler does not cut it.	
Oct 3 2006 	Great Boutique Hotel	The Chandler Hotel was quaint and charming, just what you expect from a boutique hotel. The rooms are small, but very clean and well maintained. The bathroom amenities were Aveda, very nice to see high quality toiletries. The rainforest shower was a nice element. The staff was extremely helpful (from the front desk to the bell men). The turndown service really made you feel attended to. The hotel is located in midtown, so it is close to many attractions and neighborhoods; the Empire State Building is a 5 minute walk on the 5th avenue, where you can shop til you drop. The New York library and MoMa are 10 and 20 minute walks, respectively. I would definitely stay here again.	
Sep 29 2006 	Close to 5th Ave - Friendly staff	We read the comments about the Chandler, some good some not so good.Decided to chance it and we couldn't have been happier. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The comments about the small rooms made me book a bigger room which was fine.The hotel was close to 5th Ave and Empire State Building. We walked to Times Square. If we were ever to come back to New York we would stay at the Chandler.	
Sep 13 2006 	A little bit of luxury in NYC.	A first time visitor to NYC, I was not sure what to expect from Manhattan hotels. Hotel Chandler immediately put me at ease - on arriving at the hotel we checked in with friendly and helpful staff and also got an upgrade to a bigger room. The hotel reception is a quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle outside. Our room was on the third floor at the front - a bit noisy at first but we preferred the view onto the street, and with the double layer of blinds on the window the noise at night was not so noticable.Room itself was immaculately clean and more than we expected, and the small but luxurious bathroom has everything you need - the rain shower and Aveda products add those little extra touches. Location wise I felt it suited our needs as we could easily walk uptown towards Central Park or downtown towards SoHo etc, and there are lovely restaurants along Madison Av and Park Av only a few blocks away.The staff at Hotel Chandler are helpful without being too overbearing. I will definitely stay here again and have already recommended the hotel to friends.	
Sep 10 2006 	Lovely little hotel it's all in the details	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Chandler five nights in the beginning of september. We chose this hotel based on the location, tripadvisor reviews and the nice pictures on their website. It's very centrally located a block away from empire state and within walking distance to most parts of the city. East 31st street might not win a prize for being the most charming street in town, but it's quiet and safe.We were given a room on the second floor when we arrived, but having asked for a room higher up and being light sleepers (there's a bar on the first floor), we asked for another. We were given one on the seventh floor without question or attitude, which was nice. Our room was a decent size and was tastefully decorated, it looked just like the pictures, a rarity for most hotels. The bathroom was small, but we lacked nothing and thoroughly enjoyed the plush frette bathrobes, the complimentary aveda products and the 'rain'-shower. The aircondition was effective and we could control it ourselves. We loved that the bed had a comforter instead of just sheets (being scandinavians and all), but the bed itself was very hard and not too comfortable. The tv had lots of channels, including hbo, and the hotel has its own entertainment system with movies on demand and a dvd-library, as well as playstation. What impressed us the most were all the little details that helped make our stay comfortable. The complimentary New York Times outside our door in the morning, the turndown service in the afternoon, the chocolates on our pillows and the little card with tomorrows weather and temperature. So cute!The staff and doormen were all very helpful and friendly and the rooms and public areas were spotlessly clean. We needed to store our luggage there on our last day and it was free of charge and no problem. The few negative remarks we had were that the breakfast was very expensive (spend less money on a better breakfast elsewhere instead), the bed was really hard, it felt like it didn't have springs at all and that our window faced the back alley which wasn't much to look at. We needed the little weather cards, because we had no way of telling what the weather was based on looking outside. The lighting in the room was also a little dim. These are all insignificant, though; we loved our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel!	
Sep 5 2006 	Cute Hotel Great Location	Hotel Chandler is a very cute, quaint hotel in the middle of the city. Other than asking for a non-smoking and not receiving one our stay was great. The rooms/bathrooms are on the small side but are very clean, nicely decorated and VERY quiet. The hotel is in a great location with easy access to everything. This is a great place to stay if you want to escape the touristy upper mid-town.	
Jul 13 2006	Upmarket Hotel Chandler	We stayed at the Hotel Chandler from July 8 to July 12. Although this is a 3.5 star hotel, it was more elegant than I expected. It is a small hotel but with plenty of charm and character. It was originally built as a hotel in about 1909 I think. The room was actually larger than I had expected, with room for a desk and closet which included iron and ironing board and hairdryer so you didn't have to call Housekeeping. There was a lovely winding staircase and the hotel had lots of personality. There is even a comedy night on a Thursday which we missed out on but sounded fun.The staff were pleasant and helpful and the bed was wonderfully comfy. The Aveda products were great. The shower was powerful so you may need the shower cap if you don't want to get your hair wet! It was a small but efficient bathroom. The only noise we heard was from the toilet occasionally flushing in the room behind us - it is turbo charged. We did not notice any other noise except the continual construction locally if the window was open - they are rebuilding everywhere. The room temperature was comfortable and the AC effective. You had to ask for ice to be brought up as there was nowhere to get it on our floor. We tried the sauna but it was a bit disappointing. Even having it pre-heated for 10 minutes didn't make it hot but more lukewarm. It was on a timer too so we gave up. There is a good little gym which was totally empty.We walked everywhere - from down to Chinatown to up to Central Park so we didn't rely on the subway at all. It was a fabulous location and we felt very safe. We often walked back after dinner at gone 11:00 p.m. We found a neat little India on our last evening around Lexington and 29th so had our last dinner there.I'd love to stay at the Chandler again and I would give it a full 4 star rating. It is a very sweet little hotel. Everything was just like in the brochure and website. You didn't feel anonymous like in some of the huge hotels.	
Jul 10 2006	A great find	Stayed at this hotel in June for 5 nights. Desk staff were great, room was small but clean, but wow, the bathroom was outstanding - large walk-in double shower - really modern.Turndown service each night was a great service, including the chocolate!Location is one of the best features of this hotel - just around the corner from the Empire state. Take a right out of the hotel and then 1st right - great deli for breakfast about 200yds on the right - service here was excellent.	
Jul 5 2006	What a Great Hotel!!! Great Price!!!!	What can I say?? This was a great hotel in a great area,(right near the Empire State building, Macy's). It was first class all the way! We arrived really early 8AM and I had requested to store our luggage before the 3PM check in. They did even better and gave us a room immediately!!! We had a view on the 9th floor and it was exactly as described in the room descriptions. The front desk, the porter were great right down to the cleaning staff. The only downfall was that there were renovations outside of the building right around the block and there were a few homeless people sleeping up near the corner of the street(not near the hotel entrance). You did not hear the noise and the people did not bother you.I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone and would most certainly stay again.	
Jun 30 2006 	Okay	Stayed at the Chandler Hotel for a week in June. The location is 3 blocks from the nearest subway, 2 blocks from the Empire State Building, souvenir shops, etc. To get to Times Square, and other other touristy spots, you'd need to take the subway. Herald Square (with the huge Macy's and other shops) is within walking distance. There's a strip of korean restaraunts nearby as well. Positives:Down comforter, comfortable and clean beds.Bathroom is modern, clean, and stylish.Housekeeping does a good job refreshing the room each day.Clean rooms.Negatives:As with many NY hotels, the room is small and cramped. The lighting is too dim in the room (and there is not enough lighting).Not many amenities in the hotel.No restaraunt on site (but there is room service). The hotel is being remodeled and will have a restaraunt when the remodeling is done.Bathroom doesn't have much countertop space.If you're staying at a room at the front of the building overlooking 31st street, expect to hear garbage trucks at midnight and homeless people making noise and different times of the night. Not a big deal if you're a heavy sleeper.No real significant complaints about the hotel. The negatives aren't a big deal. Overall, it was a positive experience.	
Jun 24 2006 	Brutal Hotel	The most overpriced, overrated hotel I've stayed at in years. If you travel to NYC for business, this is not your hotel. Cramped spaces, dimly lit rooms, loud street (unless you enjoy the 12:30am garbage pick-up outside your window). The hotel claims to offer room service, but it's really a single sheet of paper with a couple of sandwiches or salads to choose from. I know, you're supposed to get out and experiance Manhattan, but if you've got work to do, don't count on room service as your dining option. Lastly, the staff. Not the cheeriest bunch of folks in the world. Ask a doorman to hail you a cab and he'll look at you like you've asked him to donate an organ. Many better options to stay at while in the city. While few hotels are perfect, I've seldom seen one do so few things right as this one.	
Jun 5 2006	I look forward to returning to the Chandler	The Chandler is in an excellent Manhattan location. The staff are friendly and helpful. My room was fairly small but this is not unusual in Manhattan and iIt had everything you could wish - and more besides. The bathroom was quite big, clean and had good toiletries. Everything was clean and well looked after, bed linen was excellent quality.My only slight complaint is that they only offer a full breakfast menu. If, like me, you just want coffee, fruit juice and a pastry, you have to go outside - or pay the full price. However there are very many coffee shops, delis etc in the area so it is not a big problem. I understand that they are going to open a restaurant - so things may change.Overall I would recommend this without hesitation and would love to stay again.	
May 10 2006	This is a great NY find!	This is a true boutique hotel -- a bit like a really nice European hotel, albeit at twice the price. On the plus side -- it was really clean, the amenties were top-notch and the staff were unusually helpful and friendly. You didn't have the feel of being in New York from them; they really seemed to want to help the out-of-town traveler. The location was excellent -- right in the center of town, but on a relatively quiet side street. We spent very little time in the hotel itself, but when we returned at night, we got a great night's sleep and enjoyed the excellent shower. We were then well prepared for the next day. (Oh, and for the computer addict, the free Internet service was also a nice plus. And the free NY Times, infinitely more helpful in getting around NY than a USA Today!)On the down side (but this was very much outweighed by the plusses) -- the rooms are, by American standards, TINY. You really are in a European-style hotel. The $15 breakfast was a bit much, esp. considering all the other places you could eat right outside the door (but then, no one forces you to buy it.) Anyplace other than NY, I would feel it was really overpriced at $200 a night, but for NY, just finding a central location, clean, well-run and a helpful staff at that price is a find.We will definitely stay again. The bottom line is that I don't think you can get better value in midtown Manhattan, and you did feel like you were staying in a NICE place.	
May 5 2006	Quite a lot of bang for your buck	Overall, our experience with the Hotel Chandler was a positive one. (We paid $175/night special promotional rate.) The staff was, across the board, incredibly helpful and polite. We initially checked into a regular room that had only a shower in the bathroom. (A beautiful bathroom, by the way, sparkling clean, with gorgeous tiles, Aveda products and bath robes for guest use.) So we switched to a smaller room that had a tub, as I'm a big bath-taker.Our second room was much smaller and the tiles around the bath tub looked like they either needed regrouting or cleaned. Plus, it wasn't the kind of tub you could lie back in -- but that's what you get for hoping for a good soaking tub for a rate of &lt;$200/night. In retrospect, the space we lost to get a bigger bathroom wasn't worth the switch. My husband and I both have bruises on our shins from hitting the platform bed and the closet doors actually touched the edge of the bed when open.That said, our room was clean and in good condition. The bed was quite comfortable. And the hotel offers free DSL in rooms (not wireless, but via cable), which is a nice touch. Plus, the location was fantastic, walking distance from plenty of great restaurants and shops and with easy access to the subway.Our one chief complaint is that we were situated on the 10th floor which, as far as we could assess, seems to house a suite of rooms that are used for the employees' break area. Or something. The door was left open many times and we had a clear glimpse into what appeared to be a ratty kitchen or living room in which people were cooking food. Strange!It wasn't the employee lounge that bothered us -- just the noise that came from it. The staff would talk to each other really loudly from in there -- and the housekeeping staff seems to have a habit of yelling to each other while working on rooms. The walls of the hotel are thin and my husband was awoken several times by both housekeeping (in the mornings) or guests coming in late at night on our floor. I sleep with ear plugs in, so I have to admit it didn't bother me when I was sleeping.And this is such an American nit-pick but the hotel doesn't have an ice machine, which I thought was very strange. I have a pain condition that requires ice packs at night and, in general, the staff was very willing to give us some ice if we went downstairs and asked. From my limited experience with New York hotels, I'd say you get quite the bang for your buck at the Hotel Chandler.	
Apr 21 2006 	Loved the Hotel Chandler	What a pleasant surprise. For NY, it was a steal and it was a very nice boutique hotel in a good location. The decor was chic and the bed was VERY comfortable. They offered nice extras, including high-end toiletries. There was a slight back-up during check-in because a bunch of people arrived at the same time. They have a small front desk and seemingly small staff for such a crunch but other than that, it was a great experience. I will return.	
Mar 17 2006 	Better than I had expected!	I must say with some of the reviews I was prepared to be underwhelmed but the Hotel Chandler is a great little place in NYC. Note, emphasis on little. The rooms are TINY (I am guessing 200 square feet max). They have room service breakfast although for the life of me I don't know why - I can't imagine where you would sit to eat it. (tiny desk, one other chair in the room). There is no closet but a small wardrobe that holds about 5 hangers and space for a small suitcase. The bathroom is also tiny but the shower is AWESOME. Great overhead showerhead.Nice lobby and nice staff as well.I wouldn't plan on coming here for a week but for a night or two a lightly-packed single or couple would enjoy it.	
Jan 20 2006	Home away from home	Just got back from New York with my husband and must I say that we're very pleased with the hotel. If you want to stay at a hotel where the front desk staff is attentive, friendly and very efficient -- from check-in to check out and treat you with kindness and respect Hotel Chandler is for you! It is the ultimate in convenience - business center, free internet, nice workout room with sauna and fantastic location where you can actually walk to interesting places. The rates are very reasonable in a neighborhood that has some expensive hotels. After many years of looking, I am so happy to finally have a home away from home in LALA land at the Hotel Chandler!! Thank you tripadvisor for pointing me to the perfect place!	
Jan 8 2006	good location but	Good location but the rooms were soo small there was hardley room to move around. We were really disappointed at the small rooms we were triping over our luggage. The location was great empire state building right around the corner. We did not have breakfast here as it was a bit pricey and we chose to go to the many little delicatesens close by where we met some great travelers like us. The staff was helpful and pleasant especially the doormen nice helpful fellas. We probabley would not stay here again.	
Jan 5 2006	Most Pleasantly Surprised	After visiting new york in january 2005 and being shocked by another hotel's quality, i was expecting the worst from Hotel Chandler when i booked it. What a surprise, this little gem of a hotel is located excellently. It is clean and modern, with lovely well equipped bathrooms and good sized rooms by new york standards. The service is brilliant and the staff were both charming and ever ready to help. A definite must to return to, Hotel Chandler proved to be a delightful stay - even coming from someone who always finds a need to change hotel rooms like myself - this was the first time my boyfriend and i did not feel the need to change rooms and did not feel unimpressed with the service and value for money. Highly recommended.	
Dec 27 2005 	Great value great location	I got this hotel for $125 a night, and was a bit worried given a few bad ratings on this website. All I can say is that the hotel is an excellent value for $125 a night: tasteful (but small -- this is New York, after all) rooms, nice bedding, free high-speed internet, great shower, nicely-done coffee/tea area available all day. Great value, and great location: short walk to Penn Station, shorter walk to Lexington Ave subway. Would definitely recommend.I find the few ratings of &quot;terrible&quot; to be baffling.	
Nov 29 2005	Never again!!!	Having just returned from New York I feel that I must write my opinion of the hotel as I chose it because of its great reviews - what a mistake that turned out to be.The only great thing about the hotel is the location. The rest left a lot to be desired. The rooms are small, the gym is even smaller and the sauna a joke with no facilities to change or shower.The buffet in the breakfast room is a disappointment; all the plates were covered and not to be removed (!) expect when you helped yourself to the food. A very odd way of presenting a buffet - I certainly have not seen anything like it elsewhere in the world.The room was not properly cleaned - far from it and the bin was not emptied.The glasses used for a drink on the 2nd night were still left on the shelf 3 days later just to mention one thing about the poor house keeping. Apart from that the heating did not work in one room and I moved rooms; another inconvenience...I can accept that management leaves a letter in the room informing me that no room service is available because of Thanksgiving and that the hotel could not get hold of someone to attend to the problem with the heating because of the holiday, but I cannot accept all of the above nor can I accept rude staff. The staff - especially the socalled manager on duty Ericka - was far from helpful. She in particular was rude!!! One by one the stars should be removed from this hotel and the rates lowered considerably. Never again!!!	
Nov 20 2005	Fantastic trip to NYC at the Hotel Chandler	Great location, friendly and extremely helpful staff. Great breakfast every morning to start the day. I will recommend this hotel to all my friends and work colleagues. Hoping to return to NYC next year, so would definitely choose this hotel again. Doormen very helpful and friendly, especially Richard!	
Nov 10 2005	Great Place to stay in new York	Have just returned from a short trip to New York. It was my second visit and i chose it for the area. I stayed in The Wolcott further along the street three years ago and wanted to experience something new.The hotel was great, and the staff helpful and friendly. Don't be frightened to ask them anything. My sister and i had a twin room.The beds were comfortable and we loved lounging in the bath robes and sipping wine. I loved the shower and aveda products.The surrounding area is fine, yes there is some building work, but to turn the corner every morning and see the Empire State building was magical. It is a few blocks from Time square, but the joy was walking the streets and soaking up the atmosphere. We even managed not to get run over. I don't understand all the negative comments...In the end, you just want somewhere clean and friendly to sleep . Take your walking boots and enjoy.... I will be returning and would stay here again.	
Oct 12 2005 	Perfectly Satisified	I was scheduled into the Chandler for a 2 week training of some new employees to take over my job with the US Postal Service. So by the very nature of the trip, my opinion would be that the whole thing &quot;sucked&quot;. I also figured because someone with the Postal Service arranged it, it would further be a disappointment.However, I was completely pleased with the accomodations, (I would of course have enjoyed more room) but the room was clean, neat, the bed comfortable,the tv and the shower worked and there were no unwanted &quot;critters&quot; running around.My wife came in for several days and she agreed that the staff was polite, friendly and ready to serve you.The only dislike I had was having to buy water, but that was everywhere in NY.My policy with lodging anywhere is DSTSS (don't sweat the small stuff). The odds are your own home is not as clean as a hotel room (at least mine isn't). Most will do anything they can to help you and if you happened to have had a bad day, maybe they had one also. Give them the benefit of the doubt..........	
Oct 4 2005	Hotel Chandler is just fine! The bad reviews are silly.	I booked a one-night stay at the Hotel Chandler through hotels, based solely on price. After reading the reviews here, I was prepared for something below average, but was entirely pleased with our stay. The negative reviews - as are so often on this or any other travel site - are almost 100% the result of travelers not planning ahead or not informing themselves about the destination. OF COURSE your window is going to look down into an alley, it's NYC. OF COURSE a hotel isn't going to refund your money becuase you booked the wrong date and didn't show up for your stay. Further, we didn't see one single roach and we didn't smell anything unpleasant at all. Compared to some of the terrible hotels I've stayed at in the city at a higher price, this place is a gem. Decent cost, clean and pleasing interior, good location and friendly staff. I will say that if you valet a car, be sure to call down well in advance of when you need it - 30 minutes or so - apparantly they park cars quite a ways away because we waited a long time for ours. Hotel Chandler is an absolutely acceptable NYC hotel - small room, clean, lovely bathroom, and concierge and valet service that you don't get at most hotels in the same price range. Do not be scared off by reviews from travelers who have irrational expectations.	
Aug 18 2005 	More than pleasantly Surprised	Reading comments that this hotel is &quot;just ok&quot; or &quot;it was a decent stay&quot;, I must admit that when I arrived I was more than a little hesitant. As it turned out I was more than pleasantly surprised. I arrived at 2:30am (thanks to stormy weather) and the front desk attendant was polite and actually pleasant. The room was quite lovely with Aveda products, Frette sheets, duvet and robes that were spa quality. The shower has a rain shower in the bathroom. Comfortable size rooms were nicely decorated. The staff was very polite in every way, very cordial and extremely helpful. I travel to Manhattan for business frequently and I'm pleased I found the Hotel Chandler.	
Jul 17 2005 	Okay stay	I stayed here for two nights on a business trip recently. I found the location to be very convenient to where I had to go--only a few blocks--for business, plus only two blocks from the Empire State Building, which I had purchased a ticket to see on the Internet. I wouldn't describe the surrounding area as a &quot;ghetto&quot; by any means, as one reviewer said. Certainly it wasn't in the really tony areas of the city but I always felt secure and safe traveling alone. I should add that I did not stay &quot;out&quot; after dark, returning from Greenwich Village one night around 8:00 p.m. The rooms are modern but showing some signs of wear and tear, like runs in the berber carpet and broken room-darkening blinds. The Frette linens were the best, and I liked the Aveda products and the tiled bathrooms with cushy bathrobes. My biggest complaint was the view of a closed in area with air conditioner vents and brick walls, and some debris scattered about. As a result I kept the blinds closed! The rooms were clean enough and they have turndown service. I ordered room service for dinner the first night and the food was fairly good. I was surprised that the mini-bar prices seemed pretty reasonable. The $15 breakfasts were okay. The self-service buffet was just cereal, fruit, bagels, croissants and such, and you could order two eggs and toast. Pretty pricey for what you get, but it was convenient and passable on an expense account.As for the staff, I found them all but one waiter to be friendly and attentive. Having said all this, the next time I would probably choose another hotel further uptown, especially since I would not be as concerned as getting one located close to my business destination.	
Jul 13 2005	Low quality and outrageous charges	Bad location: ghetto-like area, very run down and far from the shopping areasVery small roomsUnprofessional staffOutrageous phone rates (I have received a 400$ phone bill for less than 40' of conversation)Avoid this hotel.	
Jun 21 2005 	Good potential; cheesed-out management	This is my second stay here. (I stayed once under the previous name, Le Marquis -- same management).The hotel property itself isn't bad. The rooms are modern enough, average size for NYC rooms. Decor tries to be hip, but is only really just contemporary. They provide free high-speed (wired) access in the rooms, and &quot;direct-dial&quot; inward phone numbers to your room. Normal contemporary hotel stuff for hotels in NYC that want to be above average.So if it weren't for the management, I'd rate this hotel above average. But in both my stays, the management has been bafflingly cheesy. Examples:- When I came back to the hotel's bar one tuesday evening, after walking from 55th &amp; 7th (let's call it 25 blocks), jogging part of the way, I asked for a glass of water. The night manager (?? - big blond hair, too-heavy/too-dark eye makeup, russian-sounding accent) was sitting with the bartender and told me I could buy sparkling water (implying &quot;only&quot;). I said that I'm sure I could get some tap water from their bar. The bartender hesitated, looking for a lead from the other woman (manager), who said if I wanted tap water I could get it in my room, but that I had to buy sparkling water in the bar. Geez! I was *planning* on ordering drinks after I re-hydrated. But this was stupid. I was more than happy to leave this cheesy manager to nickle-dime the next patron to sell a couple of dollar seltzer from the hose -- but not me.- When I check into any hotel, the first thing I do is check the sheets. This time, I found a stiff patch on the sheets of what I would swear is ironed-in &quot;post-lovemaking&quot; fluids. I can't swear to it that this is what the imperfection was, but I'm baffled what else it might have been, and it wasn't pretty. To the staff's credit, they sent somebody up to change the sheets fairly promptly. But it was not without the staff making a little fun of what I thought the &quot;stain&quot; was. Frankly, though the sheets bug me, this would really be more the fault of the cleaners, not the hotel. But it was the attitude of the *staff* in chortling at what I thought the problem was that was the amazingly cheesy response. Let *me* decide if I want to sleep on a given set of sheets, please. Isn't the customer always right?- My A/C in my room is doing its darndest, but at it's coldest setting, it *might* keep the room at 75. Not too bad given that the evenings are basically cool. But I wouldn't want this room if the temps were soaring.I'll give them one big positive kudo. When I left my house, I left my sport jacket behind. The morning desk manager loaned me one of the coats used as a &quot;uniform&quot; coat by the desk staff. (It actually looked a lot like the coat I was planning on bringing!) This was a generous gesture, and well appreciated.So like I said: this *could be* a standout hotel -- if it had management that wasn't so proud of its property that it overlooks its own flawed management. Unfortunately, despite the good location and reasonable prices, next time I'll stay at the Roger Williams 1/2 block down the street, and better managed (despite some of the little advantages of the Chandler.)By the way -- if you *do* stay at the Chandler, and you're taking the train in from Penn Station (e.g. from DC, Boston, etc.), the Chandler is only a brief walk down 31st from the train station. If you have the 10 minutes, save yourself the cab ride, and walk the short distance. Enjoy the city.	
Jun 17 2005	Nice New York hotel in a good location	We wife and I stayed at Hotel Chandler, 3 days in the beginning of June 2005.After reading reviews of the Hotel on TripAdvisor, we were a bit anxious upon arrival. We had booked our room at the Chandler Hotel through a Norwegian Travel Agency. They could not offer a De Luxe room, only Superior rooms. One month upon arrival, I contacted the hotel directly, and asked if I could pay for an upgrade to a De Luxe room. The manager asked my to take up the question upon arrival. We did so, but they told us then that all the De Luxe rooms allready were occupied. Fortunately we were offered a lager superior room, without any extras to pay. We got a corner room at the 9th. floor. It was very nice, fresh and clean, and the size of the room was guite all right.We were very satisfied with our stay at the Chandler Hotel. We also find the Hotel's location great.We did not see any cockroaches!E.J.O.Norway	
May 24 2005 	Grease Vents affect back rooms	Nice hotel, friedly staff, they even upgred me to a larger room, but about 10pm I couldn't smell any but something like greasy exhaust, then I looked out the window below and there were many of kitchen vents... explains the odors... Hotel price are always going up in NYC , this is a good hotel for the price. .... but the grease smell just before bed... I wasn't too happy.	
Apr 1 2005 	Waiting for My Deposit Back	The hotel is a decent hotel, small rooms, but there are nice enough appointments. However, I feel cheated...last August I made a reservation for Dec 15 or so, for a company Xmas party. The person taking the reservation made it for Sept 15 (or so), took the credit card deposit and the hotel charged me when...surprise...I didn't show up for the Sept 15 reservation. Of course, the clerk heard Sept 15...but even with that, management has steadfastly refused or ignored every request for seriously considering a refund of the Sept charge, which I paid no attention to on my credit card bill that month. Of course, there was no room for us when we arrived Dec. 15...luckily they weren't full...and then The Chandler proceeded to charge for the new nights as well. Again, no refund after an inquiry of management. Well...the $250 or so is not that big a deal in the scheme of things, but the principle is...I won't stay there again until they accept the responsibility for the error. They may be right...who knows what I said when I made the reservation?...but it costs them a poorly serviced customer forever (or until there are no other rooms available in NYC!). Live and learn. And timely check your credit card for charges!!	
Feb 14 2005	Check around before checking into the Chandler	My partner and I recently stayed at this hotel over Valentine's weekend. It was a last minute decision to go to NYC, so I couldn't be too picky on where we stayed or how much to spent; however, I wanted to be little conservative because it was a short trip. I was excited when the reservation agent quoted a decent price for NY and even offered me an upgrade after a delightful conversation. Unfortunately, when we arrived at the hotel the front desk clerk said she had no record of the upgrade and was rude when I expressed my disappointment. Our room was small, but it is NY so this wasn't a surprise. It was clean and my only complaint is that the bed was VERY squeaky (I felt a bit bad for the neighbors). The lobby and bar are plain, but the hotel is in a great location. So, alas, no big deal but we will definitely stay somewhere else next time.	
Jan 30 2005	Very Good hotel clean and tidy	The wife and I had a brilliant time at Le Marquis (Hotel Chandler). The room is quite small but what do you expect in New York. It is brilliantly placed for getting around the city with the subway being a 5 min walk away. The breakfast is good although I wouldn't have paid for it if it wasn't free with our package holiday, I think it was about $15 being a British tourist I'd expect a banquette for that but it is not the case, like I said it was free on our trip. Back to the hotel it is small and there is only bar snacks and room service available in the day no restaurant in the hotel either but you are in New York!!!!!! There is a nice Italian out the front door and then take a right onto Madison Avenue don't go in the first one that has take away pizza but the next one I think it was called Meli Melo this is very nice we both had a lovely meal for about $100. The staff at the hotel are mostly foreign and do not understand English to well (not uncommon in New York) but the door men (younger ones) were very funny. All in all the is a great base for a holiday in New York after all as long as its clean and the beds made who spends the day in their room !!!!!I would stay here again but I am going to try a more plush hotel next time.	
Jan 24 2005	Nothing breathtaking	Well, the hotel looks as nice in reality as it looks on the pictures. Except for when you get a back room with a view of the opposite wall and a filthy backyard.The staff was reasonably friendly and the rooms looked clean.The cockroaches didn't mind that though. They were there anyway.	
Dec 5 2004	Will definitely stay there again	I stayed at Le Marquis (as it then was) for 3 nights in June 04, and will definitely stay there again on my next trip to NYC, although may well splurge for the larger room next time.Things I liked: - really friendly and helpful staff, best I have ever experienced in my many. many visits to NYC;- gorgeous bathoom with superb shower, towels, robe and Aveda toiletries;- very comfortable bed with delightful sheets;- very efficient A/C;- room was surprisingly quiet - and hey, who visits Manhattan for a pastoral view?!- free Net access in the lobby was a bonus, as was the very pleasant bar area. - free coffee in the mornings, plus a newspaper: nice little touches. - no sign of any cockroaches! - I arrived 3 hours before &quot;official&quot; check in but was permitted to use my room, which was fully made up bar towels, which arrived an hour later;- good location for the dedicated shopper, several coffee shops within an easy walk for breakfast. Thanks to the reviewer who recommended the sushi place across the street (entrance is actually a street higher) - it was fantastic. Things I didn't like: - the &quot;basic&quot; room is very small, fine for one person, less fine for a couple or someone with a lot of luggage.	
Oct 22 2004	The good news: no cockroaches	This is a hard hotel to review. There isn't really anything wrong, but I just didn't find anything about it that would make me want to go back, there are much better options right around the corner. The hotel is trying very hard to be hip, but seems to miss the details. The music in the lobby is so overpowering I don't know how the staff can stand to be there all day. Reception was efficient once I got the attention of one of the three people who were standing behind the desk looking self important. The bar is a cave, and hosted by someone who thought reading the newspaper was more important than helping actual customers, and who told me to &quot;hurry&quot; at 11:15 since she was closing at midnight! The room was actually a bit larger than I expected and the free ISDN was welcome. The tiny bathroom seemed to be deliberately laid out to make in impossible to put my things anywhere without them falling on the floor, the towel rack fell off the wall. The most puzzling thing is how they managed to put the shower controls behind the overhead shower. There was no way to turn on the shower and adjust the temperature without standing under the shower head. What were they thinking! I had to call to ask for bathtowels, which were missing from the room, which did arrive quickly. Later, someone came to leave a bathrobe. I pointed out that I didn't need once since I was WEARING IT, but she left another one anyway. Strange. My room was quiet, since I was at the rear of the hotel and I didn't hear any corridor noise at all. No bugs. Not a bad place to stay and I can't give it a bad review, I just think that for the price I'll go back to the Kitano next time.	
Oct 19 2004	NOT the ghetto by a long shot!	I have to disagree about the reviewer who claimed the neighborhood was &quot;ghetto.&quot; I think the location is ideal--a short and cheap cab ride to uptown or downtown, easy access to La Guardia, and away from the Times Square madness (to me that's a plus). It's not tourist mecca, but a real NYC neighborhood. Rooms were tiny but comfortable, with an excellent bed.	
Oct 8 2004	A 4AM SURPRISE	Returned to my room in the early hours of the morning after a fun night in the East Village. Turned on the bathroom light and found that I was not alone! Cockroaches. I wasnt too bothered because I have seen worse in NY. But @ $200 + per night, I dont expect to have to share my room. Up to that point I had planned on using this hotel again. I kindly mentioned it to the Management when I was checking out and got nothing but a smile and a we will look into it (when I should have been given some sort of compensation like a free night.. 20% discount.. etc.. take notes Marquis). Good bed, I-net hook up in room, convenient location etc But, because I dont like the critters, I will have to try somewhere else next time. Sorry Marquis, but understand that bugs and expensive hotel rooms dont go to well together.	
Sep 28 2004	Very nice hotel first but then...	...cockroaches!I missed to read the reviews before I booked for a five nights stay last week at Le Marquis. Four days everything seemed good, even very good:The hotel Lobby looks great, the hotel and the room looked very clean. Check-In was quick. As New York was almost sold out that days, the prices were very good compared to other places. Ok, the room is really small, probably to small to be comfortable for two, but for me it was ok. Nice looking to, including the bathroom.Breakfeast in the hotel was not my choice, but complementary coffee with complimentary New York Times and a pickup breakfeast from the near neighborhood was ok! There was also a WiFi coverage for free in my room, but certainly not a planned and reliable service.So I really enjoyed the first four days of my stay there. The hotel is near Empire State Building, 10 minutes walk from Penn and Grand Central, 15-20 from Times Square.Last evening the first cockroach appeared. Not a small one, but I won the battle! I found an additional one dead near the a/c - where they might come in the room from the very dirty outside backyard. I did not ask for a roomchange or even did not complain, as I was to tired to rise my bloodpressure. Next day I checked my personal belonings very carefully for blind passengers and left with no good feeling.Without that beasts, I would have definetly recommended the hotel to everyone. Now its your choice.	
Sep 27 2004	Terrible deceptive hotel	Do not be fooled by this hotel. The name is made to confuse the travel into thinking that this is the same hotel, or at least equivalent in standard to the Marriott Marquis on Times Square. This hotel could not even begin to compare to the real Marriott Marquis. It's in a terrible location, in the sense that the surrounding streets at quite &quot;ghetto&quot;, and one would not feel safe walking to this hotel late at night. The hotel itself is small and has the feel of a one star hotel in England. The room was so terrible and old-fashioned, that we literally opened the door, looked around, and marched right back to the front desk, where we checked out and moved to the Marriott Marquis, despite the $250 loss that we suffered. The front desk staff all seemed to be young and inexperienced, and no offer at all was made to help with our luggage. This is a truly rubbish hotel, and should only be considered if you're not fussy about where you stay, and you don't mind meager accomodations.Le Marquis is remniscent of hotels in London, in the sense that it's over-priced and shoddy, in a poor location. Do not stay here if you expect any sort of class in your hotel.	
Sep 15 2004	I would recommend it.	I spent three nights in the Hotel Le Marquis in late August of 2004. I had read the reviews on this site, so I was pretty sure that the hotel was a good one, and I was right. I was impressed from the moment I walked into the lobby. The doorman and desk clerk were professional, friendly, and welcoming. The lobby was clean, bright, and very tastefully decorated. I was checked in and up in my room in minutes.The &quot;Superior&quot; room I had was on the second floor and had no view, but the nice part was I could just use the stairs (I hate waiting on elevators). It was very clean, well maintained, and the decor was splendid. The room was a bit small, but just fine for one or two people.I particularly liked the bed, which was far and away the most comfortable I'd ever slept on in a hotel, and the bed linens were of good quality...soft and cool. The pillows were good, too, and there were plenty of them.I would have liked to have had a bathtub in which to soak after a long day of walking around Manhattan, but the rainfall-type shower was refreshing, and the water pressure was good. The bathroom was kept spotlessly clean. The room was quiet and the air conditioner worked well. It was nice to have a big, soft robe to slip into, and the Aveda toiletries were a nice touch.There was a small safe in the room, which was a comfort. There was no ironing board or iron when I got there, but they were brought to me minutes after I asked for them. I would've liked to have had a coffee maker in the room, but it wasn't a big deal, since there were several coffee shops within easy walking distance.The TV lounge off of the lobby was a pleasant place to relax, and it was nice to have the computer there with Internet access. I also enjoyed being able to borrow complimentary DVDs to play in my room. I used the in-room, $10-per-day, Internet service one day, but it was so slow and unreliable that after that, I just used the computer in the lounge.The hotel bar is intimate, comfortable, tastefully decorated, quiet, well stocked, well tended, and (for New York) reasonably priced. A very pleasant place to have a drink and chat with locals and fellow guests.I was getting plenty of exercise walking around the city playing tourist, so I didn't feel the need to use the hotel's exercise facilities. Therefore, I have no comment on those. Nor did I avail myself of the hotel's $15 breakfast buffet, since there were plenty of other places within easy walking distance where I could get a more reasonably priced breakfast.The hotel's location is great. It's in a nice part of town (Murray Hill), near lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping of all kinds. It's an easy ten-minute walk from Penn Station, and around the corner from the Empire State Building. It's fairly close to Times Square and the theaters. It's also far enough off of 5th avenue to be reasonably quiet.About the only complaint I had was that they didn't bring me clean drinking glasses when they cleaned the room every day. I'm sure if I'd bothered to call down and ask for them, they'd have brought them to me, but that's something I don't think I should have to ask for. Not a very big deal, though.This is a very nice hotel, particularly for the money. There were a lot of extra touches that I would expect only from a more expensive place. I got a Superior room through Expedia.com for just over $150 per night.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. I had a very pleasant stay and had very few complaints. It's particularly nice if you're coming into the city by train, since it's such a short walk from Penn Station. However, if you plan to spend a lot of your time in the museums (Guggenheim, Frick, MMA, Nat. Sci., etc.), you might want to stay farther uptown, unless you like to walk.	
Sep 7 2004	Small fine rooms bad gym	The rooms are very nicely appointed, but a bit small. Fine for NYC. The only complaint I had was the fitness center -- the bikes were in such bad repair the pedals barely turned. I reported the problem to a guy at the front desk who seemed to just go through the motions of listening.	
Aug 30 2004	Nice boutique hotel	Stayed here for three nights in 2003. I really liked this hotel and would reccommend it to people visiting NY who want a really good central location but no noise. The hotel is 1 block down from the Empire state building and is up a side street which while slightly dark and dodgy looking is actuall fine once you are there with very littlt noise or traffic. We walked to all tourist attractions from here except battery park and the Statute of Liberty ferry (take a cab from midtown).I didn't have breakfast included in my internet booking rate which was one gripe.The rooms are very small - perhaps one of the smallest I have stayed in (and ours was a deluxe!) but overall I would say this downside is blanced out elsewhere. The bathroom is FANTASTIC - a huge walkin shower which could proably fit about 10 people in it and fabulous blue and white mosaic tiles from floor to ceiling. Good air conditioning for the summer months. TV/DVD/internet port etc. Nice turndown service.I would stay here again.	
Jul 20 2004	Definitely go for the room upgrade	We spent two nights here in July '04 for a friend's wedding. The location was great: a couple of blocks from Herald Square/Macy's (and most subway lines). It was easy to catch cabs uptown (Madison Ave) or downtown (5th Ave) from the corner. We splurged for the Deluxe room, and we were well glad that we did. Our room was cozy, but the &quot;Superior&quot; (read: standard) rooms -- which we noted on the fire-escape map and by peeking in during housekeeping service -- were truly tiny.Rooms are well-maintained and well-decorated in boutiquey blues and taupes. A small but functional armoire included drawers, a safe, and hanging space; the TV and DVD player were on top of a separate cabinet, with the minibar underneath; there was also a nice-sized desk with a chair, and an easy-chair/table combo on the window side of the room. We appreciated the free (but rather limited) video and CD library at the front desk, which saved us from paying on-demand movie prices when all we wanted to do was kill a little time on a muggy afternoon.The bathroom was a real jewel, just like in the pictures! It was even nicer than the room itself, and easily the nicest NYC hotel bathroom I've ever seen. The decor featured white subway tile accented by blue mosaic tiles at chair-rail height, all around the room, and the same mosaic on the floor. Cream crown molding and bright silver fixtures rounded the period-appropriate look. Cute vintage-style toilet and pedastal sink; a glass shelf over the toilet and a very deep windowsill (easily 2 feet deep) made up for a lack of counter space. The water pressure in the rain-shower was unbeatable! A good assortment of Aveda amenities included shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body wash, sewing kit, shoeshine kit, and soaps.Most rooms here look out over a fire-escape courtyard, which is less-unpleasant than it sounds. I would choose an interior room again -- I presume that the rooms facing the street are much noisier, and there's not much a view. (Athough the in-room info binder said that &quot;some&quot; rooms have Empire State Building views, I imagine they're limited to the corner suites, one per floor.)We interacted just a few times with the nice, if not terribly outgoing, staff. Typical NYC-style lobby, with a small bar on the street side.Overall, we felt it was a good value for the price: We paid $180 on Expedia, an upgrade from $159 for the standard room. I'd definitely stay here again.	
Jul 12 2004	A good hotel but not a great hotel	I stayed in this hotel for a week and found it a good hotel but not a great hotel, it is pretty central with a 2 minute walk to Macy's and some good shopping. It is a small bit over priced. The brekfast is too expensive and the staff could have been more helpful. But the rooms are clean and the decor modern.	
Jul 8 2004	Luxurious but small dark and bad location	Stayed in the hotel for 3 days last mid June. Rooms are clean but very small and dark. Aveda bath products are nice amenities. It's near the Empire State building but its midtown location is not ideal walking distance to Rockefeller and Times Square. Other amenities: DVD player with free rental of a few titles.Reasons to return to this hotel: clean and luxurious; and has a rain shower.Reasons not to return: bad location; small rooms	
Jun 29 2004	Great location but some faults	I upgraded to the superior room on expedia for $200 per night - the room was tiny - with the queen bed, desk, tv stand and wardrobe furniture there was no room to open our suitcase. The foldup case stand was in the wardrobe - thats the only place it could fit. The staff were courteous but couldnt help with an upgrade. The two lifts were terribly slow. We loved the bathroom/shower design and fixtures. The location was the main reasion we stayed there.	
Jun 6 2004	very friendly and accommodating hotel!	We stayed at the Le Marquis hotel in New York for one night in May 2004. I picked it because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and because it's about a 10-minute walking distance of Penn Station. The hotel was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We arrived in New York at 6:00 in the morning and were able to check into the hotel as soon as we arrived -- which was wonderful for us, because we were tired from an all-night flight, and sometimes hotels make you wait until the afternoon before you can check in. Since we could check in so early we got in a few extra hours of sleep and were thus able to enjoy the rest of our first day in New York. In addition, after we checked out, the hotel very kindly held our bags for us for four days while we traveled to New England, which was also very convenient for us so we didn't have to carry all our luggage with us. The room was relatively small but nicely decorated and super clean so the small size didn't bother us at all. The &quot;waterfall&quot; shower head mounted on the ceiling is heavenly and the best I've ever experienced in any hotel anywhere! Overall a very pleasant and accommodating hotel in a convenient location. I would stay here again.	
May 19 2004	Great Place to Stay!!	I have traveled to New York several times and I found that most of the hotels are really small so I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I needed to check in early because I was attending a conference and needed to get dressed coming right from the airport. They were really nice and let me check in early. I thought the room was decorated nicely but like I mentioned really small. I should have asked for a better view as there was really no light. The bathroom was nice and clean with a warm robe that they provide. The shower I must say was awesome and they Aveda products were a definate treat! Overall I would say that I would recommend this hotel. If you are a sushi lover don't forget to check out the sushi /seafood buffet right across the street! It was incredible! 	
May 18 2004	Pretty Good	I stayed at LeMarquis for a few days during the U.S. Open (tennis). Overall I thought it was pretty good. It was clean and quiet. I had no problems. The room was cleaned each day. The location was ideal, in that I could walk to the Grand Central to catch the train to the matches and also walk to Broadway. I had little interaction with the staff. The room was a little small but all the furnishings were relatively new. Overall it was quite comfortable. It was decorated in a hip sort of way.	
May 12 2004	Hotels online reservation system is a joke!	I am writing in response to a review that I just read. I found the hotel reservation manager to be very rude and unprofessional. I was given a quote for a junior suite on their online request form, only to be told that under no uncertain terms was I going to get the room at that rate. I don't understand the purpose of an online quote form if they don't honor their rates. Why would anyone want to spend their money in a hotel that doesn't appreciate their business. Patrons beware!	
Feb 4 2004	Great Hotel!!	I stayed at Le Marquis for 4 nights in Jan 2003, and I have to say it was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The room was beautiful and clean if a little small and it was difficult to open the wardrobe as the bed was in the way, but the bathroom was great. It had a huge shower, lovely Aveda products and bath robes. It is in a great location just round the corner from the Empire State Building. We didn't eat breakfast as at $15 I thought it was a little steep but the Brooklyn Bagel Co a block up the road was great value. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.	
Jan 13 2004	Nice hotel shame about the attitude	After a long flight, I checked in at Le Marquis and was told that my credit card would not be accepted (I have used this card on many trips overseas). The receptionist was extremely rude and told me she would not except the card. This was the only card I had (except for a few dollars) I am sure that the computers were not working as the card company explained I had sufficient credit. As they had my passport, they alllowed me to check into the room but it took two days for the system to finally except my card. Overall, I thought the rooms were small but really well designed with an excellent shower. I liked the hotel design but was not impressed by the staff attitude throughout my stay.	
Nov 26 2003	I loved my stay at Le Marquis! :)	I absolutely loved my stay at Le Marquis. I stayed at Le Marquis for 3 days by myself and was very pleased with the service. The staff was wonderful, polite and tentative to my needs. The rooms were SO, SO, SO cozy. Really, the beds were SO comfortable and warm and the room was so tidy and neat. The rooms are small, but if you want cozy comfort then this is the place for you. The bathroom, my goodness was so wonderful. You get an array of free toiletries and the towels are luxurious, as are the robes behind the bathroom door. I really liked the bathroom! Clean, clean, clean. Overall, the experience was extremely exhilarating. I was able to relax comfortably. I highly recommend Le Marquis!	
Jul 26 2003	Don't Miss Out!	Stayed here in May 2003. We checked in late at night and were delighted to be greeted by someone to carry our luggage to our room. Although our room was quite small, it was very clean with wonderful linens and a bathroom that was so clean and delightful. The Aveda products were much appreciated after a long drive to the city. First class accomodations. Wonderful chocolate at turndown. The staff are so cheerful, helpful and friendly. Much appreciated. Would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to the city. I just wish our room had been a little bigger and easier to get around but the other amenities surely made up for the lack of space!	
Jul 8 2003	A gem!	Thanks to other reviews, I steered away from some hotels and chose this one. Great choice! Small, clean room, comfy bed with very nice linens, awesome bathroom with fabulous shower and Aveda toiletries. Reserve online and save!	
Jun 30 2003	Location location location!	We stayed at Le Marquis for several nights in June 2003. Room small but perfectly formed, bathroom excellent. Price very reasonable. Two outstanding features, the staff (thank you Bernadette for all) and the location. Right in the middle of downtown Manhattan only a short walk from numerous attractions. I would thoroughly recommend Le Marquis.Brian Larkin.
