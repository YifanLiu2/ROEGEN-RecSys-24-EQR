	Is asking for a fish at a Kimpton that difficult a request???	First off the positive...a very short walk from Grand Central Station. Upon entering 70 Park Avenue I didn't get that &quot;Kimpton&quot; scent that all Kimptons have (sorry but I think Kimpton properties have a distinct fresh scent). The lobby and check-in area were very cramped and I felt claustophobic. Being a dog lover and purposesly staying at Kimptons because they are pet friendly, I found it odd that when I asked the front desk person if there were any dogs there that he didn't know and had to ask the front door man? As we were checking in I requested that a fish be brought to our room. Six hours later, still no fish, I placed phone call and was transferred to a manager's voicemail, where I politely left a message that we had requested a fish and would like one brought to our room which was on Wednesday. Upon check-out on Friday we never saw any fin friends in Room 709, which by the way I would never stay in again. This room was located right near the elevator and by a door that was used constantly by housekeeping staff and when opened or closed made it sound as if someone was knocking on our door. Apparently this hotel does not have housekeeping closets for storage. The whole three days we were there lined up in the hall right outside our room were various carts of towels, etc. The television in our room had serious malfunctions. We set the temperature in our room to 65, but it was a consistent 75?? We never used room service because I do not think any breakfast averaging $24 is worth it. The Silverleaf lounge did offer the customary Kimpton Happy Hour $5 drinks from 5-7 p.m. nightly. We were told there was live music in the lounge, but didn't hear it as it didn't start at the time it was advertized to. I do love Kimpton hotels, but will definitely stay at one of the other ones in NYC next time we are there.	
Nov 8 2009 	Great New York Boutique Hotel in quiet Neighbourhood	70 Park Avenue is a lovely hotel in a great area of Manhattan. We were able to walk everywhere and we did just that. Grand Central is only mins away as are various bars restaurants etc... Thoroughly recommend Moonstruck 244 Madison avenue for good value burgers and the like.... The room size is good the bed is absolutely fabulously comfy and it was a lovely surprise for my husband to receive a bottle of bubbly and a small birthday cake shortly after checking in. Thank you very much !! The rooms were kept lovely and clean and we had a glass of wine each evening &quot;on the house&quot; between 5 and 6 another lovely touch. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel and next time we visit New York it will definitely be to this hotel.	
Oct 19 2009 	Great location overall a nice experience with minor caveats	Overall, a nicely-appointed good mid-price hotel in Midtown.Before you book, ask for a room on a higher floor to avoid street noise. We were on 3 and had a sleepless first night. Staff moved us the next day. Also be aware that the heat isn't turned on unless it drops below 45 degrees (friendly staff shared this with us.) When we asked for heat, they brought a space heater. Cozt rest of stay - so both problems corrected.Would stay again if I had business in Midtown nearby. Wouldn't be my first choice.	
Oct 19 2009 	Good choice for Murray Hill/Grand Central area	Hotel was well located and close to Grand Central -- the room was on a &quot;non-view&quot; side but was decent sized (as everyone else has said) for NYC, about 3 feet around the bed, which is okay. The mini-bar was well stocked and we did not hear any noise from the other rooms. Nice desk and fixtures in the room itself. The bathroom was not the greatest and the shower had low pressure, but the bed was extremely comfortable. Staffing was strange - it seemed like there were only 2 people who worked there - the bell captain and the reception desk person, and they had a hard time handling the 4 people in the lobby when we got there - not sure if this was because it was a Sunday.	
Oct 15 2009 	Don't go there	The first room we were given was dark,very small and extremely noisy. The staff leave the radio on in the room in a vain attempt to drown it out ! We were told that we couldn't move as the hotel was full that night. The receptionist seemed to be expecting our complaint and moved us the next day. The source of the noise is a huge air conditioning unit belonging to another hotel. We were moved to a room ten floors directly above and the noise was still annoying. Do not stay here if you like sleeping at night !I would be surprised if the rooms we stayed in would meet UK standards due to the noise levels.	
Oct 14 2009 	Excellent Location Comfortable and Friendly Hotel	A perfect hotel for a girls shopping trip to the Big Apple. Located a short walk from Lord &amp; Taylor and Macys and a few blocks from the subway at Grand Central Station with the express trains to Uptown and Downtown Manhattan. The rooms were a good size (by New York standards) with comfortable beds. The staff were friendly and helpful and check-in/check-out was quick and straightforward. The rate was excellent and included a more than adequate buffet style breakfast. I would happily stay at this hotel again.	
Oct 13 2009 	extremely comfortable	We liked 70 Park Avenue, our room was spacious and comfortable, for B&amp;B the rate (through travelzoo) was reasonable and above all the situation so close to Grand Central was great. The breakfast was most enjoyable. The position of the hotel was quiet and although we could hear the air conditioning unit it didn't stop us sleeping. Loads of useful touches we think, eg availability of an umbrella. The staff were very helpful, and we did need their help! The wine reception was most welcome...So, we wish there was a hotel in London to compare.	
Oct 12 2009 	Very nice space and spot right on Park Ave	I will return to the 70 Park Avenue Hotel now that I have found it. it's a terrific hotel with small (but NYC typical) rooms that are well laid out and comfortable. With its Kimpton touches, it makes one feel at home quickly. Plus it is away from the tumult of Times Square and only about a ten minute walk across town from Penn Station. It's about four bocks from Grand Central.	
Oct 8 2009 	good but not up to Kimpton standards	I've stayed in a number of Kimpton hotels and generally like them. The service at Kimpton hotels is generally very good, and 70 Park is consistent with this. The hotel has a small footprint and, for example, the elevators are small and somewhat slow, the lobby is smallish etc. Where 70 Park gets lower grades is on its overall appearance. As noted in several reviews, the place has a bit of a rundown feeling, the carpets and fixtures are worn, the rooms seem in need of sprucing up. Room rate was pretty good on promotion ($280/night), and the location is great, so not at all bad (I would give it sort of a 3.5 out of 5). I might be inclined to try a newer Kimpton property in NYC if I could get roughly the same rate.	
Oct 5 2009 	Excellent location decent hotel	Spent 1 night at 70 Park Avenue in October - overall stay was great, especially for the price paid (&lt;$200).We were arriving and departing from Grand Central - so the location was perfect (literally 2-3 blocks away). Lobby was relatively small - and included a small seating area, and tables with laptops to use (free wifi was also available throughout the hotel). We missed the afternoon wine reception, but seemed like a nice touch. Check-in was quick and easy, desk staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 2nd floor facing the street, at the end of the hallway. Street noise was not an issue at all. I'm assuming this wasn't one of the better rooms (2nd floor), but it was completely acceptable.Room was decent size for NYC - certainly not cramped. Bathroom was very large and clean. Bed was comfortable. Huge plasma screen TV and ipod dock were nice. Overall I wasn't blown away by the room, but for the amount of time we spent there it did the job - no complaints.When checking out we were asked if we wanted to store our bags at the hotel, which was great since we did not catch our train until that afternoon and weren't looking forward to carrying our bags around NYC for the day.Overall - highly recommended, especially if you're arriving/departing from Grand Central and want to stay in midtown.	
Sep 24 2009 	Never again...	This was my second visit to Manhattan.70 Park avenue Hotel I had checked in and they confirmed my reservation for a king deluxe room. They gave me my keys and sent me to a room on the 7th floor. I found it odd that the room was a step and a half right in front of the elevator doors. My first thought was this was going to be a noisy stay. I walked in to what was supposed to be a king deluxe room to find a tiny bed there. The room was terribly small. I knew this couldn't be right so I went back downstairs to ask the girl at reception what type of room that was. After playing on the computer for a minute she admitted that I had been &quot;downgraded&quot;. However, the price of the room was to remain the same rate as a king deluxe. She offered me a free continental breakfast to make up for it. I was quite angry. Not only was I downgraded but they tried to pass off the same rate as a king deluxe. I could get breakfast from starbucks down the street. I demanded a king room just as was reserved and confirmed. She told me there were no rooms left. I demanded that she find something upgraded in that case. Going back to her computer she miraculously found a king deluxe room. Off I went to the new room. Nobody helped me move my stuff I had to go up and down bringing keys and moving my bags. What service. When I brought the keys to the old room back, upon my arrival back to the new room there was a man in there, saying he was &quot;checking on the mini bar technical difficulties&quot;I did not like that. I didn't trust him not to poke around in my stuff. The mini bar was locked anyhow. So he never did &quot;fix&quot; it. Well I should have stayed in the previous one as this was the size of a shoebox with a bigger bed. I came to realize soon after that she placed me right beside the maintenance room that had a heavy door that would slam at least every 20 minutes throughout the entire night for the entire duration of my stay. Needless to say I did not sleep much after being jolted every 20 minutes. I was considering going back to reception to change rooms but was afraid of what they would come up with next, and wondered what other strange people would pop up in my room unexpectedly. The room is very dark, not many lights. The bathroom is miniscule. The blinds had brown stains all over them. The bedding had holes in it, as well as the sheets. Housekeeping changed the towels but did not clean the sink nor the bathtub. I have stayed in Manhattan before at the Hilton Garden Inn, and their rooms were immaculate and huge, that was luxury. I did not partake in the wine reception. I was too tired from lack of sleep and really didn't want much to do with anything else at this hotel.Instead I took a cab to the lounge at the Time hotel...now that was lovely.	
Sep 24 2009 	Good hotel in a quiet area	A nice, cosy hotel. walking distance to city center. The beds are big and great! The bathrooms however are a bit small.	
Sep 24 2009 	think again	this is a well situated hotel in which we had two different rooms for two recent stays within a few days of each other.The bathroom in one room was so difficult to enter,you almost had to be a contortionist.My real complaint was the fact that I received and paid two separate bills which were charged to my credit card ,but when I received my card account there was an item for several dollars charged the day we left.There were absolutely no extras to account for this,and onemailing the manager of the hotel as to the reason for this he or she failed to reply.Not the sort of treatment one expects at a so-called boutique hotel as they describe themselves	
Sep 21 2009 	Very nice - but noisy air conditioner on the next building at the side	Good value for money and included breakfast - great location !	
Sep 21 2009 	Comfortable 	My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate a &quot;girlfriends birthday weekend in NYC&quot; and was pleasantly surprised that this hotel was so lovely. We had a &quot;double double&quot; room on a high floor facing the quiet back courtyard. The room was light &amp; airy, with very confortable beds, which had down conforters and luxurious linens. The bathroom was a little small, but quite adequate, very clean, with quality amenities. The location was a short 2-3 block walk to the airport bus at Grand Central, and a few blocks to shopping and the Empire State Building. The wine reception every afternoon at 5PM in the lobby, allowed the guests to meet each other in a nice friendly atmosphere. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating and friendly, giving directions and recommendations for restaurants, and events in the city. The breakfast buffet was great. We took advantage of the special that added $1 to the room rate for the continental breakfast, which was perfect. The coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt, selection of rolls &amp; bagels, hard-boiled eggs, and fresh fruit salad couldn't have been better. They also had available for an extra charge, hot breakfasts with eggs, meat, etc.I will definately be back!	
Sep 18 2009 	Best Service in NYC	We returned to New York for our wedding anniversary and were welcomed to 70 Park Avenue with a bottle of champagne from the management. Our room was spacious and clean and we had a view of the Empire State Building from our window. The bed was huge and really comfortable. Bathroom was also a good size for NYC and the L'Occitane toiletries are a really nice touch. Location is good and just a couple of minutes walk from Grand Central. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff in the hotel, we forgot our blackberry charger and within 5 minutes the concierge had located one and sent it up to the room. Would highly recommend.	
Sep 14 2009 	Swanky!	I only stayed at this hotel for one evening but was VERY pleasantly surprised by the experience. I have unpleasantly surprised at some hotels in New York City but this was certainly the exception to the rule. The room was one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. The room was spacious, the bed was very comfortable and very well decorated. There's a large TV and a pleasant room design. This hotel also has a bar (with food) that was a nice surprise. It's within easy walking distance to Grand Central and it's a snap to get a taxi, even in the early morning hours. This was also a great deal and the cheapest place I found on short notice. I've almost paid as much to stay that places that were FAR inferior. I would love to stay here again.	
Sep 11 2009 	Great boutique hotel in the heart of Midtown	I stayed at 70 Park Avenue Hotel for six nights while I was in town for the US Open. This was my first time staying at this hotel, as well as my first trip New York City. I had a fantastic time in the City and loved everything about this hotel. The location is ideal.......only four blocks from Grand Central and walking distance to several sights, shops, and restaurants. Every single employee of the staff were friendly beyond expectations. Sophia (front desk) always greeted me by my name and made me feel welcomed. Christopher (concierge) was also very friendly and helpful. The doormen and housekeeping were very friendly too.....always saying hello with a smile whenever I passed by them. The rooms are small, but standard size for New York. And I found the room to be rather quaint, relaxing, and quiet. This will definitely be my hotel of choice next time I visit New York City.	
Sep 8 2009 	Small space but recommended	I have stayed at this location on multiple occasions for work travel, and each experience has been positive. This is a nice location very close to Grand Central Station and within walking distance of many resturants. I personally love the wine 'happy' hour that is offered in the late afternoon. It is great to walk in from a long day at work or travel and be offered a glass of wine to relax and welcome you to the hotel. I have not eaten at the resturant, but I have had a few glasses of wine with friends, and the staff is always very nice and willing to meet your every need. I would highly recommed this hotel for work or leisure, especially if traveling without children.	
Sep 4 2009 	standard hotel / fantastic service	We stayed here for three nights at the start of our honeymoon.We arrived at 1am after a nightmare trip from the uk after our travel agent thomas cook did their best to ruin our honeymoon to find a fairly standard hotel in a good location for tourists with friendly staff. On the second morning we asked at reception if we had any messages as our transfer fron the airport had not arrived and we forced to pay for cab.The receptionist said that there had been no messages but that she would contact the shuttle company to find out what had happened The pre-paid vouchers we had been given by thomas cook did not have the actual shuttle company name on them so the receptionist Googled what was on the vouchers and rang the first three companies on the search when they could not help she then rang thomas cook in the uk to find out what was going on. After putting her on hold for several minutes they then told her it was our fault for not phoning the shuttle company when we arrived at JFK.Showing customer care that was so lacking at thomas cook she told them not to be so stupid as she was not able to find the firm to contact the shuttle company even with access to Google.She then demanded to know the name of the shuttle company so she could find out what went wrong. On completion of that call she rang the shuttle company and was told that they knew nothing about our trip.She told them that that was not good enough and that we needed a return transfer to JFK the next morning and that she was going to stay on the line until they sorted that out with thomas cook which she did and 10mins later we had the transfer that thomas cook should have sorted out. In all this lady spent almost hour and made five phone calls sorting out a problem that was nothing to do with her or her hotel because she understands the meaning of the words customer service in a way that thomas cook would not know where to start and thats why I will be going back to this hotel but will never spend another penny with thomas cook. HINT (looking after customers is cheaper than advertising for new ones) The other staff were also helpful they got us into a fantastic steak house that was packed with an hours notice and when we got back to our room we found a bottle of cava on ice chocs and a congratulations card from the staff . Just to complete the service next morning when the shuttle was ten min late picking us up the staff noticed this and without being asked rang to ask why their guests were being kept waiting. Service is what makes or breaks a trip and thats why I'll be gioing back to this hotel	
Aug 25 2009 	Good location but thats it DISAPPOINTING	My wife and i chose this hotel because we have had great experiences in the past with Kimpton Hotels (DC &amp; Vancouver). The location was conveniently located close to Grand Central but other than that, theres not much else in the area. The bad: my wife and i went to breakfast at the Silverleaf Tavern and the hostess was too busy to acknowledge us, so we sat ourselves. When she finally came over to greet us, she asked us if we had the &quot;discount vouchers for breakfast&quot;. I assumed it something to do with being an &quot;IN TOUCH&quot; member with that plus I also received an envelope on arrival. So i inquired if i was suppose to receive that from the front desk during check in, she said &quot;yes&quot; and directed me to the front desk. when i inquired about it @ the front desk, the girl was rude and unattentive. instead of explaining to me that the breakfast voucher option was a prepaid choice during booking, she rudely denied me a voucher with no explanation. we were hungry so it stayed for breakfast anyways. service was terrible and the &quot;buffet&quot; was limited with very few options. the server never came to refresh my coffee or offer us a refill on OJ. To my surprise the bill was $64+ a 18% gratuity was added. RIDICULOUS!!!!!!! The rooms were small and lacked lighting. I've stayed in dozens of hotels in Manhattan and i expect the rooms to be smaller but when you chose Kimpton Hotels, you expect a certain standard. This hotel does not meet the expectations of Kimpton name. Wine reception: was served a dirty glass twice. one had lipstick on it still.Checkout was slow and unorganized and door attendants were unhelpful with our bags.I doubt i'll return.	
Aug 25 2009 	Five star service!	I just came back from a 4 night stay at the 70 Park avenue hotel. I always have the best time when I am in New York and my hotel stays are very important to me. I love staying in hotels! This was my first time at this particular one. I will list the pros and the cons about this establishment.PROS:*The service: This hotel gets a 5 star for the service it offers its clients. The employees go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Everyone is professional and courteous. The concierge even called me to ask me if she could do something for me. They have a wine reception from 5 to 6 in the lobby where they offer you a complimentary glass of wine. This is a nice way to meet other guests. *The location: You are next door to Grand Central terminal, subways, buses. It is very central.*Peacefulness: It is a hotel that caters to an older clientele so you don't hear yelling in the hallways at 3 AM from partygoers. I enjoyed that because I go to bed early so I can enjoy a full day in the city. I did not hear a single thing from the other rooms even though they were occupied. I appreciated that very much.*Kimpton loyalty program: You get some perks if you enroll in their loyalty program. You get free wifi in your room.....15$ from the minibar....free nights after eligible stays...CONS:*The rooms: This hotel has definitely seen better days. It was designed many years ago and it shows. It is very traditional. I was assigned a room that is a queen room but I know what a queen bed is and this was not one! It was a double bed. I thought the room would have been bigger. SInce I was alone, it was more than fine but a couple would find it a bit too snuggly. You have an armoire for your clothes but no drawers for your underwear and such. You have to put them at the bottom of the armoire. Paint was peeling off the bathroom ceiling, there is no fan in it and the door could use a coat of paint. These are all minor things that can irritate the hell out of you if you paid 300$. Since I got an excellent rate, 159$ per night even though the hotel was full, I did not complain. That said, I would go back because of the service and the location. Like I said, this hotel gives a 5 star service and I commend them for that. I stayed at other hotels more luxurious than this one but where I would not go back because I thought the service was next to non-existent. Paint you can put on but great service is hard to find.	
Aug 20 2009 	Incredible stay at 70 Park Ave!	Wonderful Boutique hotel in NYC!This review is LONG overdue. We stayed here for a whirlwind weekend visit in February 2008, in celebration of my boyfriend's birthday. (And to see Eddie Izzard at the Union Sq Theater!). It was my boyfriend's first trip to NYC, and it was very memorable.We had a beautiful corner room on the 17th floor, with views of both the Empire State Building and Park Ave. The concierge, Jennifer, was amazing. She helped to make our stay completely unforgettable. She really went the extra mile to make our trip special. I can't thank her enough!We had an issue with the plumbing in the bathroom upon our arrival, and maintenance arrived within 15 mins from when we alerted the front desk to the problem. Prompt service!The bed was comfortable... and the slippers, and robes were a lovely touch. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay. We would love to stay there again during an upcoming trip to NYC, but have been unable to find any rooms in our price range for January 2010. I don't know if things have changed there since our visit in Feb. 2008, but unfortunately the prices certainly have.	
Aug 18 2009 	Very disappointing!	My husband &amp; I have stayed at Kimpton hotels in Washington DC, and loved them! That's why we decided to try this hotel for a spontaneous trip into NYC for a few days. The room was very old, very small and very dingy. The bathroom was so tiny that no human being could sit on the toilet in the conventional way. And we were shocked that we did not have the YES cable channel. We couldn't watch the end of the Yankee game when we returned to our room after dinner.	
Aug 17 2009 	Wow- not what I expected at all. Two thumbs WAY down.	My fiance and I have stayed at other Kimpton hotels (In NYC, we have stayed at the Muse and the service was impeccable), but 70 Park Ave is not up to par. Things that were a major inconvenience:1. The air conditioner in our room was not as cool as we anticipated. Apparently, it is on some sort of wireless system and it shuts off if there is no movement in the room. To be fair, someone did come to change the air filter, but it was still mediocre. 2. The concierge gave us instructions to catch a train that did not run on the weekends. We waited for 45 minutes in a sweltering subway station, missed plans with friends we were meeting, and remained off-track the entire day.3. There are no free ice cream bars. I know this seems petty, but if you are advertising it on 50 signs throughout the hotel, someone should run up the street to Duane Reed and get a pack to keep on hand, for integrity's sake.4. I asked for an extra sheet for our room (which was tiny, cramped and not at all like the photograph). I waited an hour and called back a second time requesting it..5. I asked for a fan. They sent up a rickety fan that did not work properly. I ended up buying a travel fan and using that..Overall, the location was the only good thing. I was really disappointed with the hotel. It felt like I was at a Red Roof Inn, not a Kimpton hotel. I will probably be spending my money at a Hilton from now on.Good Luck!	
Aug 10 2009 	This was our anniversary and sadly...the hotel put a damper on it....	I am loyal to Kimpton hotels, having had very positive experiences in other cities, so I expected the same when booking this hotel for an overnight stay to celebrate my anniversary. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, no one was there to greet us at the curb. We waited for a bit for someone to come out to take our car and no one came. Eventually we drove around, found a parking lot, parked our car, and walked to the hotel with our bags. When we got to the desk to check in, the first thing we were told was that we were going to have to be moved to another hotel because they had overbooked at this hotel. I was clearly upset at this, and then out of nowhere, we were told that someone just cancelled, and we were handed a key to a room. The room we got was tiny, which would have been fine, except the tv was broken. Given that we had planned this night to celebrate our anniversary, we were looking to at least relax and enjoy our day and night. I can certainly say that the hotel portion of our stay was the opposite of relaxing and enjoyable, and that was due to how the check in process was handled from the moment we walked in to the hotel. In addition, we received little help from doormen, etc. We hailed all of our own cabs, as no one offered to help us, and we witnessed doormen texting and paying little attention to guests.  The experience would not have been so bad if it hadn't started so badly. I think it terribly inappropriate to overbook your hotel and then try to ship people off somewhere else because you made a mistake. That is the opposite of good customer service. It makes the customer feel unwanted. I would not stay there again and I would not recommend the hotel to anyone else.	
Aug 9 2009 	if it wasnt for the free parking would try something else	our first night we checked into a room on the 2nd floor and all we could hear was a loud humming coming from outside the window but couldn't look out because they were covered with plastic privacy paper. It was the a/c unit for the hotel next door. We called the desk but they said they were completely booked and couldn't move us until tomm. Next day moved us to smaller room and there was a gap at the bottom of the door and it was very loud from the hall. we were lying in bed and could hear every conversation going on. It was clean, good location for subway use, took forever to get our car from valet. We have friends who recommended the hotel and stayed few weeks earlier and loved it and it was very quiet for them so may be hit or miss. the concierge was very good and friendly, front desk staff so so.	
Aug 3 2009 	A Great Place to Stay 	I stayed at 70 Park Ave. Hotel for 4 nights. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly, and responsive to my needs. They made my trip a very memorable one. My room was clean, well cared for and easy to access. The evening wine social was extremely nice and very good after a day of work and lots of walking. A great wat to unwind. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC who wants a 4-5 star hotel with a rating of 4.0 or better out of 5 in survey responses. Thank you 70 Park Ave Hotel staff for such a great stay!	
Aug 2 2009 	Another Nice Stay	I stayed here a year ago and liked it very much. During my last two trips to New York, the rooms were not in my price range, but I was able to get a wonderful rate through an on-line promotion, and was very happy to be back again for four nights last week. Staff was very accommodating (special thanks to José at the front desk who extended my stay for two more nights at the same rate). The room, though not large, had everything I could ask for (except for a bit too much noise from a loud generator motor or something outside my window). The staff is friendly and professional with all the little things that so many hotels seem to overlook (concierge actually knows the area, wake-up calls were delivered on-time, wireless internet worked, I sent a file from my laptop in my room to the front desk and they printed it and delivered it to my room right away, etc...) Wireless internet is free if you join the Kimpton In-Touch program. In-Touch members also get a &quot;raid the mini-bar&quot; coupon. Nice extra touches in the room like posh robes and large umbrellas to use during your stay. The hotel feels very clean. The lobby is pleasant. I also appreciate Kimpton's eco-friendly policies and will choose a Kimpton hotel for that reason alone when it is affordable.	
Jul 28 2009 	A nice little midtown treasure	I go to NYC about once a month for brief business trips. I feel comfortable navigating the city so I don't really care where in Manhattan I stay in terms of location but want to get the best price on a 4 or 5 star hotel. I go for clean and safe which is not easy to find in NYC in anything below a 4 star rated hotel.I chose this hotel because I had a promotional code from Kimpton and the price was under $200 a night. This is a small little place. If you are going for atmosphere in the lobby or a great street, this is not really the right thing. The room was clean and luxurious. The bed was comfortable. The room had a huge flat screen television. My room was on the 7th floor and faced Park Avenue and was actually quite noisy. Other than that, it was a great, clean, nice place to stay. The staff was very friendly. The location is great, a couple of blocks down the street from Grand Central. I would definitely stay there again.	
Jul 22 2009 	Excellent hotel - great stay!	We have just stayed at 70 park avenue and found the hotel to be in a fantastic location with lovely staff and lots of nice little touches. This was our first time in the US and this hotel certainly made us feel very welcome. The wine reception each evening was lovely and greatly appreciated after a day out and about in the busy city. The location is great for sightseeing with bus routes and subway stations just a few minutes walk away - we hardly used them though as the weather was nice so we walked almost everywhere. This is a great place to stay and we would visit again.	
Jul 20 2009 	Nice hotel with great staff	I have stayed in several Kimpton properties, and have enjoyed each one. This one is no exception. I took my daughter here to see some shows, and enjoy NYC for her birthday weekend. This is absolutely the smallest Kimpton hotel room I have stayed in, but for NYC, it was a well-above average room. And we were upgraded to a king sized room. But for the price we paid (in Manhattan!), the value absolutely cannot be beat.The staff is commendable, especially their &quot;do-everything&quot; doorman Santiago. We were very impressed with his service -- actually saw him run down to the end of the block to help a family getting out of a cab and carry their bags back to the hotel. He helped us with restaurant recommendations and directions several times. The reservation had our room rate wrong, and it was promptly fixed by the front desk without the slightest fuss. Since they had the room ready, we were allowed to check in before check-in time, again, no fuss there.The location is great if you want to be a 15 minute walk from the bustling Times Square, but don't want the crowds and hectic nature of that place. It's also only 4 blocks from Grand Central, and less than 10 minute walk from Empire State Building (which we could clearly see out of our room window, an added bonus). Quick bites in the morning (delis for bagels, McDonald's, etc.) are all within 2 blocks.Nice things:1) SOOOO comfortable bed2) Nice flat panel TV3) Wine reception4) Computers at concierge table for guest use.5) Prompt and fast housekeeping (our room was fully serviced by lunchtime)There were a couple of disappointments, all minor1) Bathrooms tiny but quite stylish.2) Windows need better soundproofing3) Room service must get ice (even with ice buckets in rooms).4) Lack of much children's programming on TV (no Nick or Disney!!! Yikes). Might not matter for you depending on your situation. We weren't in the room much, so no big deal.5) Room service menu priced beyond all comprehension (that's OK, I never order it anyway)	
Jul 17 2009 	Great hotel - location service cleanliness	Five of us stayed at 70 Park Ave recently and were not disappointed with the hotel in anyway. Two of us shared one of the larger King rooms which have a lot more space than the smallest ones. So, if you plan to stay in the hotel for long periods of time, I recommend a larger room. The concierge was very helpful with lunch recommendations, the staff was very courteuous, and the bartender delivered some awesome cocktails.	
Jul 13 2009 	A great gem right down the street from Grand Central	Stayed here with friends on a weekend trip to NYC to catch a show and some nightlife. i've stayed in a lot of different hotels in the city and this is now my hotel of choice. Can't beat the location, the lobby is beautiful, the staff is very friendly (make sure to sign up for the Kimpton InTouch program if you are not already a member- you get free snacks and stuff.) The wine reception is very cool, the tv and other tech gadgetry is up to date and top notch, and the beauty products provided in the bathrooms are high quality. I love this place. It represents an EXCELLENT value. We are going back aug 1 for another broadway weekend excursion and I hope the trip will be just as lovely.	
Jul 13 2009 	A perfect Anniversary Weekend at 70 Park Ave.	My husband &amp; I decided on a trip to NYC w/o kids for our anniversary. After scouring many different hotel sites I had narrowed it down to 2 and 70 Park had a deal I couldn't refuse.Location: Central to midtown and an easy cab or subway ride to the east village/nolita &amp; the Lower east side. We found it to be an extremely safe and mellow area on the weekend. If you are coming into Grand Central it is 3 short blocks to stroll no cab necessary.Lobby:Small but nicely furnished &amp; very boutique-y. Bellman was very friendly and there were computers by the concierge that could be used. Iced lemon water, apples and the New York Times were available to guests.Wine Reception: What a pleasant event. Every evening a wine reception is held - and as it was summer we had delicious white sangria &amp; another cabernet sauvignon to choose from. A nice way to kick off the evening before heading out to dinner. (the bar also had a seriously good happy hour with $5.00 cocktails and discounted nibbles post-wine reception)Room: We had reserved a King Premier room and were graciously upgraded. We had a great view , the bathroom was GORGEOUS with a jacuzzi tub and a separate tiled shower stall. We had absolutely no issues with street noise and we were facing Park Ave. The bed was as good if not better than the Westin Heavenly Bed or the beds at the W. Tons of pillows which I love. Bath amenities were plentiful and there were many nice touches like evening turn-down, pillow chocolates and very plush robes. Rooms were not small but on par with typical NYC hotels. Huge HD TV too.Staff: Everyone we encountered was very helpful &amp; friendly and many wished us a happy anniversary. Summary: We loved it and will return - the location is perfect for us and we enjoyed the more personal yet upscale feel of this Klimpton property. Note: Halls and public areas are very well lit and if I was a solo female business traveler I would feel safe here.	
Jul 1 2009 	70 Park Ave Hotel- Beautiful Hotel Incredible Service	I always stay at 70 Park Ave Hotel when I travel to NY on business (or for any reason). The hotel is immaculate, the location is fantastic, the service is impeccable and the staff will take care of your every need. I always feel comfortable and- most importantly- at home when I come here. The hotel cares about every guest and every detail. A refreshing change from Hyatt, Marriott, Westin and other chains.	
Jun 26 2009 	Great location but unfriendly staff and poor plumbing.	$60 per night for parking with NO in/out privilege. About $300 per night for our room, which was about as good as I could find in Manhattan, that seemed like a nice place. The lobby had stained carpet and the apples in the bowl had rotten spots...not too attractive when you first walk in. Although it is an old building, the room furnishings were nice. Nice linens. However, the plumbing needs updated. Drain in tub didn't work, and it took forever for them to send someone up to fix it, but he didn't have the part, so he substituted something else. Very low water pressure. They never did anything about it.Staff, including manager, was not friendly at all. Since the plumbing never got fixed the entire 3 days we were there, they reluctanly took off one day of parking, after I almost begged. They tried to charge us for an extra day of parking, anyway, so the manager was convinced he'd given us 2 free days. We tried explaining that we weren't there 3 full days, yet he wanted to charge us for 4 days.Great location. You can see the front of Grand Central Station when you walk out of the hotel and look left.	
Jun 22 2009 	Needs an update...badly.	I just returned from a 2-night stay with my boyfriend and was somewhat disappointed by the hotel. The lobby was nice...free wine in the evenings is a great touch and the staff were hospitable, but the actual rooms desperately need a re-vamp. Our room seemed dingy and dark and if you're even close to six feet tall, good luck trying to use the toilet....we both had to sit with our legs off to the side! While the shower pressure was great, we literally had to perform acrobatics over the toilet to get into the shower. Also, the walls seem paper thin and the windows need double glazing - we heard every taxi horn from the street below. I've stayed in many other NYC hotels on the same level and most have soundproof windows at least. My only other complaint is that there were trolleys full of towels and used laundry left in the hallway near our room....a small detail, surely, but it didn't help the overall asthetics.All in all, I don't think I'd stay here again as there are other hotels in the same price range that offer more for your money.	
Jun 19 2009 	Recommendable Hotel	Really do not expect much from this hotel. It´s just recommendable.It has a great location and full service for businessman.Try to take your booking in advance to take the best available rate.The room are very cozy and the price was average for the time we booked.Overall experience was ok.	
Jun 17 2009 	Fantastic!!	I have recently returned from a four night stay at 70 Park Avenue, and what a wonderful stay it was. The staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The room was beautifully decorated, and the beds a dream to sleep in. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building from our bedroom window. The Hotel is conveniently located in a quiet area, but within easy walking distance to Fifth Ave, Broadway and only two blocks from Grand Central Station which made it really easy for us to get around.The Wine Tasting, every evening from 5-6pm was a good idea and the attached bar had happy hour from 5-7pm. There is a Starbucks one block away that opened at 6am, great for those early mornings, and Scottys Diner on 39th and Lexington does wonderful breakfast.Overall a fantastic stay and I will be returning as soon as I can!	
Jun 9 2009 	We loved this hotel.	Comfortable and plush without being stuffy. A lovely spacious room that was a pleasure to come back to in the evening. Very nice, helpful staff. A N.Y Times waiting for us outside our room every morning.And perhaps the best location on Manhattan for exploring both uptown and downtown.	
May 31 2009 	What a wonderful find	We booked 70 Park Avenue, we wanted it to be away from the rush of Times Square. I e-mailed the Hotel in advance as this was a trip for my wife's retirement from her school. We landed at New York at 11am and were at the Hotel at Midday. The reception although not huge was very welcoming. The receptionist who greeted us was Melissa. She was lovely, very welcoming and made us feel at ease immediately and throughout our stay.We had booked a King Premier room. We were surprised but delighted when told we had been upgraded to a suite on the 17th (top) floor. (If you want a bit of luxury, its worth it). Despite our early arrival our room was ready for us.The room was very big with a large bathroom with jacuzzi bath. Best of all, it had a balcony on two sides. One overlooking Park Ave towards Grand Central Station and the other side at the Empire State Building (WOW). Throughout our stay of 4 nights we were made to feel very welcome. Melissa never forgot our name and it was very much more personal than some large hotels in the City. The Manager also took the time, when we asked to view other rooms, to show us.We did not have time to attend the wine evenings, but saw they were very well attended.We went to the Top of the Rock for the first time, brilliant, no real queues and for me better than the Empire State Building.All in all, we had a great time in NYC and stayed at a lovely Hotel, being away from Times Sq was really nice. Grand Central is 5 mins walk and Times Sq 1 stop on the Metro.Would we stay at 70 Park Avenue again? - Without Question	
May 29 2009 	All in all a great stay in a fantastic city!	We have just returned from our first visit to NYC and this hotel was a fantastic part to a superb holiday. We booked through Expedia and got a great deal including flights.The hotel is in the perfect location - few minutes walk form Grand Central and right in the heart of the famous NY sights - Empire State building and the Chrysler building. It was perfect being so close to everything and not having to travel far to visit other sights.When we arrived at the hotel, unfortunately the room we had booked was not available to us. However, the hotel did everything they could to help us - they put us in a temporary room on the 17th floor with amazing views and gave us complimentary breakfast vouchers and a mini bar raid voucher. The room was fine for a shower and sleep after a long day travelling from the UK. The following day they moved us to our king deluxe room on the 15th floor which was amazing. It was extremely clean, had a lot of space - lovely seating area over looking the city streets and Grand Central, amazing bathroom with plenty of mirrors and gorgeous products which were replenished regularly, large plasma tv, massive comfy bed, quiet air conditioning, cosy dressing gowns, free wi-fi. A great room to stay in after a long day sightseeing.All of the staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and were happy to provide you with items that you needed - I requested hair straightners and got them 5 mins later. The concierge were helpful in printing off boarding passes and were available if you needed anything. The bell boys were friendly and there to help.The wine reception, which was held in the lobby every evening from 5 til 6, was a great added touch and was well deserved after shopping/sightseeing. The attached bar had happy hour from 5 til 7 with some tasty cosmos and other cocktails at resonable prices.All in all a great stay in a fantastic city!	
May 22 2009 	Such a cute hotel!	I stayed in NYC for the dates of 5/11-5/14 on a business trip. I chose the 70 Park Avenue due to its location and decor. Overall I was very pleased, and my impression just got better and better throughout the week. I have broken my review out below into different categories: HOTEL: The lobby is very nicely decorated inside, although I thought the spot between the elevators and the restaurant were very cramped. I was never able to take advantage of the wine and cheese reception because it ended at 6 and the timing was never right. RESTAURANT/BAR: The women who was the supervisor of the morning breakfast was awesome! She was very accomodating and always went out of her way to make sure you had everything you needed. In the bar, the evening bar tender (girl with short brown hair) was GREAT! It was nice talking to her while I dined solo at the bar. BELL STAFF: These guys were amazing! They always opened the door for you and were always there to grab a cab. ROOMS: Very nicely decorated. Small, but that was okay with me as I wastraveling alone. I had no view, which I would've loved to have had. The only major complaint I had about the rooms was that they were very dim. Overall, great stay and I would definently stay again. This hotel is in a great location for business or a relaxing romantic weekend. If you are looking for more of a party atmosphere, I might choose a different neighborhood, as Murray Hill is very quiet at night.	
May 17 2009 	Modern clean and convenient	Great hotel in heart of Manhattan. The rooms are cozy and modern and the hotel bar is wonderful. V. close to Grand Central.	
May 11 2009 	Great Value in Mid-Town	My husband took me to NY City for Mothers Day and we had a fabulous time. We stayed at the Kimpton at 70 Park Avenue. Kimpton Hotels are rapidly becoming my favorite choice for a city hotel. We joined In Touch, their loyalty program which have us free WiFI, a $15 raid the minibar voucher, and wonderful concierge service. We took the train from Wadhington and they also offer a significant Ride the Rails discount - 20% off their best rate if you arrive in the city by Train, We paid $149 for a very nice room on the 16th floor. You cannot beat that in the heart of Manhattan. There is free coffee in the morning and a wine reception in the evening, plush bathrobes, and Occitaine amenities It is pet-friendly but Yes the bathroom is incredibly small. But in exchange we got lots of usable space in the bedroom including a good size desk, an entry way, TWO chairs, lots of electrical outlets, a flat screen TV, a great stereo system, and room to walk around. I recommend this hotel highly.	
May 6 2009 	My new favorite hotel	I was a little worried after reading the few poor reviews re: the hotel. But I am so happy to report that 70 Park Ave. was awesome. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms (although not huge - but what do you expect - it's NYC) were very clean and comfortable. The lighting was a little low, but it was fine. Our view was of a brick building, but I didn't mind because we didn't have street noise to worry about. The beds were very comfortable too. I LOVED the location. It was in a mostly residential neighborhood, but only 2 blocks from Grand Central Station which made getting anywhere a breeze. This has become my hotel of choice when I am in NYC - I am planning another trip in the fall and will definately stay at 70 Park Ave.	
Apr 24 2009 	Unexpected gem steps from Grand Central	Found an incredible deal through Travelzoo and booked it even though I didn't know much about it. Much to my relief, my experience mirrors the better reviews here and I had a wonderful stay.First off, follow the advice of other reviewers here and sign up for the Kimpton rewards program. I got free wifi, a $15 mini-bar credit and even a room upgrade. (It was January, so I doubt they can do this in high season.) I got a corner room and was worried about the noise from the street like others have mentioned but I didn't notice it at all. What I did notice was that my room was beautiful! Seriously, most hotel rooms look alike, but this room had character. Beautiful and understated elements, huge bed with cozy bedding. The tv's at an odd angle but it worked.The bathroom was quite nice but had one very strange feature: the toilet was put in almost flush with the wall. So, you almost had to sit at an angle. I know space is tight in NY but that's a little ridiculous. Other than that it was a pretty great bathroom with good amenities from L'Occitaine. And bonus: they delivered the Sunday NY Times to my door. Fabulous!I didn't spend any time in the lobby area, which was much smaller that I expected, but there did seem to be computers set up for people to use. The front desk staff was helpful when I checked in and out, but returning later in the evenings I just got unhappy glances rather than a hello. Kind of strange.As for the location, you're 4 very short blocks to Grand Central and the bus to JFK is right there. Couldn't be better situated, really, since you're close to transportation yet not in a touristy, crowded area.	
Apr 23 2009 	Ok but nothing special.	Stayed at 70 Park Avenue for 5 days in April 2009. We chose the hotel based on price because so close to the Easter period hotel prices seemed to be spiraling upwards. THE GOOD - On the whole our stay at 70 Park Avenue was fine. The room was OK sized for New York and broadly speaking we couldn't fault the cleanliness. The staff on the few occasions we encountered them, were helpful and friendly. The room and the showers seemed quite new. A great flat screen TV as well as a DVD player. An ipod docking station was provided.New York Times was delivered every day. The concierge helped us book restaurants for dinner and even had Pizza delivery menus for the rainy day. Free Wifi in the room if you choose the option to become a Kimpton Member - basically sign up to their newsletter for free and get free internet access. Otherwise it is $11 a day to have wifi in the room. THE NOT SO GOOD. The room was very poorly lit and several of the light fixtures weren't working. We had a room on the 6th floor and the view was of a concrete wall. The bathroom had no window and very little ventilation.No shower gel or toothpaste was provided and housekeeping were very stingy with the L'Occitane bathroom products. They didn't leave enough shampoo or moisturiser for two and didn't always replace things. Overall 70 Park Avenue is OK but it can't really be called a boutique hotel. I've stayed in NYC many times in many different locations and compared to my stays on the Lower East Side and Greenwich Village, this neighbourhood was far too quiet and without enough of a buzz in the evening. Time Square is close by but if you've been to New York before and already done all that touristy stuff then this hotel isn't in the greatest location. The hotel was pretty good value for money (since NYC is so expensive) and rooms are clean and in really good condition but be prepared to take the subway or cabs downtown for nightlife.	
Apr 19 2009 	I've been back already - lovely but affordable boutique hotel in great location	We stayed here on our first trip to New York three years ago and loved it - so when we found out a friend was getting married in New York we know we'd go back, and took friends with us.The location is perfect - just a couple of blocks walk to Grand Central Station, and the main shopping streets - it's so central we walked pretty much everywhere the whole trip.The staff are very helpful and there's a great funky but relaxed vibe to the hotel - and it smells amazing from the moment you walk in the door!The rooms aren't huge but they are well done with all the facilities - and this is New York so for the price they were ideal.Little touches are fab too - a tray of goodies (which you do pay for but much better than the average mini-bar snacks, and lots of New York books to help you make the most of your time. They'll even print out your boarding pass for you if you complete a short form, and there's a complimentary wine reception for new arrivals every evening.Apart from the usual attractions - a couple of others we really enjoyed - The Campbell Apartment just inside Grand Central Station isn't cheap but has a great vibe and worth a visit for drinks. The food at Michael Jordan's restaurant - also in the station - was surprisingly good, and don't miss out on Junior's cheesecake. But one of my absolute favourites was Cafe Wha? out in Greenwich Village - a fantastic night out if you liike live music, but do book ahead if you're in a group and check out the website first to see if it's your thing - best night we had in New York by far.	
Apr 17 2009 	Expected 4 STAR received 2 STAR	Sadly, I read the reviews on this site. I went to expedia and saw great reviews. Love the Murray Hill area of NYC, so I said, why not? We wanted to stay at a 4 star hotel in NYC to celebrate SPRING with the kids while they were out of PreSchool.The photos online looked great. The description of the Kimpton &quot;kid friendly&quot; service was what sealed the deal. We didnt want to bother other folks at the hotel when our 3 year old wants to show his behind.Remember, we thought we were going to a 4 star hotel for the $325/night price. We chose this hotel because of what others reviewed on it.CHECK IN1. The lobby was a lot more dated than the photos show. they have a wonderful photographer. :)2. We were not offered our kimpton kids welcome pack, which was sad, cause i kind of pumped it up a bit to my kids to get them all excited about their mini-vacation. 3. Bell Hop service was not available.The ROOMS (We had two rooms side by side)1. Bathroom was not cleaned and mold in the shower/tub grout. 2. Much smaller than the pictures show3. Bathrom was more of a closet than a bathroom. Using the toilet, knees literally hit the wall.4. Grandma Chic is too nice of way to describe the decor. 5. Carpets in both rooms were old/stained/in desperate need of a cleaning6. Windows were dirty/dusty window seals7. Wall paper was peeling/ripped in some places8. wires were hanging from behind the wall mounted TV (Not power cords09. NO coffee Maker? 10. Ice bucket, yet no ice11. $16 for a karaffe of coffee that gives 3 cups (.includes $4 delivery fee, and 20% tip)12. $30 for an omlette...(includes $4 delivery fee, not the 20% tip)13. One outlet by the TV had 7 electronic items plugged into it, it looked like a major fire hazard, and being on the 14th floor, was a bit nerve wracking.14. Furniture, TV, wine glasses, tables, bed side tables all had at least 1/4 inch dust on them.15. Baseboard Moldings: Need of a major paint job/cleaning.CHECK OUT(Checked out at 9am)1. Very slow process. There were about 7 people checking in/checking out. 1 person working the desk.2. Their site stated that could arrange a stroller rental. I asked the front desk person when checking out since we were locking our luggage in storage for the day, would they help us get another stoller for the day (our 4 year old decided he had enough 5 mile walks). She stated NO. I said, but your site says you can do it. She replied, NOPE, we cant help you.WE CANT HELP YOU..... isnt that the kiss of death at a hotel, much less a 4 STAR hotel. 3. The Bell Hop took forever to give us our storage tickets4. Nobody was to help us to the car when picking up luggage later that evening.Okay, the positives:1. Hotel Rep, Matt S, tried helping us by offering dinner or breakfest on them. However, after seeing the attention they gave their rooms, I was not dining in their eating areas.Would have been nice to have a credit or some sort of value given back to me without having to ask... didnt happen.2. They did regrout the moldy tub, which once completed, was great. We didnt complain about the room that was moldy too. My suggestion is they should inspect their tubs.3. Wonderful location.4. Starbucks is less than a 100 yards away5. Good apples in the lobby. (be sure to wash)All in all, it was an okay stay. i would not recommend this hotel if you need to actually stay in the hotel. If you are just using it to lay your head at the end of a long day and getting up right away, than it would be okay if cleaned better.	
Apr 16 2009 	perfect location cosy hotel	We spent 5 nights at 70 park Avenue, and were delighted with this choice of hotel. The room was a good size, the bed comfortable and our jacuzzi bath, the little bit of luxury we hoped for!Reception staff at the hotel and helpful and friendly, as are the guys who help with bags etc. However we didn't spend much time actually in the receeption area and didn't shre in a wine tasty session, though did see these events taking place.We were there to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday and having informed the hotel that this was our plan, we were treated to a bottle of bubbly and yummy cake on arrival to our room - a really lovely surprise!70 Park Avenue is 5 minutes walk from grand central station, the empire state building is just around the corner and the chrysler building is leterally at the end of the street. To get a real sense of what its like to be in Midtown Manhattan, we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay.We would recommend you do your city sight seeing from 'Top of the Rock' - the views are exceptional and rather than being inside the empire state building, you get to take photos of it from here!Take the red city bus tours = Greyline - the tour guides are great and you can hop on and hop off these services.Have a good time in New York!	
Apr 13 2009 	Great Location Great Staff Very Nice Rooms!	This is one of my favorite NYC hotels! The location is great, the staff is excellent, the rooms are very clean and spacious. I am a little bias to Kimpton Hotels and this place is one to beat in the city. If you want to stay near the Empire State, Grand Central, Times Square, and Central Park, this is your place.	
Apr 13 2009 	Clean friendly hotel. Good deal for the money.	Stayed here for three nights in a Queen Deluxe room. Hotel itself is starting to look a little tired around the edges, but is overall well maintained. The room was on the small side, but clean, and comprehensively appointed. Bed was very comfortable. Room itself seemed to be overlooking some kind of ventilation shaft and there was constant hum from the air-conditioners down below (even from 9th floor) so if you are particularly noise sensitive be aware of these rooms (though perhaps not as bad as rooms looking onto street). Staff were all friendly and helpful. Wine tastings in the evening are a nice touch, and the ambience overall is casual and friendly. Location is good - comfortable walking distance to Times Square and Central Park. I would stay here again.	
Apr 12 2009	Great Hotel in New York City	I just got back from a three day drip over the long Easter weekend with my ten year old daughter to New York City. We got a great price $149.00 a night and stayed at 70 Park Avenue Hotel. It was a lovely small hotel that looked like it had been recently redone. Our room was a good size for New York with modern but warm decor. The room was spotless clean and the staff was lovely. They had fresh coffee in a cafe off the lobby every morning and served a breakfast buffet every morning. The breakfast was delicious. Every evening they have a wine reception in the lobby. The hotel was in a quiet area but very conveniently located in mid town just 2.5 blocks south of Grand Central Station. My daughter and I felt very safe the whole trip and could easily hop the subway or walk to wherever we wanted to go. I would definitely stay in the hotel again and would recommend it to a friend. The staff was also very friendly to children.	
Apr 4 2009 	Great Location Friendly Staff	We spent two nights here when we were in Manhattan on business. The location is great -- Murray Hill is a good neighborhood with plenty of places to eat and drink, and the hotel is right down the street from Grand Central, so it's easy to get anywhere.The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating as they always are at Kimpton properties. The wine reception in the evening is a nice Kimpton touch also.Our king room was an okay size, but the layout left something to be desired. it was hard to work at the desk because the chair backed up to the foot of the bed and the large screen TV was just above the desk. I don't go to New York to watch TV, but it was NCAA tournament weekend and my team was playing. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't get CBS, which is rather amazing since the studios are just a few blocks away. When I asked about the reason, I was given vague answers about the signal being hard to get in Murray Hill, or maybe it's because they're moving the transmission towers. I think it probably has something to do with the digital transition, but that's just a guess. The TV was not so hot either, even though it was a 42-inch flat panel. It took forever to warm up, and the picture was never very clear. My only other complaint with the room is that there was no coffee pot. They offer complimentary coffee in the hotel restaurant, but who wants to have to get dressed and mingle with people for that first cup of coffee in the morning? It's a minor detail, but it puzzled me that there was an ice bucket in the room when there were no ice machines anywhere, yet no coffee pot.The decor was nice, the bed was unbelievably comfortable, and the bathroom amenities were first class. The wireless connection was good, and they have a business center in the lobby where you can print out boarding passes for your flight home.I would stay here again and highly recommend it, especially if you don't care about watching TV.	
Mar 16 2009 	Cute Hotel- Centrally Located	Centrally located to Grand Central, in midtown, away from the craziness of Times Square, 70 Park Avenue is a great little hotel. The lobby and rooms are small, but cozy. The staff was really friendly and accommodated my need for an earlier check-in. I love Kimptons because most of them have ipod docking stations and easy (free!) internet access. My only complaint is that the service at the Silver Leaf Tavern (hotel restaurant next door) wasn't the greatest.	
Mar 16 2009 	It's been 2 years and I still think about this hotel	Ok, so I've been a little slow to write my 1st hotel review, b/c I'm not generally the kind of person who lends his influence to somebody else's vacation decision, but after reading a few of the reviews about 70 Park Ave, I feel like I need to describe one of the finest hotel experiences I have ever had. It has been 2 years since I've stayed at 70 Park, and certainly things change, but from the experience I had, I can tell you that I would definitely consider this hotel again. It's true, the halls are narrow, as is the elevator, and there is some noise outside on Park Avenue (because it's New York...but it didn't bother us at all). The reason I write this, though, is because we were privy the best, most sincere service ever. I actually proposed to my wife in NYC, and 70 Park was the hotel I chose to stay for our trip, unbeknownst to her at the time. After booking a King Premier room, I called to let them know that I was staying with them for my surprise engagement. The staff was downright giddy for me, and when I came back to the hotel with my new fiancee, I was greeted with applause and congratulations, as well as a complimentary bottle of champaign, fresh strawberries, and dessert. We dined at the Silverleaf downstairs that evening, and the food was delicious. From our locale, everything we wanted to see was so close. I thought the room was impeccably decorated, the bathroom tile was cool, and the lighting gave the room the warmest glow. Again, we stayed in a bigger room on a higher floor, so I'm not sure what the experience would have been with smaller quarters. But for those four days in New York, 70 Park Ave was a main contributor to memories that we will never forget.	
Mar 16 2009 	Very helpful hotel	Lovely hotel. I took my husband for his 30th Birthday. Hotel organised a cake and some sparkling wine. This has to be one of the most helpful hotels I have stayed in, both during stay and before the trip when I was in email contact with the very helpful hotel manager.They also have a lovely touch of offering a glass of wine in the evening.Rooms clean, average (new york) size. Good location. Fantastic staff.I very much recommend this hotel.	
Mar 1 2009 	nice location good value	70 Park is a nice hotel. The rooms are small, but this is NYC. I would decrib the decor as grandma chic. Our room had a 42 in flat screen, ipod docking station, wine glasses and a comfy bed. The staff was very accomdating, from the doorman helping with parking to security helping return my wife's wallet which she left in the safe. The hotel offers a wine hour at 5pm in lobby for free, which is a nice touch. There was also free coffee and tea in the morning. Location is about two block from Grand Central Station, which is cool place to check out. Went to the Oyster Bar very old school, worth the walk.	
Feb 17 2009 	Upscale - moderate price	Purchased 2 rooms, 3 nights through Priceline. Our party consisted of 4 adults, one child. The staff at 70 Park Avenue were so nice. The hotel had a kid's fun kit ready for us at check in and the child with us thought it was great. The kids even get a comment card so they can say what they feel about the hotel - and that was a very &quot;grown up&quot; touch for the child in our group. The rooms, while small, were nicely furnished, clean and quiet (we were on the 16th &amp; 17th floors, though - so maybe some of the lower rooms would hear more street noise). The beds were very comfortable. Both rooms had a view of the Empire State Building! The hotel is 4 short blocks from Grand Central station so getting around was a breeze! We would have liked to have a coffee pot in our room, but the hotel does offer free coffee and tea in the lobby during the morning and we took advantage of it. And there is a Starbucks on the next block. There is a restaurant/lounge at the hotel but we didn't eat there so can't comment on it other than to say it's available. Part of our group did go to the lounge one night. It was tasteful and quiet - the drinks were high priced, but it is a hotel lounge! Lots of restaurants on surrounding side streets and there is a neat market at Grand Central Station - we bought sweet treats there!. We would definitely stay at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel again!	
Jan 14 2009 	To Cold in Bathroom Cream was frozen ! Thats ridiculous!	Well I have to say... I travel every month, so i am not one to complain. I have stayed in the best hotels and the worst! But this time the cold was ridiculous! For Gods Sake my cream was frozen. If thats NOT AN INDICATION that it is to cold in the bathroom then i give up. When i called the room service the service man came up to my room right away. I told him that the room service operator on the phone said, &quot;YES&quot; the radiator in the bathroom was supposed to be on. Well the service man replied to me at the door, &quot;no we dont turn on the radiator unless its really cold&quot;. Well the next morning i went into the bathroom to take a shower. It was so cold you had to wear socks. My boyfriend had never seen this before and he has lived in NYC for 20 years! My cream that was in a jar was almost frozen. Is that cold enough for you? The bedroom wasnt so bad. It was 55 degrees and we were on the 7th floor, it took 13 hours for it to go up to 73 degrees in the room.- lucky i brought my heating pad. There is something clearly wrong with the heat in this hotel! The funny part is when we left the radiator was pumping out 80 degrees heat! It was very uncomforatable. It was likea comedy show. Lucky i have a sense of humor. The room was small, the TV was located in an awkward location on the wall. The water pressure was good, the free wine was nice, the $15 credit at the mini bar was nice, the breakfeast was lame but the girl hosting (Andrea) was very sweet. The room was a nightmare and not cheap! To cold, To loud, To small! Oh and also you can hear everything next to you. I heard an entire conversation of the person in the other room! Sorry but its the truth and people have to know. Nice peopel ... too bad. Never come back.	
Dec 31 2008 	70 Park Ave a nice hotel	After extensive research booked 70 Park Ave through Expedia for a price that was OK by New York standards. Stayed with my family over xmas for six nights and in general had a pleasant experience.PositivesLocation near Grand central and 42nd street, 5th Ave, was great and meant we could walk most places like the Rockafeller centre, Empire state etc.Restaurants nearby are of good quality and can recommend the place in Pershing Square outside Grand central.Hotel is clean, comfy and has really helpful staff, especially liked the wine hour and the ease of getting cabs.Good quality bathroom toiletries, great shower pressure.DislikesThe room heating had to be fixed 4 times during the stay as it seemed to only like pumping out cold air. Gave up in the end as the weather warmed up.Tiny bathroom.We were on the 11th floor at the front and the traffic noise was pretty loud for sleeping.The mini bar and room service prices are a joke, even by British standards - don't bother. Hotel bar similar.The lack of a room tea/coffee machine or even a kettle was a pain and meant trips to Starbucks a hundred yards away for a decent coffee.Overall though a pretty nice experience, mainly because the hotel was clean and the staff really helpful. but would probably go for a bigger hotel nearby if staying in NY again.	
Dec 28 2008 	Christmastime in the City	I took my daughter to NYC for the first time to see the holiday decorations and do a little sightseeing &amp; shopping. We booked the Hotel 70 because I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels. First of all,the hotel is in a perfect location. Two blocks up from Grand Central Terminal and two streets over from 5th Ave. There were plenty of good restaurants nearby, the staff was very helpful, and the rooms were very comfortable, and hip. In fact, I slept in both mornings, which I don't normally do, but the beds were so comfortable that I must have been very relaxed. The bathrooms were on the small side, but that is to be expected in some of the older buildings that have been refurbished. There was a flat screen t.v., ipod dock, bathrobes and if you needed it, an umbrella, which we almost had to use. It was a very good stay and I would highly recommend this hotel.	
Dec 26 2008 	Loved 70 Park Ave	Very Happy with this hotel. Bed was supper comfortable and I loved the products offered in the bathroom. Staff was excellent. Would stay again in a heart beat.	
Dec 7 2008 	solid hotel	This Kimpton hotel is a nice quality hotel that offered everything I needed during my stay in NYC. The rooms were a good size, stay was pleasant with the music throughout the hotel and the ipod dock, the wine reception in the eventing, and friendly doorman. The location is in Murray Hill and conveniently located near Grand Central. There are plenty of taxis to catch, and I was completely satisfied with the price my company paid and what I got out of it.My company is in the trial process of signing a contract with several hotels for our employees, and Kimpton was one on the list. Nothing against this hotel, but I prefer to stay somewhere more hip and young in the future like a W or even a boutique hotel. I guess I'll have to do some convincing!	
Dec 3 2008	Wanted to Love But Ended Up Loathing 	We spent Thanksgiving in NYC, and used American Express Travel Rewards, and we had planned on staying for three nights. I contacted the hotel prior to arrival and told them it was our anniversary, and requested a room on a higher floor, and was pleasantly surprised upon check-in that we had been upgraded to a junior suite, we had originally booked a premier king sized room.Our room was on the 10th floor, and we stayed in room 1015. The hallways are very, very dark and narrow. It was an odd configuration, as you descended down the hallway, there are three steps that lead to three rooms, with a service elevator outside. This became an issue when food service trays, and laundry were left in the hallway for hours at a time, the pictures tell the story.The room while on appearances, looked nice, I didn't know why it was classified as a junior suite, usually there is a partial wall, divider, separate sitting area, and there wasn't, just a couch against a wall. The nightstands had clearly seen better days, as both were heavily battered, and had chipping paint, so did the wall in the bathroom.One of the main reasons I booked this hotel was the Kimpton Hotel chain prides itself on being environmentally responsible and eco-savvy, and that is something I strive for in my personal life, and given the option when travelling, I will always book the eco option. Kimpton's website boasts of awards, accolades, and efforts the chain takes, so imagine my surprise when I turned on the lamp on the nighstand, and it was a regular lightbulb, there wasn't one compact fluorscent lightbulb in our room. Hotel chains such as Holiday Inn's don't tout their policies, and they have cfl's. Rule one of being environmentally responsible is cfl's. The cleaning products used by housekeeping eminated the worst odor ever, that gave me a sickening headache, and I have never experienced that before in a hotel, ever. Again, website touts non-toxic cleaning products, but this stuff stunk and certainly smelled toxic.Our room faced Park Avenue, and as other reviews have noted, the soundproofing is non-existent. Its to be expected in NYC to experience noise, but this was just unbearable, and its not the busiest part of Park Avenue. I didn't even bother requesting a move since I heard a man complaining about it at the front desk, and the clerk told him there was nothing else available.Thanksgiving Day, we got up, after two nights of no sleep, we got up to go to the parade, and I practically tripped over a very large bag of laundry outside the service elevator, and there was no one around, and there was a room service tray that looked like it had been out for hours. Coming back from the parade two hours later, the items were still in the hallway, tired, not wanting to navigate anymore, we decided to check out.Went downstairs, bags packed, no clue where we were going, too tired to argue, plan or think. The same man that was also sleepless was again asking if an inside room was available, and it wasn't. I told him we were getting out, and he said he had decided to move next door to the Kitano. I wanted out of the neighborhood. The clerk was surprised we were checking out a day early, since it was an award, and I knew we wouldn't get those points back from American Express, nothing was worth me not sleeping. We ended up at the W Times Square, paying $350 a night for a gorgeous, quiet room that to us was priceless and perfect, and we slept through Thanksgiving, but were thankful for sleep, and not having to navigate through narrow hallways.	
Nov 25 2008 	Loved 70 Park Avenue	We arrived at 70 Park Avenue on Firdya 21 November and where greeted by the very friendly staff. We had arrived in advance of check-in so we left our bags to be safely stowed away while we hit the streets to explore the Big Apple. The position on Park Avenue is great as on immediatley stepping outside the hotel you have a wondeful full view of Grand Central Station to your left. It only takes about 6-7mins to get to 5th Avenue which is great. You are smack bang in the middle of midtown with so many sights accessible from here. Our room was great with the most comfortable bed and amenities. I would certainly want to stay here on my next visit as it ticks so many boxes. After pounding the NY streets for hours on end it is so good to look forward to coming back to a lovely cosy room with a great atmosphere and jacuzzi!!. Good NY hotels are hard to find as so many of them focus on being uber trendy at the expense of real comfort and your wallet!	
Nov 23 2008 	Ok - might visit NY again but won't be staying here	Just back from 2 nights in this hotel. Got a good (for NY) price through priceline website. The hotel itself is very nice and the location is good.........However, there were a few negatives - the taxi drivers! Why do they feel the need to make such a continued racket until all hours of the night???? Extremely annoying. The bed in the room (double) was a bit smalll............ The shower was very noisy when the water was turned to hot. For a room service order of food totallying $28 I was charged a further $12 in taxes, delivery and graditude - ridiculous surely?? And finally, I phoned the front desk to ask to borrow the hair straightners the morning that we checked out but they didn't arrive..........If I do return to New York I probably wouldn't stay here again.	
Nov 21 2008 	Would stay here again	Our room was small, but stylish. The bed was very comfortable with plush pillows and linens. Our bathroom was tiny, with an awkwardly placed toilet, but the shower had great water pressure, hot water, plush towels and everything was clean. We had two windows that actually opened (nice!) and had a great view of the Empire State building.Things we loved:-Convenience. Easy walking distance to the major NY attractions. We were visiting to see a play and the theatres were within easy distance. We drove down and the hotel is fairly easy on/off the FDR.- Pet friendly: We specifically booked here because the Kimpton chain is pet friendly and we wanted to travel with our dog. For this reason, we will keep coming back to Kimpton. - Wine hour in the lobby - A nice way to unwind at the end of the day and meet other travelers. - Mostly friendly and accomodating staff. Front desk staff and doormen were always friendly and helpful. The hotel kindly accomodated our request for scheduling a specific housekeeping time so we could take the dog for a walk while they cleaned the room. We found one of the conceirges a little snooty and not very helpful. We would recommend more &quot;meeting and greeting&quot; of the guests and less internet surfing on his part.- Neighborhood feel: Located in mostly residential Murray Hill, we liked walking the side streets of this neighborhood and admiring the unique architecture of the homes. These neighborhoods were great for walking our dog as we were worried about how we would walk him on busy NY streets. On the down side, we felt the neighborhood lacked good dining choices within quick walking distance. We hoped for small, neighborhood style restuarants and found mostly larger, glitzy restaurants. We did enjoy Moonstruck on Madison for great breakfasts. El Rio was just OK for mexican food. Otherwise, we traveled out of the neighborhood for eating. Funny enough, there was a small cart on the opposite street corner for morning coffee and pastries that had the freshest doughnut I have ever had! Things that could be improved:- Because the rooms are small, less furniture would be more. Does anyone really use minibars?- There are no closets, but there are armoires with mesh doors. While OK for hanging clothes, they were too small for storing a suitcase. Worst of all, they had a pair of leopard print women's underwear apparently available for purchase. I would recommend to management, getting rid of these tacky items. Firstly, as a gay couple, it was the last thing we wanted to see, but more than that, It made us feel as though we were staying at a cheap motel and nobody wants to be looking at someone else's underwear. Because the armoires are open it became part of the rooms decor. Generally, a tacky feature and I can't believe anyone actually purchases these?!- No internet - huge problem. There were no unblocked signals to tap. The hotel allows 15 minutes free use on the lobby computer (after entering your credit card), with a fee for longer use. At these prices, we would expect free internet. - The noise: We requested a room on a higher level, hoping to eliminate city noise. Unfortunately, we were limited to the third floor since this was the designated pet floor. Even though the hotel is in a so called &quot;no honk&quot; zone, the honking seemed non-stop. We live in a major US city and therefore used to city noise, but this was constant. We asked for a fan the second night to provide some white noise for sleeping. Ask for a higher floor when booking. On the flip side, because we were on a pet floor, I think we were the only booked room on our entire floor. We never saw or heard anyone in the hallways or next to us.- Expensive parking - $50 a day for valet parking. There were several garages in the neighborhood with special rates. I think you could save big bucks if you parked your own car. I will say, the valet who greeted us (wish I had a name!) upon arrival could not have been more friendlier and accomodating.Overall, still an enjoyable stay and would rebook here.	
Nov 11 2008 	Ok but will stay somewhere else next time	Pros: Great location, helpful concierge &amp; wine hour! Nice breakfast in the restaurant too.Cons: Noise from adjoining rooms (we did complain &amp; so did other hotel guests that I spoke to) unfortunately the hotel allowed a party until at least 3am in the room next to ours, apparently the other guests also heard people fighting. There was confusion over our room too, we asked for a twin room but the room we were allocated on arrival was a queen. I did check with the hotel by email before arriving but they still managed to get it wrong  maybe this was why we ended in a twin room looking out to a brick wall? Also I did not get any upgrade mentioned by the other reviewers even though I am a Kimpton In Touch member, I would have mentioned this to reception if I had known!Nice hotel but the noise problems would put me off ever staying here again.	
Nov 9 2008 	Would return to 70 Park Ave.	I stayed at 70 Park Ave. from Oct. 25-27 after booking it via Priceline. The rate was excellent, and upon confirming the room, Matthew, was extremely helpful and due to availibility, upgraded me to a room with two queen beds.When I arrived, I was checked in promptly and everyone on staff was extremely courteous and nice. I must say, I've stayed in Manhattan over 20 times, and this hotel had the most polite and helpful staff.The room was extremely clean and a very good size for NYC, and the beds were very, very comfortable. I also signed up for the Kimpton In Touch program online beforehand, and received a $15 credit to spend on the room's minibar...a very nice bonus. I was located on the 8th floor and I could not hear any street noise. The bathrooms are quite small, and I had a problem where the sink was not properly draining. The front desk sent someone up to remedy this quickly. The L'Occitane amenities were amazing. I am usually not a fan of the bathroom shampoos/conditioners, etc. (except when it's Aveda), but the ones provided were excellent quality.The location is excellent, very close to Grand Central and several subway stops. The only snag was when I was checking out. Although room and tax was already paid for via Priceline, they charged my visa again. When I returned home I called back and they confirmed that I indeed was double-charged, and the front desk staff member said they'd reverse the charge and email me an updated receipt. However, I never received this, and had to call back a couple days later. This time the person was quite helpful and mailed me a copy of the corrected bill. This was an inconvenience, but I'm glad I caught the mistake and it was eventually taken care of.Overall, despite the billing issue I would definitely return to 70 Park Ave. again. I had a very positive experience there during my stay.	
Nov 9 2008 	Great Location but smallish rooms	being so near Grand Central, Herald Square, cannot beat this location. walking distance to Times Square or a short train ride away from Grand Central. only downside as everyone has mentioned is the smallish rooms, I had 1001...facing the back and to another buidling but because of that it was quiet. they let me have a look at 1005, marginally bigger, bighter with 2 windows instead of one but i was afraid of street noise so stayed in the first room. not much of an issue with the small rooms as we were out most of the day and it was not as small as the W where I stayed 2 years ago, that was even tinier!wine evenings a nice touch. staff was friendly, Nadia the housekeeper and the bellbo/doorman whose name i forget now (alonso?). Concierge was great, did not see his name but i think his name tag said 'Harry Connick Jr'...gave frank and real advise. he was funny too, that was a bonus. gave the best advise for brunch nearby, this cafe called 'Penelope's' i think, long wait but great value and tasty and not touristy.i got it for $239/night from the hotel website which i though was great value. good stay all in all	
Oct 28 2008 	Great Value	We have previously used the Kimpton Chain in SF and referred to Trip Advisor when making a booking for 70 Park Avenue in New York. We were lucky to be upgraded to a King Room upon our arrival given we were a Kimpton In Touch Member. Great bed, enough space although bathroom was small. However, we enjoyed the room and bed was big and comfortable. Staff were friendly and courteous and consider hotel great value for New York. Hotel has a bar / restaurant which we did not use. Definitely would stay again	
Oct 26 2008 	Great hotel in a great location	We stayed here for 5 nights in a family room for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. Although space was tight it was adequate and you don't spend a lot of time in the room anyway. The beds were very comfortable and we had the bonus of a great view of the Empire State from our window. On our first night we found the room quite noisy but were readily moved to a higher floor by Reception and this was much appreciated. We also had friends in the hotel who stayed on a lower floor and they weren't bothered at all by the noise so we may just have been extra sensitive! A nice touch by the hotel was the 'happy hour' evening reception, it was a lovely treat to return home to after a long day sightseeing and shopping. The hotel is in a great location with 5th Avenue, Grand Central Station, Empire State, etc all just a few minutes walk away. Would definitely stay here again.	
Oct 22 2008 	Awesome Hotel Awesome Service	AWESOME hotel, staff is great, the Managers get together is a nice touch at the end of the day....EXCELENT service PatrickIn the middle of everything can walk everywhere....for sure will be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	
Oct 22 2008 	Quiet Haven gets 70 Park Ave an A+	We booked this hotel because we have loved the other kimptons that we have been to this year, namely because of their attention to details and hospitality.Make sure if you stay here that you sign up on their website as a Kimpton in touch member. It's free, and you get perks and points. Namely free internet ($11), a welcome gift, and since it was my friend's birthday, champagne and cake.The room was a good size for a NY hotel. The use of lighting (everything had a dimmer!) and mirrors really created a great atmosphere. Loved the l'occitaine ammenities. THere is also a free wine reception from 5-6, but we missed it because of theater tickets. The room was quiet, and not far from Grand Central.Overall we really enjoyed our stay. The room was perfect and the staff was friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel.	
Oct 21 2008 	Wonderful Hotel Wonderful Location	We recently spent a long romantic Columbus Day weekend at the 70 park avenue hotel, Friday to Monday, October 10th to 13th. We were in Room 1217.Our redeye dropped us into NYC early Friday morning and we went directly to the hotel. We chatted with reception a bit, showed our Kimpton InTouch card, and were upgraded to a King Premier. This room was quite large for NYC standards, and we have stayed at quite a few hotels in the City. The jacuzzi tub and Occitane sundries added to whole romantic weekend feel, as did the electric candles. The entire experience from the lobby and its welcoming aromatherapy, to the room, to the bathroom was one of quality. The facilities left us without want.My bride is a member of the Kimpton Hotels Guest Loyalty Program because she feels this hotel group goes out of their way catering to the Woman Business traveler. At the 70 park avenue hotel, even curling irons and straighteners were available if one forgot them. The attention to the woman business traveler was evident during both the morning complimentary coffee service and the evening wine reception. During our brief stay, I can honestly say that during these moments, the ratio of Men to Women was at best 1 to 4. Not a bad way to start the day.The location is perfect, in the middle of the quiet Murray Hill area, yet only 2 blocks from Grand Central. The walk is only 5 minutes at the most. The hotel is on Park Avenue and we never had a problem flagging down a cab whenever we needed one. We used Grand Central Terminal as a meeting spot for our forays into the city with our friends who live in Brooklyn and on the Upper East Side. We'd meet at the Oyster Bar or the Campbell Apartment for a cocktail before heading out on the town. I would recommend this hotel to those who are expecting a luxurious boutique hotel and for those who want to be centrally located.	
Oct 15 2008 	Great location on Park Ave.	This hotel was recommended by a friend and it was perfect for us. We arrived off a red-eye flight but they stored our luggage at 8am in the morning. Room was great, bed very comfortable and we didn't have much time to use the flat screen TV except once. Staff were great, doorman always smiling and cheerful. My sister got a room with a view of the Empire State building. Great location, we walked everywhere south of the park and it is only two short blocks from Grand Central station with lots of subway and suburb trains. Only gripe was that their breakfast was overpriced and not so great, but everything else was really good value. It is not cheap, not too expensive either, and worth every cent. I will stay here again.	
Oct 9 2008 	a bit cramped and noisy...	Rooms are indeed a bit small, and if you're not used to small spaces, you could be even feel cramped (especially in the bathroom).Our neighbours were too noisy and even tried to enter the room through the doors that connect the room if you open them, but the hotel can't help that.Since the room isn't that big, I would advice the hotel to adapt the term 'less is more'..:-) They've put way too much in the room!It was a bit dirty when I opened one of the small cupboards in the room, because there was 1mm of dust on the bottom of the cupboard. I immediately closed it again.Room is way too dark and our 'view' (which I requested by sending them an email upfront) didn't allow us to open the curtain without being watched at..So not very positive about the room since the rate is quite high (but I know, it's NY...). Positive is that the lobby and the bar/restaurant are cosy and welcoming. Staff very friendly!!I think they do need to make some changes in order to keep their status.	
Oct 8 2008 	Best hotel experience in NYC	70 Park Avenue Hotel is my home away from home in NYC. I travel extensively for business and stayed with the fine team at this property for about 60-70 nights over a 12 month period of time from 2007-2008. They are wonderful! John, Carlos, Fernando, Jennifer, Marcella, Effrin, Josephine and the rest of their team are world class. My dog travels with me and the hotel is not only pet friendly, but they embrace them! The concierge will gladly arrange a dog walker while you are out (ask for Mustafa) and recommend all of the best places to take your pooch if he/she is with you. The rooms are a little cozy, but that's NY for you and the location is outstanding! Just a few short blocks to Grand Central will get you anywhere in NYC and beyond. There are many great eating establishments in the area (try Aji if you like Sushi and Carl's Cheesesteaks are the best outside of Philly) and if you're not sure where to go, just ask one of the smiling faces in the lobby! Make sure to join Kimpton's frequent guest plan as you'll be visiting this hotel over and over again!	
Oct 5 2008 	Great Time at 70 PA	We have just got back from a long weekend at 70 PA and we had a fantastic time. The weather was not so great (resulting from Tropical Storm Kyle) so we were so glad that we had chosen a good 4* hotel that is geared up to making their guests' time as comfortable and as luxurious as possible.I personally feel that the hotel is in a quieter part of NY (38th East) but still pretty central (2 or 3 blocks from Grand Central Station and the same for 5th Avenue) so we had the best of both worlds. TIP: If you are a light sleeper get a room as high up as you can to try and get away from as much as the street noise as possible. Also request a room away from the lift.)The hotel itself doesnt look as 'boutique' as you might expect from the outside - and the lobby is not as intimately opulent as one might expect if familiar with other boutique style hotels BUT the staff were all welcoming and helpful. The concierge (I didnt get his name) was a star and got us a table at the Marriott Hotel The View Restaurant at the very last minute (This restaurant was great for city views but ask for a table by the window in advance and DO get the tasting menu  gorgeous and great value when you compare to London tasting menus!!). TIP: There is wine tasting in the lobby every night from 5 - 6pm (approx) which looked great fun and a real bonus after a hard day shopping.The rooms are what makes the hotel in my book. It feels like walking into a cocoon after the chaos of the city - all warm lighting, soft fabrics and soothing green tones. It takes about 10 seconds to take in the peace and then you notice the 42&quot; plasma, the amazingly well stocked mini bar, the L'occitane toiletries and the exemplary 24 hour room service menu. Oh and did I mention the spa menu if you fancy some relief for those tired feet from all the walking? (because you will walk!) In summary, this hotel really does try to please everyone and doesn't fail. We loved it and would go back, if not there, then definitely to another Kimpton Hotel.	
Sep 25 2008 	Small but perfectly formed	Great location, friendly staff, the bar was very nice. Although we never tried the food.The room was pretty small but that's New York for you! It was very nicely decorated. Nice touches like a complementary umbrella and Ipod docking station/ alarm clock.Great TV and DVD available although we never used it as there was so much to do in NYC!	
Sep 21 2008 	Very happy here!	My husband and I stayed here for the weekend September 13-14, 2008. The hotel staff were all polite and helpful. When we checked in, I was worried that the elevator would bother us. However, you could barely hear the quiet &quot;ding&quot; and it was not a problem at all! The room as smallish as expected, but was just wonderful for as little time as we spent in it. I will say....we had the WORST time in the mornings trying to get out of the fabulous bed!!!! I wanted to stay in bed all day rather than sight see! I also appreciated the nice bath amenities. The hotel was located perfectly for sightseeing. We easily walked to most sights, and the subway station only a few blocks away. If we were tired, the doorman was happy to hail a cab. We thoroughly enjoyed our first trip to NYC and were very happy at 70 Park Avenue Hotel.	
Sep 10 2008 	Good! to recommend!	I stayed in room 1520 of 70 Park Avenue from 9 to 14 Aug., 2008I was with my husband, a friend of mine and her son. We decided to share the same room to stay in a good hotel and to avoid to pay too much money for the accommodation.There were other 3 friends with us who have been located at 3rd floor: be sure to ask for a high floor room and you will get a good view, otherwise the low floors are extremely noisy.The hotel is conveniently located near the Grand Central Station and 5th Ave, and all major tourist attractions are nearby. A metro station is just a minute walk from the hotel so that you can go everywhere with easy. All those of the staff are cute, polite and good-willing.The hotel decor is modern and pleasant. The foyer has a seating area with newspapers, internet access computers (first 15 min free) and chilled water dispenser with lemons, limes and oranges--tasty on a hot day.I can say they do all their best to let you feel welcome, comfortably and at ease.The room, while not huge, was more than adequate (please note we were 4!) and had everything you could ask for, including a comfortable beds.The bathroom was small but clean and pleasant (the toiletries were excellent).I can say we had a very good stay, at a good value for money, at this hotel and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to go to New York.Ill go back next May!	
Sep 8 2008 	A great boutique hotel	We just returned from a weekend stay at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel in Manhattan.Hotel and Location: 70 Park is a small, chic, Midtown hotel that offers a level of service thats superior to many larger hotels at this price point. The quaint lobby is nicely decorated, comfortable and inviting. The hotel staff that I encountered during my stay (front desk, concierge, doormen, maid and valet) were proficient, gracious and accommodating. The hotel is located in a residential area of Park Avenue, 4 blocks south of Grand Central Terminal. Getting around town from the hotel is pretty convenient; taxis are readily available on Park Avenue and there are two subway stations located within 5 blocks of the hotel (Grand Central Terminal and the 33rd Street/Lexington Ave Station).Room: I got a very reasonable Sleep in Style promotion rate of $263/night for a King Deluxe Room for our Friday and Saturday night stay (valet parking was an additional $52/day). The room rate included a $20 credit for the hotels Silverleaf Tavern. My requested quiet room was on the 12th floor, overlooking Park Avenue and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Saviour. The room was approximately 300 square feet (a decent size by NYC standards), very clean and stylishly decorated with a comfortable king-sized bed, a small armoire (instead of a closet) a small desk &amp; chair, an upholstered chair and two nightstands. The room size is adequate for two people and a couple pieces of weekend luggage, but I wouldnt book a lesser category room. The bathroom, although not spacious, was stylish, clean and functional. The hotel offers all the special Kimpton amenities including a complementary evening wine reception (from 5-6PM), L'Occitane bath products and plush bathrobes. At around $250/night, I think the room was a particularly good value for Midtown Manhattan.Hotel Dining: On Friday night, we met a couple of friends at the hotels Silverleaf Tavern, where we enjoyed tasty small plate appetizers, cocktails and wines by the glass. The food and drink quality, presentation and service were all very good. The tavern isnt a full-service restaurant, but its a great place to hang out, converse and people watch.Summary: Overall, the 70 Park Avenue Hotel is a wonderful city hotel in a great location. The promotional rate of $263/night was also a great value. Once again, were very satisfied with the quality accommodations, amenities and value offered by Kimpton and we'd definitely stay here again!	
Sep 3 2008 	Prime location Great Service	We stayed here on business. Before we arrived, we emailed a question and received very prompt and satisfactory response from Tim Thomai. As a Kimpton In Touch member, we also enjoyed the benefits offered by the hotel.The hotel is conveniently located near the Grand Central Station and 5th Ave (for the shopping buffs). The toiletries were excellent. They had flat screen TV with a decent selection of channels.Thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.	
Aug 28 2008 	Mixed experience	This is a really good hotel in a great location for 5th Avenue, RF Centre, Grand Central, Central Park etc. Rooms are smallish but comfortable, clean and pleasant. My issue was that there were four of us staying, a couple and two women. We had booked (some time in advance through alpharooms) a double and a twin room but when we arrived they said they had no twin rooms left. They said that they would see what they could do. Their response was to provide a fold down childs bed which was totally inadequate - especially at the price we paid - although we waited on day 2 of our 3 night stay for them to sort things out they did nothing further to resolve this situation. We were disappointed that they didn't really try to at least offer some kind of compensation. So good hotel if nothing goes wrong but don't expect them to respond if they get it wrong.	
Aug 22 2008 	Good location some traffic noise	We stayed here for 4 nights and chose this hotel because of good reviews and its closeness to Grand Central Station. The location is very good. You can walk to the Empire state building and 5th Avenue shops. Our room was very small (on 3rd floor)and the bathroom was tiny. You had to sit at an angle on the loo! However, everything was clean and the bed was very comfortable. There was lovely L'Occitaine toiletries, but bizarrely no shower gel, only soap, shampoo and conditioner. There were no drinks facilities in the room, which was a shame as of course the mini bar was expensive. However, the hotel staff are excellent. The room had a plasma TV which had lines on it so we mentioned this to staff who arranged for an engineer to repair it. When he couldn't do this they moved us to a better room (bigger on 9th floor) and gave us vouchers for a free breakfast as compensation. We were very pleased with this. The traffic is very noisy. You hear continuous horn blowing from taxis and street noise, but I guess that's the down side to staying in a city. We only ate breakfast here once as there are numerous cafes close by which are cheaper. The breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice. The hotel also provides complimentary tea and coffee from 8:30 am- 10am so we often used to grab a drink and buy a muffin from a bakery. New York is great and this is a good hotel to stay in for sight seeing. We used the Gray Line tour buses for getting about and walking is easy too. We would stay at this hotel again, but would book a larger room on a higher floor.	
Aug 12 2008 	So-So Won't stay again.	Great location, that is correct. But... I stayed for the weekend with my husband and children. Several days before we arrived, I emailed the hotel asking for two beds in room. The Kimpton website said that I would receive a reply but I did not. Upon arrival I was told that two beds would not be possible. The concierge told my husband that he &quot;didn't know&quot; where a good place for kid friendly dessert was located. The room had no coffee maker - come on!! The toilet was situated right against a wall so unless you are under 75lbs, prepare for an adventure. The tv remote did not work properly. We could not change the channels. Thank goodness for the great bartender in the hotel bar! Happy hour in lobby was nice. Hotel employees were friendly, bed was comfortable. We would take our chances in one of the many other hotels in the area next time.	
Aug 8 2008 	Great Location friendly/helpful staff tiny room.	We made a Priceline bid and eventually won this 4*-rated property for $185/nt ($222 w/taxes and fees). The hotel is in an outstanding area: close to Times Square, Grand Central Station &amp; the Empire State Bldg. The tree lined streets made for an attractive neighborhood. Nearby restaurants, drug stores and the like made this ideal for our short trip to NYC.The staff here were uniformly friendly: from the doorpersons, to the desk staff, housekeepers, restaurant/lounge staff and concierge. We were treated politely by everyone. Several, in fact, did not want to accept a tip for their services (e.g., the person who brought us a roll-away bed). We were surprised by this, expecting people to have more of an &quot;east coast, big city&quot; air.The hotel decor is modern and pleasant. The foyer has a seating area with newspapers, internet access computers (first 15 min free) and chilled water dispenser with lemons, limes and oranges--tasty on a hot day.Our room was tiny--one bed for two people, so we needed a rollaway bed . To accommodate the rollaway, we had to remove a chair. The flat screen tv had tons of channels. There were two radios. A minibar served as a tiny fridge for our water bottles. No coffee maker, but we did have iron, board and hair dryer. The bed and rollaway were comfortable--lots of nice pillows. The lighting and color combinations were pleasant. The bathroom, while not huge, was large enough for our toiletries etc. A better fan/ventilation would have been nice for preventing the mirror from fogging up. Toilet and sink worked well. We were on a low floor, and only had a view of the air shaft. Should have asked for an upper room.New York hotels are expensive and rooms are small. In this context, we felt we received decent value for our money. While I would not have wanted to pay the $300+ per night regular rate, our priceline rate made this hotel of good value.	
Aug 5 2008 	Great Hotel!	This is an excellent property. Location on Park Avenue is in a quiet, 'well-to-do' residential neighborhood, which is ideal to return to after a busy day of NYC sightseeing. Fifth Avenue, Central Park and the Empire State building are only a short walk away.The room was large (Deluxe Queen), modern, well-appointed and very quiet. This was one of the best city rooms we experienced on our trip across the USA.If there was one complaint, it is the charge for the internet. In my opinion, hotels should be supplying this as part of the standard service (many now do), or at the very least, a nominal charge. However, the fee the hotel was seeking was excessive. Although there is WiFi for those with laptops, many travellers who come from far away do not like to 'lug' around laptops (especially travelling through US airports). In any case (and after much seeking), we did find an internet cafe on 38th St not far from the hotel that charges $2 for 30 minutes.Other than the internet (which I have not taken into account when rating the hotel) the experience at this Kimpton was excellent. If I was returning to NYC, this is the first hotel I would stay at. I have already recommended the hotel to a friend who will be in NYC in September.	
Aug 2 2008 	Incredibly friendly staff Average hotel	My wife and I stayed two nights at 70 Park Avenue Hotel on the weekend of July 26th. We booked our hotel through Priceline by making an offer of $200 for a 4-star hotel.I had sent an email to the hotel prior to arriving letting them know that my wife and I were coming there to get one last getaway before having our upcoming baby. I also requested for any kind of room upgrade, if possible. We arrived around noon on friday. They stated that we could check into a regular room at that time or if we waited until 3:00 pm, they had a room reserved for us on the 16th floor with a nice view of the Empire State Building. We decided to wait and had them hold our bags for us. When we returned at 3:00, they booked us into a room on the 14th floor without the view. I'm not exactly sure what happened to the original room, but we only booked a regular room, so that was fine. Overall, we found our room to be nice enough. I would, however, rate it more as 3 star, than 4 star. The room was on the smaller side and in the bathroom there was a heater right next to the toilet that required you to sit on it at an angle. The windows in the room were also dirty impairing the view that we did have. Also there were power strips with splitters and so many wires plugged into that was a little frightening. On the positive side, the room itself was very clean and had a nice decor. They also provide a lot of extras including a flat-panel TV, iPod docking stereo, daily newspaper, slippers and evening chocolates. They also left us a box of chocolates, two waters and a nice card congratulating us on our pregnancy. We found this to be incredibly thoughtful.We found the hotel staff to be incredibly friendly and helpful every time we had an encounter with them. The location of this hotel is also very convenient as well. It is only a couple blocks from Grand Central Station and within walking distance of many other attractions. I would recommend this hotel to others because of the helpful staff and all the little extras.	
Jul 29 2008 	Midtown hotel on a human scale	I stayed in room 1712 of 70 Park Avenue on July 25, 2008. I'd booked the room--a 'deluxe queen,' I think--through a promotion on the Kimpton website (which I'd found about, in turn, through their frequent traveler program) for $194. The hotel exceeded my expectations in just about every way. My only previous Kimpton stay was in Chicago, at the Hotel Monaco, which had been underwhelming in several ways (frayed furnishings, bad plumbing), but 70 Park Avenue thoroughly redeemed the brand for me. The room--on the top floor of the hotel, and I should add my thanks to the front desk staff for doing us that favor--was airy, quiet, and (for folks who care about this) spacious, thanks to a long, narrow corridor separating the room from the main hallway. The room and bathroom were, as I remember, done in shades of cool green, beige, and white; it was a great place to take refuge in after a night (or morning) on the town. The hotel, like most (and perhaps all) Kimptons, features a complimentary wine hour from 5 to 6 each evening, and it was fun to people-watch in the lobby, even if the latter was a little too small to accommodate the guests who wanted to hang out there. (Big lobbies are not, by the way, anything I tend to crave in a hotel; still, if we'd arrived any later than 5.15, there would have been nowhere to sit.) The location is also, I think, preferable to about any other on the fringes of midtown, except, perhaps, Hell's Kitchen. There are plenty of restaurants in Murray Hill and Gramercy, and the only drawback is the yuppie vibe: for those of you who've spent time in San Francisco, imagine a coarser version of the Marina with fewer natural blond(e)s. But we ate well and slept well and walked everywhere, and that's about all I expect from a neighborhood. The hotel is clearly in an older building--there was a whiff of sewage every time we stepped into the elevator that made me think, ah, the good old days!--but the renovations are pretty convincing; the lobby is graceful, if small; we never ran into other guests in our hallway (a big plus for me), nor did we hear them (except for one door shutting distantly around midnight); the bath products from L'Occitane were nice (although I'd still prefer Aveda, guys); and we kept expressing our wonder at how well we'd slept in the heart of the city.	
Jul 22 2008 	Couldn't have been nicer!	Enjoyed a three night stay here over 4th of July. My first room faced an inner courtyard and was very noisy. My request to move was honored and luggage moved for me. Concierge was very helpful with restaurant recommendations. Wine hour was great -although busy and they didn't enough glasses for everyone all at once. Oh well, a cold beer tasted good, too! Great location and pleasant staff. Give this hotel a try!	
Jul 17 2008 	Standard Kimpton	I've stayed at 70 Park Avenue several times for both business and leisure. The price usually seems to be right ($250 range) which is the main draw, as the neighborhood isn't very exciting. The good: Because I am a Kimpton In Touch member, I seem to be upgraded at this property fairly often. The corner king rooms over nice views of Park Avenue and abundant light, which is a rarity in NYC hotels. The beds are typical, very comfortable Kimpton beds. The desk is great and extremely functional. There is an extra chair so you won't need to resort to sitting on the desk chair or the bed.The bad: It is nearly impossible to catch a cab outside this hotel. Because it is located downwind of Grand Central, you can forget about getting a cab between 8-10am and 3-6pm. Not handy. The rooms are tiny. Closet space is not abundant and the bathrooms are teeny.Overall, I will continue to stay here when the Soho Grand is at capacity or out of my price range (during the winter). It is clean, the staff friendly and the room is comfortable which helps you forget the size.	
Jul 14 2008 	Great location	We have just returned from a 3 week holiday in the US where we spent 5 nights in New York in this hotel. The hotel is in a great location near many of the great skyscrapers ie Empire State Building, Chrysler Building and the beautiful building that is Grand Central Station is only five minutes walk away. The hotel lobby is small but plush with complimentary apples, water and newspapers. Our room was on the 3rd floor but we asked to be moved after the first night as the extremely noisy air con units were outside our window hence no sleep on our first night! The hotel staff were very accommodating and helpful and there was no issue about moving. We moved to the 18th floor (back of the building) and we got a lovely bright room with a view of the Empire State building. Beds were very comfortable with an excellent large flat screen TV, bathrobes, nice toiletries in the bathroom, iron, minibar and even an umbrella. We had two children with us so we never had breakfast in the hotel @ 25USD a head. Instead we walked 5 mins to the Grand Central station where there were lots of good value options that suited everyone.	
Jul 12 2008 	Great stay--not disappointed!	My daughter and I were in town celebrating her 15th bday. This was our first stay at a Kimpton property, so I joined their In-Touch program and selected my preferences. I noted on the reservation what we were celebrating. Upon arrival, we were given our preferred room--double-double on a high floor w/ a view (Empire State Bldg). I was very pleased since I paid for only one bed.It was a very nice room and the size was perfectly adequate. The size of the bathroom was fine too. I do agree w/ many posters that the lighting is a bit dim for reading but it creates a nice, soothing atmosphere.The staff was very nice. And we enjoyed many of the special touches--wine reception, L'Occitane toiletries, turn-down service w/ chocolate, ice water and apples in the lobby, free tea and coffee in the morning, $15 &quot;raid the mini-bar&quot; coupon. I also very much appreciate their &quot;green&quot; practices.But the best part of our stay was the way they chose to honor my daughter's bday. About 15 minutes after we checked into our room, room service arrived and surprised us with a small bday cake, a bottle of sparkling fruit-flavored tea in a champagne bucket w/ 2 wine glasses and a personal note to my daughter with another $15 &quot;raid the mini-bar&quot; coupon. She was so excited! I felt the hotel went above and beyond my expectations.	
Jul 8 2008 	Excellet location services and very clean.	My boyfriend and I stayed for the 4th of July weekend and we had very good time. The location is great. 4 blocks from Grand Central Station. Walking distance to Empire State Building, The Chrysler Building, shops, restaurants and 5th Ave.Check-in was efficient and courteous. During the entire stay, staff was very friendly.No coffeemaker in room. But they do have free coffee just off the lobby in the morning and wine-tasting thing in the early evening.Everything is great. The employees can't do enough for you. You name it. You can't go wrong here. I noticed a remark about some small bathrooms. True, but it won't spoil your trip. It is really a sensational hotel. I've stayed in many. This is a keeper.The Empire State Building, my God is a rip off!!! not worth it!!!!. to pay that kind of money.	
Jul 7 2008 	Very nice	Well its all been said before, but I have added some information which may help those trying to find their way round NYC for the first time..To start with when you get out of the airport there is no problem getting a cab, its a fixed fare of $45 so dont worry if there is no meter showing....now this is important..Tell the cab driver you are going to Park Avenue, corner of 38th Street and the NAME of the hotel is 70 Park Avenue.if you don't say it this way then chances are they will take you to, Park avenue corner of 70th Street, which is a long long way from where you want to be and the cab driver will charge extra..On arrival check in is fast and well organised.Our group had a twin room and a kingsize room.The difference? well apart from the beds... in the kingsize we had a view onto Park avenue, those in the twin had a view of a brick wall and needed ear plugs because of the noise of air con units outside the room. My advice? request a room at the front.Rooms are very clean, we had a slightly better bathroom, bigger bedroom and a sofa &amp; table. Nice relaxing room with decent shampoo, soap etc. Large flat screen TV and a mini bar which was restocked every day.We also had a hair dryer, iron, board, dressing gowns and even an umbrella in the room plus a free newspaper every morning. One of the 2 lifts failed at the weekend, not their fault but it left people with a choice of a long wait, using the service elevator or walking...we were on the 4th floor so it wasn't a problem for us. It was fixed first thing Monday it was so never a major problemThe only downside was the breakfast...cost was about $25 each, and consisted of the usual fruits, croissants etc or egg, bacon and the like. VERY limited choice and to be honest not really worth the money, but as mother in law is diabetic she had to have something first thing so it didn't leave much choice. A better choice option would be to visit the railway station which about 2 blocks away at Grand Central, lovely food downstairs in the food hall and cheap.There is good internet service...its available in the rooms and also there are a couple of computers in the lobby.This is how it works!!?? type in a credit card number, you get a free 15 mins per day. (if you have several cards take them all as you get 15 mins with each card). At the end of the 15mins you have a choice of paying about $6 to carry on for another 15 mins or just log out..(then use another card).We flew with BA and on the day before our return I checked in on line. Lucky I did as an earlier flight had been cancelled and all those people were on our flight, the people on our flight who failed to check in via internet were bumped onto a much later flight.I printed off the 4 sheets of paper for our boarding passes and I was expecting to have to pay $1 each, (like I am in so many other places)...however I wasn't. and frankly this is a sign of the small things they do that makes all the difference.... After all how many other hotels bother to visit tripadvisor and reply?? Customer service was just right.Check out was easy and fast. There are cabs waiting outside from very early to do the airport runs...again $45 fixed price.In conclusion, apart from a breakfast that was less than exciting the stay at 70 Park Avenue was perfect. Thanks to all the staff who made our stay such an enjoyable experience.	
Jul 6 2008 	Dream Come True	My husband and I have not been away together (just us) for about 5 years now, so we were really, really looking forward to our night in the city at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel. I was able to get a great rate on the hotel web site using their AAA discount, and booking about 4 months in advance. I booked a King Deluxe Room. Imagine my surprise when we checked in and the really nice guy at the front desk informed me that he had upgraded us to a King Suite. We were on the top floor of the hotel and throroughly enjoyed the view of the Empire State Building from our private terrace. The hotel was just gorgeous, super clean, spacious and the staff was very nice. It's location was perfect for getting around town. I would like to point out that a short walk down to 3rd Avenue will bring you to Sarge's deli, which is not only one of the best Jewish delis left in New York, but is also open 24 hours. Our one night in New York was as romantic and relaxing as it could possibly be and we agreed that with a wonderful place like this so close to home, we will definitely be back in a few months. Thanks to all at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel for a wonderful experience.	
Jul 4 2008 	Great for a weekend in New York!	We were in town to see Eddie Izzard's comedy show 'Stripped' at Radio City (fantastic!) and were looking for somewhere fun and relatively central to stay for the weekend. I have stayed at Kimptons in other cities and found a wonderful deal on their website - we booked a King room for $269 (non-refundable). The hotel was in a great spot, on Park Avenue so it is a bit quieter than some of the mid-town 7th and Broadway hotels. Our room was lovely, l'Occitane toiletries were a nice treat! The room doors were a bit loud when they shut (especially if people did not hold them and just let them fly!), but otherwise the room was quiet and comfortable. We were pleased to be in a nice, walkable neighborhood. Walked down to Brasserie Les Halles (Park and 28th) for dinner Friday night (where chef Anthony Bourdain works when in town) and had a great brunch at Josie's on 3rd Avenue at 37th street. I would definitely stay at 70 Park Avenue again when we're up there next!	
Jun 30 2008	great	great location, in a quiet neighborhood but only a short walk to Times Sq, staff very courteous and helpful, were able to meet all our needs all what you would expect from a Kimpton, would stay there again next time in NYC	
Jun 30 2008 	Nice Hotel Good Location	Just returned from a girls weekend in NYC. This hotel was perfect. We booked two King Rooms. Room #1505 was really nice. Corner room with lots of windows. Room #1507 was fine, with the exception of being near the elevator. Room was large for NY. Bathrooms are small but nice. Beds are really comfortable. In fact, the location of the hotel is extremely quiet at night. We hardly heard any sirens etc... Very different from the San Carlos Hotel we stayed at last year. Nice wine reception in the evening. Water and apples in the lobby area all day. Bellman were very nice and helpful. Grand Central is a couple of blocks up, very convenient for subway. Easy walk to Rock.Center area. Conceirge seemed a little rude, which I did think was odd! Only complaint, was one of the elevators was not working and the lines/wait times for elevator were extremely long and also that one of our rooms was not ready until 4:30 or after. It was disappointing since we arrived at the hotel at 10:00 that morning and were told to come back around 3:00. Ate dinner before the show (Grease) at Trattoria Trecolori on 47th Street. Dinner was really good and prices extremely reasonable. The restaurant is adjacent to Brooks Atkins Theatre, so it is the perfect location. Moonstruck is a small diner type restaurant around the corner from the hotel. Reasonable priced breakfast and lunch. Also ate at Bar American on 52nd (Bobby Flay Restaurant). It was just okay. I wouldn't eat there again or recommend it to friends.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay here again. Location was perfect!	
Jun 29 2008 	Mixed reaction	We just finished a 5-day stay at this hotel, leaving me with mixed feelings. Pros: Excellent location in Murray Hill, near Grand Central but not in the middle of chaotic surroundings. Staff was pleasant and responsive (although we did not use the concierge). Since we were members of Kimpton In Touch, we received free wireless Internet for our entire stay (which was very much appreciated by my husband and teen-ager) and 2 free items from the mini-bar. The large flat-screen TV and various audio-visual gadgets were also fun. The evening happy hour provided us with a good glass of wine.Cons: Although we expected a relatively small room, we had virtually nothing in which to place our clothes so we lived out of our suitcases for 5 days. The aforementioned gadgets took up virtually all the desk and minimal cabinet space. The bathroom was so tiny that a person could barely turn around. Although it helped the hotel's boutique aspect that each floor had only a small number of rooms, hallways were so small that laundry carts and cleaning supplies sometimes blocked our way.Our queen-queen room price was $300 per night, and I haven't decided yet whether we got our money's worth.	
Jun 23 2008 	Good Location Great Beds	70 Park Avenue is a cute hotel in a really good location. We had a room with two queen beds. The room itself was pretty small and the bathroom was tiny. What was strange was that they had dimmers on almost every light, including in the bathroom. The tub was so small that you couldn't even lie down. The technology was good though, we had a huge LCD TV in our room. The beds were great and we had a great view. We looked down on Park Avenue. The room-service breakfast was pretty good too. 70 Park Avenue is a pretty decent hotel but it isn't the best hotel I have stayed in in New York City.	
Jun 20 2008 	Another great Kimpton property!	The room was beautiful and pretty large by NY standards. I had a queen room with a spectacular view of the Empire State Building from the bed. It's in an excellent location close to lots of tourist spots and great restaurants nearby. The staff was friendly and accomodated my every request including tracking down a stapler for me. There's not a gym onsite but they have passes to the NY Sports Club that's a couple blocks away. I would defintely stay here again.	
Jun 16 2008	Nice rooms inconsistent service	70 Park Avenue Hotel was a nice hotel, but service was inconsistent. Our room (a queen deluxe) was small but very comfortable, and the location is convenient to Grand Central.The hotel advertises its excellent service but lacks follow through; for example, we received an e-mail prior to our stay from the hotel's executive assistant asking if we had any special requests or questions, yet she never responded to the e-mail we sent in reply. We also requested a specific pillow type when making our reservation (it's on the hotel's registration form) and still received the wrong pillow in our room (easily corrected the next day). Worst of all was the hotel concierge; when we asked for help finding a restaurant, he was busy shopping online for t-shirts so acted as if we were interrupting him (note: it was very early morning and there was no one else in the lobby). He did not offer to make reservations for us or even provide us with restaurant phone numbers.Since the rooms were nice and location good, I would consider staying here again, but would know to expect chain motel vs. boutique hotel service.	
May 30 2008	So close and yet quiet!	Selected this hotel for my second visit to NYC with my grown daughter. The first time was at Christmas a couple of years ago and this time we just wanted to chill and not run around like the frenzied tourists we were last time. I chose this hotel because they are part of Kimpton which is 'greener' than some hotels.. or at least I hoped!We found it to be such a great place to stay - close to Grand Central Station - and yet upon returning - it felt like home. Nice and quiet and welcoming. Cheryl checked us in very nicely and was a lovely hostess at one of the wine hours we were able to attend. Marie was on the desk each evening and the very first evening sent us to a great Italian restaurant just across the street - Rossini's. She was always available to chat or just to smile and wave as we came in each evening. Christopher was the concierge and sent us to a very fun and tasty Thai restaurant in Chelsea - Nooch - and was very good at checking in with us to see how we liked it.As Kimpton members, we were treated to items from the mini bar in the room and also would have had free internet access if only we had brought a computer. But there is free 15 minute access in the lobby and after that you may use your charge card. Each day there is a free wine hour which is fun if you would like to relax awhile and meet other guests - we had the fun of meeting a couple from Chicago. Two great yoga studios - Yoga Sutra and Om Yoga - were very easy to find. One within walking distance across from the NY Library and the other a very easy subway ride to Union Square. Found the farmers market that Saturday going on and a very wonderful boutique store - Mavi. And there is nothing better than to be in a yoga class with the skyline visible outside the windows!A bit more on the hotel ... we were on the 11th floor and never were bothered by the street traffic. Lovely turndown each evening with the best chocolate left on the pillow. There are blackout shades if you want to lower them behind the blinds. We liked waking up to the sunshine. We heard from a fellow guest on the elevator that they were filming a chase / crash scene for 'The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3' a few blocks away so made a detour that morning. Fun to watch. No signs of Denzel, Travolta, or 'Tony Soprano'.. but the crew working the scene were most hospitable. Our flight didn't leave until Monday evening so we were also able to arrange a late check out and they held our bags for us so we could fit in some more time in the city we have to say we might love best!!! We will definitely return.One last thought .. if you're there while the Super Heroes is at the Met.. that was one of our favorite things this time around.	
May 27 2008 	more than adequate	got a great deal via travelocity, ($210 per night for deluxe king room). well, well worth it!!!! i would admit that if i paid $350-$400 per night, i'd be dissappointed. the king deluxe room was actually quite large and spacious, (for NYC standards only). the room was clean, small bathroom, (of course), nice little ipod clock radio. other than that, relatively no-frills. very, very small lobby. but, i'm not in NYC to hang out in the hotel. for the price i paid, i give it an A-. oh, and relatively quiet too, (park ave no honking policy is nice. wish that was in effect when i lived there :( )i would definitely stay again if i received the same kind of deal. if you are looking for a more trendy place to hang out in, this is not for you.....	
May 27 2008 	Small....but really nice!	I got a great rate through Travelzoo for this hotel ($199) and checked out the reviews on Tripadvisor. It was up to my level of expectation, based the the reviews. I expected the room to be small, and it was, BUT, it was really clean, efficitiently set up and very, very comfortable for a short stay. The bed was fabulous and we enjoyed the location which is centrally situated. The staff was friendly and the check-in and check-out was smooth. I would stay her again for a short stay and, if you can get a good rate, it is an excellent value.The price for breakfast is rediculous but there are some good restaurants on Lexington Ave, one block away.	
May 24 2008 	High End Hotel for reasonable price	This was my second stay at the hotel. It is such a nice hotel. I am extremely picky about hotels and will not stay at anything that is slightly budget. I normally stay at Westins, W's, Ritz Carltons, St Regis. The rooms are so clean and actually somewhat spacious for New York. Furnishings are very modern, bathrooms are elegant with subway tile, great bath products that I always take home with me, flat screen TV's, IPOD Docking Station etc..The location is perfectly location in Murray Hill away from the noise of Times Square but close to Midtown and then a quick cab ride downtown. The hotel bar and restaurant are very nice and posh. They are definatley going for a 'Hudson' look here. I will stay here again.	
May 22 2008 	Loved 70 Park Ave.!!	We just got back from our stay in NYC. We stayed at 70 Park Ave for 1 night, but then we stayed in another (more expensive) hotel for the rest of our stay, which was for business. I have to say, we loved the 70 Park Ave. the best. And here's why...The lobby and common areas were very clean and the staff was incredibly nice. I recently signed up for the Kimpton rewards program (free) and they automatically upgraded us to a king room overlooking Park Ave. The room was huge and gorgeous! (See photos..). Park Ave is an extremely nice area, but it's only 2 blocks from Grand Central Station. The bed was so comfortable and the flat screen tv was huge! I'm an interior designer, so I was impressed that they are environmentally friendly (compact flr. bulbs, low flow water fixtures, etc.). We ate breakfast at the Silverleaf Tavern, which was good, but a bit pricey (2 buffet breakfasts - one regular, one continental - both with coffee) - $58. The restaurant design was quite hip though....Overall, I recommend this hotel and the price is extremely competivitve. What a great stay!	
May 4 2008 	Great Hotel Quiet Neighborhood	I stayed at the 70 Park Avenue for work and spent a little time with friends in NYC. I selected it because of Kimpton's reputation, TripAdvisor reviews, and because I got a great corporate rate. Turned out to be the perfect hotel. I had a large room on the 16th (of 17) floor. The bathroom was a little small, but not a big deal. The service at the hotel was first rate with very helpful desk and bell staff. This is in a primarily residential area with easy walking access to Grand Central Station. I liked the quiet residential area as opposed to the more chaotic hotels around Times Sq. or Central Park South. It allowed great access to other areas, but was calm at the hotel. Its still NYC, so I would recommend an upper level floor. It is an older building that has been redone. I had a little issue with the heat/ac one night that unfortunately could only be resolved by opening the window. It was a function of an old building and fluctuating outside temps in early spring. (Not a big deal for me) I would stay here again and would recommend it.	
May 4 2008 	Great stay	I booked via the United web site and landed a room a good $150 less than a similar hotel in Midtown. Very modern hotel, staff has been very friendly and helpful. Two minor downsides: The bathroom is tiny and not well laid out. And the wireless internet service slow and spotty. But otherwise the rooms are clean, modern, well designed. The bed was comfortable and the water pressure in the shower good. The area is quiet for Midtown. I would certainly stay here again.	
May 2 2008	Nice Hotel Great Location Few Amenities	This hotel is very nice, especially for the dollar. The room, like others mentioned was small. That is to be expected in this price range in this location. Cab ride from LGA to the hotel is 29.95 with tip and I personally did not drive, cabbed it everywhere. The hotel is very close to Grand Central with several dining options and shopping(great bagels and coffee in the AM) and a small pharmacy/grocery inside. The immediate area is somewhat residential mixed with corporate offices but a few minutes walking and you can be at the Empire State Building, Macy's, and several other shopping and dining establishments. You should definitely sign up for the Kimpton rewards on their website. It is a free service and you get extra perks as a member (slippers, chocolates, H20 etc , free internet) on your 1st night. The hotel itself has 1 restraunt that is nice, but that is all. The lobby is as small as it appears on the website. It felt a little small to me as far as a place to relax or people watch, bit that is just me and probably common for NYC. I would stay here but if traveling with my children would probably look for somewhere with more amenities. All in all the staff is fantastic, very concerned that your needs are being met. I would definitely stay here again. Excellent staff, Excellent location.	
Apr 19 2008 	Location and Service make this one a gem	Took my daughter on a spring break trip and this hotel was the perfect choice. I was concerned she would want the hustle and bustle of a Times Square Hotel but she welcomed the quiet location come nighttime. The room was nice size especially by NY standards and the bath, though not large, was clean and well-stocked. The beds were very comfortable with nice linens, duvet and blankets. My daughter really liked the ipod station. We were able to listen to Legally Blonde all night! We had a corner room with an unexpected view of the Empire State Building. Great location with an easy walk to Rockefeller Center, Times Square and Grand Central Terminal if you need to travel farther. I would definitely stay here again.	
Apr 8 2008 	Great Hotel Excellent Service	I just returned from a three night stay at 70 Park Avenue and enjoyed the hotel very much. We stayed on the 16th floor and had a nice view of the Empire State Building. We checked in at 4pm on a Friday and didn't have to wait in line. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. We especially liked the nice quality linens--down comforters and pillows, soft blankets. Our room was a good size (with two double beds), and included a desk and chair and still enough room to walk around. Lighting was nice (there was a variety of options) and included candella nightlights, which I hadn't heard about before my stay. It was like having candles in the room--soft lighting.Other amentities that we enjoyed were the iHome clock/radio for my ipod, L'Occitane bath amenities, flat screen with nice sound system, dvd player (my son brought movies with him and bought some from street vendors), slippers, and the nice lotions that were left on our bed each night with the turndown service.The honor bar included a variety of snacks and drinks and some essentials that guests may have forgotton. Prices were reasonable considering the convenience of the bar.I was surprised to receive an e-mail from sombody at the hotel a few days before my stay asking me if there was anything they could do to make my stay more comfortable. I had requested two extra pillows and although they weren't there when we arrived, they were delivered within minutes of my request. On the first night, there was a handwritten note from the assistant GM, with a small welcome treat and an offer to use the internet for free in my room (didn't apply to me since I didn't have a computer). There was free internet access in the lobby (15-minutes per 24 hour period) and free printing of airline boarding passes.The location was prime. Just a few blocks from Grand Central Station -- where there were lots of shops and eateries. We weren't far from the Empire State Building, Rockerfeller Center, Broadway, Fifth Avenue, lots of touristy stuff.	
Mar 29 2008 	Great Service in a great location!	I stayed in 70 Park Avenue for 5 nights in March 2008. We arrived early evening and our bags were brought straight to reception. We checked in with no problems, staff were very polite. Room was a little small but fine for us as a base. Lovely bathroom with toiletries and bathrobes provided. Bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept in! Only downpoint was that you have to pay for everything on the tv, no free channels at all which was a bit disappointing considering the price. Ipod dock was useful to wake us up after a long flight! Also we didn't have a view but were not that bothered as only used the room to sleep and shower! The hotel has a complimentary wine hour from 5.30 to 6.30pm in the lobby each evening. Was lovely and relaxing the two times we made it there!  Doorman so helpful in calling us a cab when we needed it-much appreciated in the rain! The reception staff also let us use their telephone to confirm our trip bookings. There is 30 minutes free internet in the lobby too, after that you have to pay. All in all a lovely hotel in a quiet location. Easy walk to Empire State building and some shops and restaurants. Grand Central Terminal station about 3 or 4 minutes down the street where you can get breakfast and catch a train or the subway.	
Mar 28 2008 	We were very pleased with our stay at 70 Park Avenue	Having done extensive comparison shopping online, I felt sure that this KImpton Hotel would be a comfortable place to stay in a good location at a competetive price. We were not disappointed. The room was larger than any midtown hotel in which I had stayed previously. The marble bathroom was clean and well stocked. Linens were of a superior quality.The lights could be dimmed to nightlight level, and the electronics were cutting edge. The hotel staff was accomodating, making sure I received the requested foam pillows and a make-up mirror. Even a heating pad for sore muscles would have been at my disposal for the asking at no extra charge. Our room was quiet, an upper floor, not on the main street. The concierge desk was staffed at every hour we needed someone, and fresh green apples filled a bowl in the lobby, providing a healthful snack for our 14-year-oldMy husband and I enjoyed the evening wine reception and complimentary coffee in the mornings We highly recommend 70 Park Avenue, a small boutique hotel, where you rarely have to wait for an elevator. Let the concierge book a car to pick you up at the airport for a reasonable fee; then use the subway from Grand Central (just 3 blocks away) to explore areas beyond walking distance. Enjoy a stress-free visit to the big city!	
Mar 25 2008	Perfect hotel in New York	This hotel was PERFECT! it has a great, quiet location close to Grand Central station. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They try hard to make your stay enjoyable. We loved the complimentary happy hour from 5:30  6:30. The beds are heaven and the bathrooms are trendy and clean. I will be returning for sure.	
Mar 23 2008 	Fabulous stay...and a great deal!	We have stayed in many Manhattan hotels, and we found this Kimpton property to be wonderful in many ways. I am a member of their InTouch loyalty program, which may explain why, although we'd paid what is for NYC the giveaway price of $189, we were upgraded to a HUGE penthouse suite with an enormous Jacuzzi tub, separate living room, 2 flat screen tv sets, a lovely view, and a balcony. This price was offered as a Kimpton internet promotion with a duration of a month or so. The hotel was understandably sold out.It being a birthday, a chilled bottle of Cava was there when we arrived. As is usual with Kimpton, the management sent an email in advance of our stay to see what the hotel could do to improve our stay. [InTouch members write personal profiles, so the hotel knew to have dark chocolate waiting for us, too.] The location, a two minute walk from Grand Central, was great. We arrived early and, while the room wasn't yet ready, we were offered facilities at which to &quot;freshen up.&quot; Granny Smith apples were offered near the registration desk. There was free internet in the lobby. Organic and delicious coffee and small label tea---unlimited---were offered gratis until 11 a.m. During our stay we had a minor plumbing problem which was rapidly resolved by the engineer in house. Everyone on the staff was friendly and courteous.I am very happy with Kimpton's social consciousness, e.g. their corporate sponsorship of Dress for Success, HIV/A.I.D.S. contributions, support of the Trust for Public Land. I like their plug that as a guest one does good while sleeping. All in all, I'd describe this as a wonderful Kimpton stay; as usual there were the very welcome personal touches which we have found characteristic of this smallish chain.	
Mar 19 2008 	Lovely Kimpton Property	Had a wonderful weekend here. The room was decently sized for NYC and had all the amenities you would want. The location is quite conveniently located just a few blocks from Grand Central so it was a breeze to get anywhere. 4 adults shared the room and we didn't find it too cramped or uncomfortable.	
Feb 29 2008 	Great stay!	I was very pleased with 70 Park Avenue from check in to check out, everyone was extremely polite and helpful. When I mentioned that my room was smaller than I thought it would be they upgraded us at no extra charge. The rooms are nicely done, with ipod docking station, flat screen TV, Nintendo games &amp; DVD player. The bed was very comfortable with nice linen and duvet. They have a good environmental policy so the tissue &amp; toilet paper are made from recycled paper, and lighting is energy efficent as well. The bathroom was small but very servicable and clean with great ammenities. It is a small boutique hotel but has charm and very warm and upbeat feel about it. My phone was stolen while in NYC and again the staff were very considerate and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel to others. The location on Park just below Grand Central Station is perfect. My son and I had a wonderful time visiting family except for the phone incident.	
Feb 26 2008	Fantastic place to stay!	I have just returned from a 4 night stay at 70 Park Avenue. The hotel was fantastic, the staff extremely friendly and helpful. Had a double king sized room which looked out over the buildings at the side and a nice view of the Empire State Building. The location is fantastic really central being 2 blocks from Grand Central Station. The amenities in the room are very good with L'Occitane toiletries and an LCD 42 inch tv. Also a well-stocked mini-bar which includes some additional items such as nail-files, bed-socks and other handy things you may have forgotten. All in all a fantastic place to stay and would definitely return.	
Feb 12 2008 	Great week in the "Big Apple"	Excellent location (on Park Ave three blocks from Grand Central Station). The staff was extremely helpful. Complimentary wine hour from 5:30 to 6:30 was a Kimpton Hotel special touch. The rooms are comfortable and adequately sized by New York standards L'Occitane products in bathrooms. Large,flat panel TVs in each room. Free use of Apple computers in lobby limited to 15 minutes before starting charges. New York Times each morning on threshold and Wall St. Journal available.  Overall a wonderful 7 day stay.	
Feb 9 2008 	Does what it says on the tin	- Great location 2 blocks from Grand Central Station- Staff helpful if you want, otherwise stay out of your way- Rooms fine (Superior) - bathroom small but adequate- Room at back of hotel over air-conditioning which was noisy,  would prefer front rooms, but not a big problem.- Had a bottle of wine in Bar first night - very expensive - $60	
Feb 2 2008 	Fantastic Customer Service	We stayed at 70 Park Ave. for one night in January and had a fantastic experience. We'd definitely stay again. We were upgraded to a king room at check-in; there were robes, chocolates, still bottled water from Wales and a handwritten note addressed to me from the hotel manager when we returned at the end of the day. This is really great customer service and sets this hotel apart from similar hotels (i.e. Park South).The hotel provided turn down service...this was truly an unexpected treat. The room here was big enough, beautifully appointed (but the bathroom was really small and the mirror covered wall against the toilet really didn't do much to make the room appear larger...scary thing, that mirrored wall...) and quiet enough. Aside from the bathroom, we thought the hotel, staff and the room were great. The general atmosphere of the hotel and the room was peaceful and upscale. The hotel provides wine and cheese every afternoon in the lobby...nice touch.We were directed to Rossini's on 38th street (we could see the restaurant from the hotel lobby) for dinner. The hotel supplies new, complimentary umbrellas in the room for guests' stays, so the short walk in the rain was rather nice. This cozy,little restaurant is great. We awoke to a dry but cloudy NYC, had breakfast downstairs in the restaurant in the hotel, got charged $60.00 for a not so special buffet, explained to hotel management that my package included breakfast (which wasn't clear on my travelzoo confirmation form; I'll watch more carefully for this next time) and they complied. Good for them! The service at this hotel (and throughout the City) was consistently fantastic.	
Jan 28 2008 	Loved 70 Park Avenue!	I recently stayed at this hotel for a shopping weekend in January, based on a friend's recommendation. The hotel staff was amazing from the minute we stepped in, to the minute we left. The room was perfect for two people who didn't want to share a bed (we had two double beds) - clean, nice decor, good size. We didn't have a great view, but who comes to NY to sit in their hotel and look out the window? The beds were amazingly comfortable. The hotel is in a great location - a very quick walk to Grand Central, and is also within walking distance of many great shopping areas and attractions. Fernando, the concierge, was extremely helpful and gave some fantastic recommendations for restaurants in the area, and was able to get us reservations at times we couldn't. Such a nice guy, and always asked us how our dinners were when we came back or the next day that we saw him. Free wine was served in the lobby between 5:30 and 6:30 every day, which was welcoming after a day shopping. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, and have already recommended it to many people.	
Jan 13 2008 	70 Park Avenue - Home Away From Home	First, let me start by saying that I stay at 70 Park Avenue on a regular basis. Let me also say that I have stayed in many, many, many hotels in New York City and the fact that I return to 70 Park Avenue whenever possible speaks for itself.70 Park Avenue looks as classy and sophisticated as it's address might suggest. However, it manages this level of sophistication without the pretension that often goes with other hotels in it's class that make you feel lucky to have been granted a room at their property. 70 Park Avenue is attitude free. To the contrary, the team at this property bends over backwards to make sure that you not only feel welcome, but special as a guest. This goes for the front desk, the bellmen, the housekeeping team - -anyone you come in contact with. As with other Kimpton Propperties, it is clear that the 70 Park Avenue team is extremely proud of their hotel (as they should be) and love their jobs. This makes a winning experience for the guest.But 70 Park Avenue goes even further. How many hotels have you stayed at where you receive a welcome e-mail asking if you have any special needs or requirements several days before your stay? How many hotels are happy to provide upgrades if space is available to make the guest &quot;that much more comfortable&quot; than they would have otherwise been. How many hotels have an endless supply of Granny Smith apples for you to munch on anytime you like? You get all this and alot more at this hotel.As if the service is not enough on it's own, it is matched with exquisite, contemporary yet comfortable decor. Contemporary design can often be cold, but 70 Park Avenue exudes comfort and warmth. When you step out of the elevator, you get the feeling of being in your own, very stylish apartment building vs. a hotel. In your room, warm chocalate and beige hues surround you like a hug, as do bathrobes, slippers, massage lotions, soft music and wonderful toiletries.This is a GREAT hotel - - take it from one who has tried MANY. Stay there and you won't be sorry. As a matter of fact, you are likely to return and make it your &quot;home away from home&quot; in NYC.	
Jan 3 2008 	Quiet boutique hotel	We are a family of 4, so it can be difficult to find a room with 2 beds, and no charge for the extra people in the room. 70 Park Avenue does NOT charge for extra people--so we got a room for a very reasonable rate (at least by New York City standards) The room was small but very well appointed. The hallways were dark and our door stuck so at first, we were leary. But the hotel was friendly, and after we got used to the size of our room, we felt right at home. We would stay there again.	
Dec 25 2007 	This was the Getaway we needed thank you!	We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The minute we checked in, we were greeted by a very sweet staff person, who let us check in at 12:15pm, and automatically offered to upgrade our Queen room to a Delux King. We stayed on the 10th floor, which was quiet and we were not disturbed by any noise. The room was a nice size for a NYC hotel room, with a large televison (as another reviewer pointed out, it was all the way in the corner of the wall, which wasn't a big deal to us), several L'Occitane products in the bathroom, and a really really comfortable bed. The linens were so soft! The shower warmed up right away and had very good water pressure. There was inclement weather, so we didn't want to walk around too much at first in order to get a bite to eat, so was approached a staff person at the front desk for a recommendation, which she happily supplied. She recommended a nice diner style restaurant nearby, Moonstruck, which has a huge menu and very tasty food to choose from, and our salads definitely hit the spot. We felt any time we came in contact with a staff person they were extremely accessible and more than willing to assist us. We received an excellent deal through an online service, and we felt this establishment definitely met our expectations and helped to make our getaway memorable.	
Dec 20 2007 	We won't return.	This very expensive room was clearly a single, with almost no floor space, no chest of drawers, and only the radiator on which to balance a suitcase. The wall-hung TV screen is at right angles to the bed, so one can't watch while in bed, only from the one comfortable chair across the room. Normally we enjoy breakfast in a hotel room, but not here; we didn't even try. We supposedly had a special deal; I can't imagine what they usually charge for this room--or who would pay it!	
Dec 12 2007 	Luxury hotel	Beautiful hotel. Large room (for New York) Friendly staff, wine tasting in the evening was a bonus!! Great location, hotel booked through cityandshow.com who gave superb customer service with decent local knowledge, enabling us to plan and visit most attractions we wanted to in the week we were there.	
Dec 2 2007 	Worst service extremely uncomfortable bed and way overpriced	I travelled there for business, people are so so but the hotel SUCKS! do yourself a favor and not stay there.	
Dec 2 2007 	So Close To Everything - Perfect For A FIrst Timer!	With everything within walking distance this hotel is a gem. Perfect for a first timer who wants to get around New York the only way - on foot!The Bad:Not much really...The Run of the Mill:The rooms are not massive but this is New York. The bathroom is INCREDIBLY small, but still functional - albeit for one person. The Good:NYTimes every morning is a great touch. The little extras in the room are nice such as a bottle opener, ice box and wine glasses. This make for a great stay. The best thing is the LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. You can not say enough just how good the location is. Sitting in Mid-Manhattan with a 3 block walk to the Empire State, a 2 block walk to Grand Central and a 2 block walk to 5th Avenue... Times Square is about 8 minutes away, the Rockefeller Centre is less than 15 minutes, as is Radio City, Central Park and pretty much all the sights of Manhattan. Macys is a brisk 7 minute walk also.If you want a great location with a well appointed (but not grandioso) hotel, then 70 Park Avenue is your hotel.	
Nov 30 2007 	Great Hotel	Great location to 5th avenue, Lexington, Madison, Grand Central. Simple, no frills, nice decor and very cosy. Rooms aren't huge but it is Manhattan. Staff very friendly.	
Nov 25 2007 	Great location nice extras	Stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend. Great location and the rooms were very nice. Definitely not cookie-cutter like chains. We have stayed at a number of Kimpton hotels and this one definitely did not disappoint. We stayed in a king room with a view of Park Ave. The room is small (BUT this is completely expected if you stay in NYC) but very nicely appointed. 5 gigantic mirrors, IHOME for our Ipod, nightly turndown service, yoga mats and equipment available upon request. The room had a very cozy feeling, just what you need after dealing with the throngs of people on 5th ave. Bathroom was completely fine. Again, small, but well appointed and exactly what we expected. The lobby is swanky and the nightly happy hour is fun. It's nice to meet other hotel guests! Another tid bit, Fagolini on Lexington (1 block off from Park) on 39th is a very reasonable cozy italian place. Quite cozy with good service and pretty romantic for my book!	
Nov 24 2007 	Great Location Great Service	It is nestled away in the quieter area of of 5th avenue, but you can walk everywhere. You might feel more like a local and not a tourist. A starbucks is right out the door to the left and the best make-up outlet is right around the corner too. I was attending a convention at the Javitz center and brought a pair of comfortable shoes and walked to and from everyday. Yes, it was quite a haul, but the sights! It was an adventure every morning as I took a different route. The staff and concierge were so helpful in pointing out different places to go and remembered my name and likes/dislikes immediately. The rooms were small but everything fit - just. They packed in almost every amenity and luxury you could need. The view out the back wasn't too great and you can hear people walking in the halls but the beds were perfectly comfortable and the rooms were very clean! The bathroom was small and the ventilation wasn't great but it was clean and that was the most important part. You will have to leave the sliding door open so condensation doesn't overtake the place. I would stay here again in a heartbeat as it really is the epitome of the boutique experience. The doormen are great and see you coming before you can even catch their eye.	
Nov 22 2007 	Great location for City sights	Booked this hotel on the strength of reading reviews. Glad to say I was not disappointed as I booked it for a special birthday present for my partner. The location is near to Grand Central station and to be within walking distance to the Empire State building was great. In fact once you get to grips with the grid system walking around New York is easy and we felt very safe as the neighbourhood was good. We could see Empire S building from our bedroom window and although the bedroom was slightly small - room 1203 - for a double room it had everying we needed. The air conditioning unit was a puzzle to work out but we got there without the buzz in the end. The staff on reception were friendly and it is a nice touch to offer guests wine free for an hour in the evening and free coffee in the morning - although you have to go to the breakfast room to get it - is a bonus. All in all a good hotel and we both enjoyed our stay and have recommended it to some friends who are staying next weekend.	
Nov 14 2007	Fantastic hotel amazing location	This hotel is fantastic. We got a king deluxe for $200 per night off travelzoo. I cannot understand why anyone would complain when looking at the other reviews. Room was fantastic, lovely decor and very clean. Communal areas were spotless and a wine reception was help every night in the lobby. I cannot complain about anything, I only have good things to say about the place. When I return to NYC I will definatley stay here.Location great too, just a few blocks from Grand Central.All in all a great hotel	
Nov 8 2007	Brilliant	OK, so I am a fussy traveller as you will see from some of my other reviews but I am confused as to why there are several bad posts on this hotel. As a regular Kimpton guest I was not dissapointed and found the room superb. The decor was stylish and the room was actually quite big. I can only guess from some of the other comments that the guests are from the parts of the world where space is not at a premium, where rooms are huge and in most other US HOTELS you could call it an apartment. New York hotel rooms are all small and it is something you have to accept. Or alternatively pay in excess of $700 per night. I was also impressed with the food and service and in Particular, there was a lovely gentleman concierge with a gorgeous dog who was fantastic. If you want a hotel in a good position and great service then pick this one.	
Nov 6 2007	Thank you for everything!!	I have never posted or rated any sort of service on the internet before but felt I had to say something here.I got married the 26th of October and stayed in the hotel from the 22nd to the 28th. I was apprehensive of staying here as I have never been to NY before and as I was getting married, I wanted to originally stay in one of the big plush hotels, I am so glad we changed our mind. Firstly the location is nice, you don't walk out of the hotel into hustle and bustle of Times Square or an equally busy avenue or street, but it is in such an area that you can see the Empire State building out of one window and throw a stone at the Grand Central Station out of another (that is not a suggestion!!). I found it (and I have a very poor sense of direction) fab to get about. You can get to see everywhere from Central Park to Pier 17 easily as long as you put comfy shoes on.The service I found was fantastic. I have never been a lover of hotels, I have never taken advantage of a Concierge service and I would always lug a suitcase about myself. However it was my wedding and I cannot praise enough John Powell the gent that helped me find my flowers, locate different shops and generally just be the most helpful man ever.Rooms - now I can compare 3 different rooms in the hotel. We booked a King Suite and were very happy about this, until we found out that we had been upgraded to a Penthouse King Suite which I must say may have been a bit smaller room size but had a massive Jacuzzi bath facing the Empire State Building, massive shower and a wrap around balcony. Yes I know I was very lucky! But to be honest I don't know what everyones problem with the room size is? My friend and her boyfriend stayed in a standard double room, another friend and her brother stayed in a twin, and with all the complaints about size going round I don't know what happened!! Has no-one stayed in a city hotel before? I go to London regularly and I must say that the rooms in the different hotels are generally no bigger. Yes the bathrooms are small but unless you are prepared to fork out a fortune, wherever you go they will be. The rooms are comfortable, the beds are to die for and the bathroom freebies are gorgeous.It tipped it down on my wedding day, I was in Central Park and got covered in mud but I dont care because the whole week was really good we even got champagne red roses and a bath full of petals to come back to. The hotel doesnt need doing up (unless you accidentally go in the service elevator to the basement like I did you might find it a bit duffed up) the corridors arent dark and dingy with threadbare carpets, it is nice and above all you dont feel like a number, staff there remember what you are called and talk to you and see how you are, that is what I wanted and that is what I got.Thanks xxxTip  get down for the free wine at 5.30  6.30 it is nice and if you dont like wine have a bottle of lager instead	
Nov 5 2007 	The worst hotel I have stayed in.	This is part of the complaint that I made to the kimpton hotel 70 park avenue for which I have not yet had a reply.I would like to make a complaint about my stay at your hotel for the period of 26 Oct to 3rd Nov.I have never been treated with such lack of care in a hotel before. I booked by phone (as I was not getting any response via the internet) for two double rooms. I only received one confirmation by email and for one single room. I sent over 14 emails trying to correct this mistake. I received the reply the day after we arrived in New York!I also called the day before we arrived in New York to confirm that there were four of us and also to request for transport to the hotel from the airport only to be told after 35 minutes of international telephone call that the hotel does not provide transport!When we arrived we found little 'childish' cards playing music to us stating that the staff will do everything to make our stay comfortable. On the sixth night I developed an excruciating back pain which I can only attribute to narrow uncomfortable beds in the hotel. It is the first time I have suffered from back pain. It started gradually and reached a peak after a few nights. After taking some pain killers, I asked the reception for a hot water bottle . I waited for 20 minutes just to be told that the hotel does not provide hot water bottles either! I mentioned this, the next day, to Joshua Wills at the desk.He said that he will look into it. I also told him that I had sent numerous emails to the hotel regarding the mistakes in the reservation as well as my enquiries about the transport and had only received a reply after my arrival. He asked me to forward the emails to him and he would look into those too. I did so immediately. Later I went to settle the bill. He gave me a bill including a charge for an extra movie which we had not watched. I asked if he had recieved the emails that I forwarded to him. He said no. I checked my email and noted that they had indeed been sent and precisely to his email and he had recieved it but chose to deny it because he could not be bothered checking his mail. I will not go into further details but this hotel has been given a rating of four star and that is quite amazing considering its facilities which hardly comes up to two/three star anywhere in the world. I have never posted a complaint before. In fact I don't usually like to complain but this experience was just too much to bear. I SHALL NEVER STAY AT KIMPTON HOTELS AGAIN.Mrs M. Howells	
Oct 29 2007 	OK hotel but I'd probably look elsewhere next time	I stayed in this hotel for the first time a few weeks ago, I was there for 3 nights on business. The location is excellent for mid town and the rooms themselves are pretty decent but the bathroom was tiny. The floor I was on also seemed to smell very strongly of cigarette smoke. The room I had was large enough although as it was at the back of the hotel it looked straight at another buildings air conditioner units. This turned out to be a bit of problem as these air conditioners are very noisy. The air con unit in the room made so much noise that I turned it off and opened the window only to find that the units outside made even more noise, so I struggled to sleep well while here.Overall I would say that the location and hotel bar are good (as is the food they serve in the bar), but for me I will try a different hotel next time Im in NY.	
Oct 24 2007 	Great Hotel	We have been to New York 3 times now , and this is the best hotel we have stayed in , friendly helpful staff , really nice rooms and a great location . We will return there next time in New York	
Oct 22 2007 	Love It	Read loads of reviews on loads of hotels before taking the plunge on this one. I found a decent price on cityandshow.com and they gave me good information about the hotel and made some great restaurant recommendations.The hotel is decent, really clean, staff helpful and in a nice quiet (if that is possible) part of the City, but within reach of all the keys sites. The rooms are decked out nicely and the bed was lovely and comfortable. The hotel also has a drinks hour for all guests which is a lovely touch and starts the evening off well. I would certainly recommend this place and would stay there again	
Oct 18 2007	Very $$$$ hotel that serves Beringer wine....	On my last day at this hotel I took advantage of the &quot;free&quot; wine hour in the lobby and after paying over $500/night I got a glass of undrinkable Beringer wine. Is that the best they can do when they're raking in that kind of dough? Do they not value their clientele enough to serve them anything better than supermarket wine? Looking at the wallpaper (made to look like marble?) and the 80's formica coffee table covered in wallpaper (which was peeling), I felt like that I'd been had....Everything about the experience felt cheap....You can stay in some wonderful hotels in NYC for $500 -- think grande dame, Central Park, real marble lobby, etc. This place is a knock-off and not a very good one.	
Oct 17 2007 	Nice hotel	70 Park Avenue hotel is a nice hotel in a nice area. We stayed in a King Deluxe room. The mattress is super comfortable and the room is very clean. By New York standards it is also quite spacious. The staff was very courteous and quick to help. The hotel is conveniently located by Grand Central station and the Empire State Building. The hotel is older and the floors squeaked but other than that I have no complaints. We booked through using a code from travelzoo for $200 a night and felt it was a good deal. I would stay there again in the future.	
Oct 4 2007	Eh.	I'm a sucker for nice bath amenities, so I was kind of excited when I won this hotel on Hotwire. Their website also touts their &quot;forgot it, we've got it&quot; program, and since I was stuck in the city after working a 14-hour day, I was looking forward to some gratis saline solution.Alas, their idea of forgotten essentials includes shoe shine polish kits and nail files, which is all good, but not what I needed. Their L'Occitane toiletries were kind of old lady floralish. Bathroom was the smallest bathroom I have ever been in - counting my first apartment when I lived in NYC - that's small! They did a good job of strategically placing mirrors to make the room and bathroom seem larger.As others have mentioned, the walls were VERY thin. Hallways seemed worn. Plasma TV was nice, but was streaky-looking in damaged areas of the screen. Minibar was in a strange place (right between the beds in the nightstand), and though it was broken - outer door opened, but other door was stuck, blocking the fridge - and I told the front desk about it when I left, my AmEx still incurred a mystery charge. Perhaps I was given a worn, faulty room as a Hotwire customer, but I would never stay here at full price. Actually, I don't think I'd even stay here for $199. There are much better deals in NYC.	
Sep 30 2007 	You've got to be kidding me . . .	I stayed here because this is a &quot;Kimpton&quot; hotel, which I have always had good experiences with. Not this place. The hallways are barely wide enough to navigate. (Might want to skip meals for a week before you get there, the elevator could pass for a coffin.) For our $600 bucks a night for three nights, we got a dingy room with visible stains on the bedding, a bathroom barely big enough to enter, and a cleaning staff that attempted to pilfer my ipod. Don't bother with this place. You'd be better off at a La Qunita (and would have $1500 left over).	
Aug 31 2007 	Sweet Hotel	I enjoyed the hotel, but I think I'd go elsewhere next time. It wasn't very exciting, but it was a nice base, especially if it is your first time in New York. The staff are very helpful and friendly and the hotel is within walking distance to Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building. The hotel interior was modern and funky, and our room had the coolest portable lights. The buffet breakfast was also very nice. For a good dinner, I'd recommend Todai, an all you can eat sushi buffet near the Empire State Building!	
Aug 30 2007 	Good hotel!	We stayed in a double double room at the hotel. It was cramped, but compensated for this with excellent features such as a 42&quot; TV, excellent L'Occitane toiletries and an iPod speaker/alarm clock, although a larger room would be a requirement for a future stay. The staff were very helpful and there are computers that you can use in the lobby, (for an extortionate price). The breakfast is very mediocre, and there is a similarly priced alternative called the Central Cafe, opposite Grand Central station, (which is just down the street) that serves the best pancakes on Earth. When you are so close to one of the best breakfasts in NYC, there is no excuse not to try the Central Cafe!	
Aug 21 2007 	I'll Be Back!	Stayed at the 70 Park Avenue while attending the New York Gift Fair. The location is great...nice neighborhood and central to everything. The hotel is small and cozy with an attentive staff. The consierge is exceptional and endlessly helpful. Each evening the lobby is filled with quests having a complimentary glass of wine or beer. A small dog named Sydney is a constant presence and is always ready for a quick game of Tug O War. The rooms are small, the bathroom smaller - but both are well appointed and comfortable. I was especially impressed with the water pressure. The large flat screen TV was nice though the sound system was a little large for the small room. This is a perfect place for someone travelling alone. I will definately make a return visit.	
Aug 20 2007 	Park Avenue Ordinary	The rooms are clean and quiet. The plasma TV's are nice. But other than that the hotel experience was very ordinary. The hallways are narrow and dark, the lobby is small and need of an upgrade. The complimentary (?) 15 minutes of internet access is a joke, either make it free or don't offer it. Our room had a nice view of the air conditioning equipment. If you can get a good rate (around $200 per night) I would say it is a good value, but if not don't bother.	
Aug 20 2007	Nice hotel at this price point	I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels and this was my first stay at this property. - Older building that's been renovated. So a bit squeaky in some places, small elevators, etc- A few blocks from Grand Central Station- Clean overall- Friendly, professional, helpful staff- Nice bar... for a hotel- Room was well appointed. Thoughtful turn down service. Bathroom was small, but nicely renovated- Rooms not as &quot;sealed&quot; as newer properties. My room (1506- overlooks Park Ave) was quiet, but another guest was complaining at the front desk about screaming kids in the middle of the night. Guest across the hall had an upset bowel and awful smells wafted through the hallway - Would stay at this property again and recommend to others	
Aug 9 2007 	Great small boutique hotel	Stayed 6 nights in late July/early August for the first time in this boutique hotel on business trip. Paid US$290 + tax per night (which includes free daily newspaper).Overall, had a great 4* stay.Pluses:- location, location, location! (2 blocks from Grand Central Station, next to Madison and Fifth Avenue shopping areas, easy and quick exit to JFK)- large and well furnished bedroom (Empire State building view, 42&quot; plasma TV, Ipod compatible sound system, DVD player, king size bed, cordless telephone)- friendly and efficient staff- free wine tasting every evening (although small size of lobby makes it difficult to participate)- generous supply of L'Occitane toileteries in bathroom- adequate breakfast spread (approx US$30 incl. tax) - but limited choice of hot foodNegatives:- minute bathroom (combine shower/bath tub, inadequate space to put out own toileteries or electric toothbrush - finally resorted to putting toiletries in the bedroom, steams up easily if bathroom door is closed)- narrow corridors / elevators- no gym on site (although hotel can offer complimentary access to a nearby gym)- no business facilities, no free internet- small lobby / public areaOverall, would definitely stay here again for business or pleasure especially at the right price (good New York hotels are notoriously very expensive) due to great location and generous and well appointed bedroom. However, if price is not an issue and a 5 star stay is preferred then this hotel is not the right choice.	
Aug 9 2007 	Tiny bathroom and windows don't block out noise.	Spent 3 nights on the 3rd floor of the hotel facing the street. Paid $335 with tax on a corporate account. The bathroom was tiny, even by NY standards. The room was plagued by quite a bit of street noise. The carpet in the room had ink stains.The staff were friendly and very helpful. The room had a large flat screen TV and was pretty well sized. The hallways were small and somewhat dingy. There was a large stain outside the room and we always seemed to be walking around the housekeepers carts.The hotel is in a good location, but unless you secure a good rate you can do better.	
Aug 7 2007 	Very Cozy Place to stay in the heart of it all	I stayed at the hotel for 4 days in July on a business trip for work. The staff at the front desk was very friendly. On man even took the time to find a cell phone charger for me after my suitcase was lost at the airport. I had a single room with a king size bed. The room was great. Could not believe the amount of mirrors in the room. It had an alarm clock that I could hook my Ipod up to. That was cool. The restuarant food was ok, nothing to brag about. The front door guys where really nice. Times Square was 4 blocks up and 4 blocks over. China Town was a $13 cab drive away. Grand Central Station was very close to the hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. My mother and I plan on returning again in October for a shopping trip.	
Aug 7 2007 	Fun small hotel	Good 5 night stay at the 70 Park ave. hotel in NYC in July. This is a small boutique type hotel located about 3 blocks south of Grand Central Station on Park Avenue. Location is good for walking anywhere in the city and also close to train or subway. Friendly Door men are very quick at hailing cabs as well.The hotel is very well decorated. Rooms are comfortable and contemporary, we had a plush King size bed with loads of pillows and the large flat screen wall TV was a nice touch, complete with sound system and dvd player.From our window we could see the Empire State Building and that was nice. There was great closet space but the bathroom was tiny. Not really a problem except for the toilet which was pushed up against the bathroom heater. If you are a large person--good luck. But the fixtures were all new and the shower was great, with a nice selection of soaps, etc.In room safe, free coffee in the bar area downstairs. We loved the concierge, John Powell, who went out of his way to help us with several requests. Be sure to talk with him --he has invaluable info about NYC. and can help you get some super dinner reso's in whatever price range you want.The bar area was nice, plus there is a happy hour with free wine in the lobby each evening. Nice touch to relax after a day sightseeing or working. I would recommend this hotel , especially if you can find a good deal because it can get rather pricey --only complaint I had was the toilet and they can use better sound-proofing on their doors--loud bang whenever a door closes close to your room. but other than that the 70 Park Ave. is a really nice hotel in a great part of the city. It's a part of the Kimpton group--so be sure to sign up for their in-touch program.	
Aug 1 2007	Pleased @ the Park	Date: July 15, 2007I needed a place to stay in New York to help celebrate an anniversary. And after looking on Trip Advisor and reading many reviews I decided to try 70 Park Avenue.It was perfect. The staff was very helpful. We went to the hotel hoping we could check in early. There was a room available but it didn't have the greatest view. And we knew this because the person at the front desk nodded her head left and right to let us know we shouldn't take that room. Luckily we weren't in a hurry so when we came back we had a room with a better view.The room was a good size. The bed was nice and comfortable. The plama T.V. is a nice touch. Seeing the L'Occitane toiletries in the washroom was a pleasant surprise. There was an IPOD docking station to charge and listen to your IPOD.There was also a complimentary wine reception in the hotel lobby and coffee and tea served in the morning in the restaurant/bar.We were even able to leave our luggage when we came to the hotel early and left our luggage after we checked out and came back after spending the afternoon sightseeing.Even though we were only two or three blocks away from Grand Central Station the area did not seem hectic. It did have a &quot;boutique&quot; feel to it.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who plans to visit New York. I know I'm glad I stayed there.	
Jul 24 2007 	Lovely hotel good location	We stayed at 70 park avenue hotel over memorial day weekend this year. We were in NY just to enjoy the city and restaurants for the long weekend and we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We booked a special deal through Travelocity and got an amazing rate ($200) for a basic room. Yes, the room was small, but the amenities were nice (l'Occtaine toiletries, nice bed, plasma tv, magazine to read, etc) and our room even had a view of the Empire State Bldg. The hotel staff was friendly, there was a good quality coffee/tea service in the mornings, free wine happy hour reception each evening, apples in bowls in the lobby, etc. Even though it is a chain (Kimpton), it definitely has the feel of a boutique hotel. It's location a few blocks from Grand Central Station on Park Ave. was very nice. We enjoyed being in more of a residential area of the city and off the beaten tourist path a bit. I would stay here again.	
Jul 18 2007 	twins fan	We have stayed in many of the large hotels in NY, and we found the location and size of this hotel superior to any others. We enjoyed the efficiency and friendliness of this hotel's staff, the cleanliness of the lobby and rooms, the comfortable beds and pillows, and the lack of congestion both in and around the hotel. It was convenient to all NY locations. The bowls of apples in the lobby and the wine/beer happy hour were a pleasant surprise. We would defiantly stay here again on our next trip to the city.	
Jul 16 2007 	Nice Hotel	Stayed at this hotel one night for Business after four nights at the Hilton NY with my family. Interesting contrast. This hotel is quite old but a very well done boutique type hotel, with a smaller well appointed room. Very friendly staff and a good Midtown location.	
Jul 11 2007	70 Park Avenue hotel	This hotel was fine. I had a small, but lovely room--very clean too. The hotel was old, but was not slow. The hotel is old and art deco, but not dumpy as other New York hotels can be. The location was fine, the staff was okay, but I wasn't blown away by the service.The wine reception at night was fine. the Internet is only free for 15 minutes and you have to put a credit card in first, because the next 15 minutes are $15.00The Silver Leaf Tavern in the lobby was not interesting at all. It was rarely open and it was overpriced.I do recommend this if you can get a good deal.	
Jul 10 2007 	Park Avenue Pleasure	Booked a Premier King Room. This is highly recommended as their general rooms are quite small and coming from the UK, I got it for £573 for 3 nights on Lastminute.The hotel is very central for sightseeing. It's about a 20 minute walk to Greenwich Village or Central Park and has plently of restaurants nearby. It's right in the heart of the city and on a busy road (isn't everything in New York) but it's also quite a leafy street.We had room 1015 overlooking Park Avenue. It was a well appointed room with a nice jacuzzi bath, huge TV and everything the hotel say it has on the site. I would definately stay here again. Gripes, well here are my criticismsNo tea and coffee facilities as mentioned in a previous review. $7 plus $3 room service and 20% gratuity included is ermmmm excessive. Thats $11 for a pot of tea. Tea is complimentary on a morning in the lobby but who wants to put on their clothes when they just wake up to sip free coffee in the lobby. Starbucks is two buildings down on the left when you come out of the entrace lobby and is $1.69. Starbucks was our saviour when we stayed and you can drink it in the comfort of your room.Mini BarSorry staff but $4.25 for a 330ml can of Pepsi makes you feel like you are being ripped off. Shop around the corner sells 1.5litres for 79 cents. I know that mini bars are always expensive but it was excessive.Room ServiceThe Silverleaf Tavern downstairs do the most wonderful french bread pizza which we had in the bar when friends came to visit us for drinkies. It's $12 in the bar but $15 + $3 delivery and 20% tip to the room. Why $15 when they are adding $3 delivery on too. Don't understand that.InternetIt's $10.95 for 24 hours wifi or ethernet connection billed to your room. In this day and age, free internet should be an added little bonus to make your stay more comfortable. They provide free internet on two laptops in reception but only for 15 minutes a day per credit card number you tap in on the screen, then it's $5.99 per 15 minutes. This I didn't like.Apart from those things to avoid, it's an excellent choice and for someone who had never visited New York we feel we hit on to somewhere good.	
Jul 8 2007 	Great boutique hotel	Mrs chop and I were in town to see a show, and decided to give 70 Park Ave a try. I used to live two blocks from this location, so I know the area well. Not right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle like in Times Square, but close enough to everything (we even walked all the way down to Union Square).We booked a King Premier room. The room assigned was a corner room on the top floor, with our own private balcony (complete with benches, plants, and even a little table, very nice). Huge soaking whirlpool tub plus separate shower. Large plasma TV on wall. Room was very nicely furnished and cleaned.Check-in was efficient and courteous (my wife counted they said Mr. chop fifteen times during the check in process). During the entire stay, staff was very friendly.No coffeemaker in room. But they do have free coffee just off the lobby in the morning. And of course the Kimpton wine-tasting thing in the early evening.It was very hot (around 95) and with the room on the top floor, air/con was not as cold as I'd like it. But it was cool enough.Style in very comparable to SPG's W hotels, but brighter and less &quot;chic for chic's sake.&quot; I like this very much (I like Ws too, but this is IMO more subdue).All in all, a great stay. So much so that we have already booked a return visit in a couple of months.	
Jul 2 2007 	Nice hotel	I stayed at this hotel over the weekend of June 29th with my girlfriends while attending a bachelorette party. The hotel was very nice and we had no real complaints. Check in was quick, the lobby is rather small which makes you feel like the front desk is watching your every move but they gave us no real problems. The rooms were a nice size and could easily accomodate the small suitcases of 4 30 year old women. Cabs were easy to get with the assistance of the doorman. We got this hotel for $199/night through travelzoo and thought it well worth the money. The weather in NYC was nice and we had no problems with the temperature of the room or AC as previously mentioned. The beds were great. No ice machines, room service has to bring it to you. Also, don't bank on valet it cost me $42/day and I probably should've gone and found a spot but at rush hour in NYC I just didn't feel like it. We had room service come and make our beds and give fresh towels as they normally would. Modern room with flat screen tv were really nice. A cab is needed to get to any area though but that was okay with us.	
Jun 15 2007 	We loved it!	We stayed at 70 Park Avenue for a week in November, we had one quibble while we were there which was resolvedDont know why but i am always impressed when theres a man employed to just open doors when you arrive.Check in was efficient with helpful friendly staffWe really did love the rooms, the bed was so comfortable (so comfortable we bought a similar one when we got home), the bathroom was a good size for the two of us plasma and dvd wer great to have, some nights we do like to just lounge around in the room, and also wireless internet avaiable for the week was really handy, We loved the little removable lights,We did have one issue, one night we came back from a show and found that our door opened without the key, it was about 11pm at night, we phoned reception and a maintenance man arrived to try and fix it, we then had another guy come up, after about an hour of faffing around it still wasnt fixed, the senior guy suggested that we leave the door as it is and then tomorrow will try and fix, it, my husband (far too polite) agreed, then the door closed they left and 1.....2......3...... &quot;YOU DO REALISE THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY IM SLEEPING IN THIS ROOM WITH NO LOCK ON THE DOOR!&quot; So i rang recpetion with quite a bit of arguing they agreed to move us to another room, we had 15mins to pack our things and get to a new room, we did get complimentary breakfast, however i shouldnt have had to argue so much to feel safe.This happened on the second to last day it didnt ruin the holiday we had a blast, went to statue of liberty, empire state building, rockafeller, i would always recommend the express ticket on the empire state building and make sure you right to the top,We also went to see Rent, i loved it Husband didnt (however i have watched the dvd), and we saw I love you Your perfect now change which we laughed all the way through.Also do jump on one of the tour buses they are great fun and a nice easy way to see the sights without getting cabsNew york is a fantastic place, i would definately go back, i think i left a piece of my heart there	
Jun 12 2007	You Won't Find Better	This is a real sleeper. Everything is great. The employees can't do enough for you. Great location. You name it. You can't go wrong here. I noticed a remark about some small bathrooms. True, but it won't spoil your trip. It is really a sensational hotel. I've stayed in many. This is a keeper.	
Jun 5 2007 	Loved Everything about It	The Super shuttle dropped us off in front of the hotel and we were immediately impressed. The lobby was neat and clean. The employees were all friendly and helpful. Upon arrival to our room we were delighted. Great size for a hotel room in New York for 3 people. Wonderful large-flat-screen TV, plush terry cloth robes and towels, nicely decorated room, but most of all CLEAN. The maid brought extra towels immediately upon request.The location is fantastic-close to Grand Central Station and the metro, bus stop is one block awa y. Lots of good eateries down the block on Lexington. Scotty's Diner perfect for breakfast.We got a great rate on Travel Zoo and would definitely stay there again for the same price.	
May 29 2007 	Sweet Sixteen Overnight	Excellant experience! Got a great deal through Travelzoo.com $199 pernight. Belong to Kimpton In Touch Club Membership and received an upgrade to a King Premier Room that connected to Double Double Deluxe with the help of Natalie the onsite hotel reservation professional. The staff was very accommodating and provided excellentservice for the group of ten that was traveling. I want to single out Crystal, one of the hotel's Concierge's who helped with ideas for the sweet sixteen party and for providing the cake and refreshments for the late night celebration. Crystal really made the overnight a complete success. I would definitely return for future stays!!!!	
May 21 2007 	Glad it wasn't generic but some things lacking	My husband and I stayed in a King Deluxe room on the 12th floor on a Friday evening in May. We came away with mixed feelings about the place and the conclusion that we would make reservations somewhere else on our next trip to the city. Here were the pros and cons:Pros: -Quiet room as requested (but note: if you request a quiet room the downside for this hotel is that you might face another building, giving little light and no view, instead of a quieter side street).-Room was very clean and restful, with soft lighting, interesting textured walls, quiet brown tones for color scheme, two big windows that open, good amount of space (around 300 sq. ft.).-Location OK - convenient to Grand Central, quiet neighborhood as others have noted (but a short walk, 5-10 blocks, to some interesting restaurants on Lexington Avenue and 3rd Avenue)-I liked the quirks of it being an old building, which meant an unusual (if inefficient) room floor plan. Room 1201 where we stayed had a big entryway area with large tiles on the floor, and the armoir was placed in this entry area. The 42&quot; TV was off center from the bed because the bed faced two windows, and so the only place where they could install the TV was facing the bed but to the right. Actually that was nice, I thought, since the TV wasn't quite so present that way.Cons:-As another reviewer mentioned, no coffee maker in the room. Strangely lacking in this basic convenience. I asked for one at the front desk and was told none was available. Wasn't willing to pay $12 (pot of coffee plus delivery fee) for room service coffee. Went downstairs for the free coffee in the morning (wishing I could have stayed in my jammies and made my own high quality coffee, having brought it with me) --- it was worse than terrible!!!!! Something akin to Maxwell House. Boutique hotels should IMNSHO offer high quality coffee.-They don't seem so great at honoring requests. I had requested a foam pillow online but did not receive one (didn't go to the trouble of making a second request, but they should have noticed the first).-When I told the front desk clerk that I would appreciate it if they made a note of my unhappiness with not having a coffee maker in the room, I was handed a business card and &quot;invited&quot; to comment on this myself. Hmmmm.....I'm supposed to make that much of an extra effort after being inconvenienced? Why don't they collect this information as it is given to them at the desk?-One bathrobe only (why do hotels do this? These rooms are often enough shared by two people -- must they share a single bathrobe?)-No Candella portable dim lights that were promised on the website, and I was looking forward to checking them out.-L'Occitane bath products weren't so hot.-Nothing great at all about the service at the desk or by the bellhops. Perfunctory, didn't seem to really care, nothing really personable. A big contrast to the super customer service I recently experienced while staying at the nearby Affinia 50 hotel.Altogether, our stay was moderately comfortable, the decor was OK in a generic modern way (without any real interest to it), the location means you need to walk/taxi/subway to anything you would likely want to do. We did luck out and only paid $175 for the room (before taxes), on the Starbuck's Friends and Family plan (relative being a Starbucks exec.), would have been VERY unhappy if we had shelled out their normal price for the room, which I think was well over $300.	
May 14 2007	Nice rooms close to Grand Central- great experience	Pros-Close to Grand Central Station (3 blocks)Located in a beautiful, fairly quiet neighborhoodNice luxury touches in room- jacuzzi tub (very nice after long day of work/sightseeing), plasma TV (barely used it, but nice), and even had these little battery powered cadella lights for ambience.Free computer to use in lobby (always occupied though)Wine reception every evening Very helpful/friendly staffCons- For a tourist, Grand Central is a nice hub of travel, but being on the red line for the subway system would be even more convenient (in my opinion) for the major sightseeing.Thats it. That is really the only thing that would have made my stay perfect.	
May 2 2007 	Great deal for $200 a night	Booked the king bed deal through Travelzoo for $199 a night. Asked for a upper floor room with little noise and got a room on the 16th floor. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. Love the 42&quot; plasma tv, the ipod clock station and the dvd player at no extra charge. The bathroom is small and the water didn't drain as fast in the shower. The neighborhood is nice, close to the Grand Central Ternimal where you can jump on Metro which can take you to every part of Manhattan. Walking distance within Empire State Building, New York Public Library and a leisurely stroll up towards Midtown. A great deal for a romantic weekend in the Big Apple.	
Apr 20 2007	A nice little place	We stayed at 70 Park Avenue Hotel for a weekend in April. We booked the hotel through travelzoo for $219 a night (for a room with two double beds). The hotel was nice but not spectacular. The lobby looks very nice but the hallways were a little shabby - nothing a little paint couldn't brighten up. The staff was wonderful and anytime we had to call down to the front desk for anything they were very prompt in getting it to us. The room was small but nothing less than I would expect for a boutique hotel in NYC. Our room had a very nice, very large flat screen tv with bose speakers and a dvd player. The mini bar was surprisingly well priced and actually cost less than ordering drinks through room service. The bathroom was very small but as long as you don't need more than one person in there at a time you'll be fine. We asked for a &quot;quiet&quot; room and the one we had was perfect. It was away from the elevator and on an alley. We didn't have a great view because of the alley but at least we didn't have any traffic noise either. The hotel is in a very quaint area of NYC called Murray Hill. It's not far from most things and yet it is a relatively residential area so there is not a lot of foot traffic. The only complaint that I had was that the maid service left a little to be desired - she never replenished the glasses in our room even when they were very clearly dirty - and when the staff brings stuff up to your room upon your request they have a tendency to just try and walk in without knocking. Obviously if you're in the habit of deadbolting the door when you're in your room this would not be an issue. There is a safe in the room so if you are worried about leaving something in the room you can do so safely. If you need to leave your bags at the hotel after you check out they are more than happy to store your things for you without an extra charge. There are also laptops available down in the lobby for you to use if you want to hop on and check your email or look up something. The concierge was also very friendly and very helpful. Overall I was very happy with this hotel and would definitely stay there again.	
Apr 12 2007 	Great Boutique Hotel	We loved the hotel, and am not writing this review out of pity for the staff as stated by a previous reviewer. What people seem to be forgetting is that this is a BOUTIQUE hotel so it is going to have less amenities and less space than other bigger hotels. If that is what you are looking for then stay at a big chain such as Hilton or Sheraton. Saying that though i stayed at the Hilton New York last year and had a much smaller room than I recieved at the 70 Park Avenue. The room we stayed in (1610 )was spacious, well presented and the bathroom was adequate for myself and my 6ft 1in boyfriend to fit in at the same time!We received any room service order promptly and nothing was too much bother. The free internet makes a real difference and we were able to book tickets for various attractions and print out the tickets the night before.The location is great, easy to walk to all the major attractions and shops, and there are a number of good options for breakfast and dinner nearby.We were lucky to receive a great deal of $199 a night through travelzoo, but would be happy to return to the hotel on any subsequent visits.	
Apr 11 2007 	King For A Night	For a single traveler, this is a fine place to stay. If more than one, though, a King room is a necessity. We were two and assigned a small room with a full-size bed. We asked for a larger bed, but the hotel was sold out.An upgrade was available the next day for an additional $50 a night, but we didn't want to pay that. Fortunately, on our third night the front desk manager was able to give us a free upgrade to a junior suite with a King bed. That helped ease our concerns about our stay and made for a great last night at the hotel.I might mention that we had stayed here when it was the Doral Park for a month. Then we had two beds and were able to be comfortable, even with a dog.I stayed here alone last year and was happy with my room, which then had a King bed.So, in short, try to make sure you are getting at least a King size bed if there are two of you. Unless your a very close couple!	
Apr 5 2007	Very nice for the price	I stayed here in January with my sister, on our annual &quot;sisters&quot; visit to the City for eating at great restaurants and seeing shows. We got a great price -- $200-- and both agreed as we left that we would come back again. Because it was a boutique hotel, there was never a line; there was always a hello; we never had a problem getting a cab (which I needed, as I was using a cane for walking that week); and we met and enjoyed other visitors. The room was just fine (nicely outfitted, etc), and although the bath was small, it was fine,too.I stayed in the location before, and really liked it -- in a lovely neighborhood, but close enough to walk to theater (I just couldn't this year because of my injury.)	
Apr 4 2007 	Only OK-I expected more from Kimptpn	OK-I'm a HUGE Kimpton fan and 70 Park Ave is the seventh Kimpton I have visited, so I had VERY HIGH expectations. It is not the caliber of 9-0 (Boston) or most of the Hotel Monacos. Was disappointed to find window air conditioning unit blocking 1/3 of our Park Avenue view. (On the second day I asked them to take it out-which they did). Some of the furniture was scratched up and I've never seen such a maze of extension cords and wires (although we did enjoy the flat screen tv, dvd player and stereo). I know all NY rooms are small, but the bathrooms at 70 Park are tiny-(think Paramount NYC) -only one person at a time. We were in King Deluxe (Room 1607-beside elevator) at $199 Travelzoo rate booked through Kimpton. Requested high floor as street traffic is noisy during week-but Sat/Sun were quiet. Room 1605 is corner room in same category (not bigger but windows on two sides makes huge difference). Although the location is great, I expect more attention to detail from Kimpton. The lobby is not convivial-the space is chopped up-divided by big table with computers. Free wine or not - I didn't want to linger. Front desk is so small staff can only assist one or two guests at a time. Ask for coffee maker for room as lobby coffee was empty more than once. At $199 I don't feel like I can complain too much, but if you are spending $350 go to the Soho Grand or W Tuscany. And what is Kimpton thinking with the music theme (see website-the theme of 70 Park Ave is music)?? Only evidence of theme was framed sign by the elevator on my floor proclaiming Peter Gabriel Sledgehammer to be the most widely played music video. Kimpton should have put that attention to detail into something else.....	
Mar 30 2007 	The Honest Truth	Just got back from NYC where I stayed at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel for 3 nights. Had a standard room with a King at $325/ night.The staff was terrific, extremely accomodating. They have a nice bar attached to the hotel. A wine tasting every night and a coffee bar set-up in the morning is a nice touch. Centrally located 2 blocks south of Grand Central Station for those who use the train.However, the Hotel is tiny. When I say tiny, I mean everything is downright liliputian. The lobby is beyond small. The front desk couldn't be more than 5 feet long. The elevators, of which there are two, are extremely small, and can fit no more than 3 people with bags. The hallways are dark, gloomy and extremely narrow. I had a corner room with a king bed. To say it was small would be an understatement. It felt like I was sleeping in a closet. The bathroom was calustrophobic. Fitting two people in a King room for more than a night is an adventure in contortion. Sharing the bathroom sink in the morning is out of the question. The door to the bathroom is a slider....always a bad sign...to save on room space. The funniest thing was the huge 40&quot; Plasma bolted on the wall that absolutely dominated the room. Unfortunately it was opposite the door, rather than the bed and had no swivel arm so you could never watch it straight on. And closets? Well, there are none. Just an armoire for hanging clothes.The upshot of this is that you just can't keep the place neat and orderly because there's just nowhere to put anything. Bags have to sit on the only open floorspace where you get to trip on them, clothes get strewn about the room. It was if I was back in my dorm room at college....well at least I had a good laugh over that. Thankfully, the top-rate hotel staff always came in to neaten up each day, They must all be experts in storage solutions.The linens were very nice, but the mattress I had felt like it needed replacing. Great control over the air conditioning and heat, hot showers in the morning.But, would I stay here again? Absolutely not........not unless I shrink to half my size. And I'm really sorry to say that...because the staff there is so good. I almost felt sorry that they had to make up for the hotels, ahem, &quot;short&quot;comings. They deserve a better hotel to work at.Anyone who gives this hotel a great rating is, I assure you, doing it out of pity for the staff. There is almost nothing else to like about it.	
Mar 29 2007	It was OK	The overall design of the building is nice, but the construction is terrible. For example, the toilet was flush up against a metal heater that is no longer in use, so when you sit down to use the restroom the entire side of the leg is exposed to cold metal. I'm scratching my head trying to figure out how a man or a heavier person would use the toilet because I'm small.It was very dark in the hallways, the carpets were pretty gross and my towels had holes and stains.The staff was so nice and the doormen were great. I actually liked the location because I like to sleep at night and it was nice and quiet. I got room service for breakfast one morning and it was very quick. Overall, it wasn't horrible, it was pretty average.If you get a good deal on the price like I did then I would recommend it, but if you are paying full price I would consider elsewhere.	
Mar 28 2007 	Great Staff and Great Location!	Excellant experience! Got a great deal through Travelzoo.com $199 per night. Belong to Klimpton In Touch Club Membership and received an upgrade to a King Premier Room and a free on demand movie. Had a 40&quot; inch plasma TV and a bathroom with jacuzzi larger than my bedroom at home. Is the hotel older? Yes, Are some of the rooms in need of renovation when paying over $300? Yes. But there is no price that can be placed on the great staff at this hotel. Any requests placed to housekeeping, front desk or room service were fulfilled within minutes. The location was perfect. Three blocks to Grand Central Station and six blocks to the Empire State Building. It was quiet and peaceful during the evenings but just 15 minutes and six blocks away was Times Square. I did not have an issue with noise but did learn that during March that only the heating system worked and had to open the windows during some of the warmer days during the visit. I went with my 12 year old son and by the end of our four days, the staff were welcoming us by our first names. This was my first experience with a Klimpton Hotel but I can promise it will not be my last. Make sure to get back to the hotel by 6:00pm to enjoy the complimentary wine or beer. Great diner one block from hotel called Moonstruck which was a favorite eatery during our stay. The hotel dining room was more of a lounge and was not appropriate for my son and myself. Two computers plus a printer were available in the lobby at no charge which were a great asset when checking for last minute plans during our stay. At the end of four days in New York, I asked my son what will he remember most about his visit and he said all the nice people he met at the hotel. If looking for a hotel that treats it's guests with four star service no matter how much was spent for the room don't hestiate to try this establishment.	
Mar 16 2007 	Very enjoyable stay	Just returned from 4 nights staying at this hotel. There was 4 people in my party so we booked a king deluxe room and a double double deluxe queen room. We got a promtional offer through Travelzoo.com for $199 per room. I really enjoyed staying in this hotel. Have no complaints at all. Check-in was very swift and the receptionists were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were lovely, an ok size (not massive) and simply decorated with a flat screen dvd, wifi and dvd player. The location is brilliant - 5 minutes walk from grand central station which was very handy for the subway (especially as it was so cold when we were there) and only a few mins from 5th Avenue. We only ate in the bar once for breakfast. They were offering a continental breakfast for $18 and a hot breakfast for $25. We opted for the continental breakfast which was bagels, danish pastries and a nice selection of fresh fruit. It was nice although quite expensive.All the staff that we dealt with were very friendly and helpful especially the door man. He was very funny &amp; helpful &amp; spent 10 mins one freezing afternoon trying to hail us a taxi to the airport. The only real negatives I would say about this hotel is that it was a little worn in places. The carpets in the bedrooms were a bit worn and the hallways were very narrow &amp; a little dark. Also the bathrooms are a little on the small side. Overall, our stay was a very positive experience.	
Mar 6 2007 	Mixed feelings about the 70 Park	See, there's lots of good things to say about the 70 Park Ave but there's no getting away from the poor things. The hotel has great staff in the main, especially the door staff, the wine hour is fab and we were sent a lovely bottle of wine and nibbles by the hotel manager to welcome us back to the hotel (we've stayed there several times before). Unfortunately I think the hotel is going downhill a little. They've changed the service offering in the silverleaf tavern which used to be very classy and offered a lovely restaurant menu. Breakfast was expensive and pretty inedible, now they don't even offer lunch, except by room service. We arrived with our 1 yr old son for a weekend and even though contacting the hotel twice about it there was no cot in our room for him when we arrived. We made several repeat calls before we got a cot brought up and when it did arrive it looked like something from an orphanage. We expected a decent travel cot or nice crib with bedding etc, but got just a metal cot with worn bars and no sheets! Not exactly what we expected in a hotel such as this. We also used to like the Thymes toiletries in the bathrooms but see they have changed to Occitane which we don't like as much. So I don't think we'll be back at the 70 Park any time soon.	
Mar 2 2007 	I love this place.	I just returned from a weekend at 70 Park Avenue and I loved it. It's not opulent, but I don't like opulent. It's small, friendly, clean, modern, and in a great neighborhood. Our king sized bed was extremely comfortable, the sheets were very, very soft, the towels were thick and bright white, the bathroom was immaculate and up to date. We enjoyed the flat screen TV on the wall, and in the morning we loved sitting in the easy chairs by the windows, reading the New York Times that was left at our door, and eating breakfast (that my husband went out and got at a neighborhood place). The location is great -- Murray Hill is a very nice neighborhood, and after getting off our train at Grand Central it took us less than 10 minutes to walk the four blocks to the hotel and get up to our room. This is the only place I want to stay when I'm in New York; it's perfect for me.	
Feb 13 2007 	Cozy and chic weekend getaway!	My partner and I stayed at 70 Park for a weekend visiting with relatives in NYC. I got a fantastic rate of $199 from Travelzoo (which I check religiously every day!) The check-in was swift and super friendly- overall during our stay, everyone was really fabulous and unpretentious (considering the neighborhood...) We are atypical Park Ave types (aging punk rockers), but we felt very comfortable.The room was tucked in a quiet corner and we didn't think it was small at all for NYC! It was beautifully decorated, very warm and cozy, and had great L'Occitane amenities. We really liked everything about our stay, especially the iHome, which we used constantly.We have always had great luck w/ Kimpton hotels and this is no exception. Their commitment to service and style is evident. Watch out for the wine hour- by the time we met with friends for dinner, we may have had too much! :)Overall- if the rate is good, we will stay here every time. The only thing that was a bit tricky is the location, which is probably ok for touristy types (2 blocks from Grand Central), but far from LES and the Village for us to walk. We paid almost triple to stay in Soho last vacation and the staff of that hotel was very stick-up-the-arse.	
Jan 21 2007 	Not as nice as the pictures	Thanks to all who posted advice about noisy halls. I found a good rate at this hotel and decided to try it, requesting a quiet room. So noise was not an issue. I don't think I'd go back however. It wasn't terrible - perhaps what bothers me is just the disparity between the glowing room photos and reality. Once you see photos like that, it's hard to not be dissapointed when the room is so frayed around the edges, with peeling paint in the bathrooms and a carpet that had seen much better days. Love the plasma TV but the sound system buzzed. The front desk staff was very kind. So if you need to be in that immediate area and you get a deal around $200, I'd say go for it. But if you're picky like me, don't go out of your way to stay here.	
Jan 16 2007 	Fabulous time at 70 Park Ave	Just visited New York around Christmas time with my daughter who was turning 10 years old. Crystal, the concierge, chatted with her and then when we came back to the hotel late one afternoon there was a small birthday cake with card, signed by the staff, and two bottles of soda in a champagne bucket! How great was that!! My daughter's face was a picture, she was so delighted. Now I call that pretty special service. Our room had a Park Ave. view, great plasma TV, and not too small either. In fact for a double queen it was pretty spacious, by NY standards. I found everything immaculate and staff friendly and I enjoyed the 'happy hour' in the lobby.The location couldn't be beat - Grand Central Terminal at the end of the street, cabs galore, Park Avenue is a dream to walk around, we had a terrific time. I'd recommend this hotel in a heartbeat.	
Jan 13 2007 	Knock Knock. Who's There? The Heating Pipes	We decided to stay at 70 Park Ave for the tail end of NY-area trip at the end of 2006 seeing friends and family. We had lived in the NY metro area before so were very familiar with the area. We also haved stayed at Hotel Monaco and other Kimption properties and have always liked their service. Upon first check-in at 70 Park, I had the sensation of an upscale hostel. However, this had little to do with the decor etc of the hotel, but the fact that the lobby was packed with people huddled around drinking wine. Come to find out, we arrived during their evening wine hour (or hour and a half) and due to the cold night and the fact that a ton of tourists were in town for new years, it was jammed.Check-in was easy and I think that because we checked in via the hotel website and not through an on-line service, we were given a room on a higher floor and away from the elevator as requested. By the way we paid $309/night for a king room, booked a couple weeks prior to our stay (holiday rates!) Room decor was nice - small bathroom as expected in NYC, but the overall room size was nice. Large flat-screen TV with DVD player. An iHome iPod alarm clock was a nice touch, allowing you to connect your iPod for charging/listening. I am a member of the Kimpton Intouch program, and as such they had a bottle of water and some snacks in the room.There were only two issues during our stay. One was a consistent banging of the heating pipes near the bathroom. Every half-hour or so, the pipes would bang loudly for a couple minutes. When I complained to the front desk, they said they could move us, but that because the building was old, it was a common problem (I have heard this before about the older buildings in Manhattan). They also suggested turning off the heat in our room - which would have been fine since the rrom stayed warm enough - but even with doing that, the noise continued. We assumed it must have been the building's main heat that was casuing the issue. Luckily, we were so tired that we were able to sleep through it. The other issue occured on our last night there - the TVs are connected through some receiver box for enhanced sound, and for some reason, our box crapped out and we couldn't get it reset, so the TV had no sound. Again, not a huge deal since we were so tired, we didn't even worry about having one of the hotel engineers come up to fix it.All in all a comfortable stay and one that I would recommend as a good option in NYC - just be prepared for the pipe noises in the winter!	
Jan 5 2007 	OK if you don't need to sleep!	This was my 2nd stay here, the first being just after they opened. In the past 2 years, their prices have doubled, but the infrastructure has not improved.DRAFTY, NOISY WINDOWS:The windows are clearly from the technology of another century. They isolate the room neither from the elements nor the noise. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a breeze, but we had to hang bathrobes &amp; towels from the venetian blinds to block the draft coming in from the windows. Although we were on the 12th floor, the traffic sounded like it was directly outside.NOISE and more NOISE:We were in a room which has double doors to an adjoining room. We could hear everything that happened in this room.LOW SHOWER PRESSURE: self-explanatory NO RESTAURANT:This Kimpton property seems to have broken from the pack and away from the the &quot;FLAVOR&quot; part of the Kimpton Creed of &quot;CARE - COMFORT - STYLE - FLAVOR - FUN&quot;. They closed their restaurant.DARK HALLWAYS: This is one of the first things I thought they would improve here. Except for the 70 Park Ave, no Kimpton property I've ever experienced has dark, depressing hallways.STAFF:Compared to most hotels, the staff here is a dream. However, compared to most Kimptons, they are below average. They seemed to have forgotten some of the basics.POSTIVE ELEMENTS:1) The design of the room is very comfortable. If they would just install modern windows, one could feel right at home in these rooms.2) The night concierge was excellent.3) Surf-stations in the lobby.PRICE / PERFORMANCE:At $475 / night (plus tax!) they need to do a lot better. And when they can get that kind of money for rooms, they can afford to invest in infrastructure. The fact that they don't is a bad sign.	
Jan 4 2007 	Broken plasma construction and a huge bug	Overall, the lobby and the the hotel bar are nice, but the rest of the hotel leaves a little to be desired. Upon arriving, I found the plasma TV didn't work properly. I asked for a new room that evening, but they gave me the usual, &quot;We're completely booked tonight, we'll try to give you something tomorrow.&quot; The next day, they moved me to a room next to hotel construction and I was greeted in the bathroom by the biggest cockroach I've ever seen. For $500/night, definitely left something to be desired. So good luck if you decide to stay, but I would recommend seeking another hotel.	
Dec 19 2006	Friendly but lots of little annoyances	Yes, in agreement with other reviewers, the beds and in-room entertainment options (plasma tv, iPod dock, DVD player) are great, the complimentary wine in the evening is a nice touch and the staff is friendly. But on a recent 2 night stay, I found other little annoyances that keep me from giving 70 Park a 5 or even 4 star review. There is no coffeemaker in the room. Yes, there is compliemntary coffee service in the bar in the morning, but I don't want to have to dress and go to the lobby to pick up coffee. At $400+ a night, a coffee maker would be a nice touch. Coming back at 11PM after the theater, we wanted a cup of tea, but the bar was closing and there was no way to get a cup of tea short of ordering from room service. 2 of the 3 evevators were out of commission for the entire stay, resulting in long elevators waits. (A few hours is understandable, but hey, this is New York, there have to be 24/7 elevator repair companies!) In room internet access costs $10.95 a day. There are ice buckets in the room, but no ice machines --- you have to call room service to get ice. (So why put ice buckets in the rooms, eh?)Overall, 70 Park just doesn't add up to a 4* hotel experience. Yes, the decor is trendy, the bathroom amenties upscale, but for a hotel at this price point, a guest should be able to make a cup of coffee or a cup of tea.	
Dec 13 2006 	Brilliant Hotel	We were a party of 4 ladies on a long weekend trip from the UK. After reading some of the reviews on this Hotel we were quite worried about what we would find. However we cannot fault it and would highly recommend it. It was everything we had hoped for, it was spotlessly clean, friendly, in a good location, wonderful views from the bedroom. The beds were the most comfortable we have ever experienced in a Hotel. The concierge John was wonderful and really took care of us, he booked several trips and restaurants for us and did everything to make us all feel really special, he even arranged for some delicious Apple Pies to be left in our rooms one evening with a lovely note saying we were his best guests ever! The evening wine reception was very good and allowed us to meet with other guests at the hotel. The doormen were also very helpful and if we needed a taxi they would stand in the road and hail us one, they couldn't do enough to help. We would definitely stay at this Hotel again and can't wait to go back.	
Dec 7 2006 	Cute hotel	As a last minute break to New York it was hard to find availability in any of the 'old reliables'!But this hotel turned out to be a great find! Nicely located with a decent sized room with a fantastic view!Staff were very helpful and I thought it was great value for money	
Dec 1 2006 	A Wonderful Stay	This hotel is a real gem.My wife and I arrived from England for our first visit to NYC. We felt at home as soon as we walked in the door, the staff were extremely friendly without being over bearing and we were shown to our room on the 8th floor. We were a little apprehensive after reading various reviews some good some bad.These concerns were quickly laid to rest.The room was clean well furnished, reasonably spacious and had amazing views with Grand Central station to the left. The bathroom was small but again clean. There were lots of nice touches in the room such as bathrobes,slippers and various beauty products to keep my wife entertained. Having mentioned it was my wifes birthday we also found a bottle of champagne on ice. The plasma TV and integral CD/DVD player kept me happy. On leaving the hotel we only walked a few blocks to find ourselves at The Empire State building, Macy's (wife happy again) and Time Square so a great location. As our stay went on we became good friends with the staff,this was mainly due to the relaxed atmosphere created by the wine tasting each evening, a chance to chat with other guests and swap stories about the days events. Definitely return to NYC and 70 Park Ave.	
Nov 19 2006 	friendly great beds	I stay at 70 Park a few times a year for (1) the great beds, (2) the lobby with 4 macs lined up with free internet and complimentary wine, (3) good restaurant, (4) free coffee in the bar in the morning, (5) good cocktails in the bar at night, (6) the friendly staff, and (7) heck how many times in your life can you say you live on Park Avenue. My only reservations are the AC (I was there too during last summer's heat wave - oy) and a few of the rooms are tiny. Huge range in price depending on when you book, but it can be a great deal.	
Nov 16 2006 	It was OK!	We were in NYC and stayed two nights at the hotel during Nov 12th weekend. The hotel room is spacious for two couples (we had two queen room) and amenities were great. However, the weather was unseasonably warm and the AC was not working. We could not sleep both nights and when confronted about the heat, front desk said they are having problems with furnace. We ran into alot of guests that were complaining about the tempreautre. We spent a lot of money for the rooms and considering a decent hotel, we expected the rooms to be heated or cooled according to weather.THen the vallet took forever to get our car back, couldnt find the car, and asked twice what kind/model car we had. The entire process took over an hour and delayed our trip to get out of NYC before traffic hour. We don't think we will go back there again!	
Nov 8 2006	Decent quiet mid-Manhattan hotel	My son, who is in his 20's, and I stayed for two days over a weekend during a &quot;guy's baseball weekend&quot; trip. The location is ideal, two blocks from Grand Central Station for train access. Our room, at the end of a hall and with a view of an adjoining room, was very nice, quite comfortable, and quiet - if on the small side. The staff was pleasant but did not go out of their way like other Kimpton properties at which I've stayed. One inconvenience was loss of both passenger elevators on the last day. I'd stay here again but not for more than $250-275. Next trip might see me back at the Waldorf.	
Nov 8 2006 	Hip and comfy	What a nice surprise. Down pillows, hip furnishings, all the help you could ask for with bags and cabs, and even an iPod-compliant clock radio. There are a million hotels in NYC, and many call themselves 'boutiques.' 70 Park, a great location to anywhere, truly is.	
Oct 30 2006 	Great Central Location	I stayed at 70 Park Avenue, for a four night break with my boyfriend. We were looking for a very central location, and a classy hotel. For this, 70 Park Ave didn't disappoint. Firstly, it is just three blocks from Grand Central station, two blocks from Fifth Avenue, and a 10 minute walk from Time Square. The proximity of Grand Central means you can get pretty much anywhere, very easily on the underground. The room was nice, with a decent bed, and a 42&quot; High Definition Flat Screen TV but unfortunately....you couldn't swing a cat. However, this is what you'd expect in a NY hotel, and it's the trade off for a great location. The bar downstairs is a good spot, and always had some life about it. Didn't eat there, so can't comment on that.Overall, apart from the small room, I was really happy with this hotel, and is an ideal spot for a couple.	
Oct 14 2006	Scaffolding broken elevators dingy carpets and nappy blankets- needs renovatio	Small rooms, getto service and nothing works properly. Try using a blowdryer in the bathroom while having 2 lights and the tv on. They don't seem to care about the heat either. The renovation looks much older than 2 years. Try doing it again soon.	
Oct 9 2006 	I'll Stay There Again	Just returned from a weekend stay. I really like this hotel. While it can be a bit noisy as previously mentioned it is NYC and the hotel is Mid-Town- Murray Hill area so a lot is going on. The location is fabulous. Very close to Grand Central. We stayed in a Queen-Queen Deluxe and it was quite roomy. Great shower and comfy beds. We ordered BLT and chocolate cake late one evening and it was the best! Came with salad instead of fries that was simply delicious. I think this hotel over-all needs a face lift. It is probably a 3.5 star but the service, food and location was so good I'll round up to a 4. The staff was incredibly polite and welcoming. Room very clean. I'll be back. I found a great pkg deal at Cheaptickets.com with air and got our room for less than $350, unbelievable for the size and location.Tip: Go to the 'Frick Mansion'. For $15 you get complimentary audio headset. The collection is incredible, especially if you like Flemish masters, and the house amazing. Go early- 10 am opening, as it tends to get crowded in the pm.	
Oct 9 2006	The best beds in the world!!!	i have just got back from staying in this hotel. We had a deluxe double double room and it was lovely. The room had lots of nice little touches, and the bathroom was really nicely decorated.The best thing about this hotel was the bed - it was the most comfortable hotel bed i have ever stayed in, as their marketing literature says, 'we sell sleep'. They certainly do!The location is fantastic, you can walk to all the major attractions in no time at all, and being so close to Grand Central station makes finding your way around really easy.i would definitely stay here again, and would certainly look up their other hotels if staying in a different city. i don't understand why this place has been getting such bad reviews.	
Oct 5 2006	Noisey	Noisey, stayed here on business with some other business travellers...I was put in the penthouse room which was ok but yet was kept awake every hour by the lift. The room was right next to the lift shaft and I finally gave up at 4am when the person delivering the paper threw it against my door with a bang. I ended up changing my room at 4.30 in the morning. The staff didnt apologise for the room. Found out next day that three other people had done exactly the same! Apart from that, it was nice and clean and bar staff friendly. Foord and drinks and little pricey for what you got. If I was paying myself, I may stay here, as for business, never again.	
Sep 28 2006 	Good Value	This is a great value for NYC. The rooms are smaller than average but it's New York city, don't you want to get OUT of the room a little?My first time at a hotel in the Kimpton chain but I like what was offered for the money.	
Sep 15 2006 	Good for price and location - nice touches	This hotel seems to get bad reviews here but we had a good experience. Location - very good, can walk to many places of interest as a tourist and very close the shops and grand central station.Rooms - very nice, not small by European standards, bathroom was cosy but lots of mirrors helped it feel bigger! Decor was very nice with lots of gadgets, and frighteningly large plasma tv! My main complaint is probably the complexity of everything! It felt like there were wires everywhere! Turning the lights on and off felt like a bit of a chore!Restaurant - not tried, lots of nice places closeby too.Lobby - very nice area, free laptop access was a plus for day to day planning of trip. Other guests make comments about the lifts! This seems to be an ongoing problem, there was only one operating during our trip which slowed things down, especially as the hotel was busy. Evening wine reception seemed a nice idea but we were never there to take advantage - too much sightseeing to do!Service - overall very good, no complaints, but we didn't challenge in any way.Overall very nice place and perfect location if you fancy the midtown area. I'd certainally recommend if the price is favourable.	
Sep 11 2006	Going downhill	Having stayed at this hotel when I come to NYC, I have to say that it has gone downhill FAST. Ok, I travel all the time for work and Im not picking up the tab when I'm workingHaving stayed here previously and loved the place, and having stayed at one of their sister hotels (in the kimpton range) in Boston called nine zero (which I loved) I have to say Im unhappy.List- The room service guy kept coming back to pick up my tray/collect tip when I told him not too- well thumbed, worn menus, travel guides etc- Ridiculously over priced (even at corporate rates)- $17 for a glass of wine delivered to room (they didn't get it when I asked them for a glass not a bottle but Ill put that down to my poor humor)- Elevator comes in and out of service- Over $10 per night for internet- ESPN out for entire stay (I missed Monday night football!!) - Excuse - 'it's out for the whole hotel'- tiny bathroom (funny, I didn't notice this last time round maybe b/c all the above weren't issues)- Minimal towels AND they aren't particularly softI could go on .....Find somewhere else and use the $$$ you saved on dinner in Bryant park or somewhere else fun.	
Aug 8 2006	great boutique hotel in mid town	My wife, two teenage daughters and i just spent a week at 70 Park located at 38th and Park Avenue in Murray Hill area of NYC. This hotel is park of the Kimpton chain of very nice smaller hotels found around the country in perhaps 10 cities. We have found the Kimptons to be a great chain; and 70 Park was just what we needed. We have stayed with them in Aspen, Denver, San Francisco; and have found their corporate concept of hospitality and luxury perfect for us. We were upgraded to a deluxe king room for no increase when my wife and I commented on the size of our deluxe queen room; the girls had a deluxe double double (two double beds) which was spacious. Both rooms were totally upgraded and newly decorated, a welcome change from the normal tired, small, and boring NYC hotel rooms we have endured. The cost was not unreasonable for the quality, and the staff was wonderful. The concierge made our reservations with delight, the doormen kept track of our daughters, and the managers' free wine tasting each afternoon in the lobby gave us a chance to meet many other travelers and compare notes. This is our hotel of choice when in NYC from now on.	
Aug 4 2006 	Good Choice No Regrets	I don't have but a few NY hotel experiences to compare this hotel to, but simply by walking around the downtown area, I'm convinced this location is for guests who want a more business-like stay, away from the hectic, noisy, touristy areas. My thought is that the city is nuts, and an escape is crucial when you've had all you can take.I stayed in this hotel during the 98-102 degrees days and the city was doing all it could to conserve energy to avoid a blackout. The hotel had one working (slow) elevator before the power company imposed a mandatory shut-down of all elevators - at least that was the hotel's explanation. If that were true, then that's circumstances beyond their control. The staff did the best they could - and walking up and down the stairs was the misfortune of the guests and the staff. Under that pressure, the staff performed well.I wouldn't call this hotel a 4-star luxury stay. It was simply nice and pleasant. It is clean, comfortable beds, great tvs and mediocre air-conditioning. My negative opinions are that wi-fi is an additional charge per day, although the lobby provides a few computers for free internet access - there is no coffee maker provided in the rooms - and the room service has a limited menu. Other Kimpton hotels have spoiled me with the opposites of all that. But it is NY city, and everything costs money.	
Aug 1 2006 	If the price is right for you it's fine	I spent the weekend of July 29-30, 2006 at 70 Park. The location is convenient. The staff is polite. The building and rooms are clean. The decor is tasteful. If 70 Park is in your price range for a good but not great hotel, it's a fine place to stay.If you are considering 70 Park as a possible luxury accomodation, it's not. The rooms are small - not places in which you would casually lounge for extended periods of time. The beds and linens are not the top class that you would find in a luxury hotel. The bathrooms are very small - mine was probably 4x8 feet, so that things like the toilet paper holder and bathmat had to be constantly shifted to use the bathroom. A number of electrical fixtures in my room did not work. One of two elevators was out of service, which made for long waits. The pastry and coffee offered for breakfast in the lobby were a step above a motel's, but not a huge step above - and certainly not as good as what could be purchased at any shop in the area. The polite staff was not particularly friendly or helpful, other than one or two of the doormen. I had no fewer than five knocks on my door from maid service on the morning I checked out - when they obviously should have known enough to wait for me to check out. I list all of the above not as complaints, but to illustrate that while 70 Park may have pretentions of being a luxury boutique hotel, it's in reality a good, limited, small hotel. If you're looking for luxury, you're likely to be disappointed. If you're looking to splurge, this is not the place to do it. If 70 Park's prices seem reasonable to you for a good small hotel in a central location, you'll be satisfied.	
Jul 30 2006 	I agree just OK	I agree with the recent reviews that 70 Park Avenue is OK, but not great.I arrived Friday afternoon and was assigned room 1709. I liked the idea of being on the top floor. One elevator was out of order leaving 1 passenger elevator and the freight elevator. However I did not experience any especially long waits. My room was at the back of the hotel. The view was nothing special, but I suppose it was relatively quiet with regard to outside noise.Upon entering my room I was immediately hit with the smell of mold and Lysol. Not very pleasant. The a/c unit was very dirty and there was a black substnace on the louvers that I assumed was the mold. I wiped as much of it off as I could, but I could see inside the unit that it was filthy. I opened the window to let a little fresh air in which helped a little bit. When I went out for the evening I brought the mold smell to the attention of the front desk. On my return it just smelled like more Lysol, not very pleasant.The room was OK sized for NYC, but nothing to write home about. The plasma TV is a nice touch since it takes up less space, but the incoming signals were nothing special. I tried to use the DVD player to play an audio CD, but couldn't get any sound out of it even after following the directions.Wireless internet is an extra $10.95 a day, which I think is ridiculous. But they do have two computers publicly available downstairs for free.There was a lot of hall noise at night and if you want to sleep in late in the morning forget about it because housekeeping is up early making noise in the hallway. They happened to set up their trash collection point right outside my room so it was quite noisy.The bathroom is a decent size. My bathtub drain wasn't working properly as there seemed to be a partial clog. I also told the front desk about that and they did have some one fix that issue.Overall for what I paid with a special rate I thought it was an OK value for NYC, but I am sure there are other, nicer properties in the same price range.	
Jul 24 2006 	It's OK. But not up to a 4-star level	It is a boutique hotel on 38th Ave and Park. The location is quite convenient to the Times Square area (about a 30-minute walk). Staffs are helpful and friendly and my wife and I were generally happy with the stay. However, I don't think it is up to the claim as a 4-star hotel.The room size is normal base on New-York-hotel standard and it is clean and well-lay-out in general. The Plasma TV is a nice addition (but there is not High-definition channel being offered). However, the sound of the TV kept cutting out from time to time and it took them 3 visits in 3 days to fix it up. Another thing I did not expect is that they put the utility closet right in the guest area. My wife and I were constantly awaken by the opening and closing of the closet outside of our room during the room-cleaning hour in the morning.Also the concierge service was not that helpful. We ended up have to book the afternoon tea in the Ritz Calton ourselves. In summary, I think it is a good hotel to stay; however, I expected them to pay more attention to small detail for a 4-star hotel as claimed	
Jul 23 2006	Okay but not great	We just spent a weekend at 70ParkAve hotel and had a neutral experience. I booked on the hotel's own website for a &quot;hot nights&quot; package, and they insisted the only room they had was on the third floor - third floor is too noisy from the street below. It got quieter when we figured out that the window was out of it's track and got it closed more properly. The concierge steered us to a very mediocre restaurant that he discribed as &quot;terrific.&quot; The bathroom is good for one, but for two girls - very cramped. And the walls are thin. We had pretty good neighbors, but for a few loud moments that gave us a sense of what could have been. I think I will try a different hotel on my next quarterly visit to NYC.	
Jul 19 2006	first class	This is a no nonsence hotel where everyone from the door man to the cleaning person does their very best to make sure that you are pleased. I cant wait to go back to NY to stay at this Hotel.	
Jul 17 2006	another good kimpton experience	if a city i am travelling to has a kimpton hotel, i will usually stay there. i think that they provide a very consistent level of service for a reasonable price. my opinon was reaffirmed with a two night stay at 70 park avenue. i was travelling with my family and we had two rooms. one with a queen and one with two queens. for NYC rooms they had a decent amount of space, including a desk and big flat screen tv. the staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. 70 park ave is in a nice location to reach much of manhattan easily. unless you are willing to shell out $500+ per night, i think 70 park ave is a great choice in manhattan.	
Jul 10 2006 	Very Nice Boutique Hotel with a convenient quite location	I just got back from a one night stay on July 8, 2006. My experience was very good with the exception of the very noisy family that shared a door between our rooms. At this hotel, beware of sharing a door between your room and strangers. The kids were so loud that I thought they were playing in the hallway. At approximately 1:30am, I finally decided enough was enough and got up to ask my neighbors to keep it down. To my surprise, there was no one in the hallway. I then realized by the light that was shining underneath the 1-1 1/2 inch space between the floor and adjoining door, that the noise was coming from behind the door. I've stayed in plenty of rooms with adjoining doors but never experienced this before. I think maybe if there was carpet rather than tile flooring, the noise would not possibly have been so bad. It was too late for me to switch rooms so I just prayed that the noise would stop soon.The room I stayed in was nicely appointed and of average size by NYC standards. It was very clean. The bathroom is small if you're sharing but fine for one person. On another note, a good place for breakfast is the Moonstruck Cafe on 48th and Madison. It's only one block from the hotel. It has good, decent portions for low prices (at least low by NYC standards). The location is very nice because it's convenient to Times Square, the Theatre District, Bryant Park and lower Manhattan. I would stay here again.Hope this review helps someone else.	
Jun 2 2006 	A Delightful Oasis You'll be Sad to Leave	We stayed for a long weekend (Sat.-Mon.) on a trip that was a mix of business and pleasure. It was way too short. This hotel is tops in comfort and very convenient. It is in a great neighborhood of friendly people (yes, in New York). It is within walking distance of many New York landmarks. If you want to go further afield (as we did), the subway station is just a few blocks away. They thought of everything--even umbrellas and robes. And that's in the basic room. I've stayed in more expensive hotels in the U.S. and Europe that didn't begin to pay nearly as much attention to details. The hotel's long list of amenities doesn't begin to telll the story. It is the people who make this hotel and induce the most smiles. For example, as we were leaving one morning the doorman volunteered that it wasn't going to rain (despite the forecast)--and he was right! After working in marketing for over 20 years, I've become a little jaded. But this hotel impressed the socks off me. As a second-generation tightwad I can't believe I'm saying this, but it is well worth paying extra to stay here.	
May 24 2006	Great little hotel	Just got back from a 3 night stay at 70 Park Avenue....and I can only echo what every one else has said about this great little hotel. Friendly staff, the comfiest beds, plasma TVs, good location and these great little chargable candles called Candela which was good for creating a nice ambiance. Downsides would be the dark corridors, and the fact we asked for a room with a view - and although we got a corner room on the 3rd floor [that is the 2nd floor to the Brits] so we could see Park and 38th - we saw it from the height of the traffic lights - and it was rather noisy at night!For breakfast we walked down two blocks to 3rd and 38th and went to Daniels' Bagels for apparenlty the best bagels and cream cheese in town! Would recommend and stay here again.	
May 12 2006 	You want to feel welcome in New York ? Go to the 70 Park Avenue Hotel !	After a long trip (8 1/2 hour flight plus the bus trip into the city), the friendly staff with smiling faces was a real sight for sore eyes ! I had reservations for a smoking room, but had also asked for a Park Avenue view (I did not want to face a dark alley in the back). The staff convinced me that the only available smoking room was not as nice as the Junior Suite which I had reserved and since they had tables in front of the hotel where smoking was permitted, I took their advice.The room was very large (and not only by New York standards). There were fluffy bathrobes, fluffy towels, great shampoo and body lotions and the largest bathtub/Jacuzzi Ive ever seen in a New York hotel ! And I will not forget to mention the flat-screen TV, the cotton-sheets, plumb pillows and extremely comfortable mattress.This hotel more than deserves its 4 stars , even though the hallways are a bit dark and dinghy and the doors could use some paint. The lobby is small, but who wants to spent time there, there was free coffee in the morning, a free New York Times and apples for grabs in the lobby.The bar/restaurant was under renovation, but drinks and breakfast were available and the weather was nice enough to just grab a coffee and sit outside (there is a Starbucks 3 doors down, in case you want breakfast before 7.00 am).Having lived in New York, I knew that Park Avenue is very quiet at night and although there is the usual New York traffic all day long, you can sleep with the windows open at night.A great place and well worth the money ( I did not get much of a special rate, having booked at the last minute) - all things considered, the 400 $ were very well spent and I would definitely stay there again.	
Apr 17 2006	70 PA: excellent and under-rated	Stayed here from 7 until 11 April, having picked it up for $195/night with Priceline, but with a little apprehension given some of the reviews posted here. But enjoyed a splendid time: great location, a couple of streets from Grand Central, but without quite the frenzy of hotels off, say, 5th/6th Avenues; enormously welcoming staff, in particular concierge John who could hardly do enough for guests; and terrific rooms, with extraordinary - to my eyes - 42&quot; plasma TVs, very comfortable beds, and adequately sized bathrooms. Street noise from Park Avenue was minimal while there were no interruptions from adjoining rooms or the corridor. Having stayed previously at the Sofitel, Bryant Park, Barclay Inter-Continental, Hilton 6th Avenue, Chelsea, and Algonquin, I'd put this near the top of that list, probably in a tie with the wonderful Sofitel. And for $195/night ....!	
Apr 14 2006	Loved 70 Park Avenue	Four of us just got home from a six night stay at 70 Park Avenue and and we were all thoroughly pleased. The location was convienent and quite. The rooms were clean,the bed comfy and we loved the flat screen TV. The staff was exceptionally professional, at the same time very friendly and helpful. I would most defiently recommend the 70 Park Avenue Hotel, and would stay there again on a return trip.	
Apr 2 2006	Good time at 70 Park	Recently dropped into NYC for a one night visit and stayed at 70 Park Ave. We were traveling with our two dogs and selected this hotel because they are pet-friendly and also were located close to the activities that we had planned for our trip. We were upgraded to a room at the end of the hallway and the room was very large, clean and beautifully decorated. The flat screen TV was a definite plus as we wanted to catch some of the Final Four action. The bathroom was surprisingly large as well - we weren't expecting much especially after reading some of the other reviews. Our room was facing Park Avenue and we didn't hear a lot of noise when the windows were shut. However, it was warm in the building (apparently, they hadn't turned on the bldg AC) so we had the windows open for part of the evening. You can definitely hear some street noise but it wasn't anything that would keep you up all night. Plus the beds are so comfy, it's hard to get a good night's sleep here. Overall, we had a great time. Service was excellent and will definitely come back again.	
Mar 6 2006	Will definitely go back	Like a lot of other readers here, i wasn't sure what to expect at the 70 Park Avenue after reading some good and some bad reviews. I can honestly say that I'm very happy that I didn't let the bad reviews change my mind about staying here, as from the moment we walked through the doors we were very well looked after. We stayed in a King Deluxe room so cannot comment on other room types but our room was beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean and tidy. I admit the bathrooms are a bit on the small side, but more than adequate. The bed was possibly the most comfortable bed that I've ever slept in. On our first night there we were tired after our flight so decided not to go too far, and we ended up dining in the Silverleaf Tavern which is inside the hotel, and this was probably the most enjoyable meal we had during our 5 nights in New York, for anybody dining there i can definitely recommend the pork.Overall I would recommend this hotel to every person going to New York, ok, so it is not on Times Square like so many hotels, but it is literally just a 10 minute walk around the corner to all of the action in one direction and 10 minutes in the other direction you are at the Empire States Building, and its nice quiet Park Avenue location makes it seem like a world away from the hectic Times Square area.	
Feb 20 2006 	Great - if a little pricey...	I had a terrific stay at 70 Pk Avenue. As I was alone, I opted for a smaller bed and therefore slightly cheaper room, and was rewarded with a huge bathroom! A colleague had the king size bed, but a tiny bathroom, so it's worth checking what you get in advance. Overall tho, a really good stay.	
Jan 19 2006 	One to avoid	I stayed at this hotel because my favourite hotel (The Regency) was booked out for part of my trip. The first room I was given had a very noisy a/c system outside the window and as a result I barely slept on the first night. I was moved to another room which was much better but both room were very small.The standard of maid service was very poor, the room didn't get properly cleaned. The staff on the front desk were not very helpful and would basically ignore me if they were dealing with somebody else - no acknowledgement I was waiting or 'I'll be with you soon' type comments.I had a safety deposit box which they would bring out and place on the front desk, no privacy at all. I really don't like having to go through my safety deposit box so publicly.I regretted staying at this hotel and wouldn't do so again.	
Jan 16 2006	It depends on the room!	I am always curious when hotels are either rated one dot or 5 dots - but not in between. I had a $200 Kimpton gift certificate that I wanted to cash in. I have always had good experiences with other Kimpton properties, but was a bit hesitant after reading the one dot reviews. After staying at 70 Park Avenue, I now understand the point spread - it depends on the room you have. My partner and I had a stroke of luck. We were assigned room 902. The bellman mistakenly took us to room 910 - we did not look at the number on the door, and maid was just leaving so we did not use the pass key. The room was great. Clean, well decorated, large by NYC standards, nice plasma TV - directly in front of the bed, OK size bathroom and nice French products. We loved the room! This was the first time in my many visits to NYC that I wanted spend time in the room. The room faced Park Avenue and was bit noisy, but great! We returned to the room after lunch and the key did not work. We checked the key envelope and realized we were in the wrong room. We went to room 902 and the key card worked. What a difference! 902 was small, window faced a wall, and the TV was not in front of the bed, but to the side (would have been impossible to watch from bed.) Fortunately, management let us keep the first room. I can now understand why some people hate this hotel and others love - we would not have been as pleased if we were in the small room. When making a reservation, ask for a room that faces Park Avenue - its worth putting up with the street noise for such a nice room. Service was good, wine reception nice, guests and staff very friendly. Want to go back. Only paid $225/night with a special &quot;hot rate&quot; listed on the Kimpton web page.	
Dec 17 2005 	Will never return	Have stayed at this hotel several times on business and pleasure. Will never, ever go back. First time, my room door didn't close and lock without repeated slamming. Another time, a/c was broken, rooms were unbearably hot, we were refused service in the restaurant, which was empty, because we did not plan to order full dinners, TV in room was broken, staff was rude, laundry trolleys in the hall, 4ÅM fire drill...Another time, the heat was on even though it was in the 70's outside, front desk staff promised I would have a window a/c then gave me a room with none and temperature of 80. Staff was consistently rude and pretentious. Room was not clean (bath had a jaccuzzi and black gunk came out of the jets). Others I've spoken to have told of exposed electrical wiring with water dripping from it. For the prices and the pretension, I expect much more.	
Nov 16 2005	Depend want you want!	First the hotel was very clean, nice &quot;as you can drink&quot; welcome wine (between 17h &amp; 18h30 at least friday and saturday). We got a room on the 8th floor with view a brick wall and into an other room!. Room is ok in term of size but the bathroom is extremely small, not even a regular bath. Ok I don't go to NYC for my hotel bathroom but if you travel with your wife and would like to add a romance touch by taking a bath: Forget it!So if you need just a room to get sleep because you will be walking all day, that is perfect. Well located. Again, very clean. But if you want to be in the hyp NYC, pass on.We paid 350$ a night (kind of last minute trip, didn't not help, I guess). For that price, I would have expected to be in a Design hotel... but not in NYC it seem...Plus, we paid 42$ each night for parking valet and guess what, they brought back my car with a 12&quot; inches white scratch on the passenger door. They says that the garage will pay for it... Still pending news!It is always the same thing: is it good or not? And it always come back to the same basic : What are you looking for? Maybe the last factor is how much you paid! For my next trip, I would try somethiong else, I will look for more design Hotel...	
Oct 28 2005	Room on the small side but comfortable	Stayed there in august. For being so hot outside the room was actually a nice relief from the heat. Although they were a little on the small side, it was inviting and accommodating. Service was nice, very personable.	
Sep 22 2005 	I'll stay here every time I come to NY	As a female business traveler who's sampled several hotels in NY, I truly appreciated this rare find--a bright, light, clean, well-situated but not hugely expensive hotel where I felt safe and pampered. Great neighborhood, spotless room, friendly staff with good recommendations for local eateries (there's a restaurant, but I didn't try it--I wanted good pizza). Rooms are small (typical NY) but well-thought-out; there's plenty of light for working or reading; nice flat-panel tv. I had a room on the 3rd floor, so there was lots of street/traffic noise, which doesn't bother me, but might bother others; I never heard another guest. Other reviewers have noted the odd placement of the toilet next to a radiator of some sort, so you have to turn a little sideways because there's no leg clearance on your right, but other than that, I had no complaints. Bed was literally the best I've ever slept in in a hotel--the linens were nice and the mattress was dreamy.	
Sep 11 2005	Happy with Kimpton	We've stayed in Kimpton hotels in Boston and San Francisco and enjoyed the boutique feel and warm touches unique to Kimpton such as the wine tastings, massage in San Francisco.I have to say, during this trip I must have called to modify our stay no less than 10 times. There was an illness in the family and things were up in the air. Each and every time the representative I spoke to was professional, helpful and even thoughtful. With all the changes I'd made there certainly would be room for error, but no, we were able to check in early - the room was as I requested (away from the elevator on a higher floor). Quiet is kind of hard to come by, it is Manhattan. And we'd much rather have a view and a little noise.Love the comfy, soft, inviting bedding. Robes are a great extra, and I loved the Thymes products in the bathroom. Color scheme is sophisticated throughout the newly renovated hotel.Everyone we encountered at the hotel was professional and curteous, even friendly. Room service for breakfast was efficient and tasty. Retrieving the car took the amount of time the bellman said it would. Concierge made a dinner reservation promptly for us. Bellman always had a smile.Yes, the rooms are small - but for the time we were in the room, it didn't matter.We'll definitely stay at Kimpton again.	
Sep 3 2005 	Extremely Disappointing	Although we do appreciate that in New York hotel rooms are sometimes on the small side, but here the room size was ridiculously small! My husband had to turn sideways just to enter the bathroom, and even then only one person could just about stand to use the facilities. My husband actually injured his back having to negotiate the wardrobe and the bathroom. The hallway was very dark and often blocked with laundry trolleys, which again had to be negotiated to get into and out of the room. We did ask to be moved, but were told there were no other rooms available unless we wanted to pay a lot more money to upgrade. We expected more from what we thought was a 4* hotel! We would not stay in this hotel again, or recommend it.	
Aug 5 2005	Quaint Hotel Great Location Very Nice Stay	I just returned from a 4 night leisurely trip to NYC. The trip turned out to be wonderful because the weather was great and we had plenty of time to see everything we planned.The hotel was above average. I was very pleased with its location, which was on Park Avenue and 38th street. Upon leaving the hotel lobby, you can look up Park Avenue and see the Grand Central Station facade and the Met Life building. There is a starbucks on 39th Street one block up Park, which we went to every night as our nightly walk. We were too exhausted to go much further than that :) Our hotel room was quite small, but very quaint with lots of nice details. For example, in the bathroom, the toiletries were above average, the fixtures were very nice, the shower had great tiling and good water pressure and there were plenty of mirrors. A hair dryer and iron were provided in the room, which is pretty important to my wife and I. We hate packing that kind of stuff. The robes in the closet were very thick and cozy. I am not a robe person, but I wore this one every night. The bed at 70 park was wonderful. It had a huge body pillow, which was unique to us. The down pillows, comforter and blanket were sooo comfortable. It made it very easy to fall asleep after a long day of sightseeing. There was also a full size mirror (huge) on one of the walls, which we dont normally see in our hotel rooms. The only cons: The plasma surround sound system did not work very well. The sound kept crackling and the volume would vary loud to soft as you flipped through the stations. It seemed like each station had its own volume control. Inside and outside the hotel was a little noisy. The housekeeping staff was constantly slamming doors as they went in and out of rooms and linen closets. Outside you heard the typical blaring horns even though we were on the 15th floor. Some reviews on this site mentioned the toilet being flush against the radiator. Not in our room. We had no issue with this at all (room 1504). Another con is that they should add one more computer for guests to use. However, the whole hotel is Wi-Fi although we didnt have our laptop to take advantage of it.The staff was very friendly as we came and went from the hotel and the concierge helped us on a couple of different occassions. He recommended a good restaurant and Century 21 for shopping by the Trade Center site. The hotel held our bags for a couple hours on our last day because our flight was at 6pm. Also, our room was ready 2 hours before check-in, which was a pleasant surprise. We were anticipating having to wait. Many more pluses than minuses. I would highly recommend this hotel if you can get a good rate like we did (through Orbitz).	
Aug 4 2005	Nice neighborhood okay room	First time in NY - was expecting a small room, but ours was very small with no drawer space (one drawer) and an okay-sized closet (there were about 10 wooden hangers in the closet, an ironing board and iron, and a safe). The bathroom was decent-sized, had good toiletries, and a shower with great water pressure and temp. It was HOT while we were there, and our A/C did not work well, but cooled the room off to probably 75-80 degrees (it was in the low-mid 90s during our stay). The plasma TV was great (there was NO room for a regular TV), and the bed and linens were very comfortable. Our friends had a room with two single/double beds and was much larger than ours (we had a &quot;queen&quot; bed). Loved the neighborhood - great pizza and breakfast a couple of blocks away, and good shopping as well. It was about a 10-minute walk to Times Square - I liked being out of the main hustle and bustle, but able to walk there easily. The concierge was very helpful, liked the wine tasting in the late afternoon, and the bar made an excellent cosmo. We ate at the restaurant the first evening, and the food was very good. The hotel also has 24-hour room service, which came in handy after a long evening out. The service was very good, always someone helpful at the front desk, two computers to use in the lobby, and everyone was very friendly.I would stay again if I got a good rate - would definitely stay in the Murray Hill area again. Can't wait to go back to NYC - we had a wonderful time!!	
Jul 25 2005	Good 3.5 star boutique	First, the pros - the lobby and rooms are decorated nicely, minimalist/modern/european styling and comfortable. The rooms are decent size by New York standards, but you're not going to be able to throw a party in them. There wasn't a dresser, the a decent sized armoire. The bathroom was large and well stocked. The bed was comfortable. Everything was very clean. And this was the first hotel I stayed in that had a plasma screen TV, very nice.Second, the cons - The hallways are narrow and dim, but its an old building so that's forgivable. The rooms are a bit rough around the edges, some scrapes, rough trim work, etc. The service, overall, was sporadic - sometimes the door was opened, sometimes it wasn't, sometimes there were bell hops around, sometimes there weren't, sometimes I waited at the front desk for awhile (at check in), sometimes they helped me with things right away. Finally, one of two elevators broke down Saturday evening and they didn't get it repaired before checkout on Sunday. There was a 20 minute plus wait to get down from the 17th floor Sunday around noon - not good when you've somewhere to be, like the airport. This won't happen all the time, but it is a boutique hotel in an old building, so things like that will happen.Overall the pros outweight the cons - it's a solid 3.5 star boutique - if you can get a good price, its worth it over many 3 star hotels in NYC. I would stay here again.	
Jul 24 2005	Comfortable stay.	Overall we enjoyed our stay very much. Staff were fine and although room is quite small it was very comfortable. On the downside was the sliding bathroom door which was very difficult to use, lack of storage and our room was next to the linen store which led to us getting woken too early every morning. Excellent location, bed and TV. Never used the restaurant as it appeared a bit on the pretentious side. Would definately stay again.	
Jul 19 2005	Overall a decent hotel	Having booked this hotel through Priceline, I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews here. Overall, I was pleased with our stay, but do acknowledge some of the complaints here. First, other writers were indeed accurate about the toilet (right next to the heater) and the closets (very small). I would also argue that it is not a four star hotel, but a three star. Given what we paid on Priceline, I feel we got a good deal for a three star. If I had paid full price for our King Deluxe room, it would have felt overpriced. Our room was also a bit noisy, we could hear street noise on our 15th floor. However, it was not that much of a problem. We also had no problem with our air conditioning, and the bed was extremely comfortable.I do disagree with other raters about the staff, the cleanliness, and the room size. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. We also saw no evidence of dirt or of dirty room service dishes. The hotel and our room were spotless. Our room was also a reasonable size for a NYC hotel. I have stayed in much smaller rooms in NYC, so I was happy with ours. We did have a king deluxe, having asked for an upgrade, so I can't speak to the size of the standard room. Overall, it was a good deal for the price we paid. We would stay there again.	
Jul 7 2005	Not impressed: Nice but too Small	Awesome service but too expensive, considering the fact that, other than the bar, there's no activities at the hotel and the rooms are very small without even mention the size of the bathrooms. And even though it was nice and clean and coveniently located we had some trouble with the A/C. It was too hot and the temperature couldn't adjusted without help.	
Jul 2 2005	Bad to Great Depending on Room	Kimpton reservation agent treated us badly when I called to request a double bed and no-smoking, she said that they don't note those requests for people who booked through Priceline. She said we would have to take what was left at check-in time. She would not even make a note of our late arrival and said I would have to hang up and call the hotel directly, that she could not transfer us. All lies...The next agent I spoke to was happy to make all those notes and even transfered the call to the hotel. Our first room had noisy machinary outside the window (noise 24 hr/day), the sound on the TV kept going out, and the air conditioning did not work. When the room temp. went over 85 degrees we finally were moved to another room. They sent a bellman to help but he had a poor attitude. The new room was noise free, comfy, and everything worked. At check-out they asked us how our stay was and when we expressed displeasure over our first room, the snotty reply was that we should be thankful for the upgrade we got to the second room. So...the basic rooms are terrible, the upgraded ones are good but too expensive for what you end up with.	
Jun 22 2005	What a disappointment - do not recommend!	We booked this hotel (through priceline) as a 4 star hotel. I have no idea who gave the hotel this rating or why. With due respect to other reviewers, the fact that the bathroom has a villeroy &amp; boch sink and glass tiles does not make a 4 star hotel - particularly when the shower is full of black mold/mildew and the bedding is shabby. The 1st day of our stay we had a trickle of hot water, by morning, we had no water at all. In addition, the A/C was woefully inadequate. After 12 hours with no water, they finally told us that we could &quot;use the bathroom&quot; in the room next to us. Finally, they agreed that we could move to another room (did not offer to help us move, and in fact, required that we go downstairs to exchange room keys). The 2nd room was even smaller than the first, and yes, it is true that the bathrooms are so small that you have to sit sideways to use the commode. The wall heater is right next to toilet - I also wondered what would have happened if it was winter and we were in this room. The housekeeping services were atrocious, they did not clean our room at all for the 1st 24 hours. Dirty room service dishes sat in the hallway for 2 days! Also vacuums, cleaning carts, etc. were left in the hallway all day and night. The hallways were already very cramped so it was a challenge to get to your room, especially with luggage. This hotel did not live up to the promise of 4 star service, and yes, it is very noisy although there was no construction going on at the time of our visit. I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel. The one exception to our bad experience was the concierge who gave us excellent advice about restaurants in chinatown.	
Jun 8 2005 	It's ok no more no less	First; I'm not a demanding customer. This hotel is ok; staff are quite friendly and the location is ok, great TVs in the room but the room cleaning wasn't up to scratch. I wouldn't avoid this hotel in the future but I wouldn't go out of my way to stay there again.	
Jun 7 2005	We checked in checked it out then left!	After seeing the photos, hearing what all of you had to say &amp; even seeing this hotel in Conde Nasts &quot;best&quot; list recently, we felt confident in making this our home for 3 nights recently. One of us even went to the trouble of calling the hotel directly &amp; asking manyquestions ie: room size, view, bathroom, possible packages &amp; so on. We have also learned, like many of you experienced travelers, to check the room before commiting &amp; we did. The room (the same one you see on this site) was large, but there was no view of the Empire State building as promised. There is a view of the street. My boyfriend was promised a jacuzzi tub with a view of the Empire State Building, which I had to see to believe. Just a regular tub &amp; a tiled bathroom. Nice, but nothing fantastic about it. All in all, we both sighed &amp; realized that again we had been promised something really special &amp; found it so, so. We debated &amp; figured that at 425.00 a night we could do better. We went to the Omni, found it older &amp; even less desirable. We walked &amp; looked &amp; low &amp; behold found a Jolly poperty right around the corner that had several rooms (this was at check out time~we lucked out) &amp; found a jr. suite that had a large marble bath &amp; glassed in shower, 2 sinks &amp; even a bidet. We booked a full suite at the Waldorf for the rest of the trip &amp; I can't tell you how fabulously spoiled I felt. The room service was impeccable &amp; there is more room than you know what to do with (with 5 large rooms all to your own~you'll feel like a rock star, or at least someone really important) &amp; we had a corner of Park Ave. all to our own! The upshot? Upgrade, your worth it!	
Jun 4 2005	Beautiful Hotel!	Everything about this hotel was amazing! The rooms were beautifully decorated and cozy. There was a flat screen tv! Amazing! The staff were the most polite staff I've ever encountered. I do a lot of traveling and was very pleased. The location is perfect. I am trying to think of a bad thing to say......but, there isn't a thing.	
May 27 2005	Great Hotel!	I took a trip to NYC last month to ask my girlfriend to marry me, and we stayed at the Hotel 70 Park Avenue. The location was great (a few blocks from Grand Central), the room was beautiful, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. If you're at a loss for where to have a meal, I'd highly recommend the hotel's concierge. Knowing I was going to ask my girl to marry me after a showing of Avenue Q during a carriage ride in Central Park, I wasn't sure what a good restaurant in the area would be, so the concierge found out how long our show was and took care of reservations for two at a very romantic restaurant near the theatre district. Very helpful! And yes, we got engaged.My only complaint would be that the sound on the TV kept going down to nothing for no apparent reason at random intervals, but that was minor compared to all of the other great things at 70 Park.	
May 24 2005 	Only Great Things To Say!	We stayed at 70 Park Avenue for 3 nights in May, 2005. Although very small, we have no complaints at all. We had a &quot;King Deluxe&quot; room and found we were on top of each other as it was small. The bed was super comfortable! The sheets are a high thread count of cotton and had a down comforter. But the mattress was also so soft! Our room was spotless and we enjoyed the toiletries, including the lip balm! We also enjoyed the flat screen TV and the DVD player. Our service was excellent and the front desk staff was always friendly and willing to answer any questions we had. The bell staff was also helpful, knew the area and offered help when we needed directions, etc. Would for sure reccommend staying there but if there's more than 2 people, get a bigger room!	
May 22 2005 	Both sides are right	My wife and I had business in Manhatten and I picked the 70 Park Avenue because of its great location and the many positive reviews on Tripadvisor. I did notice the negative reviews, and had some reservations, but went for it. My experience during May 2005 was that both the postive and the negative comments were right. The good news: the staff is very courteous, knowledgeable and helpful. Ask for something and it happens right now. Even the bellman gave us a great recommendation for dinner. The rooms are appointed tastefully, with feather beds, Villeroy and Boch sinks, glass tiled showers and hugh flat-panel TVs with sound systems. The bad news: the rooms are small and noisy. The latter is common in Manhatten because of traffic noise in the concrete canyons. But, at 39th and Park Ave. it is very noisy indeed because of some sort of road excavation that the city has covered with huge metal plates. CLANG every time a bus or truck goes by. Room 1005, our first, was a corner room in which this was unbearable. In addition, that room was so small as to be unmanageable for two. The closet, for example, consisted of an 18 inch wide opening. The bath room was so small that the toilet was flush against a wall heater so that one had to sit sideways on it. Not sure how that would work with the heater on. We requested a room change which was accomplished while we were out. Room 1216, two and one-half floors up (yes), was bigger, had an adequate armoire and a bathroom which, while not spacious, was big enough for use. Although quieter, we still heard the CLANG in the night. I like the Kimpton chain, but as I have said in other Tripadvisor reviews, not all Kimptons are created equal. We won't go back the the 70 Park Avenue. But, after New York, we went the Washington and stayed at the Monaco which was about as good as it gets.	
May 21 2005 	Excellent location great staff.	Great things about this hotel: the staff were friendly, efficient and capable - nothing was too much trouble - and everyone I met smiled and said hello. Travelling as a single woman I felt completely safe. The room was spotless, definitely large by NYC standards and there were several nice touches - plasma screen, DVD player. The bed was very comfortable. Food - good. I ordered room service which was prompt and, again, very friendly. The location is also a plus with subways and taxis close by.Now the not so great - there was some heavy working/drilling/street noise in the morning. I don't mind the sound of traffic or even the ubiquitous honking cabs (you are in New York after all), but the extremely loud drilling was not very pleasant. This isn't really the hotel's fault - and you when you're in New York you probably won't be in your room too much anyway.All things considered I would definitely stay here again - the rooms are comfortable, the location is perfect and the staff go out of their way to ensure that you are welcomed and looked after.	
May 19 2005	No complaints here! Great place to stay!	I am shocked that there are any bad reviews on this hotel at all. When reading reviews keep in mind that sometimes a one time mistake or construction on the street is not always the hotels fault. It is a nice little boutique hotel in Murray Hill. In a very quiet area of NYC, but close to many attractions. The room was extremely comfortable with a GREAT flat screen TV. All the hotel staff was very helpful. There is a wine hour with complimentary wine. Not sure if it is every night or on the weekends. The lobby is small but cute. It has a fireplace and a table where everyone seems to hang out with thier laptops. Free internet access at this hotel. We had drinks at the bar. I bit pricey, but typical of hotel bars. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this hotel.	
May 4 2005	Avoid - Stay In the W Tuscany	Checked out after three nights of a planned 5 night stay. Things started to go wrong at check in. The Kimpton website offers free upgrades subject to availability, but at check in we were told there was no upgrade available. When we queried this we were told we could have one for $40 a night. Eventually we were offered the free upgrade but the room (a so called premier one) was still very small and the bathroom even smaller. Moreover, there was a tiny amount of cupboard space and we had to live out of our suitcase.While the room was clean and the flat screen TV nice, the common parts of the hotel were very shabby. After one decent nights sleep, City Hall then decided to dig up a water main in the street right outside our room until 3 am! We asked for a change of room the next night but was assured by the hotel staff that the drilling work would be over. That night the work continued until 12am. Checked out the next day and we were told that for our lack of 2 nights sleep the hotel would not charge an early departure fee. No offer to reduce the room rate was made. Finally, on checking our bill we found out that we had been charged over $120 for two overseas phone calls, despite having checked the phone rate with the hotel operator before hand, who had wrongly quoted us the local call rate. Given that we had our mobiles on us and could have used them this was particularly annoying. Moved to the W Tuscany (on the next block) which for the same rate was much much better. Great rooms, good service and far more stylish. If you are staying in mid town avoid the Kimpton and stay in the W Tuscany.	
Apr 5 2005	Great Stay	Just wanted to stay that 70 Park Ave was a great great hotel. After researching possibly every single hotel in NYC, I settled on this one, partly because of the great reviews and great price from their own website. The room was very spacious (though no view) and an awesome flat screen tv, big bathroom, etc etc. I had read so many reviews about how rooms are tiny in NYC but this one was very big (2 full beds) and comparable to most hotels we've stayed at around the country, but nicer, very stylishly decorated.The location was very central- very close to most tourist attractions, many by walking, all by subway or a quick cab ride. The staff was very helpful, even checking us into a room after we arrived from a red eye flight around 7am in the morning- did not expect that at all but pleasantly surprised since we were all very tired and just wanted to crash.So, all in all, I recommend this hotel to those visiting NYC- it had a nice mix of tourists, business people, hipsters, etc.	
Mar 17 2005	Not up to Kimpton standards.	Like others who stayed here, we had the experience of the heat going full throttle Thanksgiving week. The staff was very accomodating, but nothing could really compensate for a hotel heated to 80 degrees. We even had the windows open and a fan going and just could not bring down the temperature. I've stayed at other Kimpton properties and enjoyed them. This missed the mark. I hope they work things out because the hotel does have potential.	
Mar 6 2005	What a Great Place!	We stayed at the 70 Park Avenue for 3 nights Feb. 20-23rd. I was very impressed! The staff was exceptionally friendly and our room was great. The beds were super comfortable and we had a great view of the Empire State Building from our window. The bathroom was plenty big enough. We ate at the restaurant and were very pleased with the food and service. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. I would definately stay there again!	
Mar 2 2005	Adored 70 Park Ave.	If I were able to give this hotel 500 stars, I would. My mother, aunt, cousin and I stayed at 70 Park Avenue last weekend (2/24-2/28) for my birthday. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with nothing but warmth, kindness, and the utmost in helpfulness...The Rooms: The rooms were wonderful. We did not have a great view, but we were only on the 3rd Floor so we didn't really expect one. The beds were the most comfortable beds I'd ever slept on. Down comforters, pure-soft pillows; it was heaven. The 42-inch Plasma tv is a jewel. They also have a DVD player and CD player if you wish to use them. Bathrobes are also in the room, which is an absolute must if you're lounging about the room. Bathrooms are fairly small, but the water pressure is heavenly. It comes with Thymes Limited toiletries; very soothing. The Service: The service was impecible. What impressed me most was how everyone who worked there remembered you, your party, and everything about your trip. They were all the epitome of friendly. The concierge, John, was beyond helpful. He made sure we were all set for the weekend, and gave us any information we needed. On my birthday, the bellhop and the doorman both remembered it was my birthday and wished me a happy birthday. John even got me a 'birthday pie' and a card. Now, I've been to many hotels and I've never seen anything like this. I was highly impressed.The Location: The location is great. 4 blocks from Grand Central Station. Walking distance to Empire State Building, The Chrysler Building, shops, restaurants, 5th Ave. I recommend going into Grand Central and purchasing a cake/pie from the Little Pie Company. They were delightful. Next time I go to NY I will definetly be staying at 70 Park Avenue...	
Mar 1 2005	Lovely room great service	Just stayed at 70 Park (2/05), another great Kimpton hotel. Room was stylish, clean, comfortable; bath had jacuzzi jets. The room was average size or a little larger for this price in NYC. Service was incredibly cordial and helpful (from the doorman to the front desk to the restaurant). Had nice drinks and appetizers at restaurant in cozy nook. Later, when restaurant was closed (after theater) got excellent local recommendation for another place to dine. Cabs were easy to get on Park.	
Feb 24 2005	Charming Hotel	Splendid hotel located in a charming and quiet neighbourhood by Grand Central Station and the New York Public Library. The location is ideal and makes for easy travelling. Rooms are modern and average-sized, by New York standards. For some bizarre reason, our bathroom was larger than our actual room; the bathroom was splendid and replete with all the requisite toiletries and ammenities a man (or woman) could want. The staff were extremely helpful--the concierge John recommended and arranged for reservations at one of the most affable and delightful Italian restuarants in the City. In short, the staff made this hotel an experience worth repeating.	
Jan 26 2005 	Home Away from Home	This is a great hotel if you come in with the right expectations.I stayed at 70 Park Ave for 2 weeks in Jan 2005.Minus Points:Room Size: Queen deluxe rooms are very small, would recommend that you start at; at least a king deluxe, and move to the premier room category if possible.WiFi Connections: They still need to work out some kinks here.Zero Points:Bathrooms: Very small, even in the larger rooms, the bathrooms are quite small.Linen Cart: On the hallway, a little disconcertingGym: If you are suffering from Jet Lag and want to use the gym at 5 am, you cannot. Plus Points:Staff: Very friendly, no attitude, looks out for you. Service: Room service, House Keeping, Complaints were attended to immediately, with a friendly smile.Design: Modern yet warm. 42&quot; flat screens, are in every room, regardless of the size. Bring/Rent DVD's and CD's - nice surround sound.Comfort: Bed, pillows, sheets, blankets - very cosy. Very clean, great amenities. Expanded mini bar.Quiet: My room faced away from park ave, and I never heard a honk. No inter room disturbances becuase of thin walls either.Bottom line:If you are staying for a while, want a home away from home, can splurge on a larger room, this is the place to stay in NY.	
Jan 22 2005	nice and trendy	My friends and I stayed at the 70 Park Ave during the fall of 2004 for a long weekend from Toronto. We all been to NYC several times before and weren't sure what to expect since we always stayed at the large chain hotels. We were pleasantly surprised at the Park Ave. The hotel is very trendy and has a zen feel to it. Our room was with two double beds on the 12th floor with a great view of Park Ave. The only complaint I have is that the washrooms are very small, but afterall it is NYC. The staff was very friendly and since it is a smaller, more intimate, we did get that personal service. On the first day of our stay after coming back from shopping, we walked in the lobby and was greeted with a glass of wine since it was their welcome drinks which was a nice touch. I found that to be very classy and you definitely don't get that at just any hotel even the big names. I would recommend this hotel to any couples for a romantic getaway or any single business traveller, but I don't suggest this hotel to families, especially with small children, anyone travelling in groups or someone that needs their space. Overall, the location is great, central, and is within walking distance to a subway station.	
Jan 21 2005	LOVE IT	I can't believe how much i loved my stay at 70 park. i don't understand how anyone could complain about the rooms. By NYC standards, they're insanely large. not to mention incredibly comfortable. in the AM i was tempted to tear apart the bed to see what brand of sheets, pillows, and mattress they used! (i emailed the hotel instead.) the other VERY important thing to note is that it was QUIET. At least my room was. I requested a quiet room and i definitely got one. This is no small thing in NYC. The amenitites and fixtures were perfect--tasteful, high-quality, aesthetically pleasing in just the right way. Of course my room service dinner of salad and a sandwich was $55 but hey what do you expect in manhattan. but i was so exhausted when i got here that i couldn't bring myself to go out--i needed to really, really rest. and i was completely able to. so many thanks to 70 park. i've stayed at soho grand (fine), tribeca grand (faux hip doubletree, yuck), 60 thompson (wonderful) but i would pick 70 park over them.	
Jan 4 2005	Friendly hotel employees but the rooms don't measure up	I recently stayed at 70 Park Avenue Hotel while on a business trip to New York City. Here is my summary review, below. For people who want more detail than can be posted here, including commentary about certain Kimpton Inner Circle benefits at this hotel, there's even more on my personal travel blog, mentioned at the end of this review.CHECK IN: Check in at the front desk was professional. As a Kimpton &quot;Inner Circle&quot; elite level guest, I was entitled to an upgrade to the best room available at check in: I was presented with a choice of my booked Deluxe room on a higher floor or an upgrade to a King Premier room on a lower 4th floor. Upon my request, a hotel staffer escorted me to see each room so I could compare before making a decision. The booked Deluxe room wasn't that great: the view from the higher floor was uninspiring and the bathroom was quite possibly the smallest bathroom I've seen in any hotel (including a variety of New York City hotels). Simply put, the cramped bathroom in the Deluxe room would have been unacceptable - and if you are considering booking one of these rooms I advise against it. The upgraded King Premier room was essentially the same as the Deluxe room except the bathroom was somewhat larger (although still small it was acceptable) and had a bath tub with jacuzi jets. I was concerned about the possibility of hearing street noise from this lower floor room - and with the hotel staffer's assurancethat it wouldn't be a problem, I decided on the upgraded room.MY ROOM: Here's the good, the bad and the ugly about my upgraded King Premier Room:The Good:* 42&quot; Flat Screen TV (sweet!), plus DVD/CD player with surround-sound system * Very clean* Nicely furnished * Comfortable bed and pillows * Lots of mirrors * Candella nightlights were unique and created a nice atmosphere in the room * Plush terrycloth bathrobe * Bathtub with standard size tub with jacuzi jets was a nice bonus (but compare with better deep soaking tub at Hotel Monaco in Washington D.C.) * Curved shower rod similar to Westin * The Thymes Limited bath amenities * Speaking of The Thymes, I liked that instead of a mint on the pillow with turn down service, they left a packet of The Thymes &quot;Sleep Well&quot; lotion on the pillow. Nice touch!The Bad:* Street noise was a problem on the 4th floor. Despite earlier assurances by a hotel staffer, street noise was a problem in the morning, with the near constant honking of taxi horns waking me up. For context, I live in downtown Seattle and I am used to city noise. But this level of noise was unacceptable. * No power strip near desk. Come on, you've got a 42&quot; flat screen TV --but no power strip near the desk for my laptop? This should be standard and it was unacceptable to not have a power strip near the desk. * The sliding door for the bathroom was very hard to move. The door kept getting stuck and I couldn't get out of the bathroom without great effort. * I didn't like the brown wood panel on the walls of my room in 70 Park Avenue Hotel. Compared with other botique hotels I've stayed at, the room wasn't as nice. Sorry, but the wood panel looked rather ugly and reminded me of the walls of the finished basement in my parents' 1970's-built house. * Directly outside my room, there was a linen cart during the entire duration of my stay. I asked the front desk to move the cart and they said that it was a normal for 70 Park Avenue Hotel to store linen carts in the middle of hallways due to lack of space - but that they would move the linen cart elsewhere. The cart was never moved. A distinctive hotel should store linens in a closet and not outside my room in a linen cart. I don't want to walk by a linen cart every time I leave my room and return. The Ugly:* No high speed internet for you! 70 Park Avenue features WiFi high speed Internet access throughout the hotel. That's great in theory, but my laptop doesn't connect to WiFi. Upon my request, the hotel sent up a bridge router, but I was never able to connect to high speed Internet even with the bridge router. I called Kimpton's toll free tech support number and tech support said the problem wasn't with my laptop but with something local at the hotel -- and amazingly they said they were &quot;too busy to work on it&quot; (and that's a direct quote). For context, at the next botique hotel I stayed at, I had no problems connecting via their regular direct line for high speed Internet. In summary: high speed Internet is important to me - and I just want it to work; at 70 Park Avenue Hotel, it was not only a waste of my time and a headache, customer service was unacceptable.SPECIAL AMENITIES: 70 Park Avenue Hotel, like all the Kimpton properties, has an evening wine hour, during which guests can socialize with each other. I really like this concept. HOTEL STAFF AND MANAGEMENT: The hotel manager I chatted with in the lobby was very friendly and professional. The staff in front of the lobby elevator was friendly and helpful. The people I spoke with gave 70 Park Avenue Hotel a personal touch that is often lacking in New York City.CHECK OUT: fast and efficient.WHEN BOOKING YOUR ROOM: If you decide to stay at 70 Park Avenue, avoid the Deluxe rooms so you don't get the impossibly tiny bathroom. Also, be sure to get a higher level room to avoid street noise in the morning.THE VERDICT: While I liked the hotel employees I met, I'm not a big fan of the rooms at 70 Park Avenue Hotel. I expect I will not stay at 70 Park Avenue on my next trip to New York City. I must confess I prefer the W Hotel Times Square, despite its own shortcomings; the Platinum level upgrades from Starwood are generally better rooms.##For people who want a lot of detail, including commentary about certain Kimpton Inner Circle benefits at this hotel, there's even more on my personal travel blog athttp://insider.blogs.com/travel/2005/01/review_70_park_.html
