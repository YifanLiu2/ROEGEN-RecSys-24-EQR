Popped into Reading Terminal and decided to graze.  
This is just a review for quick service and not the full monty. 
Molly's was one of the stops as I was in the mood for some crispy fried potato-ey goodness.  It was a tossup between their house made chips or French fries - I chose the latter. 
Small counter off to the side for togo orders makes it quick and easy to get your eats on.  When offered, I opted for the small size. 
Fries arrived after a few short minutes, fresh from the fryer. The menu said "garlic aioli" but there was no side of such and if the taters were tossed in it, I couldn't taste it.  While they did have a good flavor, I thought they could have been been done a tad longer. 
Portion size was great. Staff was very friendly.  Good value however at sub-$4. 
While I was eating, I looked at a few of the plates around the restaurant and noticed some good-looking plates (cheesesteak and some burgers/sandwiches).  Lots of beer available and they sell growlers. Would definitely come back as it looked to be a pretty good spot.Wanted to love this place. But i don't. Got the Beans and greens soup and tasted very bland and like canned veggies. The best thing here is the beer and wine options. Like much everything else at Reading this place is an overpriced novelty.I ran the Philly Love Half marathon so in my way back to NYC I stopped by Reading Terminal Market to have a quick bite as I was starving. I liked that Molly Malloy's because the Breakfast menu was simple and quick to order. I had Farmers platter -two organic eggs Sunnyside up with potato hash and bacon with side of multigrain toast +coffee. It cost me $12 and it was good. Simple easy and tasty if you need quick breakfast on the go.So I got the banana steel cut oatmeal and it's very hard to rave about oatmeal but WOW! It's fresh banana and cinnamon with flax and chia seeds. I got a cup of coffee from them and I can easily say this cup trumps Reading Terminals famous old city coffee. I feel like I'm indulging hard right now but it's actually a healthy breakfast!Family was in Philadelphia for the Army-Navy Game. On Sunday we stayed in the downtown area just around the corner from the Reading Market. (One of my favorite places to visit in the city.)
We stopped in for a couple of beers and ended staying for many beers.
Our waitress Natasha was excellent. This seems to be a very popular place the Eagles were on TV and lots of folks stopped for a beers and to watch the game.
They have a very good selection of beers and wines. Although we did not dine with them the food looked excellent.
This place I located in the Reading Market - has a nice eating area. We stopped back for breakfast the next morning but missed breakfast (believe they stop serving breakfast around 11 am??) 
Be sure to visit these folks when at the Market!If you're in Philly, you have to check out Reading Terminal Market. The market itself can be overwhelming with options. This spot is a nice choice if you want to guarantee a seat in a comfortable setting - especially if you're looking to grab a drink at the bar.Lunch in Philadelphia during the business week is a common occurrence for some but a real luxury to us suburban workers.  I've taken off from work before just to attend lunch events in Philly so I'm rather sure of my conviction.  I was fortunate enough to work from home one day, get my yearly physical and finally get to try Molly Malloy's.
I met up with fellow Yelper Rebecca S. to try the highly publicized grilled cheese.  Being that I was on no real schedule, I had time to linger and enjoy all that this establishment really had to offer.
The space is open and approachable.  I never did get to go in the beer garden but I remember it looking a bit dank and dark.  Not the case with Molly's.  Sure there isn't a ton of natural light at that spot of the market but they've done a nice job on decor.  We chose a high-top in the back.
We ordered the braised ox-tail and the grilled cheese.  The ox-tail was soft and shredded, perfectly cooked and basically was eaten as an open face sandwich.  The grilled cheese was serious.  Goat cheese, spinach, caramelized onions and some kind of funky jam.  You can be sure that I'm going to attempt to replicate it at home.
The fries were a little hit or miss.  Some were great and crispy and others were a touch under-cooked.  Maybe it's because they're hand-cut so they have different cooking times.  Regardless, still pretty good.
I don't have the chance to get here during the week but it wasn't just novelty that made me enjoy this meal.  The food, service and prices were excellent.  Now I just need a center city job....Had the Philly cheese , it had good flavor and was a good size for lunch. My only complaint is that they gave way too many fries. Service was good.This was my second time eating here was very disappointed! !!! Eggs oily and home fries pretty awful.  they also gave me wrong  toast I wanted whole wheat. I didn't want to say anything to the waitress I think she was too busy making herself look good, I will never eat here again.  I'd rather eat at dutch landing. wasn't worth the second trip.Great in both quantity and quality! Molly Malloy's is situated in the corner of Reading Terminal Market; there's a sit-down portion as well as a take-out portion. The line can get rather long, but they move at a decent pace. There was more than enough food for me to take home leftovers.Stopped in Philly on our way home from a trip to the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  Found Molly Malloy's by accident and what a great accident.  As a Vegetarian I don't always have luck finding good choices - especially in a Pub atmosphere.  At first I thought we would just sit at the bar and have a beer or two but when I saw the menu I was thrilled.  Pumpkin soup and a salad with mixed greens, apples, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and mustard vinaigrette.  Perfect!  My husband had potato and leek soup with a non-traditional grilled cheese sandwich (goat cheese, spinach and onion jam). He was in heaven. Lots of other choices for meat eaters too. Bartender was great - friendly and enthusiastic about the menu.  I highly recommend it.Located in Reading Terminal, I naturally thought I'd be able to grab food and sit wherever. However, they're one of the few and only places in Reading that requires you to eat within their bounds. It makes for an odd experience at the Terminal.
However, I ordered their Butternut Squash soup and it was delicious. They even plopped in some candied pecans and swirled in what I believe was brown sugar. 
If you want the true Reading Terminal experience, don't go to Molly Malloy's; however, the food I've had thus far was great and what I saw my friends eat looked delicious as well.DISCLAIMER: We only used their very easy walk up beer service.  What a wonderful selection and a great way to finish off lunch from other stands!  Prices were super reasonable for micro brew and they came with lids!  Excited to try their food next time as well.If you sit here long enough, you may just forget you are in Reading Terminal..which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preference. They certainly have a fairly good draft list including some good local brews including a couple of Yards. 
Additionally, they also serve Golden Monkey which earns anybody an extra star in my book (hello 9.8% ABV!). The service was...indifferent. Kind of snotty, although not overtly so. 
Food was superbly average. Standard bar food, lots of fried foods and salty options. (The special crispy chix BLT was fried to a deep brown/black clearly indicative of some old oil.) 
And... they make their mimosas with Cook's Champagne. I am pretty sure it's on sale right now at Wine & Spirits for $4.99 a bottle...but whatevs. I guess mixing it with from concentrate orange juice masks the cheapness. 
I do think this place is an excellent addition to Reading Terminal, as it's kind of a boozed fueled oasis that allows you to sit down away from the crowds. It just could be a whole lot better.This is a decent option if you're looking to eat somewhere and have a drink within Reading Terminal. It's the only place that has a bar in the market. The food isn't amazing but it's good for what it is. The atmosphere is cool because it feels like you're within a restaurant inside the market. There are several TVs scattered around too. The food is reasonably priced and the drinks are too. The service is always pretty good. It seems that most people probably go here because they have a full bar option. The chicken pot pie was large in portion and served in a small cast iron skillet. The crust and filling were quite bland--I had to add a lot of salt to give it flavor and I'm not typically a person to add salt to foods. The Not Your Mamas Grilled Cheese was very good, although I wouldn't quite call it a "grilled cheese" more like a sandwich, but nonetheless it was delicious and stuffed with goat cheese, Brie, sautéed spinach and an onion jam. Overall, this is a decent spot to grab a bite if you're looking for a nice relaxing place away from the hustle and bustle of Reading terminal market and want to have a drink with your meal.Got the chicken pot pie and deviled eggs and uh.... AMAZING/hit the spot. Will be back again soon!!Pretty satisfied with my meal from Molly Malloy's. It will definitely be the place I hit up again when in Reading Terminal Market. I would like to also try some of their other delicious sounding offerings!
I ordered the Portabella "Cheesesteak" which was kennett square portabella mushrooms, sautéed peppers with a side of their house-cut fries. I added a side of guac instead of the cheese it normally comes with and it was great. The sammy and chips were pretty fantastic. 
We didn't drink here, but we certainly appreciate the option! We didn't even enter the bar because we had the kiddos in tow. Uncertain if that would be an issue, but it did looked like a good place to chill. 
It was a super crowded Saturday afternoon so we just sat at the community tables. Grabbing one is very cut throat at that time as many of you know. Bring patience.
Solid sammy. Happy for the vegan option!Ending up finally at this place was lucky. Good food nice guy, nice beer choice. The bar certainly did the difference in our choice.It's in the Reading Terminal Market.  That must be the lead for this review.  The venue is the primary reason for removing a star.  This would be a great place to sit and relax until later in the evening; however, it closes at 6.
Good food, fine service, and good food.Tucked inside the Reading Terminal Market, this pub is a cozy spot to grab a beer, a solid plate of food and watch a televised game or, better yet, people watch. The service is good and the waitstaff is friendly. The food wasn't fancy but it's delicious with prices that are easy on the wallet.We've stopped into Molly Malloy's twice now while walking around inside Reading Terminal Market.  Both times we have enjoyed our food and our drink and found the prices to be reasonable considering the environment. 
Who would have thunk that a place with a name like Molly Malloy's (sounds Irish right?)  would have a decent Philly Cheesesteak?  
Well, guess what...they do!   You have a few variables to choose from, and then you'll be surprised with just how delicious (and ample) your cheesesteak is.    Their fries are good as well.  
On top of that, while there are a ton of food options down there, I think this is the only (or one of the only) that are actual sit down restaurants.  So if that's what you're looking for, don't hesitate to give Molly Malloy's a try.We stopped here for a beer and wings and root chips.  The beer and wings were very good.  The root chips came out in very small pieces; you almost had to eat them with a spoon.  We mentioned it and the waitress took them off our bill.  Altogether the service was lackluster.  Probably won't be back; there are a bunch of better places in the area.When you are in the Reading Terminal Market this is a good place to sit and have a few pints and yummy food. I like the "Not-Your-Mamas Grilled Cheese" (goat cheese, black pepper fennel onion jam, sautéed spinach, sliced brioche, field green salad). The Red Fish is a good brew for an afternoon break (7.0% from Cherry Hill, NJ). The Harvest Kale Salad (romaine, kale, radicchio, crisp bacon, shaved brussels sprouts, parmesan crisps, mustard seed vinaigrette) is overwhelming. The portion is too much for one person (unless you are a cow), but perfect for two. If you are in the Terminal it is worth giving them a try. Hanna was a great server!Stumbled on Molly's during our first visit to Reading Market.  What a gem.  It's kind of a calm place to take a breather from the hectic market.  My friend was very impressed with their beer list and the food was stellar.  Everything is local (most comes from within the market itself) and super fresh.  I had the short rib empanadas, which were soooooo good, flaky crust, tender insides, just super simple and yummy.  We also got the grilled pb&j with a side of homemade fluff.  Best pb&j ever.  Sooo good.  I wish I lived close, I'd be there all the time!Amazing food super friendly people. This was my first time eating here. Had the cheese steak it was great. But the new spike tv Frankenfood Mac and Cheese was good. It was lacking some seasoning like salt and pepper or something. I will be eating there again. It's a most stop when you are in the area.The avocado toast is a healthy portion with four slices but it's more of a spread of avocado. I prefer my avo toast with chunks. It's also quite spicy, they are generous with the crushed red pepper.
The cauliflower salad is less of a salad and just a side of warm soggy cauliflower. Not a lot of red onion or flavor. Also they topped a hot dish with arugula & it wilted before I could find a seat. I'll throw it away. 
Short wait time & ok staff.Went to Philly on vacation and found this place to be great. The location is awesome and the bartenders were engaging and informative. Highly recommend.great place for food everytime we come to philly this th place for breakfast. great food great service.. ill be backAtmosphere is fantastic, beer selection wonderful, but fish & chips were just OK.  A bit too greasy.  Fries were OKI sat here for lunch and a drink after my boyfriend and I visited the Market. The place was (obviously) noisy (Sunday, July 5th). The waiter was really nice. 
However the food was only OK. We primarily picked this place because it was easy to sit there so it well served its purpose.Stopped here for a drink and they had a pretty good drink menu. The waitresses looked like they were still in training and we had several different waitresses during the time we were there. The food was pretty decent. We ordered calamari and deviled eggs, which came with some sort of eggplant puree as well. The calamari was served in a bowl with another bowl of sauce sitting on top of the calamari-- I thought this was a weird presentation- the marinara sauce bowl kind of crushed the food and the calamari was slightly over-cooked. It's rare that I find perfectly-cooked calamari anywhere, however they did give us a generous portion. Because we only stopped in for apps and a few drinks, we didn't get the full experience, but it was just ok. If it wasn't located in the reading terminal market, I'd say the experience wouldn't have been half as good.This place is a pretty good area to sit down in Reading Terminal. I had Molly's burger and the jam was a surprisingly good addition, getting that sweet and salty combo going. The fries were just OK. The Bloody Mary was great. My dining partners each had the mac and cheese and the vegetable sandwich which they had no complaints about. General seating can get pretty cramped so if you can get a spot at the bar that's a solid option.Finally got a chance to go here for lunch after hearing so much about their food. Even though Molly Malloys is located in the heart of reading terminal market, their sit down atmosphere makes you forget about the busy market itself! The friendly staff made the experience even more pleasant. Now for the food... I was having a major craving for Mac and cheese so it was an easy choice when it came to the menu. I ordered the baked Mac & Cheese which was served in an adorable little skillet! The velvety cheese smothered shells served as the perfect comfort food with every bite. My only complaint would be that there were no "buttery breadcrumbs" as promised, which unfortunately is one of my favorite parts in a classic baked mac and cheese dish. Overall, a nice atmosphere and noteworthy Mac and cheese if you've got a craving for it!Wasn't bad. The service was awesome and I also had turkey sausage with my blueberries pancakes. The food was good, kinda sad about the texture of the sausage, which was a little cold. Overall, the experience was good.I stopped in here for lunch while visiting the Philadelphia area. It is nice that Molly Malloy's has a sectioned off restaurant area which enables its customers to have a bit of separation from the very hectic Reading Terminal.  I got the chicken pot pie which came out very hot in a cute mini skillet.  The crust was doughy and delicious.  The insides had big chunks of chicken complemented by peas and carrots.  The filling was not as creamy as other chicken pot pies I have experienced.  The service was very quick despite even though it was pretty busy there.  I would recommend this place to someone looking for some good food in the Reading Terminal.Coming out of the auto show and on our way to a much anticipated cocktail pub-crawl, we hadn't planed to visit Molly Malloy's - but it became default stop one while we planned our itenerary as it was close and warm.  So who woulda guessed they have a few unique beer-based cocktails on their menu?  Yes indeed, we tasted all three. My favorite was the grandpappy - made with old grandad, Yards Tavern Porter, and a juniper-infused molasses simple syrup. An amazing, strong drink with effervescence and complex flavors. The blood-orange vodka and heffewiezen with bitters was another winner. The tequila and Victory headwater pale ale was good, but the subtly of the tequila got lost in the hops. 
The folks to both sides of us raved about the food, so another visit is in order to see what we were missing.You have to try the Not Your Momma's Grilled Cheese! No questions asked! This was a great place to get lunch in the Reading Terminal. Full bar with delicious food and a spacious place to sit.The ambiance of this place was not like the rest of the market, the music was fluid and lights were dimmer. The menu was original and the ingredients were fresh, I had the avocado toast added eggs and bacon. The avocado was smeared on whole grain fresh bread made fro. One of the places across the way, eggs were cooked to perfection and bacon was thick and crispy and added the right amount of salty balance.We got some New Orleans food while in Redding Terminal. They were out of bottled water, so I hit up Molly Malloy's, which is a bar that serves food, and has a walk up counter in the dinning area of Redding Terminal.
While I was getting my water, out of the corner of my eye I saw mouth watering eye popping sweet potato fries. I stashed this image in my head, grabbed my water, and went back to the table where my wife and daughter were sitting.
I looked at the a box of what looked like home fried potatoes and asked my wife, "what's that?." since I did not recall buying home fries. She said, that's the french fries we got. I said, "oh no, not happening. I just saw some to die for looking sweet potato fries." I said enough. My wife is a sweet potato fry lover. She could live off those things.
I got a very large plate of sweet potato fries with some tasty tangy sauce. They were really good. I don't know how Molly Malloy's is with everything, but I will vouch for their sweet potato fries.There were so many options for a cheese steak in  Reading Terminal Market, so we decided to try Molly Malloys.   We ordered 2 cheesesteaks,  fries, wing and the roasted Brussels sprouts- those were my favorite!!  Roasted in a truffle oil with garlic- absolutely delish!     The cheesesteak was good...not greasy, decent flavor.   But, obviously not the traditional cheesesteak Philly is known for- which was okay, since I didn't expect to get that anyways.  I give them 4 stars, because the food was all good.   Just, nothing was outstanding besides the Brussels sprouts.  Cost was a bit in the higher side compared to other options in the Market- but again, none of it was a surprise as you can see the cost of everything before you order.Nice place to chill in the Reading Terminal Market when you get tired of walking around & want a drink.Its a pretty nice sized bar with lots of beers on tap, food and speciality drinks.I got a Honeycrisp Apple  Sangria that was delicious and it was only $5 ! It also had really good Apples & Oranges in it.The service was good too but I can't really say anything about the food.The only reason I didn't get any food there is because we had just eaten but it looked pretty good.I'll definitely be coming here to take a drink break again next time I'm in Reading Terminal Market.A good spot for a quick lunch in the Terminal.
Cheap
Very good
A ton of food
A great beer selection.
Molly Malloy's boasts a 24 beer on tap selection and it is filled with legitimate local and treat brews.  
The fish and chips were very tasty.  The cobb salad was massive and loaded with a lot of great fresh ingredients.  
Great service.This was a good choice.  I was back home visiting Philly for a conference and wanted to get my scrapple fix.  Molly's had it as well as some other nice breakfast items and some quite tasty bloody marys.  Adequate beer list for the venue and very friendly service made it a worthwhile stop,Stopped here for a quick lunch while in Philadelphia for business, and this place didn't disappoint. They were very nice and quick to get my order up, for which I had the Brussels Sprouts and Short Rib Empanadas.
The Brussels Sprouts were perfectly crispy and flavorful, while the Empanadas were perfectly cooked and equally tasty. I only wish it was healthier so I could have eaten more, and perhaps that the Empanadas has a thicker sauce to them. However, I would definitely recommend this place and the two "snack" dishes that I got. They were delicious and surprisingly larger than I expected for being "snacks!"An unexpected place to eat a chicken pot pie but it does not disappoint.  The boyfriend was craving a pot pie so I did a Yelp search and we stumbled upon this place for these elusive pot pies.  They come in a ceramic container that looks (and tastes) like they were just pulled from the oven, which they probably were.  Piping hot and loaded with chicken (of course) and all that you'd expect in a pot pie - potatoes, celery, carrots.  The gravy in there tasted great.  I thought $7 was a steal, compared to some of the other Yelp places that yielded chicken pot pies (Red Owl Tavern, The Corner come to mind).  We were both satisfied and I even had leftovers.
To be frank, the rest of the menu looks like your fairly standard American grub (pulled pork, BLT sandwich, etc).  We didn't try anything else so I can't comment on the rest of the food but if you're craving an inexpensive place for a scrumptious chicken pot pie, this is a good choice!Not sure what to say...how about the BEST BREAKFAST EVER..the pancakes were amazing and my daughter said the french toast was the best she ever had...I can't say enough about the staff our waitress was awesome with our 4 kids....I can't forget how cool Redding is to walk around..I am from Nyc so when I say I can eat anything it means I will with a smile. The saltiest portions, with eggs and bacon hard as a rock. It takes 30 minutes for a breakfast worse than a diner. Highly suggest any other place even the corner general store would be betterLigger i en trevlig saluhall direkt under konferenscentret. Köpte Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich, som är "nationalrätt" i Philadelphia. Inget exotisk men smakade utmärkt. Jag pt på hotellet men det går att sitta vid bord på plats om man vill. Hela The Market är väl värt ett besök. Massor med olika små matställen med olika typer av mat och det går även köpa råvaror om man hellre lagar till själv. Härlig genuin gammaldags miljö.The guacamole BLT was amazing! Friendly service, great prices. A peaceful place in Reading Market to have a drink and a bite. I was alone, sat at the bar. Not crowded, (Monday early evening in January).  I enjoyed it a lot!Good spot for a sandwich and beer in the Reading Terminal Market.  Decent draft beer selection. I had Chicken Caprese sandwich.  It came with a mixed green salad, which I prefer instead of fries.  My friends both had Philly Cheese Steak and said it was very tasty. Service was very goodBurgers are nothing special and lacked flavor. More appealing to the eye than the mouth. Had it not been for thick slices of bacon I wouldn't have gotten through half of that beef patty. Definitely finished off my fries though. They were fresh skinned Idaho length potato strips topped with some sea salt.  Good draft beef options available. This is the only venue inside Reading Terminal to offer anything alcoholic. Service is ok, though space is limited and the noise level can make it difficult to have a conversation.I ordered from their to-go counter - fast and friendly service. I ordered their cheesesteak and it was good - came with house made chips.Nice people and nice burgers, especially the turkey. 
The sandwiches are served with fries and come with lettuce and tomato, but that's about it. They offer many toppings including goat cheese, gruyere, tomato jam, fried pickles, kalamata olives, celery aoli, and honey roasted peanut butter. You could go crazy creating various combinations, but for an additional $1-$2 per topping, I added red onion, braised cabbage and honey mustard (for about $13).
The burger was not a disappointment- definitely was not as cheap as other yelpers have stated. That won't keep me from coming back the next time that I am in Philadelphia. But, it will keep me from going crazy with the fix-ins. Luckily, the burger was large and juicy enough that I really didn't need to add anything else to it.I was here last March for a business trip and was so excited to come back again this year. Love the beer selection and the bartenders are great!  I will definitely be back and highly recommend Molly Malloy's to anyone visiting Philadelphia!Fast service and quick to please. I do wonder what oil they cook with because it definitely affected the taste of the omelet I had. Bacon was on the sweet side too. Passable, but I make better food at home.My husband and I stopped in Molly Malloy's at Reading Terminal on an early Sunday morning. We were impressed with their brunch menu, the atmosphere and the pricing!
My husband ordered the pancakes with breakfast meat. The pancakes were light and airy, with the perfect amount of buttermilk twang. I ordered the french toast. It was a generous serving for just $7. I couldn't eat it all!
We highly recommend Molly Malloy's for a casual Sunday brunch. You'll definitely get your money's worth!Since I've been here 3x in 24 hours I figured it deserves 5 stars. Breakfast is wonderful and a mid day snack of Brussels sprouts satay and crispin cider really hit the spot. I'll be back for more and recommend you do too!good food, good waitstaff and rotating specials. prices are fair and you can typically get in and out in about 30 min. Try the BBQ pulled pork w/ crunchy onions.So this was fun!! Right in the market so it is a great environment.  Good beer and a yummy cheesesteak.  Service was very good.First time here, food was okay, order sandwiches, I got what was called the portabella mushroom cheesesteak ,okay I guess, on the menu it is listed at $11 and comes with fries, so far so good, when I got the bill their was a up charge for the peppers and onions that the menu said came with the sandwich, was told "oh that is for the vegetarian sandwich "why in the hell would you name the sandwich, portabella mushroom CHEESESTEAK if it's vegetarian? NOT WORTH $13 bucks. buyer bewareI had the crab cakes here which I thought were good.  It had a moderate amount of crab meat (I have had more) and flavor, I thought it could use a bit more seasoning, and it was a bit greasy on the bottom of the cake, which I did not eat.  Over all a good crab cake, but I just have had much better.I stopped in the terminal and had some extra time; therefore, I wanted to sit down, be waited on, and relax.
I ordered up the calamari salad and it was delish. The servers were extremely nice and helpful and the portion was very generous.
If I am not in a rush, I will e sure to stop back and try something else.  The fries looked amazing and they are on my radar.Good choice for lunch on a very busy Saturday at Reading Terminal Market. We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess and our server was at our table within minutes of our being seated. I ordered my normal boring Bud Light which was cold and delicious and my daughter ordered an IPA which she loved. My daughter's cheese steak was the best she had in Philadelphia which is saying something! I had a goat cheese spinach and onion grilled cheese which was good but too much spinach and onion for me. Wish I had gotten the cheesesteak but all in all a very good experience!Food way better than you would expect. Great beer selection. Lovely all wood bar. Great place to regather yourself after shopping in the hubub of the reading terminal market.Great place. Nice mix of locals and tourists. Food selection is good--sea food to salads. Beer selection is great and the service was wonderful. Natasha was very cool--as were the other servers--but she knew the beers and pallets. I cannot wait to go back.I must say my wife,mother-in-law & I had a very good experience at Molly Malloys in the reading terminal market in downtown Philadelphia. My wife had the butternut squash soup & I had the best bangers and mash I've eaten yet. If your looking for a place to sit,relax a little and eat good food, well I think you should check this place out !!This place is delicious! If you're around the Reading Terminal area, this is the place to go. Decently priced food and drinks for the area, and the food is always great. I love the garlic aioli that you can order with your fries. The service is average, and they get pretty busy around 4:30/5:00, but I've never had to wait for a table.Many of the menu items caught my interest - portobello cheesesteak, harvest kale salad, ale-steamed mussels, the GBLT - but I was set on my mission for fish and chips and they did not disappoint!
The portion size was big enough to share with three large fish cod fillets. They were cooked perfectly with a nice crispy and thick yet light breading. The tartar sauce was so-so but a nice accompaniment to the fish. The chips were also great. Crispy, slightly greasy French fries that were topped with sea salt, which was a great surprise to get little bursts of saltiness every few bites.
Overall, I was impressed by what I expected to be just a mediocre lunch. They seemed to have a nice list of draft beers as well but sadly I was on lunch break from a conference....next time, beer, next time.I eat at Molly Malloy's at least once a week and have yet to be disappointed. They have a great menu with items sure to please everyone in your group. Their rotating menu of specials make it even harder to make a selection - everything always sounds (and tastes) amazing. And to top it off, they've got great service!Naturally, I'm going to give any place in Reading Terminal 5 stars. If you have even the slightest doubt in my love for the market read my Reading Terminal review, I dare ya!
Molly Malloy's is an excellent spot if you need a break from the hustle and bustle and need a good beer. Actually IMPORTANT TIP: did you know you can take your beer to go?? YUP! Even if you want to have an eclectic lunch from a variety of stands  accompanied by a beer, Molly Malloy's has got you covered. Seriously! They even pour it in a convenient plastic cup. If you need a little something to keep ya chill while perusing the market, get a beer to go and the crowd won't even phase you anymore! 
Getting back on topic, Molly Malloy's actually has extremely good food. I, for one, am a sucker for sweet potato fries and they have some delectable ones. Their lamb burger is juicy and wonderfully served. Also, if you are feeling healthy, the kale salad is darn delicious and HUGE! The chicken pot pie is tasty too. I could keep going on and on! My only complaint is the chicken caprese sandwich was a bit dry to my disappointment... Though that is the only time I've been dissatisfied, which is pretty good considering how many times I've been there! 
The market can be crazy sometimes, but Molly Malloy's is an excellent escape! And if you don't want to have a server or a sit down meal there is always the beer-to-go!!TIPS:
*There are far, far better places to eat at the Reading Terminal Market. I got unlucky with this sit down place on my first day in Philly. Even the faux-Chinese food in one of the stalls is better than this.
*Do not serve burgers when the rolls are hard and stale. No matter what beef or brie cheese is on the Wednesday special, it's hard to find anything positive about an un-fresh roll.
*Fries. Fries! It's french fries! Do they have to be cold? I left almost all of them on the plate. I should have ordered what my companion had --the Philly cheesesteak, which he seemed to like.
Service wasn't very kind or helpful. It was hard to find someone to come help us.We came in for a cheese steak a and wonderd over to this place. We had a few drinks and appetizers, Alicia was GREAT. While we are here, we shall repeat a visit.
They also give testers of the AWESOME beers. I met some friendly people as well.We had grill cheese, guacamole and chips, amazing brussel sprouts, pulled pork with bbq sauce!! For sure will eat here again before we travel back home!!I hate downtown crowds, so I avoid it unless I have to.  I had Jury duty so I usually search for a watering hole to have my lunch.  I ordered the Black and Bleu burger which includes bacon (yum), carmelized onions and a Bleu Cheese type dressing.  It was ok, but I prefer it on a roll rather than a texas toast type of bread.  The carmelized onions threw the taste off a bit.  Service was good and the draft beer was tasty.  I'll remember this place next year when I get picked again.Came on a Sunday to Reading market. The place is a bit overwhelming, especially if you're hungry!  Too much choice leading to decision fatigue.  We decided on Molly Malloy's because they had seating and an appealing menu.  Opted to try the Chicken Cheesesteak and wasn't disappointed.   Added the Chipotle Buttermilk sauce and mushrooms.  Only way to go now!  Highly recommended!  Sandwich came with a variety of sweet potato and regular chips.  Would definitely eat here again!While we were meandering through the crowd at the Reading Terminal Market on Black Friday I wondered how in the world we would ever get a table where there was room to eat! There were so many people. Then I turned and saw Molly Malloy's, a full service restaurant and bar located inside the Reading Terminal Market! It felt like an oasis in the desert. 
My boyfriend and I were seated immediately and perused the menu. He ordered the cheese steak with broccoli rabe, and I ordered the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Both meals were filling. My boyfriend enjoyed his cheeseteak immensely, while I liked my meal but it was your basic chicken sandwich, no bells no whistles. When I go out to eat I want to taste something that makes my mouth sing. This experience reminds me of the Jersey boardwalk. There is an abundance of food and you're usually ravenous after being in the ocean all day, but it's the atmosphere not necessarily the food that takes center stage. 
I also ordered a sweet iced tea. I was served iced tea with no sugar. The waitress apologized for the error and quickly delivered the sweet tea to my table. And she actually stayed more attentive after that, making sure to refill my drink at the exact right time. I really appreciated that.
Molly Malloy's is great if you need a basic meal and a seat in the oft crowded Reading Terminal Market. Or if you want to sit at the bar and have a few drinks and grab a bite to eat. I wouldn't recommend it if you're geared up for WOW, you may find it, or you may not.While attending a convention, I came here for lunch a few days in a row. It's nice because they have their own sitting area so you don't have to fight for tables in the rest of the market. 
Great, expansive beer selection. Always friendly service each time I went. 
First day, I got the mac and cheese, which came out piping hot. Pretty good.  The second day, I got the beef stew, pretty decent again. 
My date loved both his grilled chicken dish and caprese sandwich. My dad loved his chicken pot pie he ordered and mom got the Philly Cheesesteak that she said was amazing. 
So, I just ordered poorly two days in a row. 
Oh wells, will be back if we're in town!Went here for breakfast with my husband for the first time. Service was great and food was outstanding! Probably the best omellete I've had in my life was here. I also had the french toast, which were also delicious. Coffee was good too, the roast was a very peculiar one so it tasted really good. My husband had the prime rib empanadas and they were really good too!I stopped here randomly in search of a good meal. It's hard coming to Reading Terminal when you're hungry, the possibilities are endless! However, if you want to sit down an eat somewhere a bit more restaurant like this place is it! Everything here is house made & FRESH, they also use produce and meats from other businesses in the terminal. I had the fish and chips which were excellent, great batter, not too greasy and the house fries are awesome, they even make their own ketchup! Beer selection doesn't disappoint either, I'll definitely be back!Great place to grab a bite @ RTM! Table service is a plus.
Food is fresh, tasty & well prepared. Some ingredients are sourced locally(bacon from Halteman's,yum) Fresh squeezed o.j. My avacado blt was delicious.My friends loved their steak sandwich & burger served w/ fresh cut fries. Great friendly service.They also have a very decent beer/cocktail selection. Prices are reasonable , especially considering the quality of the food.Nice finish to a Philadelphia weekend with a history tour Saturday and the Flower show on Sunday where my 2 sisters joined us. 
Had a late lunch at the Reading Terminal Market where it was still packed after 1pm with the lunch crowd from across the street at the Convention center.
Molly Malloys was able to seat us in 15 minutes and served our drinks and food promptly.
My wife and 1 sister went with the pork sliders, the other sis had a kale salad and I went with a Philly staple, the cheesesteak along with a local pub brew. 
Friendly service and great atmosphere, will come again next time when we are in the area.A quick Philly Cheesesteak and homecut fries for lunch. 
The Philly Cheesesteak was excellent once it was loaded with onions, peppers and mushrooms.The homecut fries were ordinary and nothing at all spectacular. 
A simple place for a quick and yummy lunch. The server was excellent.In Reading Terminal you can probably find yummier food at a cheaper price.
That said--the food here isn't awful...just A-OK.  I think happy hour here would be amazing, great beer selection and atmosphere, but if you're in Reading Terminal for a serious meal? There are plenty of other options.I keep asking for the Irish Breakfast that I hope they will add one day!   in two visits I tried the jalapeno omellete, the fish and chips, and the Cheesesteak!  Molly Malloy's gives you a little more of a restaurant feel in the Reading Terminal and some privacy.  To my surprise I really loved the fish n chips, deep fried to perfection.  The jalapeno omellete was quite a treat, and the cheesesteak was a bargain.  This place is a winner!My first visit to Philly and I was not disappointed. Had to have my first local cheesesteak sandwich. Great restaurant in the market and wonderful food. Top it off with a Bloody Mary and it was the perfect way to start the day.Stopped in for a late breakfast and a Victory Hop Devil.  Sat at the bar. Twenty four beers on tap plus another twenty four in bottles.  So many that they print a menu. Beer was nice, service was good, food was nothing special. Only place in Reading Terminal Market serving alcohol (that I could see).I wanna start by saying I USED to love this place!  We moved away and came back,  I made an extra trip to come here. 
  The menu changed and the food suffered bc of it,  the Caesar salad used to be real dressing,  fresh shaved cheese w/ home made croutons- now it tastes like what comes out of a pre-mixed bag. 
   They took muscles off their menu that brooth and french bread OMG (my favorite).  The mac & cheese & cheese steak just weren't the same.. 
  I dont know if there were staff changes but the vibe was off and waistress was not informed on the craft beers & ciders.. 
   I miss how it was before :(So the day had finally come. I finally got myself outta my neighborhood cheesesteak joint and into one in Philly. I had a feeling Molly's might not be the most authentic Philly cheesesteak of all time, but we thought we'd give it a go as it was getting close to closing time in Reading Terminal.  The cheesesteak was alright- the bread was not very soft and the meat/cheese was ok.  I was little disappointed with the sweet potato fries. They weren't crispy, nor were they soft...they were somewhere in the middle and had a slight burnt taste to them.  I'm still on the hunt for some other cheesesteak place to steal my heart away from my favorite San Diego cheesesteak spot. I'll probably be grabbing another one before I leave town. Stay tuned.A decent place in the back (East center) of the Reading Terminal Market.  It's one of a small handful of places in the Market that has seating; that's it's biggest plus.  Since my office is in the next block, I'm in the Market at lunchtime only.  My review doesn't include the wide variety of beers that others appreciate.  
The service was very good; the food decent; the prices are OK.  Maybe the absence of a cold one at hand lessens my appreciation?  Maybe the crowds that include visiting conventioneers?  I'll have to go back to update my review.If you have a wait at the Jefferson station in philly, do yourself a favor and check out the beer/food menu at this place. No run of the mill chicken tenders and fries here. I ate the spicy potato hash for breakfast and washed it down with a beer. Aces all the way!![[Disclaimer: I'm a pescatarian, so I was dealing with a pretty limited menu here, and this review is based only on the consumption of salad + fish & chips]] 
This place is a huge improvement over the beer garden that was here before, but I have to say I thought the food was just ok. Ratio of fried batter to actual fish was a little too high for my tastes. The beer selection was good and service was pleasant, but I still caught myself glancing longingly at the plastic-boxed meals others were eating beyond the restaurant wall.
They also have tvs here playing the "big game" du jour, if that's important to you.Came to RTM for flowers and a quick lunch while shopping nearby. I have been trying to eat healthy so the slow wandering down aisles of deep fried deliciousness was killing me. I glanced at the menu here and saw grilled chicken and veggies. After asking about holding back the mushrooms (ewww!!)  the counter staff happily obliged and offered to substitute spinach. Perfect. $13 was kind of pricey I thought, until I saw my plate. Easily two serving here. I took a to-go lid and had another meal out of it at home. Perfectly grilled chicken cutlets. Very flavorful and the green beans and spinach tasted just picked. Delicious!!
I still wanted a termini's cupcake though.I had a bangin' cheesesteak here and some fries. Although you don't have to go far at Reading Terminal to get a good cheesesteak, the line was shorter.  Great people watching spot.I came here to meet a few friends who were at the Philadelphia tattoo convention and never having been to Reading Market we decided to stop in and grab lunch. We landed on Molly Malloy's and grabbed some seats at the bar.
The bartenders were really nice and let us try a few beers so we could make up our mind.
My husband and I ended up both ordering the Guac BLT (guacamole, bacon, arugula, tomato, pickled jalepeno, on multigrain bread) I ordered mine without jalepeno and added caramelized onions which was amazing!
One of the things we really loved the most was that it was served with freshly made potato chips - it seemed like a mix of both sweet potatoes and regular potatoes.
I would highly recommend eating here!I'm a big fan of Molly Malloy's. Good beer selection and tasty food nestled into the back of Reading Terminal Markey. Service has always been fast and pleasant. Great spot to grab beers and breakfast on Sunday morning before heading down to the Linc for and Eagles game. In fact we do it several times every season!My lovely wife and I stopped in one Saturday afternoon as we were in the area. We were starving but had a dinner reservation a few hours later and didn't want to eat too much before hand. We walked though the market and decided to have a nosh and a drink at Molly Malloy's. 
I used to work at the market on Saturday's and remember the drab bar that used to inhabit this space. No food service so you bought food elsewhere and ate at the bar. Nothing to write home about.  
This new space is awesome. Excellent beers on tap (not sure how many taps but enough to find something for everyone). We took a seat at the bar and perused the menu. We chose the roasted vegetables and the Butternut Squash Croquettes. Both were excellent and really hit the spot.  Service was great and we cannot wait for a return visit.Philly Girl born and raised. Awesome find in the market to sit down and unwind at he end of the week on a Friday night!!! The Brussel Sprouts are a must!!!! Enjoy!!!If you're a foodie who loves a good craft beer selection it's THE must-stop spot in the RTM. I tend to bring out-of-towners here pretty frequently. 
The food is quite good. The ingredients are some of the best of the market and the flavors never disappoint. I do wish they had more vegetarian items on the menu. I would not bring my herbivore friends here and as someone who eats a mostly plant-based diet, I feel limited in my options. The menu is a little small as it is so,  maybe I am asking too much. 
Unfortunately the service leaves much to be desired. More than once I've had to ask for silverware and napkins after being served my food and waiting for someone to return to my table. Water refills just don't seem to happen - even when they are promised, the servers never seem to return with them.
Overall, this place is "ok" - more of a tourist spot than someplace I would frequent.stopped by here Saturday for a quick lunch, great place to stop by for a quick mimosa before heading over to the convention center. one of the few places in Reading Terminal they serve alcohol... might be the only?
i got a mimosa, jersey tomato toast and wings.
mimosa was average, jersey tomato toast was pretty good! it was ricotta spread on some toast with some fresh tomato and basil, i honestly thought it was going to be like tomato pie so i was a bit disappointed but it was fresh. the wings were OK, i wanted them to be crispier and meatier but they weren't.
overall, this place is decent but i've had some better food in Reading Terminal...After walking around the entire market for 20 minutes, we saw Molly Malloy's. My fiancé got the French Toast and I got the spicy bacon hash with a side of scrapple. 
     Be aware that the "spicy bacon hash" is not spicy in the least- that was somewhat of a let down. In fact, I don't think the we're any hot peppers whatsoever, just bell peppers. 
     The French Toast was delicious with a big vanilla burst. This was also my first foray into scrapple so I didn't know what to expect. I liked it quite a bit but the fiancé hated it. I'm not sure how to describe it except that when you put it in your mouth, it tastes like warm gravy with a weird consistency. You just have to try it!I thought this would be typical bar food, but I was really impressed. We got flatbread and Mac and cheese. Both were really fantastic and little to no wait time. Bartender was super busy, but polite and attentive. Really great little place.Came here on NYE when most things in Reading Market were closed. Service was super fast, and prices were reasonable -- I ordered a Philly cheesesteak, which I was pleasantly surprised to find came with delicious and crispy root chips. 
I ended up eating it cold while watching fireworks at Penn's Landing (not my best idea, i know). Even cold, I thought it was tasty (caveat: I was also starving). Would come back to see how things taste at desired temperatures :PReading Terminal can be quite overwhelming so it was nice to find a sit down place in the midst of all the chaos. My friends ordered the cheesesteaks, because, Philly. I'm not a fan but they looked really good and cheesy! I enjoyed the Not Your Mother's Grilled Cheese which was divine! Service was really good, too. I was expecting sub par for some reason and was impressed!Why on earth would I pick a place called Molly Malloy's?  Sounds like bar and burger fare.  WRONG.  I am not a vegan, so why did I choose two vegan dishes?  Because they were delicious!  The Quinoa salad with roasted beet and mustard seed dressing was filling and bursting with fresh flavor AND bursting with roasted chickpeas.  The cauliflower was one of the best dishes I've had in ages...roasted with harissa, raisins and onions.  I could have eaten two portions.  My only complaint was that it was a bit expensive..$22 with tax.  Not that I didn't totally enjoy my meal, but that seemed high for the Terminal Market.  I guess all that freshness and deliciousness costs!Don't forget about this place in the back of the terminal! Came here for brunch on a Sunday. No wait, friendly service, and most importantly, their French toast is bomb. I haven't had a good French toast in a while, because usually they're soggy and no cinnamon flavor. This was the complete opposite. Lots of yummy cinnamon goodness and it had a nice crunch to it.  BF had the spicy hash which he enjoyed and filled him up. Would definitely return!Already one of my favorite spots in the city, Reading Terminal got an upgrade with the opening of Molly Malloy's.  It's a great use of space, with a huge, long U-shaped bar.
The food menu is extensive, and the prices are pretty good too.  I stopped in here with my buddy Dan. His go to order, fish and chips, was pretty good, but a smallish portion.  I felt the same way about my order, the Irish stew.  We saw a good number of sandwiches come out of the kitchen, and they were pretty big.
The beer list here includes 24 or so taps, and while they didn't present me with anything new, the selection is still good.  The pricing is wonky, with some beers normal prices (Bud $3, blithering idiot $5 wine glass) and some outragous (Rouge Dead Guy $9).  Still, the point is there good beers are available.
Happy hour is from 4 to 6, when the bar closes.  It's a bit odd that the bar closes the same time as the market.
Bottom Line: This spot is a pretty and tasty welcomed addition to reading terminal market.  While its promises to be overcrowded with those on break from jury duty and conventions, it'd still worth a stop for your lunch break.This is a great place to relax and enjoy a nice local beer and the best fresh Philly cheesesteaks in town. You have to try the homemade chips,,, to die for. Ask for the bowl of them because a side is not enough. All the Staff are great and the manager is passionate about food and drink and sources local. When you visit ask to say hello to Teresa who is in charge of this family owned establishment. Great food great atmosphere great service and great people make a great venue. Tell Teresa that JAMES the beer guy sent you...Seemed like an okay bar however I feel like it is a huge downgrade from the Beer Garden that once occupied the same space.  The Beer Garden wasn't trying to be something it wasn't.  Molly Malloy's seemed to want to be an up-scale dining experience yet lacked the clientele to be such.  Overall, not impressed but I will return to give them another shot.I've eaten here a few times over the past year and always been extremely satisfied.  The staff is friendly, professional, and super efficient.  This is comfort food at its best.  Today, I asked for the pot roast, no bread, extra horseradish, and spinach.  It would typically be a sandwich, but you would never have known it.  Without writing anything down, or even batting an eyelash, the staff quickly slipped it in front of me, each item in it's own specially sized bowl, including the pickled onions and mashed potatoes.  The potatoes were super creamy - just this side of that food processor blitz where they're creamy, but not pancake stage.  The spinach was somehow savory and flavorful without being oily or creamy.  The horseradish sauce was horseradish-spicy, not chili spicy to keep it hot, if you know what I mean.  This place is front and center in the market, but somehow always manages to find room for me.This was the 1st time & hopefully the last time I receive Poor Service from sitting at the bar. I never leave an insufficient tip , seriously never ! I did order the Grill Skillet Salmon & for the portion at the price of $14 was small but the "flavor" was very good. Until next visit.....A nice place to grab a cold beer with great selections amidst all the hustle and bustle. Kale Caesar was enormous! Lobster Mac and Cheese had a few bites of lobster, was tasty but pasta was very overlooked to point of mushy. Looking around I would certainly opt for one of the delicious looking sandwiches and hand cut fries in the future! Service was great despite the crowd.I'd stopped by the new space for a Yelp event last year when it first opened. It's a huge improvement on the former beer garden space. It feels very open - there's a huge bar + lots of smaller tables and several TVs. We came in for a late lunch. They have a great draft list - lots of local favorites and some beers I had never heard of before. I loved my sandwich - the Not-Your-Mama's Summer Grilled Cheese. It was goat cheese and tomato jam on thick bread. The tomato jam was delicious - lots of flavor and the perfect complement to the goat cheese. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich. Needs a little more BBQ sauce but otherwise a great sandwich. Servers were friendly and prices fair. Nice stop in RTM if you're looking for a beer!The chicken pot pie was good but the filling was still cold. The taste is there but the food itself is cold and could be presented better. It was probably microwaved since the filling had cold spots. Overall a good experience and would come back!We stopped by Molly Malloy's on a recent trip to Philadelphia.  We were walking and shopping and stopping at eateries that caught our eye.  Molly Malloy's is in the Reading Terminal Market which is always a must visit destination when we are in town.  It was bustling with patrons.  They have a fun happy hour that seems to attract a lot of people wanting to mix and mingle.  We had time before we caught our train and stopped by for beverages and snacks.  Our server was super polite.  It was near closing time but he assured us we were welcome.  He let us know when the kitchen would close.  He kept us supplies with beverages while the staff cleaned and prepped the restaurant for the next day.  We really appreciated having a spot to sit and relax.  The beers were cold and the staff was friendly.Good place to grab breakfast and a cocktail or beer if you're in the reading terminal market (it's the only spot with a bar). The French Toast was the best I've had in a long time. Husband got a breakfast sandwich and it too was delicious.. something about their bread... it's really tasty! Portions are huge.. didn't think we could finish our meals but the food was too good to let it go to waste lolEvery time prior to this last time I visited the Reading Terminal Market, I glossed over this sit-down restaurant. It never looked very busy, and it seemed to serve standard American fare. However, we decided to come one weekend morning, and it was GREAT. The place was, as usual, not that busy. The servers were all very friendly. The food was way above average for diner food. They served lunch, even at 930 am (which is my jam). We had a breakfast skillet and pancakes, which were really well cooked and seasoned. I had a guacamole BLT which was well executed. 
Considering there's always a line a the dutch eating place, I would say this place, without a wait is a much better use of your time!The kale cocktail and cheesesteak were both not good at all. The cheesesteak was very chewy and you could barely chew the food good enough to swallow it. However I'm giving this place three star because our waitress was good and the fries with garlic aioli sauce were amazing. Unfortunately I didn't just get the fries as my meal.Only had drinks!
YAY for having a full bar within the reading terminal. We ate our self through the terminal and then stopped here at the end to get a drink. I know they serve food but we didn't have any. They had a good size beer list with some unique IPAs. It has that fun Irish pub feel to it. The drinks were served quickly, were cold, and hit the spot! If you are looking for a drink while in the terminal go here! Otherwise you probably would not hit this bar.Had a late lunch here on a Saturday - we wanted to have a couple drinks and not fight for a seat so Molly's was a good choice !
The husband had what he said was a "solid" Bloody Mary. His entree was the beef stew which he had more of a soup quality then stew but was still flavorful.
Our son had the classic cheese steak served with fries.
I had fish and chips - the portion was surprising large and had to take half home. It was really good - actually one of the best I've had in a long time. The fries were good but not great.
Service was very good - our waitress was attentive even though it was very busy. 
Glad we came here!Service was extremely friendly and attentive, and our waitress had tons of patience answering our questions about their beer selection, but I wouldn't come back for the food. 
Let it be said though, the clam chowder in a sour dough bowl was delicious. If you get anything get that, just be aware that they really do pile on that bacon! 
But everything else just didn't hit the mark. The crab bisque was pretty bland and came out lukewarm. The beef stew was ok. The fries were fries, nothing special nothing awful. My friends salad (it had pears and cheese, not sure what else) was bone dry. No dressing! It was the strangest thing. And they fry their pierogies till toasty. Just....why? Why would you do that? The dough was so thick and tough, and there was WAY more cheese than potato inside. It also tasted heavily processed. Like they stuffed a Kraft Single in there. I took a bite and couldn't finish the rest. I know they advertize using locally sourced, fresh ingredients, so I'm not sure what happened there. I won't be coming back next time I'm in town.Stopped in to the Reading Terminal Market and found this gem! The roast Turkey sandwich on wheat berry bread was a full meal with chips, but we also had homefries with sea salt - so good!. All the food was real fresh, good selection of brews, too. The server, Alisha, was quick and atentive. A fun place for friends to meet up, I will go back again soon.I went here last week with my bf for lunch. From the time we walked into the restaurant, until the time we left the staff was friendly, accommodating and helpful. While there were several televisions playing, the volume was not overpowering but provided a vehicle for patrons to enjoy sports and entertainment while enjoying their meal.
We ordered our food and didn't have to wait long to be served. I initially ordered my food but when it came out, there was a slight problem with the order. The wait staff immediately stated that my meal would be comped and served me another meal to replace the original order. I tried the sloppy joe (which they have won awards for) and was thoroughly satisfied. 
Within a few minutes of the server replacing my order, the owner/ manager arrived at our table. The owner apologized for the mishap and offered my bf and myself anything else we desired for our misfortune. The owner stated that not only was my meal free but so was my bf's. The owner stated that she could not take a penny from us but had to ensure that our dining experience was good. My bf ordered a sloppy joe to go and we continued our lunch without incident. I had the coleslaw that was home made and it was delicious. 
As we were eating, the owner returned with some fresh fruit (santa clause melon & cotton candy grapes) that she got from another store in Reading Terminal. The owner then  offered us dessert and coffee, we declined because we were full :).  The staff, food, and service here were wonderful. This place is a place that you must try if you are looking for good food and great service in a timely fashion.This place is in the Reading Terminal Market, and the entire market is amazing. It's walking distance from the hotel we're calling home and will now be our go-to dining establishment while we're here. The food was delicious and filling, the prices are reasonable and the service is great. Couldn't ask for more! Best part, when you're done eating you can walk around the market and get dessert.Wanted to buy a few beers but bartender lady would not let me because I had outside food.  I won't be back here.  I rather give my money to someone who wants it's.  First rule of customer service is never turn a paying customer away!Had the extra yummy "not your mama's grilled cheese" and salad, and it was super tasty. I highly rec it! It had goat cheese and greens. Very difft from your traditional grilled cheese.Girl at counter was super rude.  Was literally in the middle of ordering breakfast with the girl at the register when they switched to the lunch menu and we asked if they could still serve us what we were ordering (the avocado toast) and her response was "No, breakfast is over."  When we asked please since we were literally ordering (and nothing that would include anything like bacon or sausage that would require pulling out breakfast food they had just put away) she responded "No- absolutely not! There are two other restaurants in here that you can get breakfast!"  Wow.  Talk about poor customer service. Not even a response like "We can't, but perhaps you'd be interested in ... from our lunch menu?"  I would be pissed if I were the owner considering staff just scoffed at a customer and basically shooed them away.  Will definitely not go back for that type of attitude.Good place, nice bar area compared to the other areas in Reading Market, good beer selection (with helpful guidance and samples), friendly and patient staff (I picked their brains a LOT with clueless  tourist questions), and fair pricing.  Food was pretty good, solid 3.5 rounded up for service.Great food, and drinks. Enough beers to choose from to last a solid season, but fear not the drinks are on heavy rotation!
The service is top notch too, quick, efficient and friendly.Came here with a friend for lunch and we both got the kale salad with grilled chicken. Salad was fine but nothing to write home about. The other entrees looked very tasty and if you're looking to stop somewhere in Reading Terminal for a meal and a drink, this is probably the place to go. It can get pretty crowded but empties out quickly.Ordered the Sausage, Egg, Cheese Croissant for breakfast. It was delicious. Portions are large so you won't leave hungry. Reasonably priced considering how much food was served.
But, sadly, the coffee was awful. Perhaps I'm a snob but if a place serves breakfast, they should serve good coffee. It doesn't have to be $400/lb good, but it has to taste like coffee. I'm not sure what was up...it had a funky sour aftertaste. This review would have been 4* had the coffee been tolerable.Craft beer selection is excellent, the fries were to die for and the service was phenomenal. Must try when you visit Reading Terminal Market!Good stop for lunch or brunch. My sis and I stopped in Reading Terminal Market on our way back to DC from NY and this was a good bet. Comfortable seating away from the crowds; good service and cheesesteak was really good. We even got sweet potato fries.I haven't had a bad meal or beer. Worth a stop. They now have beer to go!  So if you hankering some else in the Market grab it and then get beer to go and grab a seat in the common area.This is a great spot at the Reading (pronounced Redding) Terminal Market. It has a nice sit down area for big groups. Their food menu had a variety of foods from salads, Philly cheesesteak, and long selection of drinks. The service was fast. It is not fine dining but it fit perfectly in the fast pasted market. I recommend stopping here when you are in Philly!Yummmm!!!! We picked this place because of the "restaurant feel" inside the reading district and extensive beer taps and were super impressed by the food and service! I had the chicken pot pie, which was loaded with chicken, carrots, potatoes and peas with a super fresh flaky crust and hubby had a cheesesteak that he LOVED! It was a wonderful lunch on our day off together. Thanks Molly's!After another pleasant experience, I'm convinced that everything in Reading Terminal Market is amazing. I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese croissant, and it was delicious. Croissant was the perfect temperature, and the cheese was melted but not overbearing the other sausage or the egg. 
Portions are large and price is fairly expensive for a breakfast sandwich (but pretty standard when comparing to all the stalls in RTM). My friends ordered the pancakes and said good things about the food as well.
I would definitely recommend this place!I was really excited to try to chicken pot pie at Molly Malloy's. My friend from Philly been raving about it and quite honestly, after I tried it, it wasn't all that amazing. When they served it to me in a plastic takeout container, the first thing I noticed was the ugly short crust. It look like it was floating on top of the stuffing. Just look at my photos. I was expecting a nice overflowing crust with crispy flaky tendencies but instead I got a undersized pie crust. 
Aside from the awful display of a pie crust, the inside was okay. The chicken, potatoes, carrots, and peas were fresh. You could taste and tell that it wasn't from the freezer. But here's another downer, the temperature of the inside wasn't very hot. Literally, after 3-5 minutes, it cooled down drastically and started to taste like last night's leftover dinner.
Verdict - If they served the chicken pot pie with a proper crust and perhaps a warmer serving of it, I would of absolutely enjoyed it. I might of gotten a bad batch of pot pies so I won't go too far and give them anything under a 3 star review. I'll certainly give Molly Malloy's another shot next time I visit Reading Terminal.After looking through their menu for some time I decided to try the Fish&Chips.
While waiting for my order i looked through the menu again and thought tht the salads  sounded interesting.
The fish was pretty good. it wasn't tasteless and the tartar sauce was pretty good. The fries that came with it were pretty good too. i didnt finish it but i know that if i were really hungry i would have knocked them out.Good food and beer. I went to the one (not sure if there is more than one location) at Reading Terminal Market.  It was a nice place to sit down and not deal with the crowds. The menu isn't very big, but the food is good.  I had one of the daily specials: the Jerk chicken sandwich, and it was great.Loved this place, to bad I leave so far away, the service, amvience and the food are amazing, very nice selection of beer, is a most go place in Philly. 
WARNING don't park in the public parking next door they are thieves and a rip off, I guess that how Philadelphia feels about their tourist, very sad for the businesses around them.Everything about our experience here was great.  Cheesesteak, burger and guac BLT were all delicious. Our waitress was very friendly and very helpful with info on where to go to try different things.Do yourself a favor and order the cheesesteak- it's simply amazing. Every bite is flavorful, and you can substitute portobello mushrooms for the meat if you need a vegetarian option. Robin the bartender is phenomenal and remembered me and my family from almost a year ago. She's super attentive and genuine, and you can tell she enjoys her job. I will be paying this place a visit every time I'm in Philly from here on outWe didn't order food so I can't give a full review.  However, nothing like an ice cold beer at 9:30am on Sunday morning....yep, I may have a bit of an issue.  The staff is great and the beer is cold (really affordable too).  And, I should probably add...they have Not Your Fathers Root Beer on tap...Really good burger. My girlfriend loved the chicken pot pie. Great place to grab a drink and sit down for some food in reading terminal market. A little pricey for what it is, but that's to be expected in the market. Service was decent for how busy it was on a saturday afternoon.We recently had a cocktail event in April 2015 at Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia (our specific venue was Molly Malloy's) that All About Events helped us coordinate. We planned the event remotely from Colorado and had never been to Philadelphia before, and thus needed to coordinate all logistics through All About Events given our limited knowledge of the area. I can honestly say that we could not have been happier with All About Events. Gina and Sarah worked extensively with us in planning the event and molding it into exactly what we intended. They were both extremely responsive and worked tirelessly to assure that the details were all covered.
The event ended up being a cocktail hour (really 3 hours) for networking and doubled as a celebration for our organization. Because of the nature of the event, though, head counts were tough to completely pin down and we were operating on a tight budget from our organization. Gina and Sarah were happy to work with us throughout the planning process, and Gina was exceptional in coordinating everything on the actual night of the event. The cocktail hour was everything we could have hoped for: great food, great drinks, great opportunities to socialize, and an incredible atmosphere. Reading Terminal Market was a unique spin on the typical cocktail event that we have every year, and Molly Malloy's in particular was spectacular for a nighttime event. The staff at Molly Malloy's, Teresa, Gina, and Sarah were phenomenal and our experience at All About Events and Molly Malloy's could not have been beaten. We would highly recommend All About Events, and the Molly Malloy's venue for anyone looking to plan an event - formal or informal - in Philadelphia. Whether you are in Philadelphia or traveling from elsewhere, the staff at All About Events and Molly Malloy's will provide you with an outstanding experience.I came here for the first time for lunch today. It wasn't too busy, considering the fact that it was midday on a weekend inside the market. The service was a little sub par. Our waitress wasn't particularly rude, but she just wasn't very nice or attentive either. The food was amazing though. I ordered the cheesesteak, while my gf ordered the market summer salad. The salad was huge, beautiful, and delicious. The cheesesteak was arguably one of the best I've ever had. The cheese sauce alone was to die for. I'd love to come back here again during my next day trip to Philly.The brussel sprouts starter was really good. Other than that, ALL of the food we ordered was so so bland... except for the tomato soup which tasted like an entire container of pepper mixed with tomato sauce. Definitely need to adjust their seasonings. The drinks were not strong at all. Our Sweet Tea Vodka tasted like pure iced tea.Walked all over the market to find a good cheesesteak. Some places looked like they had a good one, but the price was just more than I wanted to pay. They know they have you, so they'll charge you more. I usually to go to Mama Angenlina's next to the Doubletree, but I didn't want to walk there in the snow.
Other places didn't have fries, and I was really in the mood to choke up my arteries with a cheesesteak and fries. So I finally decided to give this place a try. I sat at the bar and got great service. 
The food was ready quick, and when it arrived, I thought I was going to regret my choice. The sandwich arrived with a gloppy white cheese slathered on the meat. I gave it a try and was quite impressed. It's apparently a mixture of cheeses made on site. The meat was rib eye, so a higher quality. The sandwich wasn't huge, so one with a side of fries was a perfect meal.
All the food I could see looked great and I heard others at the bar talk about how good things were.
I would eat here again, but with so many dining options at this terminal, it may be a while, as I'd like to try other things, as well.Best Bloody Mary I have had in a while! Didn't get food but the food that I saw come out looked very good!Not bad for reading terminal I can't remember the las time I had eggs that fresh!! I had the jalapeño omelet they could stand some not jalapeños, other than that I was happy with my breakfast and waitress.Located in Reading Terminal, I naturally thought I'd be able to grab food and sit wherever. However, they're one of the few and only places in Reading that requires you to eat within their bounds. It makes for an odd experience at the Terminal.
However, I ordered their Butternut Squash soup and it was delicious. They even plopped in some candied pecans and swirled in what I believe was brown sugar. 
If you want the true Reading Terminal experience, don't go to Molly Malloy's; however, the food I've had thus far was great and what I saw my friends eat looked delicious as well.I love Reading Terminal -- it's one of my favorite places to visit in Philly. I've lived in Chinatown for a few years now and am pleasantly surprised I never ate here! I met up with some friends for brunch and it was a great experience! I loved being in the heart of the market while having our own little corner of privacy as well. I got the farmer's platter with eggs over easy, wheat toast, turkey bacon and hash. The meal was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash was delicious. The bacon wasn't over cooked or burnt and that's exactly how I liked it. We also enjoyed a few rounds of the mimosas -- some of the best I've had in this city! Made with fresh orange juice, they weren't too sweet at all and were only $7 each (I've paid almost double at other places for mimosas that weren't as good). Our waitress was so friendly and attentive and had an amazing playlist going on! Hearing "Your song" and "dancing queen" while enjoying good food, drinks, and conversation, was a thoroughly great way to spend a Saturday morning. They also have a bar area and TVs about if you're interested in keeping up with any games!Over 20 minutes for a soupy omelette in a cardboard box next to some cold oatmeal, I'm done with this placeA Fan! I had the surf and turf sliders and loved the fact that i can have 2 different types of sliders to eat. Crab cake one was so so good,and the filet mignon one was cooked to perfection. Small portion (for my big appetite) since its one slider each, but worth it for the taste. We had the special market salad which was super fresh and VERY BIG, we were able to share it with 4 people as an appetizer.. Definitely get the sweet potato fries, they were awesome. It's  in the market, so expect an open feel market style eating. Large selection of beers too!Inside Reading Market go enjoy there selection of draft beers. Lydsey's Service was just Great, would go back just for the Quality service.I really enjoyed this place. So did the ladies I was eating with. It is I side the Reading Terminal Market. This was my first time in Philadelphia so I was looking for authentic food and experiences. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak. It was served on a hoagie with caramelized onions and peppers. They put a mild white cheddar war, melted cheese sauce on it over shaved ribeye. It comes with homemade potato n beet chips. You can get fried for a dollar extra which I did. I was able to try the chips my friend order with her grilled cheese. That is actually her grilled cheese on my check in photo. I will visit again next time I'm here. I had two IPA beers, that paired perfectly with my meal. There are a lot of beer selections. Our server was very attentive. I look forward to coming back again.Really enjoyed this place. Was seated right away, staff was attentive, great beer selection and the food was delicious. 
We had. Chips & guacamole, the guacamole was fresh with lime and cilantro you could taste. My Green Apple Stacked Salad was scrumptious!! Served in a appropriate bowl (I dislike when I am served salad on a plate) the candied pecans with bacon....YUM!!!
The chicken pot pie had large chunks of chicken. Would definitely go back here to eat.We were in Philly for the weekend, and hit Reading Market yesterday morning for breakfast and to grab some cookies and local items prior to traveling back home to CT.  I ordered the eggs, toast, home fries, sausage breakfast combo here.  The eggs were totally and completely raw!  They looked like slime.  Can you say Salmonella!!!????  
The home fries with yellow peppers and onions and the turkey sausage were the saving grace of my breakfast.  A good marbled rye toast was good as well.   A word to the wise, order your eggs well done from this place and you will hopefully not be disappointed paying $11 for breakfast.Staying at the Marriott across from Reading Terminal Market (love this hotel) and had a late lunch with my husband and two young boys at Molly Malloy's.  Totally doable with normal kids.  If your kids are not restaurant savvy, don't bother.  It is not cramped, but not spacious.  No kids menu, but the boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins are terrific.  My boys (10&11) enjoyed them.  Their BBQ (thin) sauce is tasty and doesn't ring of supermarket bottle brands.  They both loved it.  No honey mustard for dipping, but the salad Dijon dressing was a great substitute.  My husband loves fish and chips and these were not the usual slab of cod in three inches of fried beer batter.  They were delicate and lite.  Service is fantastic and the staff is to be commended for their friendly prompt delivery.  They were everything we needed after a long day of fun in the city of brotherly love!  My son wants me to tell you the fries with the skin on were very yummy.  And the grilled asparagus platter was just like home cooked goodness.I noticed that it's a seat yourself place. My server ended up laughing at me as she watched me circle the tables a few times trying to find the perfect seat. She was very sweet and patient with helping me figure out a custom cocktail. Even better was the hot bartender bringing me the drink. I ordered the burger. It shocked me they didn't have mayo but then again the burger didn't need it at all. It was exactly what I asked for. A medium well burger with a side of really good fries. The garlic aoli was a nice addition. You can tell Mollys takes pride in their food and staff. They actually look happy to be working.I had an amazing lamb burger right at the end of the day. A great place for a quick bit.This place makes good food, and deserves every bit of 4 stars. Probably 4 and a half. 
Went here Saturday. GF got the chicken pot pie. We had seen it before while here drinking, and had trying their pot pie on our to-do list. It was delicious. Nice crust, lots of chicken meat, very tasty filling. Excellent.
I got a cheeseburger. It was superb. One of the best burgers I ever had. Char-broiled taste was great. It came with tasty house-cut fries. GF couldn't stop picking at them.
We come here all the time for drinks while we're at the market. We'll definitely come back to eat. 
The only drawback is that they're only open while the market is, so hours are limited. Well worth it though.Deep inside the market is this cool pub. Very good local beer menu with some really nice pub food selections. We weren't looking for a full meal so I got a bowl of stew that was on the app list. It was huge and could have been a full meal. Debbie got the special with PB&J with bacon!  Pretty tasty but then isn't everything with bacon?  A solid choice but I think there is so many choice in the market that this was your average pub and and fare.Simply delicious fresh food. I had the farmers plate with bacon, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the bacon was off the hook. Staff is friendly and on top of their game.
Well done thank you for the experienceThis place was the best! My dad and I came to Philly for an ATLUTD game and stopped in the Reading Terminal Market and found this place by accident.  The people were super super sweet, food came out fast but man the people working here were INCREDIBLE.  We had annabell as our waitress and she was honestly the best waitress I've ever had in my LIFE.  The food was top notch.  Would recommend to anyone, coming back for breakfast again in the morning.  :)Visited RTM for the first time for breakfast and after wandering the seemingly endless aisles finally decided Molly Malloy's seemed like a good option.
I've never been more right in my life. 
The french toast was literally the best french toast I've ever had in my life. It did not disappoint. I will absolutely be returning just to have this masterpiece again.Reading Terminal's best breakfast joint.  They do lunch very well too.  You might take a while deciding what to order as everything on the menu looks good.  But be sure to try the French onion soup.  It's one of the best you'll get to try.  Service is quick and friendly.  The bar is a nice addition with an expansive beer selection.  There are other diner style joints in the market but none in my opinion does a better job at offering a wide variety of items on the menu.  The only reason I took a star off is because today's visit was somewhat of a miss.  The cheese on my usual French onion soup came out sunken at the bottom of the crock.  It usually covers the soup and bread perfectly melted.  My pot roast sandwich was very drippy and it wasn't au jus, but grease.  The salad it came with was barely dressed.  The macaroni and cheese was not hot enough.  The lemon with my iced tea was brown.  Despite it all, I will probably end up coming back and hope for better.Ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. It was neither good or bad. The Cheesesteak was a little over $10 but it did feel fresh and not stale. It comes with some french fries, which was alright. I was not too excited from the French fries. 
The service was fairly attentive. I drank alot of water and the waitress periodically came to refill our glasses. Overall, I felt it's a typical bar type environment without much depth or diversity. I'll go again if my friends suggest it but not my own decision.Safe, creative food. One of the few places you can find to sit down in the terminal. Great asparagus, the grilled cheese sandwich is totally different. Good, but I would probably want to try something else if I go back. And I would go back. However, there really are so many things to try in the terminal that if they didn't have seating, I might not have tried it in the first place. Worth at least one try.This place is located inside Reading Terminal Market. Molly Malloy's is a great bar, casual atmosphere and great drink specials. We had the Honeycrisp Apple Sangria. Delicious and only $5. They have great drink specials from 4p-6p. 
We only had drinks but they also serve food.Very solid addition to Reading Terminal Market. Love the variety, the local stuff, early hours and the layout. I am not as impressed by the food. I am vegan and there seems to be little there for me.To start off when you walk in the restaurant is usually very crowded .. The menu is small but everything looks very good. The servers are all nice but they are busy waiting on many tables .. I ordered baked mac and cheese :) and French fries while others ordered pumpkin soup and chicken pot pie , calamari, carmlized onion soup  .. When the food came out it all looked amazing .. Like it came out of a magazine .. The soups were pretty good except for the onion soup the broth was good but there was so much bread and cheese inside it really ruined the taste  .. The Mac and cheese was decent  cheese was good but the pasta sauce was not amazing what the main point is the food was lacking flavor needed to put salt and pepper on everything .. The Mac and cheese as I said look good but had a different taste which can be good but in this case wasn't amazing .. The pot pie again need lots of salt and pepper and the calamari some was cooked but the other was a baby squid not chopped up or anything just fried ..  Would I come here again most likely not but give it a try for yourself to see what you like .this place has to serve the smallest "pint" in the city. it just may be a different glass, but it seemed smaller than any pint i've ever had in my hand before. 
a guinness glass is standard issue. i'll be back, and i'll measure and update this review. in the meantime, beware.I did not know this place existed in the Reading Terminal. We head over to this place for lunch and many of us, my co-workers and myself found ourselves here the first time. I had their Wedge Salad and it was really good. Too bad the Happy Hours only lasted to 6 pm otherwise it will be a great Happy Hour hangout for us!This is one of the sit down restaurants in the Reading Terminal.  It was a light traffic day due to snow, so no waiting.  Seemed like a lot of staff running around with not much to do.  Food looked good and in general, it was.  I had one of the many draft beer items you can choose from on an extensive menu.  For lunch, I choose the tomato soup.  It surely was homemade and excellent in a small crock.  I could have had a bigger bowl of that for sure.  I tried the guac BLT - wholegrain break, with guacamole and a nice jalapeno kicker cooked into the traditional BLT.  Very tasty.  I wanted to try the ROOT chips, which looked also to be homemade.  I must have got the end of the lot, as these looked like one of those giant bags of chips you get and when you are at the bottom all you get are the chips of the chips, so noting to write home about these.  Costs an extra $1 for fries, which I didn't want.  Ask them to make sure they actually give you chips and not a pile of crumbs.  They take all credit cards.  So many choices in the terminal, would consider this place for the seating, and other menu items, but not a total home run.Great beer selections.  Great bar food too, everything is fried to perfection, especially the fish & chips. The chicken pot pie was delicious. Service was also great, definitely worth a trip if you're in the Reading Terminal.Decent beer selection, located in the back of Reading Terminal. It's usually super loud and packed. I've been 2-3 times and sat at the bar, and the bartenders have always been a little rude. I know they are rushed, but just not my style. They are fine if you want a quick break during your shopping, but not worth going out of your way for.I used to live two blocks from the terminal, my best friend and I always forgot there was a beer garden within the space and when we would remember we'd promise to come back when there weren't old men sitting in the dark secluded spot. It just seemed so out of place and not the kind of drinking den that we might typically enjoy. Now that I don't live as close, I wish that I did again....Molly Malloy's has totally upgraded this space into an awesome oasis in the middle of the foodie's oasis that is the market. A giant 3-sided bar sits at one end of the space while the rest is made up of high bar tables around the perimeter and lower tables taking up the rest of the floor. When crowded it can feel cramped, but because of it's open-air nature it never feels unbearably claustrophobic.
Food prices? Completely justified. Safe to say much of the menu is in the $10 range with some items below and some above, regardless you're not doling out tons of cash to enjoy a quality meal. One dining companion ordered a burger that he said was really enjoyable though cooked more than he had originally asked, we think this was due to the fact that my other friend made a last minute switch in canceling his burger for a grilled cheese. With one canceled medium well and one lingering medium rare, it seemed that the wrong done-ness was nixed from the order. Regardless he didn't speak much while consuming his lunch, so I'm guessing it was still really good.
After my boys had placed their order for lunch it was all on me, I was so torn, do I get the burger? Do I get the grilled cheese? Decisions decisions that I left in the hands of our server Kevin. "Kevin, what do I get?" to which he replied that the grilled cheese was hands down the winner and that he had in fact eaten one for lunch earlier. So with Kevin's gusto for the grilled cheese I went ahead and settled on my sammie. Now, when they call this sandwich "Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese", they're so not F*ing kidding. Forget the days of buttered bread toasted in a pan to melt your only so-so american cheese....no....no no....I may abstain from all other grilled cheese because one bite into this brioche bunned sandwich and it's a whole goat cheese spinach explosion in your mouth. I actually did not feel the least bit badly about my hot gooey cheesey decision solely because of the amount of spinach on this bad boy. In my palatable opinion, the fennel and onion jam were a little lost on this sandwich...if the flavors were a bit more pronounced I may have had a When Harry Met Sally restaurant moment, for that it's probably better that it stay an understated compliment. I can't say for certain that my grilled cheese co-orderer felt the same way about his sandwich, but if the fact that he inhaled his in in a matter of minutes is any indicator I'd say it was a two-thumbs up on the consumption scale. 
I am so happy that the space that is Molly Malloy's is now being used in such a constructive fashion, it brightens up and airs out the sometimes neglected by myself back area of the marketplace and turns out some stellar pub grub. Will I be back? Absolutely...they accept LevelUp as payment which means I have a credit that is burning a whole in my iPhone. So who's in...who wants to squire me to MMs for a grilled cheese?The breakfast was very good here.  We got the farmers breakfast and the flavor was very good.  The marble eye toast was so good.Great place for breakfast.  I chose the make your own omelette and went crazy.  Bacon, blue cheese, mushrooms and caramelized onions? Yes! Delicious!  Is it expensive? Yes, but it's totally worth the price.Molly Malloy's has a great atmosphere and is located in the Reading Market. We had breakfast and the portion sizes are very generous. The staff was very friendly and offered good service. There is a bar in the restaurant and I think this would be a very popular lunch and happy hour spot.The bread pudding and little cream/fruit tarts were delicious.  That was all we tried, but would go back.  The girl that waited on us was friendly and funny as well!Amazing food super friendly people. This was my first time eating here.Do not overlook Molly M's for breakfast!  My husband and I both love the omelets here. Hearty portions that don't disappoint. They usually offer tasty seasonal jams to go with your toast and offer a variety of sides to mix and match with your omelet. We usually always have a doggie bag to take home with us and enjoy their rich cups of coffee. 
Food 5/5
Price 5/5
Service 4/5
Atmosphere 4/5I was planning on getting some Thai food and sitting in the food court at the Reading Terminal Market, but there was no seating. So, a table for four was open here. We had two Philly cheesesteaks and two hamburgers. (4 of us) Everyone was very happy with their meal. The burger was amazing. Slightly sweet with caramelized onions, cooked perfectly with applewood bacon. Chips and fries-you can't go wrong either way. We had a Bloody Mary, Golden Monkey beer, and a User Friendly beer. All really good. The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the beer and food and seemed patient even though it was crowded. I would definitely come back.Haven't been to Philly in a decade and staying in Center City less than half a block from Redding Terminal Market.  Wasn't sure where to eat so I wandered around the market until I saw the bar at Molly's.  Service was quick and had some great suggestions on food.  I've done the cheesesteak thing before so I opted for her chicken pot pie recommendation.  It came out steaming hot.  The crust was golden brown and cooked perfectly.  The filling was shredded chicken with peas and carrots.  The sauce was creamy and light.  However it was under seasoned but despite that, I would recommend it.Finally a place with fresh homemade fried mozzarella! Huge serving and with my first bite the oh so gooey cheese melted in my mouth! And they weren't greasy for being fried! Our bartender was super friendly! Nice spot for a break when shopping. They even serve breakfast. The beer selection is quite robust. Definitely will be back!Healthy great breakfast alternative - Avocado Toast with egg and bacon. Delicious. And service was great by Lindsey. Better than the hotel breakfast optionsVisiting Philadelphia and had to stop in to the Reading Terminal Market for the smells, sights, sounds and food and drink!  After making the circuit once, we decided that Molly Malloy's would "hit the spot"!  We found a seat at the bar and promptly ordered drinks.  The service was great, and the ambiance friendly and full of bustle.  The Philadelphia Flower Show started that day, so there quite a few patrons getting a refreshing beverage.  I ordered The All American cheeseburger medium and my fiance' ordered the Fried Polenta.  The burger is impressive (see photo) and was delicious!  The patty was hand formed and the bun covered with butter and toasted.  French fries were crisp and hot!  The plate was so impressive that a patron across the bar ordered "I'll have one of those" and pointed to my dish!  The fried polenta had nice texture and was complimented well with the blue cheese sauce.  Hit up Molly Malloy's if you can't decide where to eat!I'm no Philly boy, but this Philly Cheesesteak though... YUM!!! Best I've ever had. And those in-house made chips, SO GOOD!!!
I got a sour beer, a Philly Cheesesteak, and a grilled veggie sandwich (yes it's an odd combo, I'm an odd guy... and yes it's a lot of food... I run sometimes). It seems like these folks just can't mess anything up! Even the service was superb. 
I spent four days in Philly, and this was the best meal I had there. Definitely will go back when I'm up there again!Great food and excellent customer service!! Food arrived late and the manager cut the bill in half and provided free round of drinks.  Had a great first time, will be coming back! The "not your mamas grilled cheese" was delicious!!Always a fan of reading terminal market in Philly. Have been to Molly Malloy's a few times after a long night for brunch. Great spot to grab food or to cure a hangover. Grab a delicious Beer Mosa and a chicken pot pie and you are set! The Pot Pie is the best I've ever had!!A great spot to escape the madness of Reading Terminal Market with shoppers pushing their way through. I clearly don't mind just sitting at the bar and just people watch, scope out the tourists while getting a cold one . Plus what other place do you know that has a bar,  that serves great food located inside a market?
 Molly's has some great  crafts in constant rotation for those beer aficionados out there. If you think about it you're in a foodies paradise, why not enjoy a liabtion or two with 20+ crafts to choose from.  I know the libation gods would approve, if not that the liqour selctions are top knotch.  Who wants the same old same old? I know I don't. 
Molly's has nice sized bar with ample seating aligning the the area ,with plenty of TVs for your viewing pleasures. Good ample seating inside and out of the bar area with tables in case the bar is jammed up. Danielle is a great bartender with a great attitude.  Danielle along with her co-workers , interact with the patrons who sit at the bar. Great attitude like I said earlier , plus they have a great staff all around.      
A great spot to go to also grab something to eat. I know you are in Reading Terminal, and yes this is a foodies paradise, and yes the options are endless. Molly's has a great breakfast you could go with if you wanted a Mimosa to back it up. I did just say Mimosa and yes again , I went with one with my great breakfast.  Mind you the menu does look great with the other dishes they offer.  
I rocked out their french toast and a side of spicy bacon hash on a skillet. This is probably the best thing to order if you were to do a breakfast. The french toast was PHENOMENAL!!!  with nice thick slices with a little side of blueberries added to the plate.  The spicy bacon hash was another great dish, with an egg sunny side up laying over top placed in a skillet. The bacon was cooked just right, we all know what just right is.  If you don't know what it is, go there and order it. 
Another great spot to be enjoyed at Reading Terminal !  Go ahead break away from everything, grab a libation, take a break from it all. I know I'll be here more often.First of all I would like to start this review by saying we were in the wrong line to be seated which was by no fault of ours! There was an order and take out line and to be seated nowhere did it diferenciate the two. So while standing in the they switch from breakfast to lunch on us. By the way it wasn't 11am yet and that was when it switches!!! Finally we figure it out and get seated fairly quickly! We mention that they switched the menu on us and that we had wanted breakfast and we were still not able to get breakfast! We pick new menu options and order. We get wings they were good. We order 2 other items one of which when I put my fork in to start to eat a 2 inch long hair comes back up with my fork! Mind you it was a pot pie so I'm a little grossed out at this point. I call the waitress over and tell her quietly so other patrons would not hear! She asks if I'd like a new one. I didn't wanna risk it and it kind of turned my stomach. So I order a bacon  sandwich with arugala. The entire sandwich consisted of 1 piece of bacon split in half on each side tomato and enough arugala to feed Peter and his sisters! I was hungry at this point so I'm like I'm just going to eat it. Much to my dismay it was not good!!!! I ate a half and left the rest. My husband has already completed his meal by the time my sandwich comes out. So much for lunch together! They did take the hairy meal off the bill but did not offer to cover the sandwich price or any type of compensation for what had happened. My husbands meal was okay but we would not recommend this place!I treated a friend to lunch at Molly's last Thursday. The service staff was friendly and engaging from the moment we walked in and sat down. We were invited to sit wherever we wanted which was nice. I think that was because they had just started serving lunch. I was looking at the breakfast menu after we sat down and our server, Alicia, politely informed us that breakfast was no longer being served. That can wait for another time.
I ordered the calamari appetizer to share and my guest ordered the regular cheese steak of sliced ribeye and american cheese while I chose the portabella "cheese steak" of kennett square mushrooms, sauteed peppers and a delicious cheese sauce with add-ons of caramelized onions and sauteed spinach. The add-ons were 50 cents and a dollar respectively. Not bad at all and they really added to what turned out to be a great sandwich. We both enjoyed our selections. The calamari was crunchy without being overly cooked and rubbery with a nice parsley-flecked marinara sauce on the side. My friend had a regular unsweetened Iced tea and I had a glass of California Merlot. 
Alicia, our server, was competent and alert while remaining polite and professional. She kept things moving nicely regarding the pace of the meal and we were out of there in about an hour and fifteen minutes only because we dwelled for a bit to soak in the Reading Terminal Market atmosphere. As we were exiting the restaurant other staff members said so long to us which I though was very nice. many times in a restaurant if a person does not swerve you directly they will not engage with you which is unfortunate as far as achieving ultimate hospitality goes. All in all the staff was professional and friendly without being cloying and phony. The experience overall was efficient and enjoyable and I can definitely see myself returning for breakfast and lunch on numerous occasions. Thank you to all at Molly Malloys for a great lunch experience!Was crazy packed at noon today on Good Friday but managed to get 2 seats at the bar.  Had the vegetable panini and it was very tasty and well prepared.  Tried two different types of wheat beer and they were very good also.My husband and I were at the Flower Show this past weekend.  We read the reviews on Molly Malloy's in the Reading Terminal Market and decided to give it a shot.  It was undeniably very crowded.  However, the hostess was friendly and attentive and we were sat shortly.  Let me just say, this was a great find all around.  I had the spinach salad with grilled chicken and cranberries.  It was absolutely fresh and delicious.  My husband had the fish and chips which he thoroughly enjoyed.  To top off the meal we had excellent service by our wonderful waitress. Great craft cocktails didn't hurt either!  Would highly recommend anyone visiting the Reading Terminal market to eat here.  Thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Keep up the good work!!Great experience in Redding Terminal Market! So many options from fun to fancy! 
To start, small menu which I appreciate because I can never make a decision!  
The drinks: we started with a cucumber mojito which was delicious and smooth! Fresh cucumber taste complimented the rum perfectly! I had the grapefruit drink which had bourbon with grapefruit and thyme! Definitely my favorite drink i had in Philadelphia... and I had a bunch!!! This drink was perfect from the hints of thyme to the not overly sweet of the grapefruit! Impressed! 
We both got the tomato basil soup with the not your grandma's grilled cheese! 
The soup was flavored well with the perfect amount of basil. 
Not your grandma's grilled cheese! Grilled with Brie and onion jam with some greens! Great combo, perfect first bite! I will say that as amazing as the sandwich I would get it to split with someone! It is so good but also so bold with flavor that half was good enough for me!
I'd say this place is worth a stop!!!I love this place! I love the food! I love the people that work here! I love the cold beer! Sooooo today I'm having the chicken pot pie and the flaky crust is ridiculously delicious OMG! I've had their burger, the quac but, the French onion soup, chicken fingers, root chips and it's just ALL GOOD!We didn't eat, but the beer selection was great. Service was a tad aloof, we (and others) had to wait for some acknowledgement (at a bar of 6 guests, tops) to ask for menus, or the next round of beers, etc. Once you got the bartender's attention though, the beers came right up. I wouldn't really call it "friendly" service, but it's ok.
