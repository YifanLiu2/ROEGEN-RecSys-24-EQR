Haikou (海口 Hǎikǒu) is the provincial capital of Hainan Province in southern China and is at the north end of the Hainan Island. Haikou is a tropical coastal city that, as one of the least developed provincial capitals, has a somewhat laid-back atmosphere.
Its population consists mostly of immigrants from other provinces, and many development projects are in progress.
Many streets in Haikou are quite different during the day than in the evening. You will soon notice the abundance of coconut trees in Haikou. Most streets are lined with them. It is greener than most Chinese cities and has decent air quality.
The downtown does not have many tourist attractions and the water in its only beach area is murky but as a transport hub, it can serve a base for traveling to some cities on the north of Hainan.
Haikou is a transport hub with flights to many cities and boats to nearby mainland cities such as Beihai and Zhanjiang.
Haikou Meilan International Airport (海口美兰国际机场 HAK IATA), Lingshan Town, Meilan District (美兰区灵山镇), ☏ +86 898 65760114. The airport has two terminals, Terminals 1 and 2. Terminal 1 serves only domestic flights while Terminal 2 handles both domestic and international flights. A free shuttle bus service conveys passengers between the two terminals. (updated Mar 2019)
Haikou is the main hub of Hainan Airlines, which has domestic flights from many cities in Mainland China and from some international destinations such as Hong Kong, Macau, Bangkok, Singapore, London (via Changsha), Sydney, and Melbourne. In addition, Haikou is well-served by other Chinese airlines, particularly China Southern Airlines.
There are also international flights from Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong Airlines, Singapore on Scoot, Kuala Lumpur on Batik Air Malaysia, and Phnom Penh on Cambodia Angkor Air.
There is a train link between Haikou and Guangdong province (the trains are loaded onto ferries to cross the strait). So you can get the train from Guangzhou to Haikou. Some of these trains actually finish in Sanya. There are scheduled services from Beijing West (via Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Changsha and Guangzhou), Changchun (via Shenyang North, Tianjin, Nanchang and Guangzhou), Harbin West (via Changchun, Shenyang North, Nanchang and Guangzhou), Shanghai South (via Hangzhou South and Guangzhou) and Xinxiang (via Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Changsha and Guilin North). These services use only regular-speed trains. The nearest high-speed train station on the mainland is in Zhanjiang, which is about 3 hours by high-speed train from Guangzhou. From the Zhanjiang HSR station, you can take either a train or a bus to Haikou. If you're coming from Southwest China, however, you may want to consider getting a high-speed train to Beihai, then taking a ferry to Haikou from there. Cities such as Chongqing, Guiyang, and Kunming all have high-speed train services to Beihai but not to Zhanjiang (though there are some slow trains to Zhanjiang from those cities).
A high-speed railway connects the major towns on the east and west coasts of Hainan. It takes 1½–2 hours from Sanya to Haikou. The trains also serve the airports in both Haikou and Sanya. Other stops on the line include Wenchang, Qionghai, Bo'ao, Wanning, Lingshui, Ledong, Dongfang, Baimajing, Lingao, Fushan and Laocheng.
Haikou has three major railway stations, including the airport station. There are also several minor stations, which are served only by suburban trains.
Haikou Railway Station (海口站, Haikou Station), Yue Hai Avenue, Xiuying District (秀英区粤海大道) (in Haikou's far western suburbs, close to the border with Chengmai County; accessible via bus nos. 35, 37, 40 and 57).

Haikou East Railway Station (海口东站, Haikou East Station), Fengxiang Road West, Longhua District (龙华区凤翔西路) (served by local bus routes 11, 21, 35, 38, 49, 53, 56, 59, 74, 86, 86 Express, 89, 98, 208, K1, Night bus 1 and Night bus 3; the station is directly opposite Haikou's main long-distance bus station). Due to its much more central location compared with Haikou Station, this station tends to be more popular with passengers travelling on Hainan's HSR line. However, if travelling from the mainland, you must change trains at Haikou Station. (updated Jul 2019)
Buses connect Haikou to many cities on the Chinese mainland, including Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guilin, and Nanning. Most buses are overnight sleepers. Buses are loaded on to ferries and arrive in Haikou at either New Port or Xiuying Port. Here are a few examples of journey duration and price (as of July 2023):
From Guangzhou ( to 12 hours) ¥190-210
From Guilin (10 hours) ¥328
From Shenzhen (18 to 30 hours) ¥260-310

Bus stations can also be found at the airport and the two ferry terminals.
There are frequent daily ferries between Haikou and Xuwen. The journey time and fare varies according to which ferry terminal you choose to depart from. A new ferry terminal opened at Xuwen Port (徐闻港) in October 2020. Ferries from Xuwen Port to Haikou's New Port take around 60 minutes. You can also still catch a ferry from Xuwen's old ferry terminal at Hai'an New Port (海安新港). Ferries from Hai'an New Port to Haikou's Xiuying Port take about 90 minutes. The fare for both ferries is ¥. There are bus connections from Xuwen to other cities, but the options are limited compared to Haikou, especially in the evening.
There are daily Haikou-Beihai ferries, leaving Beihai at 17:00, taking around 12 hours and costing between ¥160-400 per person, depending on class (there are 5 different classes). For those of you traveling in China by bicycle, you can also take your bike on the ferry for an additional ¥20.
Travellers should bear in mind that it's quite common for ferries to be cancelled due to bad weather. This can occur both during the summer (due to storms and typhoons) and during the winter (due to heavy fog). If it happens during a major holiday period such as the Spring Festival, you can expect insane traffic jams and extremely large queues outside the ferry terminals when services finally resume. Hopefully the new ferry terminal in Xuwen will help to alleviate such problems in the future.
Haikou New Port (海口新海港), Tianxiang Road, Xiuying District (秀英区天翔路) (about 5km north of Haikou Railway Station; bus routes 6 (Express), 28, 28 (Express), 80, 84, 86, Sightseeing Bus 1, and Night Bus 4). (updated Oct 2020)

There are five main forms of public transportation in Haikou:
Taxi which is the most expensive option. They are easily hailed everywhere in the city. The meter starts at ¥10, but it is customary to bargain before you get on, and a typical fare for a shorter trip is ¥15. The taxi from the airport is half an hour to the city centre. On arrival you will have a familiar experience in China of a number of drivers shouting taxi at you. These are illegal taxis, and you risk at least paying extra for your journey by taking these. Instead, walk out of the terminal building and you will see a line of licensed taxis. Before departing, insist on using the meter (dabiao) even if they are reluctant to do so. It should cost ¥50-60 to the city centre.
Buses are very inexpensive, but you need to know the routes. If you choose to get the bus from the airport, show the address of your hotel to the attendant who will show you the bus that will take you closest. There is an airport shuttle that cost ¥15 per person from airport to Home Inn (formerly Civil Aviation Hotel) at Haixiu Avenue in downtown Haikou.
Commuter trains run in an east-west direction along Hainan's high-speed railway line. Stops include Haikou Railway Station, Changliu, Xiuying, Chengxi, Haikou East Railway Station and Haikou Meilan International Airport. Since there's only one line and not many stations on the route, these trains are mainly useful for getting to the airport and the two major railway stations. Ticket prices are between ¥2 and ¥10.
Motorbike taxis are mostly electric and you can get anywhere within the city for ¥5-10.
Additionally you may also rent a bicycle or an electric scooter. Haikou is very bike friendly, with wide side ways for both bikes and scooters. The riverside road 滨江路, for instance, is equipped with a beautiful car free biking and running path all along the river. Additionally, Haikou is also a major starting point for long-distance traveling on bicycles around the island of Hainan.
