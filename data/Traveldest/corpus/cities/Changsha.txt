Changsha has an urban population of over 10 million people (2022). Mao Zedong lived and worked as a teacher in Changsha, and it was the site of his conversion to communism. A huge sculpture of Mao's head on Orange Island reminds everyone of his connection to the city.
Known among the Chinese for being the site of the Battle of Changsha, which was the first major victory the Chinese scored against the Japanese during World War II. The city however, suffered from major damage from the war after it was set on fire by Kuomintang officials in 1938, planning to implement scorched earth policy should Japanese forces invade. In particular, most historical relics were obliterated during the fire and 4 Japanese campaign against the city.
Changsha has a history of more than 2,000 years of urban construction on the original site. The name "Changsha" was first seen in the "Book of Yizhou" in the pre-Qin period. Changsha County was established in the Qin Dynasty, and the Changsha Kingdom was established in the Western Han Dynasty. The Mawangdui Han Tomb is world-famous. The Changsha kiln in the Tang Dynasty was the first to create underglaze colored porcelain, which was exported to countries all over the world.

Taiping Old Street on a crowded Sunday
When eating in Changsha there is nothing better than a plate of stinky tofu (臭豆腐 chou doufu), butter pancake (酥油并 suyoubing) or mini lobster (口味虾) bought right off the street. If you have just arrived, be wary of eating from street vendors. Although the inviting aroma of food cooking may be too tempting to resist, you had better have a strong stomach if you do not want to get an upset one.
Changsha food is part of the broader Hunanese cuisine (湘菜 xiang cai), one of China's traditional eight great regional cuisines. Traditional Hunan foods are quite spicy like Sichuan cuisine, but without the unique numbing sensation that comes with Sichuan peppercorns. In summer, oversized metal mixing bowls filled with crawfish seasoned with plenty of chili and spices, take the stage atop countless tabletops. Restaurants get so busy and overcrowded that tables, chairs along with diners spill into the busy streets and the parade of tantalizing dishes endlessly leave the kitchen to appear on the tables of hungry diners.
Stinky Tofu. Stinky tofu is a classic traditional snack in Changsha. It is recommended to go to Black Classic to buy the most authentic stinky tofu.
