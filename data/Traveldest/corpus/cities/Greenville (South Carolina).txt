Main Street in Downtown Greenville.
Greenville has been described as Athens, Georgia for adults. It is the county seat and largest city of Greenville County, South Carolina, United States. Greenville is also the center of the largest metropolitan area of South Carolina. Columbia, Charleston, and North Charleston have more people, but the urban area around Greenville is larger. With its historic homes and modern office towers, Greenville is said to be where "Old South" meets "New South".
Greenville is the primary city of "the Upstate" of South Carolina, an area that includes the six counties of northwestern South Carolina along the borders of North Carolina and Georgia. It is the principal city of the Greenville-Anderson-Mauldin Metropolitan Statistical Area (2018 estimated population: 906,626) which is included in the greater Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson Combined Statistical Area (population 1,478,658 according to 2018 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau). Greenville County is both the most populous and most dense in the state at 407,383, but because its city limits enclose less than 30 square miles, the population of the city is 67,453 (2015 estimate). Perhaps a more accurate representation of Greenville's size is the urbanized area, which includes all of the city plus adjacent unincorporated areas and some suburbs that have a high population density — this figure is 302,194 (2015 estimate).
