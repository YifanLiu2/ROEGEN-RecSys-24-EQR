For other places with the same name, see Cranbrook (disambiguation).
Cranbrook is a city of approximately 20,000 (2016) (26,000 in the area) that is the primary administrative and commercial center for the Kootenay region in the southeastern corner of British Columbia, Canada. It serves the surrounding area of over 82,000 people.
The area was inhabited by Ktunaxa peoples. The land that Cranbrook now occupies was bought by European settlers, notably Colonel James Baker who named his newly acquired land Cranbrook after his home in Cranbrook, Kent, England.
In 1898, Baker had convinced Canadian Pacific Railway to establish its Crowsnest Pass line through Cranbrook rather than nearby gold rush boom town Fort Steele. Cranbrook became the major centre of the region, while Fort Steele declined; however, the latter is today a preserved heritage town.
