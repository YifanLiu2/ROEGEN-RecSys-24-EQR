Guatemala City is the capital of Guatemala, a country in Central America. With a population of around 3 million people, Guatemala City is the largest and most modern city in Guatemala. It can be interesting to visit "Guate," as it is also called by the locals, or la capital as much of the country calls it. Guatemala City has attractions and restaurants, often with few tourists. Sunday evenings' gatherings of hundreds of locals at the main plaza is certainly an unforgettable experience.
Guatemala City is in the department (territorial division) of Guatemala, and it's the capital of the country. All the main highways start at Kilómetro 0, inside Palacio Nacional de la Cultura (National Palace), in Centro Histórico (Historic Center).
Guatemala City became the capital after Antigua Guatemala had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1773.

Although it holds a repelling reputation for violent crime, Guatemala is also known for its good-natured, friendly citizens.

If you need to change money or withdraw cash from an ATM, do so before exiting customs. There is no currency exchange or ATMs located past customs in international arrivals. You would need to go upstairs to Departures for these services.
There are always taxis at the airport. They operate with fixed prices (around US$12 from the airport to Zona 10) that are 2-3 times higher than what you would pay for the same distance with an ordinary taxi. If your hotel is in Zona 10, chances are high that there is a free shuttle service.
Regular shuttles run to Antigua each day, several times a day from 06:00 to 20:00 (prices US$8–12 per person).
There is also a bus route operating the road that passes the airport that will take you to Zona 10 at around La Reforma and 12 Calle. If you are going to the old city center (Zona 1), many buses go that way from La Reforma or from 7 Avenida that runs in parallel with La Reforma, one block away. The red city buses are not safe due high incidences of crime against the driver and passengers. It is recommended passengers use taxis locally.
Central American highways CA-1 and CA-9 run through Guatemala City.
CA-1 is part of the Pan-American Highway and comes from the border with Mexico near Tapachula through the western highlands. Within the city, CA-1 is first Avenida Roosevelt, then Boulevar Liberacion and then Bulevar Los Proceres. It then becomes Carretera an El Salvador outside of the city and it leads to the Chinamas border with El Salvador.
Being the national transportation hub there are various bus lines going into and out of Guatemala City in all directions, from around the country, and from neighboring countries at varying distances. Most foreigners coming into the country would most likely fly in but it's also possible to travel from various cities in the U.S., through Mexico, to Guatemala City; and from Panama through the Central American isthmus by bus.
The city has four major bus stations based on the compass points. They are:

The city is divided into 21 zones (zonas). Zona 1 is the old historic center. Here are the national palace, the presidential palace, the cathedral, the main plaza, and the Central Market. South of Zona 1 is Zona 4, with many of the official buildings like the national bank, the national theatre, and the tourist board (INGUAT). Farther south is Zona 10 and Zona 9, divided by Avenida La Reforma. Zona 10 hosts most of the high class hotels, restaurants, bars, shopping facilities. A small part of Zona 10 is called Zona Viva (the lively zone) because of its nightlife.
If you walk, make sure to do so accompanied.
Transmetrodead link is Guatemala City's bus rapid transit (BRT) system. The fleet consists of (green) modern buses that have fixed stops and partly run on dedicated lanes, avoiding other traffic. Stops and vehicles are guarded by municipal police. The system has six lines, numbered 1, 2, 6, 12, 13, and 18. Service on each line begins between 04:30 and 17:30, and ends between 20:00 and 22:00. You must pay using a "Citizen's Card", which is available from the machines at each bus stop. It costs Q20, and includes 5 free trips. Subsequent trips are 1Q each (2023). There is also a prepaid bus card system called Transurbano that is being implemented in the metro area.
Transurbano (blue & white) buses provide slower service on more routes. To use this system you have to buy a pre-paid card from special booths, such as in Zona 1's Plaza Barrios, the CentraNorte bus terminal and the Zona 10 TransUrbano office on Av La Reforma. Cash is not accepted on board. It has surveillance cameras, and panic buttons in the units, which communicate directly to police officers.
The old red city buses, los rojos, are hotbeds of violent robbery and extortion, and should only be used in an emergency.
There are two kinds of taxis: the ones with a meter and the ones on which you have to agree on a price before the trip. Of the metered taxis, the best service is given by Taxis Amarillo (yellow cabs). It is not possible to hail them in the street so you have to call 1766. They will demand an address (they can sometimes by quite picky about getting an exact address: look around at nearby houses, and give the correct zona) and normally a telephone number, so it might be wise to have someone call on your behalf from a restaurant or so. With Amarillo, every trip is logged, and riding is considered safe.
The other kind of taxis are white. With these you have to negotiate a price, and as you are a foreigner, they most likely will demand more than the normal fare. Normally, the white taxis should be cheaper, but unless you negotiate well, the yellow taxis might actually be the cheaper choice. It is also the question of safety. There are approximately 800 unlicenced and stolen white taxis circulating the city. If you do find a white taxi who is decent, the driver will be happy to give you a card and pick you up if you call in advance; many locals who can afford the odd taxi have their favorite "taxista" whom they call, and the drivers themselves can refer you to another reliable driver should they be busy. The minimum price for a metered cab ride is Q25.

One thing you should take home with you from Guatemala is the prize-winning rum Ron Zacapa Centenario. If you don't drink, somebody else is bound to be very happy for a bottle of this exquisite rum.

The fancy one everybody passes by on the way to/from the gates and one at the end of the terminal behind Gate 11. The latter one is about 20% cheaper for Ron Zacapa rum. If Ron Zacapa is still too expensive for your taste, you may find a bottle of Indita Aguardiente for Q50 more to your liking. The souvenir shops have some nice things if you need some last minute gifts before you leave the country (a bit more expensive than the markets, but not too bad). The books they sell at the airport are ridiculously expensive, double or triple price of a bookstore.
Visa is the most common credit card for use in ATMs. In the main shopping areas, especially in Zona 10, you should have no trouble finding an ATM that takes Visa.
all 5B atm's in Guatemala take Mastercard but 5B atm's have a fee of Q40 per Q2500.
There is a Visa/MasterCard ATM at the south side of the central plaza 8 Calle 5-36, a Visa-only ATM at 5 Avenida 9-39, and a MasterCard only at the corner of 5 Avenida/11 Calle, all in Zona 1.
ATM key pads can be oriented with the 9 at the top left with the numbers descending right and down, or with the 1 at the top left with numbers ascending. If you have a spatial memory and have memorized the motion of punching in your PIN instead of the actual numerical sequence, you might be in for a surprise!
CitiBank or Citi is found throughout the country. The retail branch in La Antigua Guatemala is a fine place to bank and perform international transactions.
You can find quite an array of American fast food restaurants (McDonald's, KFC, Burger King, Wendy's, etc.) as well as Pollo Campero which is the most popular Guatemalan fast food chain. Fast food restaurants in Guatemala are very clean and accessible only to the middle class.
Though a little risky, there are great street vendors that offer a variety of good local foods. Just remember to scope out the one with the best hygiene. This is the most more local.
Shucos can be found in carts that are usually parked in between "Estadio del Ejercito" and "Campo Marte" zona 5. They are comparable to a super charged hot dog with guacamole, meats such as "longaniza", "chorizo", and bacon. Just make sure you get the one with everything (Con todo).
Mangoes or cucumbers with salt, pepitoria & limón - you can also get sliced fruit such as mangoes with "pepitoria" (roasted, crushed pumpkin seeds), salt, and lemon in a small clear bag. Or sliced oranges from carts all over the city.
Gauchitos are also good cart foods. They are basically a pattie with scrambled egg, "chimichurri" and some dressings on a bun. You can find them in various places throughout the city. One favorite is on the "Mirador" on Carretera an El Salvador. It sits adjacent to Cafesa, diner like restaurant, on an outlook overlooking the city. You can order a "Súper Gauchito", a soda, and sit and admire the hustle and bustle of the city below.
Atol de Elote is a very local and custom drink made from a corn (maize) base. It's somewhat sweet and a drink you must try. It's very rich so if you're not too hungry you can substitute it for a meal. The best place to try it is on the outlook on the other side of the city leaving towards Antigua. Just before you get to San Lucas. Its also another place where you can sit and admire the city from atop a mountain.

This town is historically famous for its pork products, and the best tasting, cleanest, most authentic place around is "La Cabanita" which is a quarter block directly south of the cathedral.

4 Grados Norte. A cultural district in Zona 4 in Guatemala City. It was a project of the municipality to convert this area into an attractive pedestrian area in 2002. Many green areas were created. Today the district also features bars, restaurants, shopping and cultural activities and has become one of the city's trendy and open minded areas, competing with Zona Viva in Zona 10.

Note: Guatemala City remains a dangerous place to visit, with high levels of violent crime and rampant poverty. If you go, be cautious and stay aware of your surroundings. The most dangerous neighborhoods in Guatemala City to stay out of are zones 3, 6, 12, 18, 19, and 21.
(Information last updated 21 Aug 2020)
Guatemala City has a high level of crime. Crimes include carjackings on the road from the airport, robberies and assaults of tourist vans, ordinary buses and cars.
Even though it has a lot of crime, if you stay alert and follow good travel safety practices, you likely won't be exposed to any of it. Make sure you sharpen your street smarts and stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
If you experience a robbery, give away anything the robbers want. Though some would suggest to just stay inside in most places after sunset, at night you can have fun safely in Zona Viva (Zona 10), Zona 14, or 4 Grados Norte.
But despite some of its negative aspects, Guatemala City is the largest Central American capital city, and one of the most beautiful in Latin America, with varied and rich culture. It is important that visitors not return to their hotels too late, and that they don’t walk alone in dark places, but as long as they keep this in mind, they should have a beautiful stay.
Guatemala City is at a somewhat high elevation (about 1500 m) in the mountains (plus the air is very polluted in Zona 1), so if you are coming from a location near sealevel, you might wish to plan to take it easy and get extra rest on your first day while your body adjusts to the altitude.
Also, make sure that any food that you eat is well-washed and well-cooked, or you might get quite ill.

If you have electrical equipment that need 220-240 V 50 Hz input instead of the country's standard 110 V 60 Hz, you can find a transformer at Electronica Panamericana, 3 Avenida y 11 Calle, Esquina, Zona 9. They have various models with prices depending on how much power you require. Q230 for a 500-watt transformer.
Also, in the smaller hotels and motels, the electrical outlets only take 2-pronged plugs. So, if you have a laptop that has a 3-pronged plug for the charger, for example, you'll need a plug adapter that will allow you to use the 2-pronged outlets.
Being the national capital, Guatemala City hosts a lot of embassies. A majority of them are clustered in the areas east and northeast of the airport grounds in Zonas 10 & 14. There are others north of the airport runway in Zona 9 as well.
