Fort Wayne is a city in the northeastern part of Indiana, a state of the United States of America. It is 30 minutes from the western Ohio border and 70 minutes from the southern border of Michigan. With a population of around 260,000 in the city and 615,000 in the metropolitan area, it's Indiana's second largest city.
Fort Wayne is a metropolitan city with a small community feel. It provides the rush of urban activity while never losing an intimate personal connection with those who live or visit here. Fort Wayne is the second largest city in the state of Indiana, located in Allen County, the largest county in the state by geography. It is the regional commerce and industry center for Northeast Indiana and also impacts the economies of Southwestern Michigan and Western Ohio. Fort Wayne has been and is a breeding ground for entrepreneurs and high tech industries.
The city has many historical buildings that usually offer regular tours. The city itself has a long history going back to the 1700s, but has lately succumbed to the urban sprawl so widespread in the Midwest. It is nicknamed the "Summit City" because, even though the surrounding area seems completely flat, it is on the high point of the old Wabash-Erie canal.
