Muscat (Arabic: مسقط Masqaṭ) is the capital of the Sultanate of Oman and its most important and populous city ( million in the metro area in 2021). It has been inhabited since at least 1000 BCE and for centuries was an important trading port on the Maritime Silk Road. It is home to a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society, and receives the largest number of foreign visitors to the country.
Wedged between the Arabian Sea and the rugged Western Hajar Mountains, the city referred to as Muscat is in fact several smaller towns which have grown together over time. These include old Muscat (also known as the 'walled city'), site of the royal palace; Mutrah (also spelled Matrah or Matruh), once a fishing village and home to the labyrinthine Mutrah Souq; and Ruwi, which is the commercial and diplomatic quarter of the city. The metropolitan area covers 3,500 km2, and this tripartite division can be inconvenient for the visitor especially as much accommodation is a fair distance from sights of interest.
Unlike other cities in the Gulf, notably in the UAE and Qatar, Muscat does not have an ultramodern skyline. Following the preferences of the Sultan, modern construction is required to adhere to traditional Arabic architectural styles, resulting in a more low-key urban landscape.

Cruise ships stop regularly at  Port Sultan Qaboos in Mutrah. Shuttle buses transport visitors from the ship to the port entrance, and taxis are also available. A board at the port exit lists fares to the most common destinations; all other destinations must be negotiated first. However, it is a short distance by foot to the Corniche, with the route passing by the fish market (described below under 'See'). Visitors need to bring only their cruise boarding pass and their Tourist Entry Permit.
Route taxi, or 'maxi taxi'
Maxi taxis (minibuses, known throughout the expat community as baisa buses) ply the highway from Seeb to the Corniche area. The charge is RO  (100 Bzs) from the Corniche area to the church roundabout and another 100 Bzs from the church round about to Wadi Adai.
On arrival at the airport, situated approximately 40 km from the main Muscat CBD, you can get a baisa bus down the main highway in either direction.
The (mostly orange and white) taxis are a bit pricier, and they hang around the hotels where they get juicy fares from unwary travellers. They will charge RO 8 for an airport trip if you don't haggle, but you should be able to agree RO 5. They always say they will give you "good price", but it's best to figure out what you want to spend then agree before you get in. You don't need to haggle when calling them through the otaxi app. The minimum fare is RO  and most destinations won't be much more than that.
The Maxi Taxis ply the main routes through town, and they go where they want so you might have to find one going your direction. Once you are on one, they will make sure you get there. The place to wait for them is on the on-ramps of most of the main highway junctions, when you'll usually see a few people waiting around for one. A journey within the Muscat area should not cost more than RO  each, but if you look like an experienced traveller and hand them RO  then you can usually get away with that.
For visitors staying in Muscat for longer than a day, renting a car provides the most flexibility and is far more economical than using taxis, as one taxi ride from Ghubrah to Muscat and back will cost about the same as hiring a car for one day. A 2WD is fine to see the sights within and around Muscat, but if you're planning to explore wadis and mountains you'll need a 4WD.
Road signs in Muscat can be confusing, and motorway exits are not always clearly marked. Compared with elsewhere in the Gulf (e.g. Dubai and Doha) Muscat drivers are reasonably disciplined, but visitors from outside the region may find the local driving style erratic. For a gentler introduction into Muscat traffic it may be easier to take a taxi (or hotel-provided shuttle) from the airport, and arrange for a rental car through your accommodation – rates are usually the same as if not better than at the airport.
Most local and international rental agencies have offices at the airport. An international driver's permit is theoretically required to rent a car, but usually agents will request only your national licence. All car hires include mandatory insurance. The cheapest car hire is about RO 15 per day for a 2WD economy car with manual transmission and sometimes no air-conditioning; for a 4WD, expect to pay double that amount.

The Mwasalat company runs a few lines of public buses which cover the most important sights and the airport. Buses are infrequent (15 to 20 minutes), but are comfortable and have A/C. Enter at the front door, tell the driver your destination and pay with cash. Women are expected to sit in the front. As of Jan 2023, there were about 7 bus lines in operation, with most starting and ending in Ruwi. The routes can be viewed on Google Maps. Fares depend on distance, ranging from 300 Bzs to RO 1.
