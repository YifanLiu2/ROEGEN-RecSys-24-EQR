Chattanooga is the 4th largest city in Tennessee. It is the seat of Hamilton County. It is in Southeast Tennessee on the Tennessee River and near the border of Georgia. It was immortalized in the popular 1941 song "Chattanooga Choo Choo", made famous by Glenn Miller.
Walnut Street Bridge over the Tennessee River.
Chattanooga played an important role during the American Civil War, when it was a major railroad hub and one of the most industrialized parts of the Confederacy along with the nearby city of Atlanta, resulting in Chattanooga and being at the center of numerous pitched battles. Many of the tourist attractions center around Civil War history such as numerous battlefield parks in and around the city. It is less prominent today because of the decline of its famed railroad, made famous by the popular song "Chattanooga Choo Choo", which is also commemorated in numerous tourist attractions and the popular Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel. In 2020, the city was home to about 185,000 people. The racial makeup of the city is 62% White and 31% African American, with the remainder being other races or mixed-race.
Despite its economic loss and a small population, the city has become notably modernized, urbanized, and economically revitalized, receiving nationally recognition for the renaissance of its once-dilapidated, post-Industrial downtown, redevelopment of its riverfront, and the fastest Internet in the world. Within the last ten years the city has won three national awards for outstanding "livability", and nine Gunther Blue Ribbon Awards for excellence in housing and consolidated planning. An early cornerstone of this project was the restoration of the historic Walnut Street Bridge, which is now the world's longest pedestrian bridge. Chattanooga is the corporate headquarters and home of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Tennessee, Rock Creek Outfitters, Krystal, Chattem, Unum, the Chattanooga Bakery (home of the Moon Pie), and Miller Industries, the largest tow truck manufacturer in the world (Chattanooga is the birthplace of the tow truck, so you'll also find tourist attractions such as the Tow Truck Museum to commemorate this). Chattanooga is also home to the Tennessee Valley Authority, a self-funding government agency which operates numerous power plants in the South. Following the city's industrial decline, many businesses in the banking and insurance industries also set up operations in Chattanooga; the city is home to large branch offices of Cigna, AT&T and UBS.
