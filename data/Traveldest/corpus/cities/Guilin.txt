Guilin (桂林; Guì​lín) and the surrounding region are among the most scenic areas in China and the most popular tourist destinations both for Chinese travellers and the international backpacker set. Guilin is the hub for trips to the surrounding area's karst terrain, limestone mountains eroded into fantastic shapes. Apart from its sheer visual beauty that has inspired China's best painters for generations, karst terrain also provides many cliffs suitable for rock climbing and many caves.
There are many scenic places within short traveling distance of Guilin. These include Longsheng with its famous Longji rice terraces; the Lijiang River, a scene of which is printed on the back of ¥20 bank notes; and Yangshuo, a small county downstream from Guilin. This makes Guilin an excellent base for exploring the northern end of Guangxi Province.
Guilin is a beautiful city. The town center is surrounded by two rivers and four lakes and studded with sheer sided karst mountains. Outside the city center, the buildings are less well kept. The main industry in the city is tourism so the city is much cleaner than other Chinese cities.
Guilin is like most other medium size Chinese cities, other than that it has a large number of western-style hotels, tourists and is relatively free of air pollution. Many Chinese domestic tourists also flock to this area. What makes it special is its proximity to many picturesque limestone mountains and formations.
Separated from the center of China and the Yangtze River basin by the Nan Mountains, Guangxi has always been distinct from the rest of China. The Han Chinese empire first expanded into Guangxi in the 3rd century BC. The Ling Canal was cut around the time, allowing small boats to transit from the Yangtze to the south flowing Xi River via the Xiang River.
Trade grew along the canal and river routes. Guilin was founded as a trading post in the 1st century BC on the West bank of the Kuei River. During the Ming dynasty, a garrison was set up in Guilin and the surrounding area gradually civilised with the development of farmland. The city had a population of over two million at the time of the Second World War, but was utterly destroyed during the war. The population slowly recovered with post-war construction of several factories for the production of paper, chemicals and agricultural equipment. However, market forces have caused several of these industries to relocate out of Guilin.
Guangxi and Guilin are home to 12 ethnic minorities besides the Han Chinese. Guangxi is an autonomous region for the Zhuang ethnic group, rather than a province. See List of Chinese provinces and regions. Various other minorities, such as the Dong, are also found in the area.
Guilin is the third largest city in Guangxi, after Nanning and Liuzhou.
Visitors from ASEAN countries may visit Guilin for up to 144 hours (6 days) without a visa provided they join an approved group tour, enter and depart China through Guilin Liangjiang International Airport, and do not travel beyond Guilin, Yangshuo and Longsheng.
Guilin Liangjiang International Airport (KWL IATA). There are daily flights from major mainland cities and from some other international cities in East Asia and South East Asia. Air Asia provides flights to Guilin from Kuala Lumpur every alternate day.
The airport bus into town is ¥20 but drops off just south of the city centre, after which a taxi should then be around ¥10 to most hotels. The bus only leaves when mostly full so there may be a wait as the bus fills up.
A taxi direct from the airport to a city centre hotel is about ¥100. Back to the airport, a hotel may arrange the trip for ¥80.
Guilin has three main train stations.  Guilin Station (Guilin Zhan) is in the centre of town on Zhongshan Nanlu while  Guilin North Station (Guilin Bei Zhan) is far away from downtown area whilst  Guilin West Station (Guilin Xi Zhan) is even further from the city center! Most trains which terminate in Guilin go to Guilin North Station while trains which come through Guilin from elsewhere usually only go to Guilin Station and not Guilin North.
There are trains from North (Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Shanghai, Xi'an), West (Kunming), South (Liuzhou, Nanning, Zhanjiang), and East (Guangzhou, Shenzhen).
From Beijing — From Beijing to Guilin or vice-versa, there are three trains on either direction. To Beijing, trains depart from Guilin (not Guilin Bei) at 12:59 (train from Zhanjiang), 15:06 (from Nanning) and 19:30. Journey time is between 22 hour and 30 hours, with the 15:06 train being the fastest. HSR train G529 departs Beijing at 07:46 taking 10½ hours.
From Hong Kong — high-speed trains from West Kowloon take three and a half hours
From Shenzhen — there's a bullet train going to Guilin from Shenzhen which will take you there in about three hours. There are only three trains from Shenzhen to Guilin daily and they are sold out quickly on public holidays.
From Guangzhou — Lots of trains in between Guangzhou and Guilin.
From Kunming — There are 3 D trains between Kunming and Guilin: D3942 (07:38/15:35), D3944 (11:02/18:42), D3946 (15:25/22:49). The fare of second class ticket is ¥. The conventional train T382 departs Kunming at 21:15, and arrive in Guilin at 15:19 in the following day. The fare of hard sleeper class is ¥.
From Xi'an — D trains began to run between Xian and Guilin in early 2018, which takes nearly 11 hours. The fare of second class ticket is ¥. The conventional train K318 is still in operation, which departs Xi'an at 19:07, and arrives at 21:18+1, 26 hours later. The fare for hard sleeper class is ¥343 per ticket (hard seat ¥201). The train's final stop is Nanning.
From Nanning — There are many high speed trains (under 3 hours) and a few conventional trains (4–6 hours). It is very convenient to travel between the two cities. One way second-class ticket of high speed train costs ¥108.
From Chengdu — In January 2018, D trains were launched between Chengdu and Guilin. There are 8 departures a day. More will be added in the near future. The travel time via high speed rail varies from train to train, around 7 hours. The original train K652 is not in operation anymore. The fare of second class ticket is ¥.
Once you get out of the train station, you will be approached by cab drivers and other drivers. While their cab meters are trustworthy, they might use a few tricks to cheat you out of some yuan, for example, aggressively pushing tours or adding false charges to the tab.
If you want to avoid the taxis, keep walking past the touts to the public bus stop. From Guilinbei (Guilin North), bus 100 goes through the city center to the central/south train station and beyond. From Guilinxi (Guilin West) you can take bus 22. Cost is ¥2.
There are some expressways locally and within the province, however for any long-distance journey, it is a two-lane road.
From Yangshuo — Minibuses (¥18) depart when full from the square in front of the Guilin railway station. Although the signs are written in Chinese, there are always conductors yelling out Yangshuo. As the buses pick-up and let down passengers along the way, the journey time can take anything from one to one-half hours. Express buses (¥18) depart from the Guilin bus terminal off Zhongshan Nanlu, several hundred metres north of the railway station (and on the same side of the road as the station). Buses depart about every 20min from 07:00. Buy tickets from the ticket office in the bus terminal.
From elsewhere — Buses link Guilin with a multitude of destinations, including Nanning, Kunming, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and further afield. Buses depart from the Guilin bus terminal on Zhongshan Nanlu, several hundred metres north of the railway station.
You can get to Guilin by cargo boat from Guangzhou via Wuzhou, but there are no passenger boats to Guilin anymore, except the boats to and from Yangshuo. You can take a cargo boat if you want to at almost no cost from Wuzhou to Yangshuo.
Getting a local map from a tourist guide or shop for ¥5 is a good idea. This will show the location of most of the sights as well as details of bus routes. Buses are an ideal way to get around Guilin on a budget. Many city parks and river spots can be accessed easily by bus. All the buses starting with 5# are free. A useful one is bus 58 which runs from the train station (and bus station) to many of the attractions. Bus fare are capped at ¥2 per trip.
Taxis are also inexpensive and easily hailed within the city. Usually hard to catch during peak hours (17:30-19:00).
Another inexpensive way for a day-trip to scenic spots in the city area of Guilin is to get a driver for a whole or half day. As of March 2012 (off-season) a whole day is about ¥100, half is ¥50. Most hotels or hostels arrange this service, also telling the driver where you want to go if one is not capable of speaking Chinese.
As anywhere in China, standard Mandarin is almost universally spoken as it is the language used in education and governance. Nevertheless, the local variant of Mandarin has a non-standard pronunciation characteristic of most regions in southern China and also exhibits influence from Cantonese. Some of the native Zhuang people speak their own language, which is co-official with standard Mandarin in the region.
English is not widely spoken but you can expect reasonable-to-excellent English from staff in most hotels and hostels (especially those popular among Westerners) and tourist shops. Elsewhere, English proficiency is none-to-limited, therefore it is recommended to have hotel staff write down your intended destination for taxis or to carry a bilingual map and phrasebook.

Many of the towns around Guilin have an old district that is being slowly replaced by new buildings on the periphery. The old buildings have generally been left in place and remain in relatively good condition as of 2019, although a lack of visitors may mean a lack of incentive to maintain them long-term. These towns can be gorgeous to walk through, although most contain few attractions of note and only minimal tourist infrastructure. With all the other things to see around Guilin, these towns tend to see relatively few tourists and can offer a welcome change of pace.

Guilin is quite safe by Chinese and international standards, but:
The number of Westerners has engendered resentment by many of the club staff—and they are often aggressive and even violent. In 2015, an Irish tourist was stabbed at Muse Night Club in downtown Guilin by a group of bouncers who beat him behind the club. He survived, but the group attack, stabbing, and police inaction show the vulnerability of the foreign traveler in overly-touristy areas.
Watch your valuables very closely in the central city (money belt), as in many tourist locations pickpocketing is a common occurrence. The bus station is the most dangerous place in the city. Keep on guard when boarding and disembarking your bus. Never carry your wallet in your pocket. Organized gangs of pickpockets operate in this area and they will focus on you if you are of non-East Asian descent.
Be careful of locals trying to sell "honey" at rest stops along the highway. They will have bags with honey smelling rocks and a part of a beehive and a knife with them and offer you a taste. According to a local it is not real honey and can be impure, made with wax, and unsafe to consume, and will make you sick.
Western tourists may be approached by people who will introduce themselves as teachers, et al., but turn out to be selling tea or artwork.
