Kigali is the capital of Rwanda. The centre of political and commercial life, Kigali dominates Rwanda and few visit the country without passing through. The city is developing fast, and is very much a showpiece capital designed to impress visitors from tourists to foreign investors and visiting dignitaries.
Monument illustrating Kigali located in Kigali car free zone.
With a population topping 1 million, the city spreads over several hills and valleys, with many of the better restaurants and hotels away from the traditional downtown area. The Kigali City Masterplan outlines the future for this burgeoning metropolis, with plans for a new city to be built south of the current city centre.
As a clean, comfortable and ordered city, Kigali is very popular with long term expats, and the city is teeming with westerners, from young church or NGO volunteers having their first African ‘experience’ to career development workers enjoying a relaxed lifestyle where it is safe to bring up young children. This in turn means the city supports numerous restaurants, coffee shops and supermarkets that cater to this demographic. The downside of Kigali’s popularity with foreigners is that it is easy to forget you are in Africa.

Visitor information from the Kigali city government.
Learn a bit of French and maybe even a bit of Swahili and Kinyarwanda; all three are extremely useful here. English is also widely spoken, at least in Kigali. A useful Kinyarwanda vocabulary cheat sheet is available, or you can buy a conversational booklet from sellers at bus stations.
Kigali International Airport (KGL IATA). Kigali International is a small and organized airport in Kicukiro District, 5 km from the city centre, and it is rare to encounter any problems there. Plastic bags are illegal in Rwanda for environmental reasons, so you should bring only reusable bags into the country.Flag carrier RwandAir has by far the largest selections of flights to KGL including one from O R Tambo Airport, but other airlines also offer flights from their respective hubs, including KLM from Amsterdam Schiphol, Brussels Airlines from Brussels, Qatar Airlines from Doha Hamad International Airport, and Turkish Airlines from Istanbul (IST IATA). (updated Mar 2023)
If you fly from Kigali Airport, you may need a Yellow Fever Certificate at your destination (e.g. South Africa). Also be careful of waiting in the cafe for your flight: some flights (e.g. Kenya Airways to Nairobi) are often overbooked, and you won't hear any announcement when they decide to start boarding early and might miss your flight.
Airport taxis are always waiting for fares, but discuss the price in relation to the distance you have to travel before getting into a cab.
There are also buses passing in the front of the airport leading to Remera, Kigali City, and Nyabugogo.
Some people use also moto bikes for the transportation, but they are not as safe as a car.
If you need any help obtaining these services or hiring a car, airport guides are available to help you.
There are a few 24-hour bar and restaurants in the airport, plus duty-free shops and supermarkets. The airport also provides free Wi-Fi, and luggage storage, medical services and police are on site.
Some international fliers find it much cheaper to fly into Entebbe in Uganda and then take the bus to Kigali. Depending an how long they stop you at the border, the bus trip takes about 9 hours. Try to get a seat on a Jaguar bus. The seats should be booked a day or two in advance in order to get seats #1 to #4.

Motorcyle taxis (motos) are the most popular and fastest way to get around town. The fare for the motorcycle ranges from FRw200-1500, depending on distance, but most of the motocyclists will ask for FRw500-1000. A trip to or from the airport should be FRw1500-2000 (Feb 2024). On the main road out to the airport they really put their foot down. It is however a good well sealed road, nice views over Kigali City and a thrilling ride.
Matatus/city buses (minibuses) provide major routes throughout the city and are the cheapest way to get around. The minibus in Rwanda is one of the best forms of transport in East Africa. Most of the buses are still new and are maintained well. There are several minibus companies which connect Kigali and the other cities in Rwanda.

A reliable individual is Alex, who is on 0788741559 (French & some English spoken).

Your best bet would be with an aid organization or NGO. If you are a resident of the US or EU, you can avoid paying for an expensive residency permit by declaring yourself a tourist upon arrival and then traveling outside of Rwanda once every 90 days for the length of your day. Your 90-day tourist visa (automatically granted upon entry) will be renewed each time you leave and reenter the country (and it's a convenient excuse to go on vacation!)
First thing to be aware is that Kigali can be expensive. As a cash strapped landlocked country costs of imported goods are high and import duties and VAT considerable. Foreigners often complain that wine, olive oil, breakfast cereals, kettle chips and other mundane foodstuffs cost a fortune, so beware. Costs can be lowered considerably by buying Rwandan or East African Community goods - Kenya in particular produces a wide range of produce that often cost half the imported European equivalent.
Outside of supermarkets and restaurants most vendors are used to a bit of haggling (even over fruit and veg) although as always keep things in perspective - but don't let storekeepers charge you double what you think you should be paying.
Cash machines/ATMs – most banks ATMs now accept Master Card, Visa card, American card, Diners Club, Union Pay, and JCB, including Equity Bank , Ecobank, Bank of Kigali, Kenya Commercial Bank, GT Bank, I&M Bank; Ecobank HQ is in the center of town next to CNLS and near UTC. There are many ATMs accepting international cards at the airport also. Don't count on any particular ATM to have money or be working at any particular time - even at the airport.
There are banks in Kigali with counter service for withdrawals (and Ecobank can do MasterCard withdrawals).
Rwandan coffee is generally very good (although stay away from the cheapest stuff, which will be the sweepings from the grinding factory floor). Expect to pay around FRw4,000 per 500 g.
Rwandan honey is great, especially the Nyungwe Highlands type. Around FRw1,750 per 500 g.
Rwandan tea (both black and green) is also pretty good.
These are stocked with Rwandan handicrafts, produce, clothing, fabulous colorful fabric from West Africa and just about anything else.

By all standards Kigali is an excellent city in which to dine. A combination of Belgian culinary influence, plenty of cows, plenty of freshwater fish, and plenty of fresh vegetables equates to some of the best eating in the region. And it's all pretty affordable.
Kigali restaurants and bars go in and out of fashion, not to mention close down, quite frequently. Check for the latest once you are in town; some places mentioned in some print guidebooks no longer exist. (The oft-mentioned Turtle Cafe has been closed since 2003!)
The region restaurants take their time – with a usual 45 minutes to 1 hour wait between ordering and your food arriving, especially for dinner. If you are after a quick meal at lunchtime, there are several African buffets around, where you pile your plate high and are out the door in 30 minutes.
As Kigali is quite a sprawling city eateries are organised by suburb.
