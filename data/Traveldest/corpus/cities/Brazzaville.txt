Brazzaville is the capital of the Republic of Congo, and serves as the financial and administrative center of the country. It can be a pleasant stopover to Pointe Noire or visits to the Congolese rain forests. It is on the northern side of the Congo River, directly across from Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Brazzaville was a relatively well-developed and thriving city before the civil war began in 1997. Although there is still some fighting in the rural areas, it is a safe city to visit, but the infrastructure has been run down. Many of its restaurants and hotels are run by Lebanese immigrants.
Maya-Maya Airport (BZV IATA). Brazzaville can be reached from Paris by Air France on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. There are flights from Johannesburg by South African Airways on Mondays and Thursdays. Brazzaville can also be reached through Ethiopian Airlines from Addis Ababa four times a week; Addis Ababa has connecting flights to numerous other international destinations, including Dubai. Royal Air Maroc operates three direct flights a week from Casablanca. Kenya Airways operates flights to Brazzaville three times a week from Nairobi. If you are a Sky Team associate, you can catch a KLM or Air France flight to Nairobi, and connect to Brazzaville from there. There are also many flights to other smaller capital cities in Africa, including neighbouring Kinshasa.
You can also travel to Brazzaville from Kinshasa via boat, but it is recommended to fly directly into Brazzaville if your intent is to visit the Republic of Congo.
Rail services link Brazzaville with Dolisie and the seaside city of Pointe-Noire. The national operator, CFCO, introduced an "express" train named La Gazelle in 2012; however, it still takes a grueling 15 hours to complete the journey. On the plus side the train has air conditioning, a restaurant car and power sockets. There's also slower services, generally not recommended for tourists. The railway station,  Gare de Brazzaville is located at Place de la Liberte.
There is surprisingly no bridge between Brazzaville and Kinshasa. If you wish to take a car across, it is possible to pay extra and get a ride on the ferry. There have been reports the car will require "disinfection" when crossing from Congo to DR Congo.
You may use local green taxis, even if they are in a poor technical condition. Much as you would anywhere, take a security-first approach to taxis: refuse to hop into any car that has two or more people in it already. One trip anywhere in town is FCFA 1,000.
Being situated on the Congo River, you can quickly get around the city by boat.

This is almost like a 'See' listing because you can get pretty wonderful views of Kinshasa across the Congo as well as the new Pont du 15 Août 1960 (Bridge of August 15, 1960), which was opened in 2016, as you are walking along the banks of the river here. This is probably the best place to go walking in fact in Brazzaville, just be careful at night. (updated Aug 2020)

The market of Poto Poto is fabulous. This is the West African quarter.

Eat at Mami Wata (great pizzas in the afternoon, enjoy the view of Kinshasa over the Congo River) or Nenuphar (great steaks).
For Muslims there are very few places to go out for eating like La Mandarine, one of the Lebanese restaurants in the city. On the Avenue Foch are few restaurants and cafes where you can get dinner, snack, coffee. But at all the Lebanese restaurants one can find Halal food.
There are several great restaurants in Brazzaville. Any taxi driver can take you to one of these nicer places (FCFA 5000-15000). Most places are closed on Sundays. Expect beers to be overpriced here (FCFA 1000 to 2000).

The Vietnamis and some of the local dishes are good and the restaurant is a nice place to read or chat with fellow travelers. Finally, the location is convenient. It serves a good buffet at a reasonable price of FCFA 8000 on Friday and Saturday evenings with a wide variety of dishes.
Beer: Primus, N'Gok, Mutzig, Heineken, Guinness, Turbo King.

No Stress. A lot of foreigners and expats. Most of the taxis will know how to get there but you can always ask for instructions at the reception of your hotel.
Brazzaville is a very very expensive city, as you will find all kinds of things but almost four times the price in Dubai or elsewhere. For example if you are looking to buy a can of Pepsi Cola which is usually 1 UAE dirham in Dubai and you will get it for FCFA 750 (Central African CFA franc) which is equivalent to 5 UAE dirhams. Same goes for other things. Try to bring as many of your personal needs with you as possible.
There is a huge market close to the Cathedral where one can buy decent African wear and bright colored materials - an adventure in itself.
There are two major grocery stores in Brazzaville, and a few convenience type stores which carry some of the same products. Below is a list of supermarkets and convenience type stores:
Casino (used to be Score) is the second largest supermarket after Park N Shop. Everything is overpriced here, but if you need your frozen pizzas. Tel: +242 06 81 03 35.

However, "street bread" can be found throughout the day for FCFA 100-150.
