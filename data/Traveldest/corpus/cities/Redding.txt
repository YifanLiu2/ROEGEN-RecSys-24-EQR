The City of Redding, in Shasta County, California, and its surrounding area has numerous outdoor and indoor activities, including two lakes and two active volcanos within close driving distance. The area offers many parks, hiking trails, and adequate shopping.
Redding is a medium-sized city, and the second largest north of Sacramento after Chico. It is also the county seat and lies along the Sacramento River, an important waterway that provides 35 percent of the state's water. It is the last major city between the start of the Cascade mountain range slightly north and the Oregon border.
Redding was founded as Poverty Flats in 1868 during the gold rush, by a former Sacramento mayor named Benjamin Bernard Redding. He built property in the area so that the Central Pacific Railroad could build a train terminal there. While building the terminal they built the city in the same area, naming it Redding after Benjamin Redding.
Since then the town has gone through various periods of rapid growth, followed by slow downs and then more growth. In the early 20th century Redding had a thriving copper and iron extraction industry. However the town struggled in the twenties with the decline of the mining sector. It came back in the 1930s though and boomed in the 1940s due to the construction of Shasta Dam, which caused the population to nearly double. In the 1950s, the area stayed prosperous thanks to the growing lumber industry and tourism that the dam brought. Interstate 5 was built during the 1960s and 1970s. Further helping the surrounding areas economy.
Redding started to decline again in the early 1980s because of the stricter logging regulations put in place by the federal government that essentially crippled the logging industry. The town continued a slow decline throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.
It has had a slight economic resurgence due to increased business from people visiting the megachurch there.

Interstate 5 (I-5) is the main north-south road through Redding, going as far north as Blaine, Washington (near Bellingham) to San Ysidro, California (a community of San Diego). Redding is accessed from Exit 675 to 682 of I-5.
Highway 44 is the main road to Lassen Volcanic National Park, stretching from Redding in the west to Highway 89 in the east. Many Redding locals go to Lassen National Park using this road in the summer, so that's when it is most crowded. Other times, parts of it are closed due to snow. Goes into downtown as Shasta St (WB) to Pine St and Tehama St (EB) from Market St.
Market St serves as a 'business loop' of I-5 from Exit 681B, through Redding and Anderson as a local road, and rejoins back to I-5 at Exit 667 south of Anderson.
Eureka Way is Redding's main link to the coast (namely Arcata) and to northeastern California (Modoc County). It is, however, one of the less-traveled roads because it is very narrow with very sharp curves much of the way.

Like many midsize American towns, Redding is fairly safe overall as long as you plan properly and take the same precautions everyone should while traveling in a new place. Although there are no truly unsafe places In Redding, care should still be taken when visiting certain areas of town. For instance, the South Market Street area, including South City Park and The Shasta County Library can be problematic depending. There are also sort of bad areas by Enterprise School. Again though, they are not any more unsafe than comparable lower income neighborhoods in other midsize cities.
