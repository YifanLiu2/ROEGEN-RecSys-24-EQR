Vigo is a city of almost 295,000 people (2018) in Galicia, Spain. It has some Roman ruins and Romanesque churches.
Vigo is not only one of the major industrial cities in Galicia, but it is also one of the more important Roman centres of Pontevedra. Although within the city you will not find much Romanesque architecture, it can be seen a few kilometers away from the city centre. A large number of Roman ruins remain in many of the municipality's neighbourhoods and parishes. Such is the importance of the Roman remains in Vigo that many Spanish authors have come to coin the term románico vigués (Vigo-style Romanesque). Vigo retains some interesting examples of Romanesque churches in southern Galicia: Santa María de Castrelos, Santiago de Bembrive, and San Salvador de Coruxo.
Vigo was a 1960s boom town after Franco's government gave this city a free-trade zone in 1947 and a Development Pole in 1964. Vigo is one of the region's primary economic agents, owing in part to the French Citroën automotive factory and to the Port of Vigo.
The Galician language (Gallego), Portuguese, and Castilian (Spanish) are all spoken in Vigo.
Vigo is the rainiest city in Galicia. Compared to many other Galician towns, Vigo and Pontevedra experience warmer summer temperatures than A Coruña or Santiago de Compostela and milder winters than inland areas.
