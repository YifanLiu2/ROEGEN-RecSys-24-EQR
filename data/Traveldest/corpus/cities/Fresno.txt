Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Winter weather typically features highs around 60 °F (16 °C), and "extreme" lows in the low to mid 30s F, often with morning fog and sometimes frost. Rain fall is sparse and occurs exclusively in winter and early spring months. Most rain storms last less than 2 days and are often spread weeks apart. It is not uncommon to experience hail, however it is very rare to see snow fall on the valley floor. The few times it does snow, the snow rarely sticks over night. While winter temperatures can reach below freezing, most all storms feature "warm fronts" that more or less eliminate the chance for snow (mid to low 40s F is a typical "cold" rain storm).
Summer temperatures average in the mid-90s F. Days with high temperatures 110 °F (43 °C) or above are not uncommon. Humidity is only around 20% in the afternoon, though, making for a more bearable dry heat. The chance to find over 110° days commonly occurs beginning late July and continuing to mid August. During these days the low nighttime temperature will only get down to the mid 80s F. It is common for a heat wave to last two weeks.

Amtrak serves Fresno with six trains a day via its San Joaquin route, running south to Bakersfield and north to either Sacramento or Oakland.  Fresno station is in a historic Santa Fe Passenger Depot at 2650 Tulare St.
Almost everybody gets to Fresno by car. The drive to Fresno takes about 3 hours from San Francisco, 3½ hours from Los Angeles, and 5½ hours from San Diego. Coming from the southern Peninsula or South Bay, most people take U.S. Highway 101 to Gilroy, State Highway 152 over Pacheco Pass and through Los Banos, then State Highway 99 south to Fresno. From the northern Peninsula, one might take highway 92 over the San Mateo Bridge ($7 toll as of 2022), to 880 North, then 580 East to 205 East to 5 North to 120 East to 99 South. From Los Angeles, take Interstate 5 north and State Highway 99 north. Fresno is accessible from the southern Central Coast by State Highway 41, usually used with State Highway 46. Fresno is the largest city in the United States without an Interstate highway running through it, but 99 provides much of that function and is slated to be upgraded to Interstate status.

As is typical in California Central Valley cities, a car is useful and often necessary to access most parts of town. Traffic congestion in Fresno is not as bad as larger places in California, but Shaw and Herndon avenues can get quite crowded, especially since there is no east-west freeway through the north side. CA-99 runs along the west side of the city, becoming semi-rural before exiting Fresno County on the northwest side of Fresno. CA-41 runs down the middle of the city. Until the late 1990s and early 2000s these were the only freeways in Fresno, but a surge in growth has spurred the development of the CA-180 and CA-168 freeways.
There is a modest bus system, Fresno Area Express (FAX), but a car would be advised. The city has a bus rapid transit line.
In 2011, Fresno became the first town or city in the Central Valley to earn a Bronze Medal Designation from the League of American Bicyclists, recognizing Fresno as a bicycle friendly community. The city is expanding its bike lanes further in an effort to improve bike access.
