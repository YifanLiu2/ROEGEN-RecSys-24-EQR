Gqeberha (formerly and commonly Port Elizabethdead link) (Xhosa: iBhayi, Afrikaans: Die Baai) (or just PE if you want to sound South African) is South Africa's fifth largest city. It is on the Indian Ocean coast half-way between Cape Town and Durban, in the Eastern Cape, about 260 km from Knysna. It lives up to its reputation as the friendly city and the windy city.
A perfect complement to the Garden Route, the Friendly City is a major sea port and tourist destination set along the beautiful shores of Nelson Mandela Bay. The centre of the South African motor industry is spoiled by moderate and warm temperatures all year round with scattered rain throughout the year - climatic attributes which contribute to an outstanding quality of life. A popular and significant destination for water sports, Port Elizabeth also offers many historical attractions, such as the Historic Donkin Heritage trail, taking visitors along the footsteps of the 1820 settlers. British heritage is reflected in the Port Elizabeth Cricket Club, and the oldest bowling green in South Africa. Port Elizabeth’s greatest treasures, however, are malaria-free wildlife areas in its vicinity, and clean beaches washed by warm water.
Port Elizabeth was founded by British settlers in 1820 and was named after the wife of Rufane Donkin, Acting Governor of the Cape Colony at that time. The city sits on shore of the Algoa Bay and with the neighbouring towns of Kariega/Uitenhage and Despatch, it forms the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality. The Algoa Bay is reputed as the Bottlenose dolphin world capital, as pods of thousands of dolphins can be spotted at any given time in this bay. This is also a year-round whale watching destination.
The tourist information centresdead link are in the Donkin Reserve in the town centre, at the Boardwalk (Marine Drive) and at the Airport Arrivals hall. These information centres are managed by the local tourism organisation, Nelson Mandela Bay Tourismdead link, which also offers tourism passes that you can purchase online or at their tourism information centres. These tour passes give you access to free and discounted activities around Nelson Mandela Bay.
Port Elizabeth was renamed Gqeberha on 21 February 2021, a change that is opposed by many of its residents. Gqeberha is pronounced with a tongue click, i.e., "Click bear gha."
Chief Dawid Stuurman Airport (formerly Port Elizabeth Airport PLZ IATA) (about 2 miles ( km) south of the city's central business district, it is often called the "ten-minute airport" because it is said to be less than ten minutes' drive from most major areas of the city). It has regular flights to Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg with Airlink, Cemair & FlySafair.
Shosholoza Meyldead link operates an overnight train from Johannesburg and Bloemfontein three times a week. You can also get to Cape Town, Kimberley, Pietermaritzburg and Durban (by changing trains in Bloemfontein), to East London (by changing trains in Noupoort, Colesburg or Bloemfontein), to Mthatha (by changing trains in Noupoort and Amabele) or to Grahamstown (by changing trains in Alicedale).
MetroRaildead link operates frequent commuter trains to Uitenhage and the surrounding suburbs during weekdays, with a reduced service over weekends.
The Apple Expressdead link is a narrow-gauge (2 feet/610 mm) tourist train that operates from a separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departs regularly for Thornhill Village via the Van Staden's River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail bridge in the world.

Toyota Hiaces or VW Caravelles or the like, modified to cram in as many seats as possible, will take you across town for approximately R10 (as of May 2020).

Each taxi operates on a laid-out route. They are more frequent during daytime than at night.
Getting on. Stand on the curve of a trafficked road. When a taxi approaches, it may flash its headlights to 'ask' if you want to go. Just stick your hand out.
Getting off. You might be able to tell the 'bouncer' (kondi)your desired destination when you pay, but in any case just tell the driver "next stop", in a clear, firm voice, if you can make yourself heard above the music pounding from the sound system.
