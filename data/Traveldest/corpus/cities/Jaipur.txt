Jaipur (Hindi: जयपुर Jaypur), also known as the Pink City, is the capital of Indian state of Rajasthan, and its largest city. The city was built in the 18th century by Sawai Jai Singh as India's first planned city, and today it's a major tourist attraction for Indians and for international visitors. It is a very picturesque city with splendid palaces, forts and historical monuments and belongs to the tourist Golden Triangle along with Delhi and Agra. It hosts several attractions including the City Palace, Govind Dev ji Temple, Vidhan Sabha, Birla Temple and several massive Rajput forts. It also serves as a stepping stone for those heading to the desert cities of Jodhpur and Jaisalmer.
Jaipur is growing fast and various development projects are being undertaken by the government and private enterprises.
Jaipur's nickname, the Pink City, is due to its distinctly coloured buildings, which were painted this colour to imitate the red sandstone architecture of Mughal cities. The present earthy red colour originates from repainting of the buildings undertaken for a visit by the Prince of Wales in 1876.
Jaipur gets its name from its founder Maharaja Jai Singh II (1693-1744), a great warrior and astronomer. He came to power at the age of 11 on the death of his father Maharaja Bishan Singh. Jai Singh's lineage can be traced back to the Kucchwaha Rajput, clan who came to power in the 12th century. They were long-term rivals to the Sisodia Rajputs who ruled from Mewar. This rivalry led them to ally with the Mughals, and this alliance resulted in them eventually gaining a pre-eminent position in Rajasthan.
Ruling from the magnificent Amber Fort which they built, the might of the Kucchwahas encompassed the kingdoms of Mewar (Udaipur) and Marwar (Jodhpur). After Jai Singh came to power, there was moment of disquiet when he supported Aurangzeb's son Azam Shah's bid to the throne. Azam Shah lost the battle of succession to his brother Bahadur Shah, who demanded Jai Singh's removal and the installation of Vijay Singh to the throne of Jaipur. Jai Singh, not one to take setbacks lying down, formed a formidable front against the Mughals by aligning himself with other Rajput states and reinstated himself.
After the dust had settled, peace reigned, the kingdom prospered and its borders expanded. Jai Singh built the city around the Amber Fort to serve as his capital, and the city was named Jaipur, after himself. Much of the credit for Jaipur goes to Vidhyadhar Bhattacharya, the chief architect from Bengal who, with Jai Singh's approval, founded the city on strong scientific principles, laid out according to the Shilpa Shastra, the ancient architectural manual. It remains one of India's best planned cities. However, expansion meant that the limited sources of water proved inadequate for the city.
After Jai Singh's death in 1744, his sons squabbled for power and without a monarch, the kingdom became open to invasion and neighbouring Rajput states and the Marathas usurped large areas of kingdom. The core, however, remained part of the kingdom, which lasted during British times. As with the Mughals, Jaipur maintained good relations with the British and during the war of independence in 1857 remained loyal to the Raj. Yet, the British gradually began to undermine the independence of the state and exercised greater control over the administration.
In 1876, Maharaja Ram Singh painted the entire city pink, traditionally a colour associated with hospitality, to welcome the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) to the city. The tradition has been maintained and today all residents in the old city are compelled by law to preserve the pink colour. Jaipur has thereby earned the sobriquet of pink city.
Maharaja Ram Singh also built the Ramgarh Lake to supply water to the burgeoning city. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the city's population spread beyond its walls. In 1922, Man Singh II ascended to the throne and it was during his reign that civic buildings like the secretariat, schools, hospitals and other public buildings were built. After independence, Jaipur merged with the states of Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Bikaner to form the state of Rajasthan. In 1956, Jaipur became the capital of the state of Rajasthan.

Jaipur International Airport (JAI IATA) (in the satellite town of Sanganer). Offers sporadic (chartered) service from London and Dublin. Direct flights from Singapore, Bangkok, Sharjah, Muscat and Dubai are also available. Jaipur also has daily domestic air links with many Indian cities such as Jodhpur, Udaipur, Aurangabad, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Goa, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune and Indore.

Indian Railways connects Jaipur from all over the country and is one of the cheapest options. A number of daily trains arrive from Delhi, Ahmedabad, Agra, Mumbai, Jodhpur, Kota, Alwar and Ajmer. Daily connections are also available for Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Kolkata, Jammu, Pathankot, Ludhiana, Kanpur, Roorkee, Haridwar, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur and Bhopal.
Long-distance trains arrive from many other major cities including Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Vadodara, Surat, Nagpur, Bilaspur, Raipur, Patna, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Puri, Chennai, Bangalore, Mysore, Hyderabad, Goa, Mangalore, Kozhikode and Kochi.
The most popular option from Delhi are Vande Bharat and Shatabdi Express trains. The Shatabdi Express train departs New Delhi station at 06:05 and reaches Jaipur at 10:30AM.
There are three major railway stations:  Jaipur Junction , which is the main station, Durgapura and Gandhinagar (Jaipur) — which is not to be confused with the Gandhinagar that is the capital city of the state of Gujarat. All trains stop at Jaipur Junction and a few trains stop at Durgapura and Gandhinagar stations also.
There is an excellent bus service between Jaipur to Delhi by Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC) with buses approximately every half an hour in both directions. Non-A/C and AC Volvo bus services are offered. The air-conditioned bus is taken through a well-maintained highway and has good shock absorbers. From Delhi you can board the bus from Bikaner House on Pandara Road next to India Gate. From Jaipur you can board the bus from Narayan Singh Circle or the main Sindhi Camp bus stand. You can also book tickets up to 6 days in advance from both these places. These buses typically take 6 hours for the Volvo and 6-7 hours for the others. There are also some private bus operators from Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and outside of Sindhi camp in Jaipur. No need to make advance reservations. The buses journey along bumpy backroads to avoid toll roads, and their shock absorbers are not good.
If you plan to leave from Delhi airport, you can get off the bus at Dhaula Kuan and get an autorickshaw (to the bus stand) or perhaps a taxi from there. You do not need to enter congested Delhi.
Express buses to several cities and towns within Rajasthan, such as Kota and Bundi, are also available.
This is the most popular way of reaching from Delhi. The journey by car from Delhi to Jaipur takes less than 4 hr. National Highway no. 8 connects Delhi to Jaipur via the industrial township of Gurgaon. The road is excellent.
There are also many car rental services in Delhi which can provide chauffeur-driven cars to Jaipur.
It is the best and cheaper way to visit the Jaipur Local Sights by RTDC (Rajasthan Tourism Dept. Corp.) There will be one guide with each bus to give you brief info about all sights. The full day tour, as of 2019, costs ₹600.
Jaipur Metro provides a fast, reliable and inexpensive way to get around the city. The Pink Line runs from Mansarovar to Badi Caupar station, which is in the centre of the walled town (a.k.a the Pink City). Fares range between ₹5 and ₹25.

Autorickshaws (tuk-tuks) are probably the best way to reach places in the outskirts of Jaipur such as Amber Fort or Galtaji, where getting a taxi or Uber/Ola to go back to the city may be tricky. They are generally more expensive than Uber/Ola, but on the plus side, they are readily available and don't require waiting time.
Hiring an autorickshaw for a whole day with a trip to Amber Fort, Tiger Fort, Jal Mahal, and other areas can cost anywhere between ₹450 to ₹550 (as of 2018). But be careful, as the drivers might ask for more money to cover parking fees, petrol, and other charges along the way. Always agree on an ‘all-in’ price that includes his/her time, petrol, lunch, and parking fees. It's not uncommon for people to agree to ₹500 and pay close to ₹1000 with all of the surprise fees. Lastly, make sure you and the driver agree that he/she will take you to the site and not close to it ‘just for photographs’.
Prepaid autos are available at the Jaipur railway station and the Sindhi Camp bus stand, although prices are a little inflated and often the same as you get with minimal bargaining.
At a certain point, the rates were revised to ₹350-400. The autorickshaw wallas will tell you to take the slip from the police booths. You can also go directly without the slip, but don't forget to bargain over the price in that case; it could be much cheaper. It'll be best if you start your sightseeing by 10AM in the morning as some of the major spots close by 4:30PM and each spot takes a lot of time, especially the forts.
Some autorickshaw drivers will try to trick you into paying more than the agreed amount after the trip is over, but you should stick to the original amount decided. Police in Jaipur are very friendly, so in case you feel the autorickshaw driver is trying to misguide you or force you to hand over extra money, just refer the dispute to the police officers at various spots.
Also some autorickshaw drivers will tell you to buy artefacts and gifts from some shops especially some on the way to Amber Fort. Firmly refuse to stop there as these shops operate on commission to the auto driver and fleece you. If you want to buy souvenirs, get them in city's main shopping areas like Bapu Bazaar.
Take along some of your own information about the eating and shopping places as the drivers have their fixed commissions at shops and eating outlets, so you might end up paying more for an item or eating at an undesirable place.
Autorickshaw drivers have been known to work together with the gem scammers. If you hire an autorickshaw for the day, he may suggest that you 'go for a beer' afterwards, and if you accept you will be introduced to the main man on the scam attempt, usually a very charismatic person who is clearly much wealthier than his rickshaw-driving 'friend'. Use common sense: why would a rickshaw driver who earns ₹350 per day (minus petrol) want to take you to a bar where beers are ₹75? Politely decline these invitations as they are invariably more trouble than they are worth.
City bus #5 connects directly Amber Fort, Hawa Mahal, New Gate and the intersection of MI Road and Railway Rd every 10 min until 9PM.
City bus #2 runs from the train station up Station Road to the City Palace, Minar, Observatory, etc. The bus driver will try to charge you more. They also sometimes ask you if you need change, or say they don't have change, despite it being obvious they do.
The buses are generally overcrowded and are in a poor condition. You can view this link to learn about the bus routes in Jaipur. Fares are by distance, as show on these charts.
Cycle-rickshaws are cheaper, but the amount of time it takes quickly makes it worth paying a few extra rupees and going by autorickshaw, bus or taxi. The advantage of traveling by cycle-rickshaw is that you can cover some great places in the narrow lanes of Jaipur which can not be seen if you hire some other mode of transport.
Walking around the old town (Pink City) is certainly a highlight, and should be done on shopping business hours; otherwise, streets can be deserted and it might be a bit unsafe, especially for solo women. While the Pink City has footpaths, they are often obstructed so you will have to walk in the road at some points. Also, be careful with crossing the streets at the multi-lane roads. Even so, the Pink City's staggering architecture and endless colorful bazaars make walking around a treat, and many points of interest, like the Hawa Mahal, City Palace and Jantar Mantar are close by each other. As in many Indian cities. however, you need to be prepared to cope with the traffic, noise, pollution and litter in the streets.
The taxis in Jaipur are very convenient and comfortable. Most of the vehicles are Maruti Omni Vans or Tata Indica cars, which are much safer than Auto rickshaws, and the drivers are polite. If you are alone or going to an unknown destination, you are strongly advised to choose this option, even though the rates will be double that of an autorickshaw. you must call for a taxi, as it is nearly impossible to hail one unless you are at a major point like the airport. When you call, you should negotiate a fare (or agree on using the meter) and get the taxi's 'number'. The taxi will come pick you up, and call you when they are close. Taxis generally have yellow licence plates with black letters. Some taxis are yellow & black, which helps to differentiate them from the private cars.
You can also try the Gozocabs Uber Cabbazar or Ola Apps and webisite like for taxi services which are not as expensive as hiring regular taxis. These services are becoming increasingly popular, so finding a car at a reasonable fare (often cheaper than a tuk tuk) is getting easier day by day.
Car rental is one of the effective alternatives for wandering around in Jaipur. Almost all of the car rental services in India including Zoomcar, Myles and Avis offer services in Jaipur.
It's possible to see the ticket price for each point of interest on the Rajasthan Tourist Government Office website
The composite ticket includes Amber Fort, Jantar-Mantar, Hawa Mahal, Albert Hall (Central Museum), Nahargarh Fort, Sisodia Rani Palace/Garden, Vidyadhar Garden, and Isarlat tower (Swargasuli).

Amber Fort (Amer Fort) (11 km North of central Jaipur, local bus #5 from Hawa Mahal or New Gate), ☏ +91 14 1253 0293. 8AM-6PM. This massive fort-palace complex built in hybrid Hindu-Muslim style dates back to Raja Man Singh and was the royal palace of the Kachwahas from c. 1600-1727. It's one of six world heritage forts in Rajasthan. The name has nothing to do with the rather pretty pastel yellow colour; instead, the fort is named after the town of Amber, in turn named after the goddess Amba. The main sights within the fort include the Sheesh Mahal, adorned with thousands on thousands of mirror tiles on the walls and ceiling. The fort/palace grounds are sprawling and the information panels (Hindi/English) are somewhat limited, so it might be worth getting an audio guide or a real guide. It's a bit of a hike up from the town, and the touristy thing to do is to ride on an elephant to the top (in order to get an elephant it is better to arrive there in the morning, otherwise at midday the elephants are done working; however, the road that the elephants walk on is not so long). If you hire a genuine guide, you will be taken not only to the Amber Fort but also to the Rajasthan Kala Mandir (a government operated shop) to buy souvenirs. Guides get a 2% commission on the items you buy there. Also see the Amber Light Show below. The site has come under scrutiny as tourists claim to have witnessed the elephants being beaten by handlers. If you walk up the hill to the Jaigarh Fort be prepared to pay the entry fee as the path terminates at a ticket window and there is no way around to the road. ₹100/20 for Indian adult/student and ₹500/100 for foreign adult/student. Included in the Composite Ticket. There is a special evening viewing from 6:30-9AM, ₹100 for all, Composite Ticket not valid. Camera: free. Audioguides ₹200. Elephant rides: ₹1100. Consider not taking elephant rides as there have been many reports of these animals not being kept and cared for in humane ways. (updated Oct 2018)
Jaigarh Fort (A 1 km walk uphill from Amber Fort, or ₹100/200 for motorbike/auto-rickshaw), ☏ +91 14 1267 1848. 9AM-4:30PM. Never conquered in battle, this was considered the strongest of the three forts in the area. It is best known as the site of the world's largest cannon, the Jaivana, which was test-fired only once — according to legend, despite using only the half the design amount of gunpowder, the cannonball flew 35 km! A better reason to visit the fort, though, are the scenic gardens at the other end and the spectacular views over the Amber Fort and the hills around. The remains of the foundry where the Jaivana (and many more) were cast are also in the fort grounds. There are multiple boards with "no tips allowed," in case someone is bothering you. ₹35/100 for Indian/foreigner. Camera ₹50 (if you do not disclose that you have a camera and later the police/their person sees you talking a photo (e.g. with your mobile) they may ask you to show your ticket, and if you don't have one, will either ask you to buy the ₹50 ticket or penalize you). Video ₹200. Automobile ₹50.
Nahargarh Fort, Krishna Nagar, Brahampuri, ☏ +91 14 1518 2957. 10AM-6PM. The smallest of the three forts, notable primarily for excellent views over Man Sagar lake and the vast sprawl of Jaipur. Built in 1734 by the Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in a mix of Indian and European styles, the fort also houses the (relatively) compact Madhavendra Bhawan palace, although its former splendour is fading under layers of graffiti and pigeon droppings. Some of the film Rang De Basanti were shot at this fort. To get to the area where the "Pathshala" song was shot, take a left turn as soon as you enter the fort. An autorickshaw can be taken from the stand in front of the Amber fort. The fort also houses the Jaipur's Wax Museum and Sheesh Mahal, although tickets for these have to be bought separately and are ridiculously expensive. Beware if buying the Wax Museum and Sheesh Mahal combo ticket, you'll be paraded through the largely unimpressive museum and then be told to queue for the Sheesh Mahal which can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours. ₹50/200 for Indians/foreigners. Included in the 5-monument Composite Ticket. ₹400/₹700 (Indian/foreigners) for the tour of the Wax Museum and the Sheesh Mahal.. (updated Aug 2017)

Rajmandir Cinema, C-16, Panch Batti, Bhagwan Das Rd, C-Scheme, ☏ +91-141-2374694, +91-141-2379372. An experience in itself, and another "don't miss". Once known as the best cinema India, and still the best in Rajasthan, it offers an overwhelming experience. From the pushing, shoving, and general chaos in the ticket queue, to an audience that laughs, cries, cheers, claps, and consistently talks through the entire film, the Rajmandir provides an insight into Rajasthani culture. The films can be interesting; Masala movies are action, drama, mystery, suspense, and epics all wrapped into one single film, teeming with dances and obligatory wet sari scenes, and unabashedly lifting generous amounts of plot devices from Western films.

Around 18 km from Central Jaipur on the Jaipur-Tonk highway, Chokhi Dhani (Fine Hamlet in Rajasthani dialect) is a kind of virtual village and also a 5-star resort. There are lodging facilities available, but the real attraction is the evening fun-fairs. There are two excellent places to enjoy Rajasthani food served in the traditional mode at their resort. Chokhi Dhani a.k.a. Lalten Restaurant is a more popular place because it is on the main road near the airport and also has other attractions, such as horseback riding, camel riding, bullock cart rides, a maze, boating and kathputli (puppet) shows. You can also watch live folk dances and listen to live folk music for free. It gives the visitor a glimpse of culture from different parts of Rajasthan, and could be nice if you will not have time to see much of Rajasthan yourself. It opens at 5PM, and be sure to get there early as many of the sites are difficult to see when it gets dark. It's a 30-min rickshaw ride from Central Jaipur, or you can go there by bus or taxi, but you are best off making sure you have a ride back.Consider buying the pass for AC hall, because the outdoor seating is a self-served buffet, while in the AC Dining you'll be served food. This makes a massive difference when there are too many people at the restaurant, as the restaurant is unable to keep up with the demand for buffet food.If you would prefer to sleep at the resort, have a look at their accommodation. Avoid going there during the rainy season.

The Gangaur Festival of Jaipur is well known in India. It starts on the day after Holi (March or April) and lasts for 18 days. In Jaipur, a sweet dish called a ghewar is characteristic of the Gangaur festival. People buy ghewar to eat and distribute among their friends and relatives. The celebration is dedicated to the God Shiva and his consort, the Goddess Parvati. A procession with the image of Gauri commences from the Zanani-Deodhi of the City Palace. It then passes through Tripolia Bazaar, Chhoti Chaupar, Gangauri Bazaar, Chaugan stadium and finally converges near the Talkatora.

Nothing is 'fixed price' in Jaipur, even in the self advertised government (RTDC) approved shops & emporiums. There are a few RTDC approved shops along "Amer Road" claiming to be government-owned and 'fixed price', but beware: they are frequently overpriced by as much as three times. Almost everything, from food to transportation to handicrafts, even accommodation can be bargained down to as much as a 60% discount off the quoted price. The lowest rates will be found in the bazaars of Bapu & Johari. Even here, keep inquiring in several shops as each one will have a different price for the same item. Don't be ashamed to spend an hour or more in each shop with the friendly shop owners sharing stories over masala chai as you look at their goods. While they are doing their best to run a business, do not overlook the genuinely hospitable culture of Rajasthani people.
Jaipur has tens of bazaars of different sizes and specializing in different products. Expect a brilliant, colourful explosion of flowers, elephants, ox carts, and wares; a complete assault on the senses. The traveller will smell the deep aroma of spices in canvas bags, the fetid smell of animals and open sewers, the sweet waft of tea, and the crusty acrid burn of dust and exhaust. There are different specialist zones, whether it's food, flowers, textiles, carved statues or plumbing. It is chaotic and noisy, people may stare if you are a Westerner, and anybody who has something to sell will try to sell it to you, repeatedly. Watch cobras dance out of their wicker baskets, and don't be too surprised if the snake charmer slaps his cobra for having a wayward eye. Be prepared to be asked for money if you plan to take photographs of snake-charmers and beggars. While you should always be wary, be sure not to completely close yourself out to the locals as one of the highlights of Rajasthan is the chance to interact with the friendly people.

Jaipur also has other markets like Civil Lines Market and MI Road and nearby markets. It also has a few malls like Crystal Palm Shopping Mall, Gaurav Towers, MGF Metropolitan Mall, Pink Square Mall, Triton Mall and World Trade Park.
Jaipur is famous for its many jewel merchants where you can get great deals on semi-precious gems such as turquoise, lapis, tiger eye and the star ruby (a gem found only in India that is distinctive for the 6-pointed star it shines under natural light).
Jaipur is famous for its 'rajais', a type of light quilt stuffed with cotton. You can get colourful & soft `Shaneel ki Rajai' in a velvet finish. These are quiet warm, soft and long lasting. You can shop in the main market area. But remember to bargain. To be confident of quality, and are willing to pay a little more, visit government stores for rajais.

Beyond the standard dangers of travelling in India (thieves, hustlers, touts, questionable drinking water), Jaipur has developed its own set of unique scams.
You may be approached by a local, sometimes youths on motorbikes, who claim that Westerners are unwilling to engage with the Indian people.
"Why don't tourists want to talk to me?" or "I am a student, I want to learn about your culture" is a common opener. They may also try to make you feel guilty by claiming "It is Indian culture to be help." If you engage them, the scam artist will invite the visitor to drink tea. Frequently, the tourist will only be told of the gem stones the next day or after dinner. Usually it is some sort of tax problem. The unwitting mark is then sold fake stones for resale in his/her home country. Even if stones are posted in front of your eyes, you are more likely to see Elvis than the gems again. As a general rule, do not accept tea from strangers, but in addition be wary of any who invite you to talk in secluded areas. The easiest is a simple and polite refusal of any offer, even if just a drink and chat. You may need to firm in your refusal, and walk away.
If you are a Westerner and a person outside your hotel accosts you, then it's likely the person is scheming to acquire your money. There have been reports of smugglers trying to entice foreigners to assist in smuggling items. Under no circumstances accept: smuggling is a serious offence.
