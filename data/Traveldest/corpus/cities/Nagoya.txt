For the city in Batam, Indonesia, see Nagoya (Indonesia).
Nagoya (名古屋) is the capital and largest city of Aichi prefecture, in the Chubu region of Honshu. It's not one of Japan's top tourist draws as most tourists just zip through on the bullet train on their way between Tokyo and Kyoto. But if you do decide to stick around, there are plenty of car-related attractions, a restored castle, an ancient shrine, and a surprisingly happening nightlife.
The hub of the Aichi region, Nagoya is Japan's fourth-largest city after Tokyo, Yokohama, and Osaka and one of the nation's major economic centers. In terms of manufacturing, as home to auto-making giants Toyota, Honda, and Mitsubishi Motors, Nagoya is to Japan what Detroit is to the United States — and it was completely flattened during World War II.
Now a modern metropolis, Nagoya gets its name from an old manor called Nagono which was built in the area in the 12th century. The manor prospered for two hundred years, and people began to refer to the area by the manor's name. Over time, the pronunciation of the Chinese characters in the name "Nagono" shifted to "Nagoya", by which the city is now known.
Three famous local figures later helped to put Nagoya firmly on the map of Japan. Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu all hailed from around Nagoya, and all shared the ambitious goal of unifying Japan under one government. Tokugawa finally succeeded in 1603 after winning in the Battle of Sekigahara, and established the Tokugawa Shogunate, which would rule Japan for the next 250 years.
Soon after uniting the country, Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered the construction of Nagoya Castle for his son. He then ordered the people of nearby Kiyosu (on the outskirts of Nagoya) to move to the area around the castle, and a town soon came into being. Cotton, ceramics and lumber were the main industries sustaining the town as it grew into a small city.
Following Japan's opening to the world during the Meiji era, Nagoya rapidly industrialized and established transportation links with the rest of Japan that would allow it to easily export its goods. During World War I, Nagoya became known for its foundries as well as its machinery and heavy industry exports, which would continue to grow throughout the 1930s.
The 1920s marked the beginnings of the automotive industry in Nagoya, which continues in importance to the current day. At the heart of the industry is the Toyota Motor Corporation. Starting from humble beginnings as a loom-making company, Toyota entered into the automobile business in the 1930s. It now stands as the world's largest automaker, and continues to dominate the local economy along with the car-making giants Honda and Mitsubishi.
During World War II, much of Nagoya's manufacturing infrastructure turned to the production of military goods, making it a prime target for bombing raids. Almost 25% of the city was destroyed during the war, with almost half the population fleeing to the countryside to avoid the attacks.
The end of the war marked a new start for Nagoya. Car-friendly wide streets and boulevards were bulldozed through the rubble of war, making for the city of today.
Nagoya now ranks as one of the nation's economic powerhouses, and is home to the head offices of Toyota Motor Corporation, Brother Industries, Daido Steel, Makita, Denso Corporation, INAX, Noritake, NGK Insulators and many others. Unlike other parts of Japan, which borrowed heavily for elaborate and expensive public works projects in the bubble years of the 1980s, kechi ("miserly") Nagoya held to a pay-as-you-go philosophy, and has not been as adversely affected by the post-bubble recession as other major centers.
The booming economy has also brought many foreigners to the area, and the region now hosts a thriving community of Japanese-descent Brazilian immigrants, who help to keep the wheels of the local economy spinning. With its strong economy and growing population, Nagoya is a city to watch in the coming years.
Nagoya's climate varies greatly throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from a low of 4 °C ( °F) in January to a high of 27 °C ( °F) in August. The city is known for its incredibly hot and humid summers like many cities in Japan, with high temperatures routinely surpassing 30 °C (86 °F) in August, so those with an aversion to heat would be better off visiting in the milder temperatures of the spring or autumn.
While divided into 16 wards or ku (区), the focal points of this sprawling agglomeration are Nagoya Station (名古屋駅) to the north, Sakae (栄) to the east and Kanayama (金山) to the south.

Not arriving via Centrair Airport?
If you happen to arrive in Japan at Osaka's Kansai International Airport, Nagoya can be reached in two hours by taking the Haruka limited express train to Shin-Osaka station, then changing to the Tokaido Shinkansen.
A few air flights operate daily from Tokyo's Narita Airport to Centrair Airport, for the benefit of international passengers. Otherwise, Nagoya is three hours away by taking the Narita Express limited express train to Tokyo's Shinagawa station, then changing to the Tokaido Shinkansen.
Mall beyond the check-in counters at Chubu Centrair international Airport
Chubu Centrair International Airport (中部国際空港 Chūbu Kokusai Kūkō, NGO IATA). Japan's third major international gateway is on an artificial island 30 minutes south from the center of town. Facilities include two hotels, restaurants, a shopping concourse, and an onsen spa with views of the runways.
The best way of connecting between Centrair Airport and central Nagoya is the Meitetsu Airport Line. The fastest trains are the all-reserved "μSKY" trains, which depart for Nagoya every 30 minutes. The journey takes 28 minutes at a cost of ¥1230. Slower Limited Express trains offer first class (reserved) and ordinary class (non-reserved) seating and take 37 minutes for the run to Nagoya - the standard fare is ¥870. Japan Rail Passes are not valid for the Meitetsu, though you can exchange your rail pass voucher at either the airport or at Nagoya station.
Buses run hourly from Centrair Airport to the Meitetsu Bus Terminal, taking about 1 hr 20 min at a cost of ¥1200. The bus also stops at a few major hotels, including the Nagoya Tokyu, Nagoya Kanko and Hilton Nagoya.
For large groups, Tsubame Airport Limousine offers private van service between Nagoya and Centrair Airport. Vans seat between six and nine passengers, and the cost for the service depends on the destination. As an example, trips to Nakamura-ku, where Nagoya Station is located, cost ¥12000.
Slightly more expensive than the van is a taxi. A trip to Nagoya station will run ¥15000-16000.
Nagoya Airport (also known as Komaki Airport, NKM IATA) (to the north of the city). While all other companies have moved to Chubu, regional flights by Fuji Dream Airline still use the old Nagoya Airport (NKM IATA). Flights are available from a number of domestic destinations: Aomori, Iwate, Niigata, Kochi, Fukuoka, Kitakyushu, Kumamoto, and Yamagata. Most flights are code-shared with Japan Airlines. Shuttle buses connect to Nagoya station in 30 minutes for ¥700.
Nagoya Station (名古屋駅 Nagoya-eki). Nagoya Station is the confluence of all the major train lines and long-distance passenger bus services in the city. Underground and adjacent to the JR train station are the stations of the Nagoya Railway (Meitetsu Nagoya) and the Kintetsu Railway (Kintetsu Nagoya) (updated Jun 2020)
Nagoya is along the Tokaido Shinkansen route between Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. To the west are Gifu and Kyoto, and to the east are Hamamatsu and Shizuoka.
The fastest service on the Tokaido Shinkansen is the Nozomi. With the Nozomi you can travel from Tokyo in 1 hr 40 min (¥11090), Kyoto in 35 min (¥5800) and Shin-Osaka in 50 min (¥6560).
Users of the Japan Rail Pass cannot use the Nozomi, but can use the slightly slower Hikari services that run through Nagoya twice every hour. The all-stations Kodama services operate to/from Tokyo twice per hour.
Thru Nozomi trains from western Japan reach Nagoya from Okayama (1 hr 40 min, ¥11290), Hiroshima (2 hr 20 min, ¥14230) and Hakata station in Fukuoka (3 hr 20 min, ¥18540). If using the slower Hikari or Sakura you will need to change trains at least once, either at Okayama, Shin-Kobe, or Shin-Osaka. Note that while there are three direct Hikari trains that leave Nagoya in the morning towards Hiroshima and Fukuoka, there are no such direct Hikari trips from these cities to Nagoya.
If you wish to sacrifice travel speed for savings, you can take advantage of the Puratto (Platt) Kodama Ticket, which offers a discount for Kodama services if you purchase at least one day in advance. You get a reserved seat and a coupon for a free drink (including beer) which can be redeemed at a "Kiosk" convenience counter inside the station. With this ticket a trip to Nagoya costs ¥8300 from Tokyo (3 hr; 2 trains per hour), ¥4300 from Kyoto (1 hr; 1 train per hour) and ¥4400 from Shin-Osaka (1 hr 15 min; 1 train per hour). A few early-morning Kodama trains cannot be used with this ticket.
Discounted tickets can also be purchased in advance through Japan Railways' official SmartEX App, available in English and other languages - look for Hayatoku fares.
Nagoya serves as the terminal point for the hourly Wide View Shinano, a JR Chuo Line limited express train to the mountain resort town of Nagano (3 hr) via Matsumoto (2 hr). The Wide View Hida JR Takayama Line limited express connects Nagoya with Takayama (2 hr 30 min), with some runs continuing to Toyama (4 hr).
Local trains (which can be used with the Seishun 18 Ticket) take about 6 hours from Tokyo (¥6260), 2 hr 15 min from Kyoto (¥2590) and 2 hr 45 min from Osaka (¥3350). Multiple train transfers are required (three at minimum when traveling from Tokyo, at Numazu, Hamamatsu, and Toyohashi, and one in Maibara at minimum when coming from Kyoto or Osaka, although more are often required if travel is not optimally timed), and travel times do not include rest stops.
Nagoya is also served by the Meitetsu (名鉄) and Kintetsu (近鉄) private railways. If coming to Nagoya from Osaka, a travel option that comes cheaper than the Shinkansen is a Kintetsu limited express service called the Urban Liner (アーバンライナー), which runs from Osaka-Namba station. The Urban Liner departs at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour, covering the journey in about 2 hr 15 min at a cost of ¥4260. (The shinkansen, by comparison, makes the run from Shin-Osaka to Nagoya in under an hour for ¥6560.) Japan Rail Passes are not valid for the Urban Liner.
Many day and overnight buses run to Nagoya from other locations throughout Japan. They can be cheaper than the shinkansen or local trains. Some of the main bus operators include Nagoya-based Meitetsu Bus and JR Tokai Bus, along with Willer Express. In addition to major cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe, highway buses run from places including
Sendai, Fukushima, Koriyama, Utsunomiya, Tokyo Disneyland, Takasaki, Maebashi, Kofu, Fujiyoshida, Niigata, Toyama, Takaoka, Kanazawa, Fukui, Nagano, Matsumoto, Iida, Ina, Shirakawa-go, Takayama, Shingu, Okayama, Kurashiki, Yonago, Matsue, Izumo, Hiroshima, Miyoshi, Takamatsu, Tokushima, Matsuyama, and Fukuoka.
Most buses will pick up and discharge passengers around Nagoya station, either near the station's shinkansen exit or at the nearby Meitetsu Bus Center. An exception is Willer Express, which will use either Sasashima Live south of Nagoya station or Noritake 1-chome west of Nagoya station.
Buses between Tokyo and Nagoya are very frequent. Direct trips take 5–6 hours, but some trips could take up to nine hours depending on the route and stops. Buses charge in the range of ¥3500-5000 for daytime trips and ¥4000-6500 for overnight trips. Discounted fares are sometimes available based on the date of purchase.
Many buses also operate from the Kansai region: Meishin Expressway buses leave several times per hour, operating from Kyoto (2 hr 30 min, ¥2550), Osaka (3 hr, ¥3000) and Kobe (4 hr 15 min, ¥3400). A few buses also travel from Nara (2 hr 30 min, ¥2550). Discounts are given on round-trip purchases.
Willer Express bus journeys can be booked online in English, and Willer's Japan Bus Pass is valid on all of their routes with some exceptions. Willer also sells tickets for Meitetsu Bus and other bus operators on their website, but these trips are not valid with Willer's Japan Bus Pass. Both the Willer and Meitetsu buses leave from the Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal (Busta Shinjuku), above the JR tracks at Shinjuku Station, which is served by many of Japan's highway bus operators.
JR Bus reservations can be made in English through their Kousoku Bus Net web site. You can also make reservations in train stations at the same "Midori-no-Madoguchi" ticket windows used to reserve seats on trains. Buses depart from Tokyo Station - Yaesu Exit (八重洲口) and from Busta Shinjuku.

The ferry terminal is also accessible by train and city bus. Take the Aonami line (あおなみ線 Aonami-sen) south to Noseki stn (野跡駅). From there, you can board a city bus bound for the Feri futo (フェリーふ頭) bus stop (takes 7 to 10 min).
More details are available on the Taiheiyo Ferry access page.
Nagoya is a big automotive industry center, and it shows. The street network is extensive and even downtown locations can be easily reached by car. On the downside, trains and subways are less convenient than in Tokyo or Kansai, and more expensive. If you're travelling with a JR Rail Pass, the train network doesn't have many stations in the city and you'll probably find yourself using the bus or subway a lot, something your pass won't cover.
There are 5 main subway lines:
The red Sakuradōri Line (桜通線, S) curves southwest from Nagoya Station.
The purple Meijō Line (名城線, M) runs in a loop around the eastern side of the city, connecting Sakae and Kanayama.
The Meikō Line (名港線, E) spur branches from Kanayama to Nagoya Port.
The yellow Higashiyama Line (東山線, H) connects Nagoya, Fushimi, Sakae, and Fujigaoka.
The blue Tsurumai Line (鶴舞線, T) connects Fushimi and Osu Kannon, then goes south.
Subways run every several minutes between about 05:30 until about 00:30. Fares range from ¥200 to ¥320. One day passes can be bought for ¥620 (bus), ¥760 (subway), and ¥870 (bus & subway).
On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays you can also take advantage of the cheaper Donichi-Eco-Kippu (ドニチエコきっぷ) one-day subway ticket which offers unlimited subway travel for ¥620. This pass is available from ticket machines, or can be purchased in person from a station employee at the ticket gate.
City transportation one day passes also offer discounted entry at various attractions in Nagoya, including Nagoya Castle and the Toyota Museum.
More information about public transportation in Nagoya can be found on the official website of the Nagoya Transportation Bureau.
Taxis are a viable option in this car city, especially as the basic fee is only ¥500. The catch is that the basic fee only takes you  km compared to 2 km in most other parts of Japan. But for shorter distances within the city, a taxi is not only much more convenient than descending to those dark, unappealing subway stations, but also as cheap as the subway if there are at least two of you.
Most parts of central Nagoya were built on landfill just above sea level, making it a relatively flat city and seemingly easy to traverse by bicycle. However, downtown Nagoya is also known throughout Japan for its wide streets, fast moving traffic and crazy drivers. So it's no surprise that you will find most of the city's cyclists (especially mothers riding with young children and the elderly) riding on the sidewalk. Riding on the sidewalk is legal on most city streets in Japan (unless marked). However, the sidewalks can be bumpy, crowded and far from ideal for two-wheeled transport - leading an increasing number of riders to brave the city's roads.
Note: On wide roads, there are often parked cars in the left lane that force you to merge right into faster traffic. Be sure to signal whenever changing lanes and look behind and to the right for quickly approaching cars. If merging to the right is not safe, it is sometimes safer to get on the sidewalk rather than risking life and limb on the street with cars that may not yield. Beware especially of taxis, as they may make stops in front of you without much warning.
Secondary roads can be more enjoyable to ride and there are some major roads with protected cycling lanes - although these are rare and sometimes seem to have been designed without rhyme or reason. Cyclists have also been known to park their bicycles on some of the lesser sidewalk-adjacent "paths" downtown, making them largely impassible.
Bicycle parking near train and subway stations is strictly limited to designated and (usually paid) areas. Paid locking bike racks with fare collection machines are common and most charge around ¥100 for a day's worth of parking. There is also usually a window of free parking time (15–30 minutes) for cyclists making brief stops. Near the main train stations there are also attended and unattended indoor areas to park with short term and long term facilities. Be sure not to park in one of the long term facilities by mistake, as you will probably be fined more than it costs to park in a short-term area.
Nagoya has a cycle sharing serivice called Cariteco Bike (run by the Meitetsu train company). It requires returning bicycles to the nearest docking station. As of May 2024, there are 410 docking stations around the city. The service offers registration and information only in Japanese, so they are probably not a practical option for most visitors with limited Japanese ability.
