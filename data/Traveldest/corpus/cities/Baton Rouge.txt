Baton Rouge is the capital of Louisiana, USA. Located on the east bank of the mighty Mississippi River, Baton Rouge is Louisiana's second largest city, home of Louisiana State University, major port facilities, and a variety of attractions.
The name of Baton Rouge was given on 17 March 1699, Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville, led an expedition along the Mississippi River. The early French explorers found a pole stained with blood of fish and animals that served as the dividing line between the Bayougoula and Houmas Indians. It is from this "red stick" that Iberville called the city le Baton Rouge, French for "red stick". The city was founded in 1721.
The small town here was selected as the new capital of state of Louisiana in 1817, and it's been growing since. The capital was returned to New Orleans for a while during and after the troubles of the American Civil War, but it's been back here since 1882.
Baton Rouge has a semi-tropical climate, perfect for outdoor activities.
The weather is consistently warm from May to September. Be warned that, like the rest of the Southern United States during the summer, it can become down-right miserable, with sustained temperatures in the 90s (°F) with 100% humidity. Proper medical precautions should be taken if you plan on partaking in outdoor activities, such as ample amounts of sunscreen and hydration. Also, there are many days throughout July that are classified as "ozone days" due to severe ground-level ozone, which can damage the health of sensitive individuals.
Winter is usually mild and short-lived. Spring is glorious with cool nights and warm, sunny days. A light jacket is all that is needed. Fall is mild and only a light sweater is needed in the evenings.
May is considered the best month to visit, good for outdoor activities and sightseeing.
Precipitation is reasonably well-distributed and ample throughout the year with an average annual precipitation of 55 in (140 cm)
Average summer temperature: °F (27°C)
Average winter temperature: °F (11°C)
Average annual temperature: °F (20°C)
Baton Rouge, like many cities in the Gulf States, has what is known as 5 seasons. The 5th season is hurricane season, the time of year between June 1 and November 30 when hurricanes are most likely to form.
