Kingston, the capital and largest city of Jamaica, is nestled on the southeastern coast of the island. Visitors often come to the birthplaces of reggae. Trenchtown and other parts of the city may be best visited on a guided tour as it is unwise to visit on your own.
Kingston is the commercial and cultural capital of Jamaica with nearly a million people calling the city home.
At one point, it was the only city in Jamaica. The city is assigned the equivalent of postal codes, (Kingston 5, Kingston 10, etc.) which is a good representation of how truly large this city is, especially for an island such as Jamaica. There are two major sections to this city: 'downtown' and 'uptown,' also referred to as 'New Kingston.'
In Greater Kingston more than  million people live on a plain between the sea and the mountains rising up to 2,250 m above sea level. Since 1872 the city is the seat of government. Kingston can be divided into Downtown, Midtown, Uptown, East Kingston, West Kingston and villa areas in the mountains.
Downtown is the historical old town with a chessboard layout of streets. The south used to be the harbour, but it was remodelled in the 1960s, and today there are bank and government buildings at the sea. A bit north from there is the parade place with a theatre on its northern side. Towards the end of the last century the vacant space was turned into the present-day William Grant Park with trees and benches. In the north this district is delimited by a former oval race track. This track has been turned into the National Heros Park with memorials and governmental buildings.
Midtown is made up of New Kingston and bordering districts. This new part of the city was planned after Jamaican independence and is mostly made up of high-rises. Here are banks, insurance companies, embassies, hotels, the botanical gardens, the zoo and the university complex. In between is the Jamaica House and King's House, the residences of the general governor and the prime minister. Here are also the Bob Marley Museum and the Devon House, a well-preserved mansion from 1881, nowadays housing a museum, as well as shops and restaurants.
Uptown is a dormitory suburb, north of the Washington Boulevard, which in turn is the main artery leading to Spanish Town. The most notable attraction here is the private Constant Spring Golf Club.
East Kingston is a dangerous part of the city between Mountain View Avenue and Up Park Camp. Here shootouts between drug dealers occur frequently. Up Park Camp is the headquarters of the Jamaican Army.
West Kingston on both sides of Spanish Town Road is made famous through the Bob Marley song "Trench Town Rock", and infamous for its gang wars with many victims. On one side there are industries, fuel storages, a power plant, the new container harbour, the regional airport Tinson Pen, the Red Stripe brewery and rum warehouse. On the other side, between Trench Town and Washington Boulevard is a shantytown. The huts are regularly demolished by the government, though they don't build social housing to the extent that it's needed.
The affluent live in the north of the city in gated communities with big gardens. Names of the communities include Beverly Hills, Cherry Gardens, Cedar Valley, Plantation Heights and Sterling Castle.
The first settlement in the area was established in 1509 by the Spanish on a peninsula in front of Kingston and named Caguay or Cabuaya, like the native Taino name for the area. It remained a small settlement until 1655, when the English conquered Jamaica and set up the city and fortification of Port Royal on the same place, and it quickly grew into the largest city in the Caribbean and perhaps its most notorious base for pirates and privateers.
However the 7 June 1692 earthquake meant the end of Port Royal – 3/4 of its inhabitants were killed and most of the city sank into the sea. The survivors established Kingston on the mainland, and in a few decades it became the island's most populous city and an important trade centre for goods from the plantations inland.
In 1872, the island government was moved from Spanish Town to Kingston, which for a long time had been a more important city. In 1907 another major earthquake destroyed much of Kingston, and as such few buildings from before that has survived.
The 1960s were an economically good time for the newly-independent Jamaica and Kingston saw rapid development with the district of New Kingston emerging and the waterfront being remodelled from a harbour to its current shape. Kingston also hosted the 1962 Central American and Caribbean Games and the 1966 Commonwealth Games. Nevertheless, an economical downturn in the 1970s brought with it both political and gang-related violence.
In the 21st century, the situation has improved, and tourism has become one of the city's most important industries. Many visit the city including without any issues.
Kingston's climate is like most of the Caribbean - tropical with constant warm weather and distinct dry and wet seasons. The latter covers May to November, and at that time of the year hurricanes is a risk. As the city is in the rain shadow of the Blue Mountains, notably less rain fall than on the north coast.
Jamaica Tourist Board, 64 Knutsford Boulevard (New Kingston), ☏ +876 929-9210-16, +876 929-9200. (updated Apr 2020)
Since 1992, there has been no passenger rail traffic to Kingston.
Norman Manley International Airport (KIN IATA) (in the southeastern part of the island, overlooking Kingston Harbour on the Palisadoes peninsula), ☏ +1-888-247-7678. Served by Air Canada, Air Jamaica, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Delta, and a number of Caribbean airlines. Be prepared for queues at the airport, to clear immigration and customs, which are fairly strict. It is important that you know where you will be staying and write it down on your immigration form.
There are taxi vans between the airport and town - one person US$28; a group US$33, potentially negotiable. Payment can be in US dollars. The cheapest way is to take bus 98 straight to the Parade in downtown Kingston for J$80. The bus stop outside the arrivals terminal is for bus 98 going towards Port Royal. Just past the bus stop is where bus 98 stops on its way to downtown.
Kingston Tinson Pen (KTP IATA). There is a smaller airport closer to downtown, but there is no longer any regular passenger service to it.

Kingston has an extensive and modern bus system. The Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC) runs the bus system for the government, while private contractors also run the same routes. There are also minibuses and route taxis which are very affordable. Whenever in doubt, ask a bus driver how to get somewhere or where to find a certain bus; they are generally very helpful.
Public transit generally goes through one or more of the three central transportation hubs.
Downtown (Parade and the downtown Kingston Transport Centre). Keep a tight hold of your bags as petty theft is possible as in any large metropolis.
The ultra-modern Half-Way Tree Transport Centre (HWT) in uptown Kingston is generally a safer area, but there are less buses.
Cross Roads an older, congested hub not suggested for tourists.
All official taxis have red license plates that start with PPV.
Route Taxis (a taxi that has a set route and picks up multiple people along it) are also common and often mirror bus routes and are not much more expensive than buses. These are a bit more complicated to get used to, so ask for help.
Charter Taxis (normal taxis) - negotiate a price before getting in the car. Fares range from J$400 to J$5,000 for long routes.
With some practice, bravery, and chutzpah you can rent a car (Island Rent a car allows for one-way car rental). Local rental companies include Caribbean Car Rentalsdead link, Fiesta Car Rentalsdead link, Island Car Rentals and Kosmo Car Rental.
Driving in Kingston, you should be familiar with the ten most important streets to find your way around. There are many one way streets (some without signs) and even more traffic lights. Take a good map and be willing to ask (and keep asking to get a consensus) for directions along the way. It's not safe to drive in the countryside after dark. If you get in a wreck/hit someone, drive to the nearest police station.
Devon House, 26 Hope Rd, ☏ +1 876 926-0815. The Mansion is open M-Sa 9:30AM-5PM, the courtyard 10AM-6PM, and the gardens are open daily 9:30AM-10PM.

J$700 for a tour of the mansion. Entry to garden and shops is free.

The War Office of the West Indies Regiment bought the house in 1814, and it served as a army headquarters and residence for the commanding general. In 1872 it was sold to the colonial administration, whereafter the parliament functioned here until 1960 when it moved to the new Gordon House across the street. The Jamaica National Heritage Trust (JNHT) office has been in the house since 1983, and visitors are welcome.
Ward Theatre. The massive white and blue theatre building north of the William Grant Park is definitely an eyecatcher. The neoclassical building is the third theater building standing on this place and was gifted to the city by rum magnate Colonel Charles J. Ward in 1912. The theatre is a national heritage site and has more than 800 seats with its interior hardly changed since its inauguration. However, not much else has been renovated either, and the building is in a quite bad condition. The population of downtown do not really have a relationship to the cultural side of this building whereas the richer inhabitants avoid the surroundings at nighttime.
University of the West Indies (UWI). This university was established in 1948 on the grounds of the former Mona and Papine sugar plantations. Sights on the campus are the Hope plantage aqueduct build in 1758 and the university's chapel built from stones from the Gayle plantation in Falmouth. (updated Feb 2022)

dead link National Heroes Park. Originally this was the horse race track of Kingston and as such also goes by the names Racecourse or George VI Memorial Park.

There are statues of Paul Bogle, Simon Bolivar, and the Cuban general Antoneo Maceo. On the southern end of the park there are the ministries of finance and education.
William Grant Park. Former parade ground with a colourful history. In 1694 a fortification was built on this place, with the guns aimed at the harbour. It was torn down in 1870 and the place was turned into a parade ground, named Victoria Park after the queen. A statue of Queen Victoria was placed here, in addition to a gallows. In 1977 the park got its current name, and the queen's statue was joined by statues of Alexander Bustamante and Norman Manley. In the end of the 1980s the parade grounds were remodelled into a park.
Hope Botanical Gardens. 08:30-18:30. The Largest Botanical Garden in the Caribbean. The garden gets its name from the man Richard Hope who helped capture Jamaica for Great Britain and was given the property to reward him for his faithfulness to the Crown. Hope established a sugar plantation here. In 1758 the first stone aqueducts were built here, channeling the water of the Hope River and still part of the city's water supply system. In 1881 the government bought a part of the plantation and set up the botanical garden, much of which was first used as an experimental farm. Here new species of sugarcane, coffee, cocoa and pineapple was grown. Until the 1907 earthquake it was possible to travel here by tram from the city centre. Queen Elizabeth II visited the park in 1953 and since that "Royal" has been part of its name. There's a small zoo and a restaurant in the park. The garden has seen better days, but the zoo has been renovated and expanded. Free.

The sculpture features a male and female figure gazing to the skies – symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary. The park is in New Kingston, opened on 31 July 2002, the day before Emancipation Day. Prime Minister P.J. Patterson's address to open the park he acknowledged that the park is a commemoration of the end of slavery.

Lime Cay. Beach off the coast of Port Royale must take a boat from Port Royal fisherman or the hotel to island. Island is famous as the location for final scene in The Harder they Come. Crowded party spot on the weekends with food and drink available for purchase, much more sedate and often deserted on weekdays. You can camp overnight if you arrange a next-day pickup time, but be careful, as you can't exactly swim to shore!
Port Royal. Once known as the "Richest and wickedest city in the world", Port Royal was a notorious pirate haven in the 17th century. The most famous privateer (basically a pirate, but licensed by the British crown) who operated from Port Royal was Sir Henry Morgan who plundered Spanish vessels travelling in the Caribbean and even sacked Panama City. The city prospered as the pirates gathered riches, but a strong earthquake struck the area in 1692 sinking many ships in the harbour, killing many people, and leaving much of the city under the sea. Some claimed the quake was God's punishment for the evildoers of Port Royal. This disaster helped to establish Kingston as the new capital, and many of the survivors moved to Kingston.Although most of the buildings at the port today are not the original buildings, the walls of Fort Charles have been preserved since the rebuilding two years after the earthquake, Saint Peter's Church built in the early 18th century, and the ruins of Fort Rocky remain. There is also a museum to learn more about the history and see artifacts from its heyday.

WARNING: Crime rates are high in and around Kingston, with gang related violence common in many areas. Visitors should avoid West Kingston, August Town, Harbour View, Spanish Town, and Trench Town.
(Information last updated 01 Jan 2024)
Kingston has more crime than the rest of the island and it is one of the most dangerous cities in the world when measured by the murder rate. These mostly take place among members of organized crime, but occasionally others including tourists, end up in the line of fire.
While the Trench Town section of Kingston does have an interesting history, nevertheless no visitor should dare go there unless they're part of a goodwill tour or something similar with a high level of pre-arranged security. The average tourist going there would be signing his or her death warrant. Common-sense and precaution should ensure a pleasant experience in the safer areas of the city, though. After dark, only use cars to get around or stay at your place of abode. If you find yourself in need of the police, the emergency number is 119. Police corruption can also be an issue in the city.
Tourists, especially white tourists, tend to stick out and garner lots of attention, not all of it positive. Hissing and cat calls at women (even accompanied ones) is common. Replying to overzealous touts with "No badda (bother) me" can help.
Homosexuality is not condoned and can elicit violent reactions.
