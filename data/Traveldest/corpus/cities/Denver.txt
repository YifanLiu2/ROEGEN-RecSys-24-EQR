Denver is the capital of the western U.S. state of Colorado and the dominate city of the Rocky Mountain Region. Founded in 1858 as the placer gold mining camp known as the Cherry Creek Diggings, the "Mile-High City" is today the most populous city within a 560-mile (900 km) radius and the center of the Front Range Urban Corridor of more than five million residents. Denver embraces its cowboy and mining past but also looks toward the future with a vibrant arts and performing arts scene, dozens of great outdoor festivals, and distinct neighborhoods each offering a unique experience. You'll find everything a cosmopolitan city has to offer including a spectacular view of and easy access to the beautiful Rocky Mountains, which arise only 12 miles (19 km) west of the Colorado State Capitol.
Denver sits in a broad valley where the High Plains meet the Rocky Mountains at an elevation of 5280 feet (one mile or  m), hence its nickname. In 2020, the City and County of Denver had a population of 715,522, while the 12-county Denver Metropolitan Area had a population of 3,623,560.
Metropolitan Denver does have its growing pains. Urban sprawl has been a problem, with the metropolitan area sometimes growing faster than its infrastructure can handle, especially with public transportation. Denver is generally a driving city, and some problems with pollution and traffic are a part of everyday life. Extensive mass transportation and freeway expansion projects have been completed.
Colorado is on Mountain Standard Time (UCT-07) in the winter and on Mountain Daylight Time (UCT-06) in the summer. The 105th Meridian West, the reference for the Mountain time zone, passes directly through Denver Union Station.

Because it lies in the lee of the mountains, Denver has a milder climate than most surrounding areas. Denver residents enjoy a dry climate with abundant sunshine and four pronounced seasons.
Heavy snowfalls can occur between October and March, often alternating with days of high temperatures and sunshine. About once a year, a snowfall of over a few feet occurs. Winter is also when the Denver area gets pounded by a phenomenon known as the "Chinook". That's when air flows over the mountains to the west and sinks on the leeward (eastern) slopes of the foothills and warms up. This raises air temperatures dramatically, which can last for several days. If you're planning to visit Denver during the winter, be prepared with full winter gear just in case, but also pack a light sweater and T-shirt; the weather is usually very sunny and mild.
Spring in Denver is pleasant, though generally rather brief. Trees begin budding by late March and are in full leaf by mid April to mid May. March, on average, is Denver's snowiest month.
By June, Denver enters its summer season. Temperatures typically rise in earnest at this time, with most heat waves beginning in mid-June and continuing through July, usually Denver's hottest month with temperatures in the high 80s to mid-90s F (30s C). By late July, the southwest monsoon kicks in. In August, short spells of thunderstorms occur about three to four days per week. By late August, temperatures begin to drop with a noticeable difference between day time and night time temperatures. As the days get shorter through September and October, daytime temperatures drop to the high 50s to mid-60s F (mid-10s C). Slather on that sunscreen all summer long; the rays are strong and the air is dry, with temperatures often reaching the upper 90s F (mid-30s C) in July and August.
Autumn is a peaceful time to visit, with mild temperatures, little severe weather and lots of that famous clear blue sky. You'll get to see the trees display their fall colors, which usually peak around mid-September in the mountains and October in the city. October usually brings the first snowfall of the season to Denver, although it's very light. By November, it's clear that winter is on its way, with plenty of clouds, some snow and much cooler temperatures.

Denver is served by Amtrak via its daily California Zephyr service between Chicago and Emeryville, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Westbound trains depart at 8:05AM (for the best views of the Rocky Mountains), and eastbound trains depart at 7:10PM (for a restful night ride to Omaha.) However, as this is one of the longer train routes in the U.S., delays are quite common.
-1054 Denver Union Station, 1701 Wynkoop Street, ☏ +1 833-391-0338. An extensive renovation has restored Union Station to its former glory. It now boasts an on-premise hotel, several restaurants and bars as well as plenty of seating for the tired traveller. Denver Union Station is often cited as the "poster boy" for the revival of train stations, train travel in general and the adjacent neighborhoods that can be observed in several North American and European cities. Union Station is also known for its iconic "travel by train" sign first put there in the 1950s when arrivals at Stapleton Airport started to outstrip traffic at Union Station. In addition to Amtrak trains, RTD commuter and light rail services also call at Union Station, providing easy access to many places in the Denver area if you arrive by train.
Since 1914, Denver has maintained a bison herd at Genessee Park in the foothills west of the city. The herd is still easily viewed along Interstate 70.
Denver is served by five Interstate Highway routes, seven U.S. Highway routes, and a toll road:
I-25 (north and south), I-70 (east and west), and I-76 (northeast) are the major interstates leading in and out of the city. I-225 and I-270 cross the Denver area.
U.S. Highway 40 connects Denver to Salt Lake City to the west.
Interstate 70 connects Denver to Summit County, the location of many major ski areas, to the west.
Interstate 25 connects Denver to Colorado Springs in the south and Cheyenne, Wyoming in the north.
U.S. Highway 36 connects to the northwestern suburbs and on to Boulder.
C-470 Connects to the southern end of E-470 (also accessible from I-25) leading to the south, southwest, and western suburbs.
Toll roads There are a couple of major toll roads in the Denver area, and they can help you avoid some serious rush hour traffic on I-70 and I-25.
E-470 connects the airport to the southeast, east, northeast and northwest suburbs, C-470 at its southern terminus, and the Northwest Parkway at its northern terminus, leading to Boulder. E-470 is a "cashless" toll road: there are no longer any toll plazas and no way to pay tolls except via an in-car device or a billing service. If renting a car, check to see if the rental car agency provides for proper billing; otherwise, you may be subject to billed tolls and hefty service charges. Tolls are $2–4 and without an in-car device, service charges can run to $25 or more.
Northwest Parkway connects to the north end of E-470 leading to north, northeast and northwest suburbs, and Boulder. Also accessible from I-25. Tolls are up to $3 each, and booths accept only cash. There's no attendant between 10PM and 6AM, so pay attention to the signs; though some booths still accept exact change, others require you to pay online or by mail.

The central bus station is in the underground  Union Station Bus Concourse under 17th St behind the historic Union Station building. It can be accessed through the Union Station Building at 1701 Wyncoop St (main entry, location of ticket counters); through the  Wewatta Pavilion at 1700 Wewatta St (behind Union Station); and through the  Chestnut Pavillion at Chestnut Pl & 17th St by the RTD light rail station. The Union Station Bus Concourse is serviced by Burlington Trailways, Greyhound, Express Arrow, Bustang and RTD. The ticket desks are in the main historic building while the buses load underground, under S 17th St between the historic Union Station and the light rail station on Chestnut Pl. Some of the same bus companies make additional stops at Denver Tech Center (DTC) and/or in other places, check schedules. The intercity buses are generally accessed through Gates B3 & B4 from the underground station but check tickets and the TV monitors to be sure as they can be through the other doors too. Skyride 'A' Line train to the airport operates from the historic downtown Union Station:

Numbered avenues run east-west in the north half of the metro area, including suburbs. Ellsworth Avenue is the "equatorial" street. Numbered streets increase as you travel north and are generally called avenues. Avenues south of Ellsworth are also named avenues.
Named streets run north-south. Broadway is the "meridian" street. Ordered alphabetically going up as you travel east or west away from the city center, though not alphabetical closer to the city center. Addresses on named streets correspond to intersecting numbered streets, so "1701 Broadway" is at 17th and Broadway. North-south streets are generally called streets, not avenues.
Downtown streets: The diagonal layout of the downtown area can be tricky, especially for first-time visitors. North of Colfax and west of Broadway, the streets are canted 45 degrees from all other streets in the city. The transition between the two systems is confusing even for locals. Southeast-northwest streets are numbered, while southwest-northeast streets are named. As this was the original grid system of Denver, some vestiges of it exist outside of downtown, creating diagonal cuts in certain parts of the city. Some of those streets include Park Avenue, Speer Boulevard and Morrison Road.
If you plan to go outside of downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods, car rentals are the most convenient form of transportation. Local companies tend to offer better prices, but national chains might be more convenient as far as return policies and hours. Rental companies include most major car rental chains.
Meters are free on Sunday and run until 10PM on weekdays. After 10PM at many of the meters cost $ per hour from 10PM until 8AM at the smart meters. The meters say "overnight parking allowed" but you are still required to pay during this time, or you will get a $25 parking ticket. In the downtown area near Coors Field, the Ball Arena, and LoDo, there is pretty much no free parking on weekdays. In some areas a few blocks from the city center there are a few non-metered spots within reasonable walking distance of downtown. However, just because you don't see a meter doesn't mean that parking is free. Denver is increasingly using European-style meters, where you purchase a paper ticket from a machine somewhere on the block and place it on your dashboard. Also, many neighborhoods around downtown allow only permitted residents to park, so be sure to check the signs first. Some streets have alternate side parking restrictions for cleaning/clearing the streets. Check signs carefully.
The city government has been cracking down on parking violations, so if you park at a meter with a flashing red light and don't pay, even for a few minutes, expect to get a ticket. Meter violations will cost you $25 ($50 if you don't pay up within two weeks). All the meters in the downtown area are equipped with credit card readers that accept Visa and MasterCard. $1 will get you around an hour, depending on the location of the meter.
Areas outside of the downtown core (20th St, Speer, Wynkoop St, Colfax and Broadway) usually have meters that end at 6PM and are free on weekends, so parking is much easier during those times. The area just northwest of downtown, across the train tracks from Union Station, has free 2-hour parking spots (on Wewatta Street just before the Park Avenue bridge).
The area around Union Station is frequently inundated with pedestrians, particularly between Chestnut Place and Wewatta Street, and especially when trains have just arrived and passengers have just disembarked. During daylight hours, there is rarely a break in the action, and that especially goes for days when Rockies home games or other downtown events are taking place. Near Union Station pedestrians have the right of way over vehicles, and drivers will most likely get stuck waiting at crosswalks, sometimes for a long while. For the safety of the pedestrians, and the sanity of the motorist, it is best to avoid driving near Union Station unless absolutely necessary.
The RTD (Regional Transportation District) is the region's primary public transit provider, operating buses and light rail throughout the Denver area.
Denver has a fairly extensive and rapidly growing light raildead link system that can efficiently get you from Downtown to many of the city's suburbs. There are eight rail lines that branch out of Downtown along six corridors: the A line east to Denver International Airport, the B line north to Westminster, the C/D lines south to Englewood and Littleton, the E/F/H lines southeast along I-25, the G line northwest to Arvada and Wheat Ridge, and the W line west to Lakewood and the Denver Federal Center. A ninth line, the R line, travels along I-225 on the east side of Denver, connecting the E/F/H lines with the A line via Aurora. In Downtown, all rail lines either terminate at Union Station or travel through central Downtown via the Convention Center. Rail tickets must be purchased (cash or credit card) from vending machines at the stations or purchase virtual tickets on the RTD App, tickets must be purchased before boarding the trains and cost (as of 2021) between $ and $ for a three-hour pass, depending on how far you travel, age, and economic status, with service to the airport costing from $ to $. Regional day passes also cost from $ to $ (and include travel to or from the airport) and include bus fare.
The backbone of Denver's transportation system is the buses. RTD buses are $ (cash only; exact change required, with discounts available for youth and senior citizens) for a one-way local trip, and with payment you receive a transfer that's valid for three hours from when you board the bus. Day passes are also available and include light rail, for $. There is also a free shuttle, the MallRidedead link, which runs along the 16th Street pedestrian mall through Downtown and is a handy way of traveling between Downtown attractions. More information about RTD can be found at the Union Station and Civic Center bus stations at either end of 16th Street in Downtown, or on the RTD website. Local routes crisscross the city, supplemented by 'Limited' buses that stop less frequently on major arteries like Colfax and Colorado Boulevard; these buses are denoted by an 'L' after the route number, and cost the same as a Local route.
RTD also operates limited intercity coach service, mostly to the north suburbs and the more distant communities of Longmont and Boulder. These services are denoted by letters and tend to leave from Union Station or Civic Center Station at either end of the 16th Street Mall. The Flatiron Flyerdead link offers a fast bus service along express highway lanes between Union Station in Denver and downtown Boulder, with fares ranging from $ to $ depending on distance travelled. If you're in Colorado to ski or board on a budget, Eldora Mountain Resort in Nederland can be reached via the Ski-N-Ride servicedead link (NB bus) from downtown Boulder, seasonally from mid-November to mid-April; fares are $ one-way or covered by a $ daypass. RTD also operates SkyRidedead link service to the airport; see the "By plane" section above for further details.
Denver has a large network of bike trails leading all over the city. The city has a fiercely loyal cycling culture, and it's reflected in the abundance of bike lanes and trails in and around downtown. Main trails run along both Cherry Creek and the Platte, and bike lanes run down many downtown streets. The lanes are sometimes dedicated and sometimes run with traffic, and are marked by a stencil of a bike in the street. The city's designated routes are signed, and you can pick up a bike map at the info centers downtown and at many bike shops.
Don't be afraid to assert yourself in traffic when there is no bike lane - the drivers are, while impatient sometimes, for the most part respectful. Bikes are treated legally like traffic in Denver, and (while admittedly rare), you can get tickets for running red lights and stop signs. Bikes are also expected to ride as far to the right as practicable, unless you're riding in a group of 3 or more - in which case you are considered (and can behave like) a car. Neat, huh?
Bikes are required to have front lights at night, and a good lock is recommended in areas around downtown. Bike theft happens frequently.
Denver is a vibrant city with plenty of attractions for visitors, plus a diverse collection of neighborhoods that can be attractions in themselves. Many of Denver's older areas are the perfect density for exploration; you'll find an interesting mix of apartments and homes with flowery front gardens, wide flagstone sidewalks, bright green lawns and big, shady trees. Capitol Hill, Highlands, Baker, Berkeley, Uptown, Sloan's Lake, Cheesman, Washington, City and Congress Parks are just some of the neighborhoods bustling with people and places to see.
Denver has many beautiful parks that are full of colorful gardens, meandering paths, crystal clear lakes, abundant wildlife and recreation opportunities. The city has a rich pioneer history, and there are plenty of museums where you can learn all about it. It's also a very environmentally conscious city, with one of the nation’s first municipal “Green Fleets”, public transit vehicles using hybrid and alternative fuel and a city tree-planting initiative. Hop on a green bus, grab a bike or just walk around to discover Denver.

Lakeside, 4601 Sheridan Blvd, ☏ +1 303-477-1621. call for hours. A throwback from Denver's past, Lakeside is an amusement park like they used to make; without all the corporate branding and commercialism. While it may have a somewhat seedy exterior, Lakeside is still a staple of local kids' upbringings, and remains a fixture of Denver culture as well as a much cheaper alternative to Elitch Gardens. Coaster buffs will squeal with glee over the Cyclone, the park's original 1940 Edward Vettel-designed wood coaster.

Colorado Symphony, Boettcher Concert Hall (in the Denver Performing Arts Complex), ☏ +1 303-623-7876. September–June. The Colorado Symphony Orchestra is an American orchestra established in 1989, as the successor to the Denver Symphony.
Denver Center for the Performing Arts, The Buell Theatre (in the Denver Performing Arts Complex), ☏ +1 303-893-4100. Year-round. Spend an evening at the theater watching anything from revivals to world premieres. The center hosts a Tony Award-winning professional resident company, and touring productions.
Opera Colorado, Ellie Caulkins Opera House (in the Denver Performing Arts Complex), ☏ +1 303-778-1500. November–May. This young company performs classic operas in their downtown venue. $30-160.
Besides this complex, you can find smaller venues, restaurants, and cafes for a unique and exciting experience.
Mercury Cafe, 2199 California St, ☏ +1 303-294-9281. Highly recommended. This popular restaurant/cafe/event center is a must for any lovers of poetry, theater, or counterculture. Live music almost every night, salsa classes, and more. Particularly recommended Sundays nights, when it hosts Denver's best poetry slam. Often, you might run into well-known names like Andrea Gibson. Check out their schedule for more information.
There are a bunch of places in town where you can catch a concert, but the most interesting and unique venue in the larger Denver area is almost inarguably the Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, a huge outdoor space surrounded by rock formations that make for not only a stunningly beautiful setting but also naturally perfect acoustics.
Bluebird Theater, 3317 E Colfax Ave, ☏ +1 303-322-2308. A beautiful old World War I-era silent movie palace on Colfax Avenue, now repurposed as a music hall where concerts in a variety of genres (primarily rock, but also blues, country, bluegrass and the like) are presented in an intimate setting.
Fillmore Auditorium, 1510 Clarkson St. Capitol Hill is where you'll find arguably the epicenter of Denver's live music scene. This cavernous and newly-renovated space is famous for its dual Minors with Adults Liquor License, so if you're underage, you're not necessarily segregated into crappy seats.
hi-dive, 7 S Broadway (cross streets: Ellsworth & Broadway). A small, scruffy bar with character to the hilt, hi-dive is mostly a place to go if you want to check out Denver's local music scene. But it's also made a name for itself as a place rising stars play just before they make it big, so come out to a show here and maybe you can say you "saw them when..."
Larimer Lounge, 2721 Larimer St, ☏ +1 303-291-1007. You can't miss this hipster-friendly club and concert hall in RiNo, with huge, brightly painted Op Art murals covering the whole front of the building. Catch mostly local rock, country, and electronica acts, with a few national touring artists to mix things up, in an ambience that's a lot cleaner and less skeevy than some of the dives around town.
Lion's Lair, 2022 E. Colfax Ave, ☏ +1 303-322-2308. Famous, or should we say infamous, dive bar in Colfax that's been a gathering place for Denver-area punk, hardcore, and thrash fans since the 80s. The drinks are cheap, the lights are dim, and the ambience is grungy - and that's meant in a good way.
Ogden Theatre, 935 E Colfax Ave. Like the smaller Bluebird, the Ogden Theatre is another old silent movie house and vaudeville hall that's been repurposed as a music venue. Whatever your favorite genre - rock, hip-hop, R&B, electronica, country - you can probably find a show you like at this affable midsize venue.
Oriental Theater, 4335 W 44th Ave, ☏ +1 303-455-2124. Yet another movie palace turned music venue, the Oriental is the Berkeley neighborhood's destination of choice for everyone from rock and rollers to stand-up comedy fans to arthouse cinephiles.
Colorado Avalanche retired jersey numbers at the Pepsi Center
Denver is the only city in the Rocky Mountains with teams in all of North America's "big four" pro sports leagues.
Denver Broncos, Empower Field at Mile High, 1701 Bryant St, ☏ +1 720-258-3333. The Broncos are among the most successful teams in the National Football League, making frequent playoff runs and winning three Super Bowls, most recently in the 2015 season. They have had a number of famous quarterbacks, most notably John Elway, who won two Super Bowls as the Broncos quarterback in his final two seasons as a player and now manages the franchise; and Peyton Manning, who played his final four seasons in Denver after being let go by Indianapolis, with the Broncos' most recent Super Bowl win coming in his last game. (updated Aug 2018)
Colorado Avalanche, Ball Arena, 1000 Chopper Circle, ☏ +1 303-405-1100. In 1995, the erstwhile Quebec Nordiques landed with a bang in Denver, winning the Stanley Cup in their first season in their new home city, following it up with another championship in 2001, and most recently winning it all in 2022. They've had their ups and downs since then, but they're always solid playoff contenders in the National Hockey League. Will this be the year they go for number four? Head to Ball Arena just outside of downtown and find out.
Colorado Rockies, Coors Field, 2001 Blake St (on the edge of the LoDo neighborhood), ☏ +1 303-762-5437. Ballpark tours at noon and 2PM on M-Sa non-game days during the season and M W F Sa during the off-season. Denver's Major League Baseball team plays in Coors Field, one of the most beloved ballparks in the major leagues and the most hitter-friendly park as well, thanks to Denver's dry air and high altitude. Tickets range from the $4 "Rockpile" bleachers behind center field to $60 for a seat behind home plate. Behind-the-scenes tours of the ballpark are available. Tickets $4-60, Ballpark tours $9 adults, $7 seniors, $6 children.
Denver Nuggets, Ball Arena, 1000 Chopper Circle, ☏ +1 303-405-1100. After decades of disappointment, Denver's National Basketball Association team finally saw a measure of success for a couple seasons in the late 2000s, when superstars Chauncey Billups and Carmelo Anthony led them to back-to-back first-place finishes in the league (followed by quick implosions in the playoffs). After a few years in the bottom of the league, the Nuggets rose to contention in the early 2020s, led by two-time league MVP Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray, and capped it off with the team's first NBA title in 2023. Win or lose, Denverites reliably turn out to matches at Ball Arena, for a long time hoping this was the year they either turned things around or took the next step toward a championship, and now hoping they can add to their title collection.
Denver is represented in many smaller leagues too. Of special note among these niche sports is rugby union, which has an outsize following around here: not one but two of America's leagues field teams in the Mile High City.
Colorado Rapids, Dick's Sporting Goods Park, 6000 Victory Way, Commerce City, ☏ +1 303-727-3500. A charter member of Major League Soccer, the Colorado Rapids are a consistent draw despite generally middling success on the field. The biggest games of the season see the Rapids face off against their hated rivals, Real Salt Lake.
Colorado Mammoth, Ball Arena, 1000 Chopper Circle, ☏ +1 303-405-1100. They may have only won one Champions' Cup, in 2006, but the Mammoth are a perennial force to be reckoned with in the National Lacrosse League. They play at Ball Arena, and tickets are easy to come by (and a relative steal, starting at $10 for single seats).
Glendale Raptors Rugby Club, Infinity Park, 4599 E. Tennessee Ave., Glendale, ☏ +1 303-639-4604. Rugby union club whose top side competes in Major League Rugby, the USA's latest attempt at a professional league in the sport. The organization also fields women's, developmental men's, and youth teams, some of which play as the Glendale Merlins. Also of note: In 2018, Infinity Park became home to the USA Women's Sevens, a tournament in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series for national teams in rugby sevens, a variant of union with 7 players per side instead of 15, with halves of 7 minutes instead of 40. (updated Oct 2018)
Denver Barbarians Rugby Club, Dick's Sporting Goods Park, 6000 Victory Way, Commerce City. The lower-profile but more successful of Denver's two rugby union teams, competing in the U.S. Rugby Super League since 1967 with three championships to their name.

Mexican food is abundant and satisfying and takes a local Denver flavor. Green chili is the order of the day: a brown, chunky and spicy sauce made from pork and Pueblo or Hatch green chilies that works well on everything from chorizo and eggs to tamales. Denver is also known for "western" food using ingredients such as angus beef, buffalo, rattlesnake, cutthroat trout and Rocky Mountain oysters. The city also embraces its cultural diversity with a wide range of ethnic restaurants. Southeast Asian restaurants are especially abundant with a multitude of Thai and Vietnamese restaurants in every style and price range. Like other large cities, Denver has most types of cuisine, and several restaurants have been noted in top food publications. Smoking inside bars and restaurants is prohibited statewide; however, some places with outdoor patios still allow smoking there.

The effects of alcohol are magnified at higher elevations, so people may find themselves inebriated more quickly and with greater effect than they would at lower altitudes. Moderation is probably a good idea until you understand your body's reaction to alcohol and can acclimatize to its effects at higher elevations.
That said, the following are some of the best bar-hopping locales in the city:

Colfax Avenue, described by Playboy Magazine as the "longest, wickedest, street in America," stretches 26 miles through Denver and its suburbs.

Denver is quite safe for a city its size. Use common sense when traveling, particularly in downtown and some of the other inner-city neighborhoods. Denver does have a visible population of people experiencing homelessness, but the city has strict laws about accosting for money. In general, panhandlers don't harm anyone. Downtown has a fairly active 24/7 population, especially in LoDo, so it's generally safe.
Still, it may be a good idea not to travel alone at night in some of the neighborhoods surrounding downtown. Although the inner-city neighborhoods are not as bad as those in some other cities, they have higher rates of crime than the rest of the city. The rest of Denver is safe, though.
Like the rest of the United States, the emergency number in Denver is 911. This will connect you to the local emergency services (police, medical, and fire). If you need to report a crime to the police, such as a burglary (not in progress), minor assault (no injuries and not in progress), car theft, etc. Dial ☏ +1 720-913-2000 and request for police assistance.
The Denver Police is the main police force for the Denver Metro area. Most police officers are polite and trustworthy individuals, so if you need assistance, approaching a police officer is a good idea.
Mile High Marker on the State Capitol building
Altitude sickness or Acute Mountain Sickness is an ailment that potentially anyone can have when they visit areas with higher altitudes than they are used to, due to decreases in barometric pressure (though not oxygen content). Denver is called the Mile High City for a reason—at an altitude of a mile above sea level, one can start to experience some of the effects of altitude sickness, though this condition generally becomes more pronounced at elevations around 8000 ft (2500 m) and above. Some normal changes may occur when people travel to higher altitudes that are not altitude sickness. These include the following:
Hyperventilation (breathing faster and/or deeper than normal)
The above are generally nothing to worry about, though problems with breathing may be helped by a drug called acetazolamide. If you think you may have problems, get advice from your doctor before traveling to Denver.
Some people get Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), which can be serious, at the higher elevations you will experience if you are touring through the Rocky Mountains. A diagnosis of AMS is usually given if a person has a headache accompanied by one of more of the following symptoms:
Loss of appetite, vomiting and/or nausea
Some people liken AMS to a bad hangover or worse. It occurs because your brain tissue swells at higher elevations than it is used to. If you are feeling unwell at high altitudes, assume that you are suffering from AMS unless there is another logical explanation that would be accompanied by other symptoms (food poisoning or a viral infection).
To avoid AMS, try to get to a lower elevation until your symptoms subside, drink lots of fluid to avoid dehydration, and avoid traveling at high rates of ascent. If the symptoms continue or worsen, travel to a lower altitude. AMS can turn into High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE), a potentially fatal condition where the brain swells so much that it ceases to function properly. Symptoms of HACE include confusion, inability to think clearly, lethargy, ataxia (walking staggerdly, as if one was drunk), and changes in behavior. The person may not recognize having HACE, but if you any of you experiences any of these symptoms (especially ataxia), immediately make sure the person is taken to lower elevations for medical treatment.
Another very serious condition, called High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) causes fluid in the lungs. If someone suffers chest tightness, congestion, gurgling breaths, blue or gray fingers or lips, cough producing frothy or pink liquid, and difficulty breathing even at rest, they should be taken to a lower elevation and receive medical treatment immediately.
Although not particularly common, keep in mind that these illnesses are possible and that anyone is susceptible to them, even if you have traveled to high elevations before.
Another medical concern at higher elevations, particularly those in Colorado and Denver, is sunburn and skin cancer. The higher elevation means that there is less atmosphere protecting the skin from harmful solar radiation. This is especially true in Colorado, with both dry air that saps the skin of protective moisture and with the beautifully sunny days we have in the state.
Colorado has the highest rate of skin cancer in the country, so it is always a good idea to wear a lot of high SPF sun-screen, hats, long sleeve shirts and pants. Don't think that you are protected from the sun in the winter either. The sun's rays can actually be reflected by the snow on the ground, still causing skin damage, so when in Colorado, do as the locals do, and wear sunscreen on any exposed skin surface at any time of the year.

For skiers and snowboarders, winter is the best time to visit Denver. Hordes of people fly into Denver International Airport each season on their way up to the ski capitals of Summit and Eagle counties, including Vail, Beaver Creek, Copper Mountain, Keystone, Loveland Basin, Arapahoe Basin, and Breckenridge, Winter Park; a little further away are Steamboat, and Aspen. You can find information on resort shuttles at the desks in DIA's main terminal.
There are many ski resorts about 1½–2 hours west of Denver along I-70, but weekend traffic to them can be very slow, especially in inclement weather. Steer clear of the crowds by skiing during the week or planning your trip outside the busy season (Thanksgiving to New Year's). There are also plenty of mountain trails for snowshoers and cross-country skiers, which are generally free. You can also take the RTD Ski-n-Ride service from Boulder to Eldora Ski Resort west of Boulder, which is the only resort with scheduled bus service. Winter Park (Colorado) receives train service with the Winter Park Express operated by Amtrak. Departures are once every Saturday and Sunday from January to March at 7AM with the return trip departing Winter Park at 4:30PM.
See the National Parks of Colorado.
