San Antonio is the second largest city in the state of Texas and the 7th largest in the United States. It's the 24th largest metropolitan area in the country. Visited by more than 31 million annual visitors, San Antonio is a beautiful city at the axis of three different geological terrains: Hill Country, South Texas Plains and Prairie and Lakes. There's a lot to do in this city: fine art museums, historical missions and plenty of amusement parks in addition to great dining and lots of drinking. The culture and people are vibrant and interesting. San Antonio's downtown is one of the most lively in the nation.
Downtown San Antonio from the Tower of the Americas
San Antonio is considered to be the cradle of Texan liberty. Its best-known landmark is the Alamo, the site of the famous battle (1836) where Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie were killed. When most visitors see the Alamo for the first time, their common reaction is "Hm, I thought it would be bigger."
No other city in Texas reflects the state's Spanish and Mexican heritage better than San Antonio. Hispanics make up a considerable fraction of the population and it shows in most places. The Hispanic atmosphere of San Antonio makes it a truly unique U.S. city. This becomes most evident during Fiesta week, a yearly celebration that attracts  million people to its over one hundred events including parades, music, festivals, fairs and food and drink in the charming downtown streets of the city. San Antonio also has a significant African-American population.
San Antonio, with a population of about  million (2020), and a metro population of nearly  million (2018), still enjoys a small-town feel despite the hustle and bustle. Its people are friendly, open and bicultural, and the concentration of population around its center makes it easy to get just about anywhere within a 30- to 40-minute drive.

San Antonio's bus system, the VIA Metropolitan Transit, runs the downtown trolley service (actually a bus) for a small fare. Bus fares range from about $ to $ depending on the service with a one-day $ pass (for purchase at some retail outlets see VIA's Website under Fare information) for all routes.
There are 4 types of routes: Express, Skip, Frequent, and Metro. The Express routes usually run from the sub-urban areas (mostly Park and Rides) to downtown. Most of them run about once every 30 minutes. Skip service usually runs along the streets with high traffic. They usually do not stop at bus stops that are served by the frequent routes. Skip routes also usually run about every 30 minutes. Frequent routes can also be found on high traffic roads and as the name implies, the stops are very frequent. Although Frequent routes come by about once every 15 minutes, it is usually faster to wait a little longer and take the Skip routes if you are going a long distance,for example on San Pedro ave, it is usually quicker to wait for the #3 (Skip) as opposed to the #4 (Frequent) if you wanted to get from downtown to North Star Mall. Metro service is usually found in neighborhoods around the city, frequency varies with each route, but they usually run about once an hour.
Discount fares are available to children between the ages of 5 and 11, senior citizens 62 and older, Medicare recipients, persons with disabilities and students. A reduced fee ID is required for reduced fares and can be acquired from VIA Information Centers (students may get the necessary forms from their campus administration). Bus schedules and route information can be found at VIA's website, by calling the VIA information line +1 210-362-2020 or for the hearing impaired at +1 210-362-2019, or at the San Antonio Visitor Information Center.

By American standards, San Antonio is safe for its size; despite a rather high poverty rate and the racial tensions that flared up around the country since 2017, the Alamo City has managed to avoid most of the crime waves that hit other American cities. As long as you take elementary precautions, you'll have a fantastic time. Even when there are crowds for such events like the Alamo Bowl, it is still relatively safe. The River Walk always has something going on, but if you're in one of the quieter spots at night, exercise some caution.
San Antonio has a high rate of cars break-ins. Do not leave any belongings in your car.
Some neighborhoods in the east (Eastwood Village, Wheatley Heights, Arena District) should be approached with caution at night, though they are of little interest to tourists unless you. In San Antonio, if a place looks iffy, don't go there at night.
As of Dec 2021, San Antonio has 5G from AT&T Mobility and T-Mobile. Free WiFi is widely available.
