Columbus is a huge city with several district articles that contain information about specific sights, restaurants, and accommodation.
Columbus is the capital of the American state of Ohio and is located centrally within the state as the core of the Greater Columbus area. Sited in an area where the Rust Belt, Bible Belt, Appalachia, and the Farm Belt meet, Columbus is a fusion of many different parts of America. It is the home of the Ohio State University. The combination of Ohio Government and the Ohio State University has fueled amazing growth both financially and physically in Columbus. It has created a business and research environment that has provided substantial employment opportunities to the diverse ethnic and local graduates of the Ohio State University, and other academic institutions in Columbus. The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), is projected to be one of the top 50 supercomputers in the world and among the top 10 supercomputing academic centers. It also ranked number 1 on About.com's list of the United States' Most Underrated Gay Cities.

Named after the Italian explorer who sailed under the Spanish flag, this city is the largest in Ohio in terms of population with 906,000 in 2021, and the 14th largest city in the United States—though with only million people, the metropolitan statistical area is relatively small (the 32nd largest in the nation and the 3rd of 4th largest in Ohio). Major area employers are state government (as the state capital), Ohio State University (the largest student population in the nation) and numerous Fortune 500 companies headquartered here (Cardinal Health, Nationwide Insurance, Limited Brands, etc.) It is a day's drive from one half of the U.S. population and is located at the intersection of I-70 and I-71.
Generally arranged in a really big wheel, Columbus is the central hub to many nearby cities including (clockwise from the north):

The COTA bus service can take you to most important places in the city, which should be about 5 blocks away from any conceivable location you need to go to. This service costs $ for an Express bus and $ for a Local/Crosstown bus. Transfers for a Local/Crosstown bus are free, but transfers between bus types, such as from a Local to an Express route, are subject to an upcharge. Ask the bus driver for a transfer when you pay your fare, and you'll be given a transfer pass that you use when boarding the next bus. You cannot use a transfer pass to board a bus on the same line that travels in the opposite direction (i.e. you cannot get off a bus line and use the transfer pass to board a bus going the other way).
Most of High St (US Route 23) from Clintonville in the north to Merion Village in the south is pedestrian-friendly, and while areas between campus and the Short North had been fairly rough, gentrification and the growth of student housing, boutique shops, and restaurants has created a fairly continuous stretch of safe by-foot travel.
Downtown Columbus is a walkable area with most attractions within a 20-minute walk of each other. The Columbus Landmarks Foundation conducts walking tours, too.
Columbus is a car-centric city, with usage of a car required outside of the areas directly surrounding downtown. Parking is extensive (and reasonably priced) at almost all major destinations. There are many surface lots and garages around the city. There are only a few areas of the city, like the Short North, where parking can be hard to come by; those locations feature abundant valet parking at $5 per vehicle. U-turns are illegal citywide in Columbus.
Downtown is a short drive ($20-50 taxi fare) from the airport via I-670W. Uber and Lyft are also available, and tend to run on the lower end of that $20-50 range.
Columbus is notorious for aggressive towing companies, especially downtown, on campus, and in the Short North. Before you park somewhere, make sure that it does not have a "Private Parking" or "Tow Away Zone" sign nearby.
CoGo Bike Share. A bike sharing program with stations in downtown, surrounding communities and Easton Town Center; pick up a bike at any station and return it to any station. A pass enables unlimited 30 minute trips. $6/24 hour pass.
Most Columbus museums are located near Downtown, or near the Ohio State University.
The Ohio Statehouse and other buildings in the downtown core serve as distinct architectural landmarks.
The neighborhoods on the outskirts of Downtown are usually very distinctive. These include the German Village, The Short North, the Victorian Village, and others.

A major test market for most major chain restaurants (though this is not as true as it once was), Columbus has a large density of national chain restaurants, some even having multiple venues in a single neighborhood.
That being said, Columbus has a growing ethnic and upper class dining scene thanks in part to continued immigration (from Africa, especially Somalia and Ghana, Southeast Asia, and Latin America) and the continued gentrification of the downtown area.

Broad Street in Downtown Columbus is home to a number of Christian churches of considerable historic and architectural interest, including First Congregational United Church of Christ, where Washington Gladden, a pioneer in the Social Gospel movement, preached from 1882-1918. Both First Congregational and the nearby Catholic cathedral, St. Joseph's, offer a range of special services and concerts throughout the year.

Broadly speaking, the northwest quadrant of the city (north of I-670 and west of I-71, including Clintonville, Grandview, Upper Arlington, Worthington, Dublin, and Hilliard) is the safe zone from a crime perspective. The other three quadrants, especially along Broad Street (US-40) and Cleveland Avenue (OH-3), are overall less so, although German Village and Bexley are notable oases in the southeast. Outside the I-270 outer belt, the risk of crime diminishes greatly.
Visitors to the area should be aware that the theft of laptop computers, phones, and other items from automobiles is a common occurrence. Always store valuables in the cargo compartment of one's car and make sure it is locked.
Theft of vehicles themselves has achieved a great deal of notoriety in the 2020s. Kias and Hyundais are targeted because of a vulnerability that enables a knowledgeable thief to operate the vehicle without the key. Thieves are often juveniles who steal the cars for the purpose of joyriding, but they are still dangerous and you should never confront them. Police recommend that drivers of affected vehicles use a steering wheel lock to deter this type of crime; occasionally they give these out for free.
Motorists who drink and drive will face stiff penalties if one's blood alcohol concentration is above the legal limit (). Police routinely set up checkpoints along major roads where all drivers must pass through and show their license and registration to check for intoxicated people.
Vehicles are required by law to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks. However, the law is not universally followed. Take care to watch for turning traffic when crossing streets. Conversely, the OSU campus is pedestrian-dominated, and drivers should be alert for jaywalkers.
Columbus has three major networks of hospitals, all of which offer a high standard of medical care. Each has many locations; the major hospitals are listed here, and others may be found on the district pages. Your insurance may not cover all three networks.
