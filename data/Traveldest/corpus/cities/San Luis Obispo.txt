San Luis Obispo is a city in San Luis Obispo County in the Central Coast region of California.
San Luis Obispo; Cerro San Luis (the hill for which the city is named) is on the right
About half way between Los Angeles (200 miles / 320 km to the south) and San Francisco (230 miles / 370 km to the north), nine small but impressive volcanic peaks march down a valley of the Santa Lucia range to the Pacific Ocean. Nestled around two of these peaks is San Luis Obispo ("SLO", "slow", or "San Luis" to locals), a small college town that also is one of California's oldest communities. San Luis and its neighboring communities boast extraordinary resources for hiking, mountain biking, sea kayaking, swimming and surfing; outstanding natural beauty; a carefully preserved and thriving 19th-century downtown centered around a meticulously restored 18th-century mission; a small but thriving art gallery scene; and a large and growing collection of top-quality wineries.
San Luis Obispo is bounded by the imposing line of Cuesta Ridge to the northeast, the Irish Hills to the southwest, dramatic Bishop Peak to the northwest and Islay Hill to the southeast. The town clusters around the feet of the 1,000-foot (300-meter) Cerro San Luis, notably marked with a big white "M" (for Mission High School). Both locals and visitors frequently refer to Cerro San Luis as "Madonna Mountain" and a common misconception is that the "M" represents the surname "Madonna;" the famous Madonna Inn sits at the foot of the mountain and the city of San Luis Obispo negotiated public access to the peak with the Madonna family. Cal Poly sits hard against Cuesta Ridge (with its big white "P") and the downtown area runs from Cerro San Luis roughly toward campus around two parallel streets, Higuera and Monterey. Most restaurants, bars and shops are located on Higuera Street, nearer the Mission and Cerro San Luis; hotels are mostly located on Monterey Street, nearer the university but still within a mile (2 km) of the central downtown. A few restaurants are located in the charming Railroad District, about 5 blocks east of Higuera via Santa Rosa Street, near the train station and youth hostel.
San Luis Obispo Visitors Center, 895 Monterey St. (in the same building as the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, on the corner of Morro and Monterey Streets in the heart of downtown), ☏ +1 805 781-2777, visitorcenter@slochamber.org. Su-W 10AM-5PM; Th-Sa 10AM-7PM. The Visitor Center offers San Luis Obispo city maps, visitor guides, books about San Luis Obispo, and San Luis Obispo souvenirs. Welcoming Information Specialists are at the ready to answer questions and provide recommendations on what to do, see, eat and explore during your visit.

San Luis Obispo has a one-terminal airport,  San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport (SBP IATA). Scheduled flights are available from Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Portland, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Seattle on Alaska Air, American Airlines, and United. Taxis and Uber/Lyft is available, as well as rental cars, and the 1A and 1B city bus routes link the airport to downtown. (updated Jun 2021)
Central Coast Shuttle has 7 trips a day between the Los Angeles/LAX and Santa Maria Airport, about 35 miles (56 km) south. This is a limited option, an Uber or ride from a friend must be procured, but may work in your situation.
Air Charter or air taxi is another alternative, where you can catch flights to San Diego for the weekend, or to any large or small airport. Air charters and air taxis fly point-to-point, at the departure time, departure airport, and arrival airport of the passengers' choosing. Prices start around $150 for a seat on flights that might already be going to your destination, or go from $1,000 to $10,000 or more for a custom-chartered flight where you hire the aircraft to fly you directly to your destination, any time you want to go. On-demand flights, and seats on flights already chartered to/from San Luis Obispo are offered by Pacific Air Taxi. Air taxi flights have a much shorter check-in time (typically just 15 minutes) than larger airlines, so you can just arrive and go. Travel time for an air taxi flight is usually 80 minutes from SLO to Sacramento.

From Los Angeles, the route traverses the wild coastline of Vandenburg Air Force Base, which is otherwise inaccessible to civilians. During the winter, Coast Starlight travelers should enjoy great sunset views after departing San Luis Osbispo southbound.

Since San Luis Obispo is home to the first ever motel (The Milestone Mo-Tel) it is definitely a car town. Both Highway 101 and Highway 1 run through town, with the two overlapping from San Luis Obispo until they split again further south in Pismo Beach. San Luis Obispo is the south end of dramatic Big Sur stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway (California Highway 1), inasmuch as the PCH rejoins Highway 101 in town. Highway 101 turns inland from San Luis, traversing the historic Cuesta Grade over the Santa Lucia Range to Atascadero and Paso Robles, then onward through the Salinas Valley to the San Francisco Bay Area. Travellers opting for the very worthwhile scenery of Big Sur via the PCH should be aware that driving times are much longer than by the 101.
Car is the easiest way to get around town and the larger region, but many locals opt to travel by bike or to walk within the city.

The Madonna Inn's ornate exterior

Founded in 1772 by Junipero Serra, Mission San Luis Obispo was the fifth Catholic mission in California. Still an active parish, it is in the middle of downtown on Chorro St and Monterey St, with its main courtyard interrupting Monterey St for a full city block. In addition to the church, there is a small museum; both are definitely worth visiting. The Mission is part of the Mission Plaza development, which incorporates San Luis Creek and a number of stores and restaurants. Walk from the Mission to the creek and up to one of the restaurants for a bite to eat. Admission is by donation.
History Center of San Luis Obispo County, 696 Monterey St (across Broad St from the Mission), ☏ +1 805-543-0638. Every day except Tu 10AM-4PM. Housed in a beautiful library donated by Andrew Carnegie. There are three separate exhibit areas (two medium-sized rooms and a set of two much smaller rooms). There is a friendly attendant, and there is a good chance that you will find the exhibits interesting and worth looking at. For example, in October 2014, there were exhibits of impressive baskets by Native American tribes from the region and historic photographs of people and buildings in San Luis in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Free.
San Luis Obispo Museum of Art, 1010 Broad St (on the west end of the Mission Plaza), ☏ +1 805-543-8562. Every day (except Tu from Labor Day through July 3) 11AM-5PM. Really just a relatively large art gallery (or a couple of galleries), with art for sale. You might or might not find it interesting, but admission is free.
Take some time to walk around the downtown area. It's changed rapidly over the past decade with the introduction of new developments and larger chain restaurants/stores, but still maintains a wonderful small town feel with the addition of pedestrian corridors between streets where you'll find locals hanging out.
Take a look at Bubble Gum Alley and leave some of your own chewed gum behind. Located on the south side of Higuera Street between Broad St. and Garden St.
Depending on the season, college basketball, baseball, volleyball, soccer, and football games can be seen at the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), in the hills on the northern end of town. Games are generally $5 for non-Cal Poly students.

There are many places to hike and mountain bike in San Luis Obispo. The Santa Lucia mountains and the "Nine Sisters" offer many beautiful views of the city and the countryside. The two most popular hikes are Bishop Peak (no bikes allowed) and Cerro San Luis (multiple biking trails). If you're interested in other mountain biking trails around the county check out the list at CCCMB, a volunteer organization that creates and maintains trails countywide.
Visit Montana de Oro State Park. Take Los Osos Valley Road 10 miles (16 km) west of town to a park named one of the state's best-kept secrets by the L.A. Times a few years back, and with good reason; it's filled with an abundance of hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails both along the ocean along the bluffs and inland into the coastal peaks; a dramatic cove with caves that kids and adults love; and miles of sandy beach and tidal pools. Trails range from casual ambles along the bluffs to the steep climbs up Valencia and Oats Peaks. Oats is the longer hike (about  miles / 9 km) but more rewarding, as it offers views of Valencia against the Pacific, as well as northward and eastward to the Nine Sisters and Cuesta Ridge; the trail also is less steep. A terrific nine-mile (14-km) loop can be made by continuing over the summit to the Coon Creek trail, then crossing back in front of the range along Rattlesnake Flats Trail. Take water! The "Mountain of Gold" also reigns as a popular out-and-back destination for the many road cyclists in the county, but cyclists ride westward early as strong winds pick up through Los Osos Valley in the early afternoon.
Walk or bike to Poly Canyon. Located on the north east side of the Cal Poly campus. Poly Canyon is a hilly, open, grassy area where many Cal Poly engineering and architecture students have constructed senior projects. The road up can be reached by taking the main road towards the Poly Canyon Village housing complex and taking a right before the road dips down the hill on a smaller road with a gate that quickly turns to dirt/gravel. Public vehicles are not allowed to drive on it, though be alert for university vehicles travelling up and down on occasion and student runners/cyclists.
Kayaks and other outdoor gear can be rented at reasonable prices by students and the public from Poly Escapes on the Cal Poly campus. Kayaking is possible in many places in the county, but the most exciting place to kayak is between Shell Beach and Pismo Beach where there are sea caves you can explore. There are guided tours of the so-called "Dinosaur Caves" available from several kayak rental shops in Pismo Beach.
San Luis Obispo Children's Museum, 1010 Nipomo Street, ☏ +1 805 544-5437, info@slocm.org. Th-M 10AM-4PM. Nipomo and Monterey. The Children's Museum is an interactive, family experience, inspiring learning through play. Great for families with young children. (updated Mar 2024)
See a movie downtown at the Fremont Theatre or The Palm Theater. The Fremont is located downtown on Monterey St and has become an instantly recognizable landmark with its vivid neon signage. The beautiful classic main theatre room is used primarily for the largest movie being screened while the rest are shown in smaller modern theaters built in a hidden addition. The Palm Theatre is a local movie theatre that instead showcases the very best of independent, foreign, art house, and mainstream cinema. Located downtown on the corner of Palm and Broad, it is an easy walk and located next to two of the main parking garage facilities.

This page uses the following price ranges for a typical meal for one, including soft drink:
Due in large part to the dearth of affordable ethnic eateries (SLO is a very white town), dining in town will set you back a few dollars. None of the local restaurants stands out with a consistently good menu (with the possible exception of the pricey Koberl) although several have some great dishes. Consequently, a fun and satisfying way to explore downtown is to have an itinerant dinner, sampling appetizers, salads, and a main course or two at a variety of eateries.
Bliss Café, At the Downtown SLO Farmers' Market, ☏ +1 805 547-0108. Th 6-9PM.

(updated Jan 2017)
Novo Restaurant And Lounge, 726 Higuera St, ☏ +1 805 543-3986. Open until midnight on Saturdays, with last reservation time 9:30PM. This eatery is beloved by locals, although the expense of a visit is justified more by the truly lovely atmosphere than by the middling quality of the menu, which features "international" foods prepared with fresh local ingredients.

Avila Beach - Avila Beach is a small coastal community 10 miles (16 km) southwest of San Luis Obispo that offers a number of quaint inns, spas and resorts. Point San Luis, accessible via a scenic docent-led hike or by trolley, is home to a lighthouse that dates back to 1890 and is the only surviving Prairie Victorian on the West Coast. Visitors looking for relaxation can soak in nearby mineral hot springs or lounge on the sandy beach that gives the town its name.
Carrizo Plain National Monument - 75 miles (120 km) east of San Luis Obispo, this remote national monument is home to the largest remaining native grassland in California. During wet years it boasts spectacular wildflowers in the spring, and Soda Lake is an important wintering area for waterfowl when precipitation is sufficient to flood the seasonal lakebed. The park is also home to Painted Rock, a Native American site that has been adorned with pictographs over thousands of years.
