Georgetown is the largest city in and capital of Guyana. Georgetown is primarily the business and governmental seat of the country but its fascinating wooden colonial buildings also provide a different experience for tourists. Most tourists visit Georgetown as a launching point to the rainforests of the interior.
Founded as a small Dutch settlement in the 18th century, Georgetown has changed hands between the British, Dutch and French many times - not unusual for places in or near the Caribbean. The influence of several colonial powers is visible in place names. The city got its current name after the British King George III in 1812.
Georgetown is home to about 200,000 inhabitants, around one in four of whom are Guyanese, and is by far the commercial and administrative centre of the country, as well as an important entry point and transport hub. Sitting on the shore of the Atlantic, the city is one metre below sea level and protected by a seawall from the ocean. The city with its surroundings has a notable network of canals. Many homes in the suburbs are built on high stilts to prevent water damage when the dyke protections fail.
A few degrees north of the Equator, Georgetown has a tropical rainforest climate with stable temperatures around the year; daytime highs at 30°C and nighttime lows at 23°C. There is no true dry season, but February-March and September-October are the driest periods. May-July is mostly the wettest time of the year, and a less intense rain season is in December-January.
Cheddi Jagan Temeri International Airport (GEO IATA). The main airport serving Georgetown is mainly served by Caribbean Airlines from New York City and Port of Spain. American Airlines flies from Miami and New York-JFK. Delta Air Lines (twice-weekly), Eastern Airlines, and JetBlue fly from New York. Copa Airlines flies from Panama City and Surinam Airways flies from Miami and Paramaribo year-round and Orlando/Sanford during the peak season. Make sure you have some currency when you arrive because there is no ATM in the airport. Also, in town the only bank that your card will work at is Scotiabank. US dollars can be used for almost any transaction and you can easily stay in Georgetown without using the local currency. Immigration processing is appallingly slow. Arriving tired on one of the late-night flights is an exercise in considerable patience.
Once out of the airport, a taxi is about US$25 or G$5000 and takes 45-60 minutes to get to Georgetown, depending on traffic. The cheaper, slightly slower option is to take minibus #42 to Timeri bus park which is behind the parliament building near Stabroek Market. The minibus costs G$260. The minibuses run at all hours of night and day, however taxi drivers will try to get you as a fare as soon as you come out of departures. They will say it's not safe to walk around in Georgetown at night, which is true. However, a taxi from the minibus station to your hotel will be about G$400.
Ogle Airport (Eugene F. Correira International Airport OGL IATA). A small airport slightly closer to Georgetown (~6 mi) that is for a few private charter companies, primarily used for domestic/local flights. They are served by Gum Air and Trans Guyana Airways. See below.

From there, you will go through customs on the Suriname side. Then take the 11:00 daily ferry across the river to South Drain. The ferry journey takes about 30 minutes, but you'll need more time for going through customs on the Guyanese side. On the Guyanese side, you will be in Molson Creek and can take minibus #63a to the minibus station near Stabroek Market in Georgetown. The trip takes at least 3 hrs and costs ~US$10. From there you can get a minibus for G$60/pp to where you are staying in Georgetown or a taxi for G$400.
From Brazil travel to Bonfim on the border and walk across the border. Find a minibus or taxi to take you to Lethem city center and inquire about minibuses traveling to Georgetown.
Map of Georgetown (Guyana)
When people in Guyana refer to buses, they mean minibuses. Minibuses (known as route taxis elsewhere) are the most common way to get around town. Minibus fares range from G$60-G$1000 depending on the length of the journey. Within the city, minibuses cost G$60 per person. Travel in this mode at night could be risky, however if the minibus does not get you to your exact location, the taxis are very cheap to complete the last leg of your trip.
There are numerous taxi services which are listed in the telephone directory and are not expensive. Fares should never be more than G$500 for travel within the city and most fares should be around G$400, regardless of the number of people. All taxis licence plates begin with 'H.' There are set prices for taxis for different destinations, e.g. from the airport to town costs GD$5000, from the airport to Molson Creek is GD$24000, etc. It is wise to ask at your hotel to recommend a driver. The "Yellow" taxis have the best reputation. Once you have found a driver that you trust, ask for his or her mobile phone number. A small tip will ensure that you get prompt service.
St. George's: one of the world's largest wooden buildings
If you have a day or two to spend in Georgetown, check out the markets listed below, take a walk down  Regent Street, or through one of the markets and have a look at the Umana Yama Church (Amerindian cultural center) or some of the older colonial buildings around town, especially on Main Street.

Since tourism in Guyana is not much developed there are not many online resources. But asking taxi drivers, barkeepers and random locals you meet on the street will yield many contacts to private accommodations that are much more affordable than the ones listed online. Thus, when planning to stay for more than just a few days, it is advisable to only book a hotel for one or two nights upfront and then go hunting when there.
Some hotels post their rates without the 16% tax, and in those cases the price you have to pay is higher.

Georgetown is notorious for petty street crime. Do not walk alone at night, or even in the day, unless you know the area well. Areas such as the Tiger Bay area east of Main Street and the entire southeastern part of the city including, in particular, Albouystown and Ruimveldt are traditionally known as high crime areas but one can be relatively safe if going through these areas in groups and with native escorts. Venturing into the covered area of the Stabroek Market can pose some dangers but if you need to visit it then do so with a group or with Guyanese whom you know well and with whom you feel comfortable. Police are unlikely to help you unless they see the crime in action. Be sensible about wearing jewellery. Even cosmetic jewellery which is gaudy is likely to attract the wrong attention.
It is advised to exercise common sense.
You might have heard of or read about the village Buxton. It is a hotbed of Afro-Guyanese violence, comparable to the American neighbourhood Compton south of Los Angeles. Visits to Buxton ought to be brokered carefully with someone who knows the area well and who is well accepted in the village. If your visit to this village is perceived to be anything other than casual then there could be unwarranted problems. There are a lot of gangs and drug dealers there. Many Indo-Guyanese villages such as Cane Grove, Annadale, and lusignan, are notorious for violence, petty crimes, racism and kidnappings. It is advisable for tourists or people who are not of Indo-Guyanese origin travelling through these areas should also be accompanied by someone known in these areas.
The police response varies depending on the location and time of the crime. Some tourists have reported positive responses.
Discussions of the current affairs of ethnic relations between the two major races, politics and the socio-economic issues in the country ought to be undertaken with much tact and much patience. Be aware that these types of discourses can sometimes lead to very heated and intense debate, and possibly something much worse. Guyanese are generally very open to discussing most issues, but as an outsider, you could be seen as a part of the problem - as absurd as that sounds - so guard your tongue.
Crime is rarely directed at tourists, so don't feel intimidated. Just be sensible about the company you keep, where you go and how you behave.
Homosexuality is illegal in Guyana and carries a sentence of life in prison. However, no one has been charged under the laws. One organisation, SASODdead link, organises some events to promote anti-homophobic work. There is no local gay "scene" as most homosexuals remain rather closeted. Private gatherings are known to occur to which one must be invited. Homosexuals who are openly gay are generally left alone providing they are circumspect about their behaviour. Public displays of affection among gay people are frowned upon and can make you the target of overt discrimination, attacks and taunts. There are no hotels, resorts or bars anywhere in the country which cater exclusively to gays and lesbian visitors or locals for that matter. Homophobia is sustained primarily through the influx of music which contains homophobic messages in their lyrics. The gay visitor is wise to be very cautious and conservative in his/her behaviour.

As the capital of the country, Georgetown is a good place to start exploring the rest of Guyana.
Kaieteur Falls. The falls is located on the Potaro river in Kaieteur National Park and is in the center of Guyana's rainforest. Its combination of great height and high water volume make it one of the most impressive waterfalls in the world. There are frequent flights between Ogle Airport and Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Georgetown and the falls' airstrip. Day trips by airplane start from $275 per person (Air Services Limited). Book ahead to guarantee you don't miss out.
Brazil There is bus service to Lethem where you can reach the border with Brazil. It is 14-18 hour journey primarily on a dirt road so be prepared. Pack water and snacks as breakdowns are notorious and you don't how long you might get stuck. From there you can catch a boat for about US$, or you can walk across the bridge to enter Brazil. It is your responsibility to stamp out of Guyana and into Brazil (make sure you tell the taxi driver to stop at immigration) because it is not required for those who are not travelling inland and only go as far as the border town on the other side.
Suriname: Mini-buses leave at 4am. Flights leave from Cheddi Jagan International airport later in the evening; from Ogle airport there at least two daily flights leaving, one early in the morning, the other at 1:30pm. Beware that one needs to obtain a tourist card from the embassy upfront.
