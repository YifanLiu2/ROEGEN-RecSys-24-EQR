St. George Utah LDS (Mormon) Temple
St. George is a city in southwestern Utah, on the Utah-Arizona border, known regionally as "Utah's Dixie" (a nickname given to the area for its warm southern Utah climate which was used to grow cotton by early settlers). The city is nestled in a scenic valley of desert vistas in the northeastern Mojave Desert, adjacent to the majestic Pine Valley Mountains.
St. George has seen unprecedented growth and has become well-known for its spectacular scenery, proximity to Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park and Grand Canyon National Park; a growing arts and cultural scene; year-round golf, big-city fine dining and shopping variety; recreation, mild climate of over 300 sunny days a year, internationally known events and a major southwestern retirement destination. In the 1990s, the city was dubbed Utah's Palm Springs as retirees were flocking here. Today, however, St. George is growing into a diverse city of all walks of life, with a population of over 80,000 and metropolitan area of over 160,000 (2016). For locals and visitors, from the avid outdoor enthusiast to the more cosmopolitan type, the area offers everything from 'A to Zion'.

St. George, like all cities in Utah, follows a well-defined grid system that makes it easy to get around and find your destination. For example, let's take the address 650 South 300 East. Each hundred represents one block radiating out from the center point at Tabernacle Street (running east-west) and Main Street (running north-south). To find 650 South 300 East, starting from the intersection of Main and Tabernacle, you would drive 3 blocks to the east, then just over 6 blocks to the south. St. George Boulevard, a major east-west artery, takes the place of 100 North.
While the grid system in the heart of town is well-defined, it can be become difficult to follow in the outlying areas and new subdivisions on the outskirts of the city. While in some cases the addresses will still follow the grid pattern, the blocks will become smaller and more irregularly spaced, and there will be more streets that don't follow the grid system at all.

Members of the Western Athletic Conference, the Trailblazers are in the midst of a four-year transition from NCAA Division II to Division I that will end in 2024. Utah Tech lacks the high profile of some other schools in the state, most notably Utah in Salt Lake City and BYU in Provo, in no small part because its football team plays in the second-level Division I FCS in the newly formed and football-only United Athletic Conference. On the plus side, this means ticket prices are considerably lower than those for more prominent teams. The most prominent venues, both on campus, are  Greater Zion Stadium for football and soccer and  Burns Arena for basketball.
