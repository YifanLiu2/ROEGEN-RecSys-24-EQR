Wilmington is a city in the southeastern part of North Carolina. It is the county seat of New Hanover County, and home to the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, the U.S.S. North Carolina Battleship Memorial, the Cape Fear Museum, Airlie Gardens, and a large historic district. It is convenient to nearby beaches, and is a relatively short drive from the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill), Charlotte, Myrtle Beach, SC, and the I-95 corridor.
Wilmington was once the USA's third largest film and TV production site. Television shows (such as Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill, and HBO's Eastbound & Down) and movies (including Iron Man 3, The Crow, Blue Velvet, and Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive) were filmed in Wilmington, but the stars, trailers and crews left a long time ago.
The city is famous for its beaches, seafood, and historic plantations. As of 2020 , there were about 116,000 people residing in the city, with about 300,000 residents in the metro area. The racial makeup of the city is about 70% White, 26% African American, and the remainder other races.
The cultural opportunities in Wilmington are endless; aquariums, museums, historical sites, festivals, libraries, film studios, theatres, and plantations can be enjoyed in this richly cultured city.
Wilmington was the site of the only violent overthrow of a democratically-elected government in United States history, the Wilmington Insurrection, when a mob of 2,000 white Democrats massacred an estimated 60 black residents and the duly-elected city government (including several white men), and installed a white supremacist government in its place despite the city's population being more than 55% African-American at the time. This was following the 1898 election in which a coalition party that promised free public education for all and equal voting rights for every African-American man in the city had secured a majority of city council seats.

Wilmington sits between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean. With the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream, some 45-60 miles (70–95 km) offshore, Historic Wilmington and North Carolina's Cape Fear Coast - Carolina Beach, Kure Beach & Wrightsville Beach enjoy a temperate subtropical climate year-round. Summer temperatures are usually in the 80s °F (close to 30 °C). Seasons are mild, with an average 212 sunshine days and a mean average temperature of  °F ( °C). The average winter temperature is about 50 °F (10 °C).
From the south via I-95 N, or from the direction of Charlotte, you should take US 74 E (exit 14 in North Carolina from I-95). It will take you about an  to 2 hours to get to Wilmington from the junction of I-95 and US 74. If taking this route, you should be sure to stock up on snacks and drinks, use the restroom, and fill up your gasoline tank before merging onto US 74 E, because stops are few and far between until arriving in Wilmington. US 74 (running concurrent with US 17 and US 76 at this point) crosses the Cape Fear River Bridge into Wilmington just south of the Historic District.
From the north via I-95 S, or from the direction of Raleigh, take I-40 E. Again, it will take approximately  to 2 hours to get to Wilmington from the junction of I-95 and I-40. You should be aware that stops between I-95 and Wilmington are also infrequent, although there is a rest area near Warsaw, at the exit for NC 24.
From Barstow, California drive 2560 miles (4120 km) due east on Interstate 40 through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee. The interstate ends at US Highway 117 in Wilmington.
Wilmington International Airport (ILM IATA), 1740 Airport Blvd (to the northwest of downtown). Two airlines fly into ILM: American Airlines and Delta. There are non-stop flights to Atlanta, Charlotte, New York, Orlando/Sanford, Washington DC, and Philadelphia.
Bus service to Wilmington is via Carolina Trailways, a subsidiary of Greyhound. Buses connect Wilmington to Charleston, Goldsboro, Myrtle Beach, Raleigh and Savannah. The station is at 201 Harnett Street in downtown Wilmington. Service is infrequent, with only four arrivals and departures per day, and the station is open for limited hours: 9AM-1PM, and 4PM-6PM.
Wilmington is very much a driving town. Below are some alternatives to driving, but the boating and biking mentioned are mostly recreational activities, not the best way between points A and B. If you're arriving in Wilmington without a car, you will need to rent one, use cabs for the duration of your stay (which must be called ahead of time), or rely on the inadequate and infrequent coverage of the local bus network.
The NCDOT Cape Fear Run Bicycling Highway 5dead link connects Apex to Wilmington and closely parallels the RUSA 370 mi (600 km) brevet route. The 300 mi (480 km) Ports of Call Bicycling Highway 3 connects Wilmington to Bath, Edenton, New Bern and Southport. The River to the Sea Bikeway (signed route 1) runs for 10 miles from downtown Wilmington to Wrightsville Beach along local streets and off-road paths. The Wilmington Metropolitan Planning Organization provides maps of local bicycle facilities and routes. The Gary Shell Cross City Trail runs from Wrightsville Beach, through multiple city parks, ending 15 mi (24 km) later at E.L Wade Park.
There are two water taxi services that connect downtown Wilmington to the U.S. Battleship North Carolina and connect Wrightsville Beach to the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve at Masonboro Islanddead link. Many area attractions, including Carolina Beach, downtown Wilmington, and Wrightsville Beach are accessible by boat via the Cape Fear River and Intracoastal Waterway.
Local bus service is provided by the Cape Fear Public Transportation Authority, which does business as WAVE Transit. WAVE Transit operates eight local routes through the city of Wilmington and New Hanover County. Most of these operate every 30 min on weekdays. The authority also operates a free downtown trolley that runs every 10 min on weekdays and infrequent service to the towns of Belville, Bolton, Hallsboro, Lake Waccamaw, Leland, Navassa, and Whiteville on the west side of the Cape Fear River. The base fare for a one-way trip is $. The services that cross the river are more expensive.
Interstate 40's western terminus is in Barstow, California, the eastern one is in Wilmington - only 2,554 miles to go!
If you do not drive to Wilmington, it really is advisable to rent a car once you arrive as travel in Wilmington is so difficult without one.
Car rental is available at the airport from these companies:
Hertz Rent-a-Car, +1 910 762-1010
National Car Rental, +1 910 762-8000
Thrifty Rent-a-Car, +1 910 343-1411
Traffic can be heavy in some parts of Wilmington (South College Rd., Market St.), but on the whole, driving around town is relatively easy. For the most part, major thoroughfares radiate out from the historic downtown, and there are numerous streets that allow you to cut across these radiating thoroughfares. The new Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway provides easy access to downtown, the airport, Interstate 40, and the beach while bypassing the most congested parts of Wilmington.

Due to several low-income neighborhoods located near the Front Street nightlife district and the fact that the nightlife attracts a hefty group of college students and US military personnel from nearby Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base, Wilmington does have a slightly higher crime rate than would be expected from a city of its size. When walking through unfamiliar neighborhoods/areas (particularly at night), exercise the standard level of awareness and caution and try to travel in groups. During late weekend nights, alcohol-fueled fights on Front Street are not unheard of. Typically this occurs around the time bars begin closing at 2:30-3:30AM The police are typically on top of disturbances, however, and such fights serve more as a public nuisance than a threat to safety. The Front Street riverfront nightlife district typically has a considerable mounted police presence on busy nights able to handle any disruptions.
There are several neighborhoods that have reputations as crime spots, but these areas offer nothing of interest to the visitor and are best avoided altogether. Do not mistakenly, particularly at night, wander into low-income neighborhoods that border the riverfront/Front Street district. Violent crime has been known to happen in these areas.
Always be aware of your surroundings. Front Street is quite a busy area; if you find yourself suddenly in an area lacking in pedestrian traffic, there is probable a reason for it so immediately turn around.

Because Wilmington is on the coast, there is a possibility that a tropical storm system could affect the Wilmington area during hurricane season (June 1 - November 30).

Carolina Beach – a beach town, plus a state park famous for carnivorous plants
Kure Beach – a quiet beach town, plus an aquarium and a Civil War fort
Southport Take the ferry on a day trip from Wilmington to this quaint little town. Stroll along the sidewalks, check out the antique shops, historic homes, grab a bite to eat, and experience true southern hospitality. Unfortunately, with the plans to build a new port and the building of condos and strip malls, this gem will eventually go the way of the dodo bird. See it now before its gone.
