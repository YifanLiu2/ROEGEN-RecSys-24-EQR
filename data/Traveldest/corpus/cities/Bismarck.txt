Bismarck (Hidasta: mirahacii arumaaguash; Arikara: ituhtaáwe) is capital of North Dakota and the county seat of Burleigh County. Bismarck is North Dakota's second most populous city, after Fargo.
The city was first named Edwinton, but the name was changed only a year later after Otto von Bismarck, a German statesman and politician. It was believed that the name change would attract foreign investment from Germany and encourage German immigration to the city.
Very little is known about Bismarck's history prior to the 1800s (during which time Europeans started immigrating to the United States in large numbers). It is believed that the first settlers in the area were the Mandan (a Native American tribe) and they are believed to have resided in the city for thousands of years.
During the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Corps of Discovery, a specially-established unit of the US Army, came into the area and stayed for a few years. The Corps of Discovery aimed to establish diplomatic relations and peace with the Native American tribes who resided in the area.
In 1872, Camp Greeley (later Camp Hancock) was established in the city to protect those working on the Northern Pacific Railway. During this time, the area continued to be flooded with immigrants and the city was officially born.
The discovery of large gold reserves in the Black Hills attracted numerous people to Bismarck, but this caused tensions with the Lakota tribe, who believed that the European immigrants had no business encroaching on territory sacred to them.
In the late 1880s, Bismarck became the capital of North Dakota.
As the capital of North Dakota, many of Bismarck's residents work for the North Dakotan government. Approximately 70,000 people live in Bismarck, making it one of the smaller cities in the United States.
Germans are the largest ethnic group in the city, comprising half of the total population of the city. Large numbers of Germans came from Russia during the 19th century, and they were drawn by the prospect of owning large amounts of land in the United States. Almost all German-Americans in North Dakota have Russian roots.
Bismarck's climate is characterized by cold, somewhat snowy and windy winters, and hot, humid summers. Thunderstorms occur in spring and summer, but much of the rest of the year is dry.

The Desert is a local hangout in the summer. The Desert is on the east bank of the Missouri south of the University of Mary. It takes about 15–20 minutes to reach by car. There is a boat ramp (Kimball Bottoms) in the area, and continuing past the boat ramp while following the shoreline for about another mile will bring you to a large sandbar beach where you may park your car and camp. This area is often extremely crowded during the summer, especially on holidays and weekends. During the week, it can be much more relaxing. A large area is located adjacent to the beach that is used by off-road vehicles, including dirt bikes and 4-wheelers. While generally North Dakotans are very respectful and generous people, when large numbers of people are at the Desert, it can be a hard place for families to enjoy time together. There is often plenty of partying and alcohol consumption. If you have small children, this is an area best avoided on weekends and major holidays (mainly the 4th of July), especially when the weather is good.
Boating is a great way to spend a long weekend or a lazy summer evening. A map showing boat ramps can be found here. There are generally many sandbars available in the Bismarck area to dock on. Much like the desert, sandbars near the bridges in the middle of Bismarck-Mandan often become crowded and rowdy on hot summer days. Head away from the middle of town, to the north or south, for some seclusion and relaxation.
Water-skiing, tubing, and wakeboarding are all popular activities, as well. Be aware that it is often dangerous to do these things within the vicinity of the four bridges spanning the river, as there is often too much boat traffic. Heading one mile up or down river will help you to have a safer (and more fun!) time. State law requires two people on the boat/jet-ski in cases of pulling someone on a tube, wakeboard, etc. One person is required to sit at the back of the boat and 'spot' for the people being pulled. There are state Game & Fish patrol boats enforcing these rules.
Play Cro-Shoes. This is a great river tradition. The game was invented by Vern Peterson, a local, in 1987. The game combines elements of horse shoes and other games to provide a unique sandbar game. Game sets are available at Scheel's Sports, located at Kirkwood Mall, or through the Cro-Shoes website contact page.

Cross-country skiing is often possible in Bismarck. Bismarck Parks & Recreation Department grooms trails at Riverwood Golf Course if snow conditions allow. It is often possible to ski in the countryside around Bismarck, but remember that trespassing on private property is a crime!

Ft. Abraham Lincoln State Park is made historically important because within its boundaries are the ruins of On-A-Slant Mandan Indian Village and the Fort Abraham Lincoln cavalry and infantry post.

Bismarck offers two major shopping malls, Gateway Fashion Mall in north Bismarck, and Kirkwood Mall in south Bismarck. Kirkwood Mall is the city's largest mall. It is anchored by Target, JCPenney, Herberger's, Scheel's Sports, and I. Keating Furniture World.
Besides the mall Bismarck has Wal-Mart, Staples, Office Depot, and Menards. Bismarck had two Super Walmarts, Sams Club, Lowes, Kohls, and many other shops. The majority of the newer retail centers are in the northern part of the city.
Most national chain restaurants are off of I-94 Exit 159 (Hwy. 83/State St.), near Kirkwood Mall on the south side, and in the Pinehurst area (Exit 157, Tyler Parkway and Divide Ave.) on the west side. For a more unique dining experience, explore restaurants in the historic Downtown area. This district's Peacock Alley, in the former Patterson Hotel is a local favorite.
Many North Dakotans are meat-eaters and these restaurants do not disappoint in this area. Pasta entrees and seafood are quite popular as well, rounding out most menus. Due to ND's landlocked location, seafood must be flown in regularly, so a seared ahi tuna steak is likely to be at least 'good'. However northern pike, walleye, buffalo, and pheasant are likely to be local and fresh. These items are worth a try to capture a more authentic taste of North Dakota.
Kroll's Diner. American and German cuisine. Famous for their Knoephla soup, which you can purchase by the bucket.I-94 & Highway 83, +1 701 223-19071915 East Main Avenue, +1 701 255-3850 $5-12.

Bismarck is a relatively safe town. Your biggest danger is the winter weather.
In the winter don't forget proper clothing for harsh weathers. For 20 days in Jan-Feb 2004, the temp did not get above 0 °F. The coldest temp was in Minot, ND, at -45 °F (-75 ° windchill) while Bismarck was at a "balmy" -43 °F.
If your car has a block heater, remember to plug it into a wall outlet. Local rental cars will have block heaters installed. If you don't know what to look for, ask the rental place; they will know. Block heaters will keep the car from freezing up during sub-zero temps.
From April–October, most of the state will conduct its road construction projects. During this season, plan for occasional delays in Bismark and on the roads connecting the city to neighbouring areas.
