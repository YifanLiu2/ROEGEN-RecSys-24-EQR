Villahermosa is the capital city of the state of Tabasco. This city is both a modern city and one of the oldest in Mexico, with a rich history dating back to the early 1500s.
Villahermosa is an important city because of its cultural history, natural resources, commercial development, and modern industrialization. It became rich because oil has been found in the area. The search for oil resulted also in the finding of artifacts of the Olmec culture.
Its natural resources like cacao, sugarcane, bananas, tobacco, rice, and hardwoods has made Villahermosa attractive to domestic investors. The city has become a hub for oil and gas operations in Southern Mexico and is referred to as the “Energy City of Mexico.”

You do not get a discount if the driver has a passenger, the price is the same.
