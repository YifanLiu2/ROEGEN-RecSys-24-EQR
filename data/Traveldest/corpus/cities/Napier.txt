Napier in New Zealand is the most consistently Art Deco city in the world, due to being largely rebuilt in the 1930s following a devastating earthquake in 1931. It is in Hawke's Bay, on the sunny east coast of the North Island.
The National Tobacco Company building (1933), one of Napier's many Art Deco buildings
At 10:47 AM on 3 February 1931, Napier and the wider Hawke's Bay was struck by a magnitude  earthquake. The quake and subsequent fire killed 256 people and destroyed much of the central business district. The demolition rubble was dumped along the eastern foreshore and turned into gardens and a recreational reserve.
After the earthquake, the CBD and other areas were rebuilt in the Art Deco styles prevailing at the time. Today, Napier is billed as "the Art Deco capital of the world", with over 100 Art Deco buildings in the CBD alone, most of which have been restored and heritage-listed.
The earthquake raised the land by several metres, draining the Ahuriri Lagoon. The airport, the surrounding farmland, and the modern-day suburbs of Onekawa, Pandora, Pirimai and Tamatea all sit on the reclaimed land. Some streets still have the names they had when they were on the coastline – streets called a "quay" or a "bay" may be inland now.
The suburb of Taradale, a separate town until 1968, has the region's oldest and most famous wineries, which host concerts during summer.
