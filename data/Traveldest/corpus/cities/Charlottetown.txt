Charlottetown is the capital city of Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. Charlottetown is a great place to spend a few days. It's a quaint and pretty town, small enough to be able to walk around, and has lots of good restaurants and bars. It's also within easy reach of the Prince Edward Island National Park.
Looking north on University Avenue from Province House
Charlottetown was named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen consort of King George III of the United Kingdom. Charlottetown was incorporated as a city in 1855.
It was the site of the famous Charlottetown Conference in 1864, the first gathering of Canadian and Maritime statesmen to discuss the proposed Maritime Union. This conference led, instead, to the union of British North American colonies in 1867, which was the beginning of the Canadian confederation. PEI, however, did not join Confederation until 1873. From this, the city adopted as its motto Cunabula Foederis, "Birthplace of Confederation". In 2016, it was home to about 36,000 people, with 77,000 in the metropolitan area.
