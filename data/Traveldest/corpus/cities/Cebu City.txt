Cebu City is the main city on Cebu Island in the Philippines and is known as the Queen City of the South. It is the capital of Cebu Province, a transport hub, and a popular tourist destination in its own right.
Cebu is part of the country's second largest large urban area, Metro Cebu, whose other main components are the cities of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu. This is a booming metropolitan area with all the conveniences of a modern city, as well as many of the problems of squalor, traffic, noise and pollution. Cebu City is clearly the center of the urban region, though the other towns are far from insignificant.
The area has excellent transport links and is the main hub for travel in the central and southern Philippines either by sea or by air. Cebu City has the busiest seaport in the Philippines. Lapu-Lapu has the Mactan-Cebu International Airport with direct international flights and many domestic flights. It is far more traveller-friendly than the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Metro Manila.
The term "Cebu" is somewhat ambiguous; it can refer to the city itself (the commonest usage), to the whole Metro Cebu urban area, to Cebu Island or to Cebu Province which includes Cebu Island and a few nearby smaller islands.
The Colon district near the port is the oldest part of Cebu; it was the first Spanish city in the country and has tourist sites from that era, listed under #See. It also has much of the low-cost accommodation and a lot of department stores or small malls which, while not as large and modern as those in other areas, are often more affordable.
Osmeña Boulevard is one of the city's main streets, running approximately north from Colon district out to the provincial capitol. About halfway along is Fuente Osmena Circle.
Mango Avenue, officially General Maxilom Avenue, runs east from Osmena Circle. During the day it is a busy area full of shopping centers, restaurants and some hotels. In the evenings, it becomes a major nightlife area.
For climate information, see Metro Cebu.
See Metro Cebu for general information about reaching the urban region.
Mactan-Cebu International Airport (CEB IATA) is in Lapu-Lapu. Many travellers land there and head for Cebu City by bus or taxi.
MyBus travels from SM City to Mactan Airport via Park mall. Buses depart from 6AM-midnight at 20-min intervals) and cost ₱25 from park mall and 50 from SM per person. All the MyBus vehicles have air-conditioning and CCTV. The last bus from the airport is midnight . The first bus from SM is 6AM.

Taxis are also readily available for ₱300-450. Coming out of the terminal, turn right and walk a bit past the end of the building to reach the main taxi stand.
For either the bus or taxi, 45 minutes is a typical time. However, either can sometimes be a bit faster or much slower depending on traffic conditions.
Cebu City's domestic port is the country's busiest and is home to almost 80 percent of the country's passenger vessels. The passenger port is in Cebu City, near downtown. The parts of the port that handle containers and other freight extend for a long way north of that, reaching into Mandaue.
Note that Cebu City ferry terminals charge a terminal fee. The fee is approximately ₱25, depending on pier. Only cash is accepted and no ATMs are available prior to the secure area (which you can only get to by paying the terminal fee).
Identification is usually required to pick up ferry tickets, but this is at the discretion of the check-in agent. Seats are usually selected at check-in. If you are stranded overnight at a ferry terminal, you may be required to present identification or to complete a questionnaire about your intentions by security.

Cebu South Bus Terminal, Natalio Bacalso Avenue,.
See the Metro Cebu article for a more general discussion of getting around in the large urban conglomerate of which Cebu City forms a part.
Do as the locals do and catch a colorful jeepney. They are available 24 hours and cover most of the nooks and crannies of the city. Ask around for which route to take, or read the signs on the sides of the vehicles showing their routes. Routes within the city are also listed on Google Maps; Google Maps lists certain stops but you don't actually have to get on or off at any particular stop -- you can get on and off anywhere along the jeep's route. Costs start at ₱12 for the first 4 km and increase for longer distances. Beware of pickpockets and other theft, this is unfortunately very common on jeepneys and even locals fall victim. Hidden pockets, money belts and carrying goods near one's nether regions are common but they are not infallible strategies to avoid theft.
MyBus have five bus routes around Metro Cebu. Fares are from ₱25-50 (except route 5), and all buses are fully air-conditioned and low-floor.
Route 1 between SM Seaside and Park Mall (in Lapu-Lapu) via SM City Cebu and the North Bus Terminal,
Route 2 between SM Seaside and Talisay
Route 3 between SM City Cebu and Mactan Airport via Park Mall
Route 4 between Park Mall and Talisay via the North Bus Terminal and SM City Cebu
Route 5 between BDO Fuente branch and SM Seaside. Free.
Robinsons Malls offers free shuttle buses between Robinsons Fuente or Robinsons Cybergate and Robinsons Galleria. Services between 30 minutes.
Sugbo Tours transit buses have large air conditioned buses every 45 minutes from 5AM till 9PM from the southern bus terminal going via Mango Square, SM City Mall, Northern Bus Terminal, Pacific Mall, Island Central Mall in Mactan. Fares ₱20-40 (May 2023).
Beeps buses have fully air-conditioned low-floor buses. In the future, they will replace all routes served by jeepneys'. Fares are ₱ for the first 4 km and ₱ for each succeeding km (as of May 2023). Buses depart every 15 minutes. Unlike the other operators, they operate 24/7.
Cebu City is building a bus rapid transit (BRT) system which will run between Cebu IT Park and SM Seaside since 2022, passing through the capitol, Fuente and CSBT. It is still under construction (between the capitol and CSBT) as of 2023, but the city operates an interim bus service runs along the route.
Taxis are omnipresent in Cebu City. But there's a decent chance you'll be overcharged by a taxi driver at some point during your trip to Cebu. This should be considered a cost of visiting Cebu (or anywhere in the Philippines). You can (and should) report improper taxi behavior to the Department of Tourism in Cebu by phoning +63 32 254 2811.
Unless you're familiar with the city, always insist on a metered fare as a negotiated fare will almost always be much higher. If you know the city and need to go a long distance, it may be worth paying a negotiated fare so that the driver doesn't take the scenic route or you become victim of an uncalibrated meter. Late in the evenings, there could be taxis driving with an uncalibrated, inflated meter.
Most trips around the city should not cost more than ₱150. The fare from the airport to most of central Cebu should be ₱300-400 (2023) depending on whether you use the white or yellow cabs (white ones are reportedly cheaper).
If you know the name of the building, establishment, area or street you wish you reach, taxis are still the fastest way to your destination. Most drivers know where almost everything is. If the driver is pleasant, a ₱10-50 tip is warranted, especially if he loads or unloads your bags. Most drivers do not have, or will tell you they do not have change, so be ready with 50s and 20s when going on short trips.
It is best to avoid the "Private" taxis as they take advantage of tourists and charge 5-10 times the normal fare. You will find these taxis at the some of the high-class hotels. They are normally owned by the hotel to make money and may charge ₱500 for something that should cost ₱60. Some hotels make it hard for other taxis to pick you up at their premise and you may need to walk outside to save money.
Another place where private taxis are common is the airport. To avoid them, simply ask a porter for help and for a metered taxi. Downstairs at the exit for arrivals, there is a booth that will flag down a taxi for ₱70, but you can also go up the ramp and there are a lot of metered taxis waiting for you. You can also wend your way upstairs to Departures where many metered taxis are available. Fare down town to Ayala or SM Malls should be around ₱250 (May 2022) on the meter. You may be told "500" by the driver. Just grab the door handle and say "What, you don't have a meter?" Don't travel unless the meter is used; not using the meter is illegal, and you can report it to local officials.
The main language spoken throughout Cebu Province and in many nearby areas is Cebuano, the most important of many Visayan languages in the Philippines.
English and Tagalog are common as additional languages though using the former is usually preferable to the latter. Sometimes, they also speak in Bislish (Bisaya Cebuano + English) and/or Taglish (Tagalog + English) when they cannot find the appropriate word to use. Younger people speak English with a Cebuano accent, often interchanging i and e, and o and u.
The city also has some speakers of other Visayan languages such as Ilonggo and Waray, and the Chinese minority speak Hokkien, but most speakers of those languages can also speak at least one of Cebuano, English or Tagalog.
The city was well established as a trade center and regional capital even before the first Europeans, under Magellan, arrived in the 1520s. When the Spanish returned to colonize in 1565, Cebu became the first Spanish city in the country and (briefly) the capital. Many of today's tourist sites go back to the period of Spanish rule which lasted until the Americans took over in 1898.
Basilica of Santo Niño (Basilica del Santo Niño (Basilica of the Holy Child)), Osmeña Boulevard, ☏ +63 32 2556697. A large and venerable church that traces its history to the founding of the convent of the Santo Niño de Cebu in 1565. It contains a statue of the Santo Niño (Holy Child) that is regarded as the oldest religious relic in the Philippines. The statue was presented by Ferdinand Magellan to Queen Juana during the baptism of King Humabon and his wife Queen Juana on 14 April 1521. The natives of Cebu were formally Christianized by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi and Father Andres de Urdaneta on 27 April 1565. However, as they found the natives hostile, the village was set on fire. Later on, in a burnt-out house, a soldier named Juan Camus found the statue untouched. This was proclaimed a miracle. The statue, adorned with gold and precious stones, is in a glass case to the left of the altar. The church sees a constant stream of devotees praying at pews in the sanctuary and in front of statues of saints. The Basilica del Santo Niño Museum (open Tu-Su 8-11:45AM, 1:30-4:45PM) contains the vestments used to dress the Santo Niño and jewellery offered to the Santo Niño for use during his feast (#Sinolog) on the third Sunday of January. ₱30 for museum.
Magellan's Cross, Plaza Sugbo, off Magallanes St (between the Colegio de Santo Niño (south of the Basilica of Santo Niño) and Cebu City Hall - if you approach the Basilica from Osmeña Boulevard, walk through the courtyard of the Basilica and the Colegio to reach the Plaza). An octagonal building decorated with murals containing a large wooden cross that commemorates the Portuguese conquistador Ferdinand Magellan who planted a wooden cross upon converting the original inhabitants to Christianity. A plaque states that the visible wooden cross contains the original cross, but some historians say the original cross was reduced to firewood by local inhabitants when the Magellan fleet headed elsewhere. Take time to appreciate the various candle sellers who dance around during worship and while selling the candles. Free.
Colon St. Brave the cacophonous traffic to see the oldest street in the Philippines with some nice worn-out classical buildings dating back to the American Era. At night, this street transforms into a market with good buys everywhere. Be wary of pickpockets though.
Fort San Pedro (Fuerza de San Pedro). The smallest Spanish outpost in the Philippines during the colonial era. It has a small museum showcasing the wreckage and treasures from the sunken San Diego galleon from Mexico. The area is scenic with the newly renovated and open-air Plaza Independencia at the entrance. Adults, ₱30; students, ₱20; senior citizens, ₱24.
The Chinese Taoist Temple. There are many people of Chinese ancestry in Cebu, and several Chinese temples; one is the Taoist Temple. From there you can see a nice view of the city because it is on a hill.
Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral. A church built in 1565 by the first Spanish missionaries in Cebu, seat of an Archbishop who has subordinate Bishops in many cities of the Visayas. It was mostly destroyed during World War II and had been rebuilt a bit differently. Behind the church is a cemetery where several prominent churchmen including Cardinal Rosales are buried.

A well-preserved Spanish colonial mansion constructed largely of wood, set in a pleasant, manicured garden. The lower floor has a collection of old tools, and an A/C room that has changing displays such as art exhibitions.

Yap-Sandiego Ancestral House, Mabini St, ☏ +63 32 266 2833. Another historic house, this one from the 17th century, with hand-carved furniture and a garden. It does indeed look old/cryptic. ₱50. (updated Sep 2020)
Jesuit House Museum, 26 Zulueta St (really quite strange in that you have to enter through a warehouse door, but there is a sign), ☏ +63 32 255 5408. Yet another heritage house museum, this one the residence of a Jesuit from around 1730. Inside looks like a Spanish galleon. ₱50. (updated Sep 2020)
Sugbu Chinese Heritage Museum, M.C. Briones St & Burgos St (across street from Cebu city hall and short walk south from Magellan's Cross), ☏ +63 917 831 8353.

Tops Lookout. This sits at the top of the Mt Busay and has an unobstructed view of the entire city at night. A few shops and restaurants stand along the way for a short stop. Taxi drivers may want as much as ₱1000 for a trip to Tops, so the best way to get there is by mountain bike. This is a world class climb and on any given day, Cebu's bikers are humping the 45-minute to 1-hr trek filled with switchbacks and views better than you see actually at the very top. Ask your hotel where you can rent a mountain bike. They may have to ask around a bit, but it's worth it.
Ride a tartanilla - Head to Cebu's old quarters in Carlock St and try riding a horse drawn carriage called a tartanilla. Remember to negotiate with the driver before taking a ride.
See the scenic view of Cebu City's skyline - The Marcelo Fernan Bridge or Second Mactan Bridge offers some interesting views of the city at night, and is even picturesque from below. Arrange for a taxi to take you there.

Adventure seekers may head to the top floor to experience a breathtaking view of this modern city and its environs.

This festival honouring Santo Niño, the Holy Child, is held annually on the third Sunday of January. It is centered on the Basilica in Cebu City but is celebrated throughout Cebu Province and to some extent even in nearby provinces; it attracts large numbers of both tourists and pilgrims. Festivities last for about a week leading up to the Sunday climax.
There are colorful parades in many towns. Main thoroughfares around the city are blocked for an all-day and all-night loud and colourful street party. Don't forget your dancing shoes!
On one hand, Sinulog can be one of the most interesting times to visit Cebu. On the other, some consider it a time to avoid. Hotels tend to sell out, streets and restaurants are crowded, and traffic may be horribly jammed. For example a bus heading south from the south bus station normally takes under an hour to reach Carcar, but it can be over three hours during Sinulog because the highway is also the main street of various towns along the way, and several have parades along it.
There is quite a bit of shopping in various neighbourhoods of Cebu, especially in the old downtown Colon area and around Fuente Osmena Circle.

One great thing about Cebu is that, while being an island paradise on the one hand, it's also a sophisticated city, with a wide range of pretty decent restaurants to choose from. However, Cebu's all-you-can-eat buffets are more expensive than those elslewhere in the country.
Street-food abounds in Cebu. You can buy all sorts of Philippine delicacies from the many street stalls scattered around Cebu City.
All the major malls (listed under #Buy) have food courts, and major chains — KFC, Shakey's Pizza, Starbucks, Bo's Coffee and others — have locations in many of them. The downtown area around Colon Street has a large number of restaurants including many budget places and many fast food chains.

Mango Avenue (officially General Maxilom Avenue) and Mango Square is where the bulk of the nightlife is. The typical venues are nightclubs, bars and karaoke boxes.
There are many girlie bars, mostly along Mango Ave. It is fairly common to visit these clubs just to enjoy the show, a lot of scantily-clad dancers who compete to catch customers' eyes. However, the dancers are more-or-less all also available for sexual services. Prostitution is illegal in the Philippines but quite common, and these bars are the most usual front; see the Philippines article for discussion.
