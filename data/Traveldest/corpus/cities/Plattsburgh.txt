The closest American city to Montréal, Plattsburgh (city and town) has a population of about 20,000 (2020).
The area was the site of a native Indigenous village at the time of Samuel-de-Champlain's 1609 Lake Champlain valley expedition. The French settled in the area during the «coureur-de-bois» fur trade era in the mid-to-late 17th century. Historically a French area, Plattsburgh later fell to the English, then finally, was under American control.
Located on the western shore of Lake Champlain, Plattsburgh is separated by the lake from Burlington, Vermont to the east. It is the primary city serving the vast Adirondack Park region, as development within the park boundary is strictly limited outside the few existing villages (such as Saranac Lake and Lake Placid).
Plattsburgh has a long military history. The city, founded in 1785, is home to a War of 1812 museum; it was the site of the Revolutionary War's Battle of Valcourt Island and the War of 1812's Battle of Plattsburgh. In 1915, the Preparedness Movement established the first of the "Plattsburgh camps", volunteer pre-enlistment training grounds for prospective future Army officers. During the Cold War, Plattsburgh Air Force Base (PAFB) was the Strategic Air Command's primary wing on the US East Coast; its sheltered location in the Champlain Valley was protected by the rain shadow of the Adirondack Mountains. The 556 Strategic Missile Squadron, activated at Plattsburgh AFB in 1961 and armed with a dozen Atlas liquid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, disbanded in 1965. The Air Force base closed in 1995.
The former base, one of four military bases in the United States large enough for a Space Shuttle landing, now serves as a small civilian airport.
Plattsburgh is connected by Interstate 87 to Montréal to the north and Albany to the south; Amtrak's New York City-Montréal "Adirondack" service passes through the city.

Plattsburgh serves a regional market; to the many tiny villages in the Adirondacks with only a few small, local independent merchants, the Champlain Centre is the closest major mall.
As a cross-border shopping destination for Canadians, Plattsburgh's fortunes tend to be cyclical. When the Canadian dollar is strong, the Montréal community eagerly seek out cheaper prices in the US; when exchange rates are unfavourable, Canadians stay home en masse. Tightened passport restrictions in the post-9/11 era have also weakened cross-border demand. A few stores (such as Target, and JC Penney) do not exist over the border in Canada and some grocery items (such as milk and yoghurt) are less expensive stateside.
Price Chopper, Hannaford, Yando's Big M (South End), North Country Food Co-Op (Downtown), and Wal-Mart are possible destinations for grocery shopping.
Champlain Centre, 60 Smithfield Blvd. Established 1987, the mall features J.C. Penney, Target, Best Buy, Gander Mountain, Dick's Sporting Goods, DSW, and a Regal cinema.
