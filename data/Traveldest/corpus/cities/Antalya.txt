Not to be confused with Alanya, a resort 130 km further east, or with Antakya a historic city in Hatay province of eastern Turkey
Antalya is a city in Pamphylia on the Turkish Mediterranean coast, and the chief resort of the "Turkish Riviera". It's a metropolis with a population of  million in 2022, the fifth largest city in the country.

The city was named for its first documented ruler Attalos II (220-138 BC), king of Pergamon, though it was obviously settled much earlier. Attalos' life and wife resembles soap opera, and his epiphet Philadelphos - "brother-loving" - hints at insecurity over how his relationship with back-from-the-dead brother and co-ruler Eumenes II might be portrayed. He based his fleet here - there were few alternatives along this exposed coast, and Attaleia (Ἀττάλεια) grew up around what's now called the Roman harbour. It never grew large as it lacked a hinterland - it's hemmed in by mountains with difficult routes to get inland, although a fertile coastal plain extends up to the east. Early visitors included St Paul the Apostle (Acts 14: 25-26) and Ibn Battuta, who in 1331 AD recorded how Christians, Greeks, Jews, and royal court each inhabited their own walled enclave, while the Muslims lived in the main body of town all within an enclosing wall.
This relative isolation meant little fighting here, but Antalya was the prize to be handed over after conquests elsewhere: to the Seljuks in 1207 and the Ottomans in 1391. After Turkey's defeat in World War I, the harsh 1920 Treaty of Sèvres handed over tracts of the country to the Allies, and Italy gained Antalya. This was reversed, and Turkey gained its present borders, by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.
Access was improved by road building in the 20th century, but the game-changer was in the 1970s when commercial airliners could jet tourists non-stop from northern Europe, and the political environment boosted tourist infrastructure. The city burgeoned, with development either side of Kaleiçi the old town centre, but especially east along the sandy Lara beach. Effectively this strip extends 150 km until the mountains terminate the coastal plain: it's all called "Antalya area" in tourist literature, but in this guide the easterly towns of Belek, Manavgat, Side and Alanya are described separately.
Climate is of course Mediterranean. Summers are hot, sunny and humid yet rainless. Days average 30-35°C and may surpass 40°C; nights may be muggy and sticky so you want air-con.
Winters are mostly mild, punctuated by storms, downpours and strong winds. April-May and Oct-Nov are optimum conditions for sight-seeing, and the sea remains warm late into Autumn.
Antalya Airport (Antalya Havalimanı, AYT IATA). Flights from all over Europe and Russia bring hordes of tourists, mostly on package deals. Other destinations include Erjan, Amman, Beirut, Tel Aviv, Baghdad and the Gulf States. There are daily domestic flights from Istanbul (IST and SAW), Ankara, Izmir, Adana, Samsun, Diyarbakir and Gaziantep. The two terminals are  km apart with no shuttle or walkway, so make sure to head for the correct one. T1 handles all domestic flights and those by Turkish, Pegasus, Sun Express and Ryanair wherever they originate. Most other airlines use T2, including Corendon the Antalya-based budget operator. The airport has the standard facilities and is usually slick, but when flights are delayed the passengers back up and it gets chaotic. (updated Aug 2023)
Antalyakart is the transport card you need for the tram or bus, see Get Around. Buy it at the airport.
By tram: AntRay Tram 1A runs downtown from two T1 stops (domestic and international) every 15 min 06:00-00:00; it doesn't serve T2. Get off at İsmetpaşa (taking 50 min) for the old town or to transfer to Tram 2. Stay aboard another 30 min for Otogar the bus station. Coming out to the airport take Tram 1A badged "Havalimanı". Tram 1B follows the same route until Yonca Kavşak then branches off to Expo.
Bus 600 runs from T1 (domestic) and T2 to Otogar - so this could serve as an inter-terminal shuttle and spare you a taxi. It runs every 30 min 07:00 to 00:00 with night runs around 01:30, 03:30 and 06:00. It runs via Mevlana Cd and Adnan Menderes Blv, taking about an hour to Otogar. At T1 the stop is by the blue "D" sign next to a fig tree, usually with a scrummage of other waiting passengers. Ignore the "D" outside T1 (international), which stands for "decoy" or "dupe me". Taxi touts will converge on you, saying truthfully "No bus leaving here!" and steering you towards a taxi.
Bus 800 runs from T1 (domestic) and T2 every two hours 06:15 to 22:15 via Barınaklar Blv in Lara (for east resort strip), cross-town to Sarısu on the west resort strip.
Havaş buses don't serve Antalya Airport, so for other towns such as Alanya travel via Otogar.
By taxi: this is the best option for Lara resort strip, which is east of the city near the airport. Official rates were last set in 2022, see Get around. A ride to city centre might be 500 TL.
Buses from Istanbul run hourly and take 12 hours via Gebze, Izmit, Eskişehir, Kütahya, Afyon, Sandikli and Burdur, for a fare in 2023 of 600-800 TL. From Ankara is 9 hours, from Izmir 6, from Adana 11 and from Konya 6. A faster route from Istanbul or Ankara is to take the YHT train to Konya, which connects with buses to Antalya.
Bus lines include Metro Turizm, Pamukkale, Flixbus (who've taken over Kamil Koç) and Varan.
Frequent buses run along the coast from Alanya, Manavgat (for Side) and Belek. Operators include Alanyalilar and Güney Akdeniz, the long-distance bus lines don't serve this short route. You could also take a dolmuş.
Antalya Otogarı the bus terminal is 6 km northwest of city centre. Your inter-city ticket may include a downtown transfer, check when purchasing. Otherwise take the tram from Dumlupınar Blv 10 minutes walk east. The station is large, modern and reasonably clean, with ticket kiosks, cafes and toilets.
From Istanbul follow O7 / O5 / O22 (toll) south past Bursa to pick up D200 east, then D650 south via Kütahya and Afyon, reckon 8 hr 30 min.
Hitchhiking outbound, the dilemma is to be far enough out to pick up inter-city vehicles, but not so far out that they can't stop. One spot northbound is the roundabout where D330 branches from D650. City buses 506 and 509 run to D330, for Denizli, Pamukkale, Aydin and Izmir. Ten buses run along D650 Akdeniz Blv, for Isparta, Afyon and Ankara.
Antalyakart is the plastic transport card you need for the tram or public bus. Buy it or reload it at kiosks along the tramway, at the airport and at the bus terminal; you probably need banknotes for this. The upfront cost is 35 TL in 2023, and single rides thereafter are 15 TL. A transfer within one hour of boarding is  TL.
You can also buy disposable paper cards for 6 TL, and pay 17 TL per ride. These don't allow transfers, nor can they be re-loaded, but you can load a suitable amount on purchase.
Or use contactless payment at the card-reader or turnstile: no upfront charge, pay 18 TL per ride, no transfers.
Discount cards are only available for citizens with Turkish ID, who pay a little more upfront but get cheaper rides.
AntRay Tram 1 runs from Fatih in the north of the city to the Otogar (transfer to Tram 3), Ismetpaşa downtown (transfer to Tram 2) and Meydan then northeast to Yonca Kavşak. Tram 1A there forks for Airport Terminal 1, Tram 1B continues out to Aksu and Expo. Trams run every 15 min 06:00-00:00.
Tram 2 is a heritage line, with 1950s/60s tramcars donated by the city of Nuremberg in 1999 in gratitude for all those kebabs and factory workers. It runs near the coast from the Museum (transfer to Tram 3) east to Cumhuriyet downtown (transfer to Tram 1) then south through Old Town to Zerdalilik. It's mostly single track with passing loops, and the project to double-track it has stalled.
Tram 3, opened in 2021, starts north of the city at Varsak and runs to Kepez, swinging west to Batigar (for Otogar and transfer to Tram 1), Akdeniz University Hospital and the Museum (transfer to Tram 2).
Buses go everywhere in the city, with over a dozen lines plying to the otogar (bus station). See above for Bus 600 to the airport.
Good luck finding any practical info on the city transport website. Try peering at bus stops on Google Map close to your start point and destination to find lines that run all the way.
Dolmuş minibuses ply fixed routes. In theory they're supposed to run to a schedule, not wait to fill up as in other Turkish cities. In practice an empty dolmuş will move so slowly in hope of more passengers that it may be overtaken by elderly pedestrians with zimmers.
There are taxi stands all over the city where the drivers have their base and teapot, or you can order through online BiTaksi or iTaksi. The official rates since 2022 are flagfall 10 TL then 14 TL per km, with no separate night rate. Popular visitor destinations have price lists in euro. You can also negotiate with any taxi driver to be your private tour guide, or at least take you on an excursion: this might be a good option for Perge but pricey for Aspendos.
City centre is walkable, and using a car or bicycle here is tiresome at best.
Hadrian's Gate (Turkish Üçkapılar, "three gates") is a good starting point for exploring Kaleiçi the old quarter. Built in 130 AD for the visit of Emperor Hadrian, it may have been ceremonial rather than a practical thoroughfare, as it became bricked up within the city walls. This preserved it, and it was only rediscovered when the walls crumbled in the 1950s.

Antalya like any other big city has its quota of dodgy individuals, sharp-edged trash and stray dogs; but tourists have little reason to be in down-at-heel districts.
Antalya has 4G from all Turkish carriers, and the signal extends along the resort strip beyond Alanya. As of July 2023, 5G has not rolled out in Turkey.
Church of Sts. Paul and Alypius (Yenikapı Rum Kilisesi, Православний храм), Yeni Kapı Sk 20, Kaleiçi (in the old town), ☏ +90 534 333 73 16. An 1844-built Greek Orthodox church affiliated with the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The parishioners are mostly Russians and Ukrainians, and the services are conducted in Church Slavonic.

Kemer southwest is part of the Antalya tourist strip. Go further south along the rugged coast of Lycia for quiet beaches and village harbours.
Belek to the east has golf links and luxury hotels.
Manavgat further east has waterfalls, but the big draw is the Roman ruins at Side.
Alanya yet further east has an ancient citadel perched on a crag, with beach hotels stretching either side.
Termessos is a ruined ancient city above the forests of the Taurus Mountains.
