Port Blair's seaside promenade, one of the few pleasant bits of town
Port Blair is the capital and largest city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands group, with a population of around 100,000.
Port Blair is an upcoming city not very different from many other smaller Indian cities. It doesn't share the beauty of the rest of the Andamans, although the seaside has been tarted up a bit. It comprises people from all over India and one can imagine it as a mini-India with no conflicts on region and religion. Aside from Cellular Jail, there are quite a few places which include Ross Island, Barren Island (known for the only active volcano) and a few others known for their historical importance. A week's trip can cover the must-see places on the islands. You can, however, do day trips to other places close by like Wandoor and Ross Island.

Veer Savarkar International Airport (IXZ IATA) (2 km ( mi) from city centre). Probably one of the most quaint and idyllic airports in India. There is a scenic viewpoint where the whole airport can be seen. There are no night flights as the airport is handed over to the Indian Air Force after 15:00. As of 2019, it has only flights from elsewhere in India. Flights to Port Blair are not really "low-cost" compared to the same airlines' mainland India flights, but are still cheaper than other ways to get to the islands. Price varies significantly with the date, so if your travel dates aren't fixed, you can save significantly by being flexible. Advance booking at least several days before the trip is recommended.

Air India flies from Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Visakhapatnam. They charge a much higher rate for foreigners than Indian residents.
Go Air flies daily from Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata.
IndiGo flies from Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata.
SpiceJet offers flights direct from Chennai, Delhi, Kochi, and Kolkata.
Vistaradead link flies from Chennai, Delhi and Kolkata.
Taxis and autorickshaws wait outside the terminal at flight times. Public buses can be flagged down on the main road just outside the airport (cross the road). A bus to Aberdeen Bazaar will cost no more than ₹7. The terminal is small and reasonably modern, with an air-conditioned departure hall, but aside from an overpriced kiosk selling chai and crisps, there's not much to tide you over if your flight is delayed.
Helicopters used to run from inter-island helicopter service 1 km from the airport terminal. There are scheduled services to Havelock, Neil, Carnicobar, Hutbay, Campbellbay and other islands. Pawan Hans Helicopter Ltd is operating its fleet of 03 Dauphin Helicopters from Port Blair under the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Administration. But you have to book a ticket in advance for a comfortable journey to the other islands. An air service, Mehair, operates an amphibious Cessna Caravan to the outer islands
Buses connect Port Blair with other points on Grand Andaman, including Baratang Island (2½ hr), Rangat (6 hr) and Diglipur (8 hr).
To get "deluxe" bus tickets, go to the little arena of shops across the road from the bus station. Ask around, but the man is in the fourth shop on the left on the ground floor.
If you're going further than Rangat the road is somewhat bumpy, so it's recommended not to get a seat number greater than 20 (as this is over or behind the rear axle). Don't get the rear seats as they are a bench - you'd be better off on a public bus.
Regular pax ship services are available to Port Blair from Chennai. There are 3 to 4 sailings every month, The voyage takes about 50 to 60 hrs and the ship normally berths at Port Blair for about 2 to 4 days. There are two jetties in Port Blair. Phoenix Bay Jetty to go to Havelock and other far destinations. Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports Complex to take smaller ferries to Ross Island, North Bay and Viper Island.

Name of Vessel and fare per berth
Auto-rickshaws are abundant, and within town should cost ₹20-40. Auto fare from the airport to Aberdeen Bazaar in the city centre is ₹30. Auto fare from Aberdeen Bazaar to Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports Complex is ₹10. From Aberdeen Bazaar to Marine jetty (from where you get ships to Havelock Islands, Long island, etc.) is also ₹10 (as on March 2010). Tourists can expect to be charged a higher price. The auto-rickshaws will overcharge you if they can see you don't know where you are going or what you are doing. One way of avoiding being fleeced by them is to just climb in the back of the auto-rickshaws and say "Aberdeen Bazaar" for example.
Boats are available to destinations like Ross Island. The boat fare is ₹75 for a return journey. It takes approximately 15 minutes by ferry from Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports Complex jetty.
Local buses are also available for inter-city and intra-city travel. Very cheap, but you'll need to ask around to figure out the routes.
Private hire cars are available for local sightseeing around Port Blair and South Andaman.
Motorcycles have been available for hire from a few shops around MA Rd. However, it seems they are no longer available for rent in Port Blair. Police have seized a lot of 2-wheelers for speeding and driving without a licence, so people have stopped renting them. You can rent scooters (light motorcycles) and motorcycles on MG road about 2 km up the hill to the west from Aberdeen Bazaar but they are ₹400 for one day which does not include an overnight as of Jan 2011. Expect to get lost.
Walking is a good option. But expect to get lost if you go too far and it is mostly quite steep hills that all look alike, so remember some landmarks.
Japanese bunker just beside Lions club, opposite to SAI Complex Port Blair
Anthropological Museum. closed Thursdays and Public Holidays. Interesting anthropological museum which gives the history of the various A&N tribes.
Cellular Jail. closed on Mondays. Built by the British to house political prisoners far away from the mainland. All prisoners were kept in isolation cells and subjected to a brutal work regime, with regular whippings and executions. Briefly taken over by the Japanese during WW2, who added torture to the palette. Today, however, the jail has been transformed into an immaculately kept national monument complete with a garden that seems very much at odds with the earlier horrors. You can watch it from morning 09:30 to 16:00 A light-and-sound show in Hindi (17:00) and English (18:00) available in the evenings. ₹20.
Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI) (about 4 km away from the airport). CARI scientists are conducting research on different aspects of island agriculture. Landscaping of CARI is beautiful and it is worth seeing. Here you can see farms of different livestocks and poultry viz. Cattle, pig, goat, rabbit, turkey, quail, Guinea fowl, duck, fisheries ponds, integrated farming system model, etc., and fodder blocks as well.
Chatam Saw Mill, Chatam (15 mins by bus from STS bus terminal, private buses available ₹6 per person). A saw mill, oldest in Asia.

Corbyn's Cove (beach). An OK beach, and the closest to Port Blair. Popular with locals for swimming and watching the sunset. However, part of the beach was washed away by the 2004 tsunami and currents can be very strong, so be careful if you decide to swim.
Japanese Bunkers, near Corbyn's Cove. Bunkers built by the Japanese army during World War II. There's one more right down the hill from Cellular Jail.

Boat tours from Port Blair You would be lured by agents to do a 3 island packaged tour (Ross + North Bay + Viper) in Port Blair for ₹400. The trip starts at 09:00 and ends at 17:00. Complimentary lunch and breakfast is provided by the tour operator. Please don’t fall into that trap. Since, Viper Island has now become a landfill for all the refuse and complete waste of time and money. It is much better to do a 2 island tour, which are North Bay + Ross Island for ₹225 . Tour for North Bay + Ross island starts at 10:00 from Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports complex. Agents also try to sell single tour of Viper Island by the name of ‘Harbour Cruise’ for ₹90. That tour starts at 15:00. and ends at 17:00.
You can get information about boat tours from A&N tourism, but not book the tour there. Instead, go to the aquarium jetty 1/2 hour before departure and you can buy the tickets from one of the four booths by the entrance.
You can also pay the local fishermen to take you on day trips to mangrove creeks (Bridget Creek is nice) or places like Mt Harriet National Park (where you can beach your boat and go birdwatching). Don't pay more than ₹2,000/day for the boat, and you can often bargain it down to much less. Check with the Forest Dept in advance as many destinations require certain permissions.

Thanks to the early-morning scheduling of most flights and ferries from Port Blair, many hotels have a 09:00 checkout policy.
