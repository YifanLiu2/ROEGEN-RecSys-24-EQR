For other places with this name, see Victoria.
Victoria is the capital of Canada's westernmost province; British Columbia, near the southern tip of Vancouver Island.
Victoria contains a perfect combination of the old and new Canada. Amidst the bustle of this little city, you can venture through the classical British architecture to the preserved Chinatown, or all the way back in time to the original First Nations (Indigenous) culture. The colourful gardens and paintings are worth admiring, while the natural beauty just a short distance away from the town is simply breathtaking.
For the purposes of this guide, Victoria includes the nearby municipalities of Oak Bay, Saanich, Esquimalt and Brentwood Bay.
First-time visitors stepping into Vancouver Island might be surprised by the very different atmosphere as opposed to the city of Vancouver just across the Strait of Georgia.
While the island is mainly quiet and laid back, Victoria is a step up as the largest city on the island, aided by the fact that all of British Columbia's governmental offices are here. The quaint skylines in the city centre meet with the genteel and natural design on the outskirts of the downtown, designating Victoria as a resort town for western British Columbia.
Victoria's prime location, right between the Canadian mainland and the Pacific Ocean, makes the area become perhaps one of the earliest modern developments of Canada. From its humble beginnings as a backup trade post for Fort Vancouver (at Vancouver in the USA's Washington State) erected by James Douglas in 1843, the city's ports have been a witness of historic events that brought influxes of people from all over the world to Canada: from the Gold Rush to opium trade between Asia and North America. The real estate boom after World War I however, is what gives the city its well-known character, with Edwardian skylines popping up in the city center that transitions to genteel civility in the suburbs. A trip to Victoria would not be complete without admiring its classic buildings and a trip to the park or the houses outside the city.
Victoria was named in honour of the ruling queen of England in 1843 and designated as the provincial capital of British Columbia in 1871.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Much like the whole coastal British Columbia, the winter is mild with temperatures averaging above freezing for all of the year and most of the year's worth of rain falling. The summer however is cool and comfortable enough to get outside as much as possible, and the sun doesn't set until 9PM! Compared with the Vancouver city however, the city is less wet and receives more sunshine as the mountains at the USA's Olympic Peninsula and the island mountains usually managed to block the heaviest precipitations. Snow, while infrequent, is not unheard-of at least every year.
The whole island is a casualty to at least one mild windstorm every year, which would usually blow after a rain shower. The wind can range from nuisance at best to damaging at worse. It is a good idea to check the weather forecast during your visit to get you prepared.

Whale watching is a popular activity in Victoria. Three pods of orcas (killer whales) have feeding grounds between Victoria and the mainland, plus grey whales, humpback whales and minke whales migrate through the Georgia Strait at different times of the year. Some companies offer whale watching tours year-round, but the best time to see whales is considered April to October. Tours outside of those times focus less on whales and more on the other marine wildlife. Many of the companies offer whale guarantees, but they are seasonable and tend to have conditions, so careful consideration is advised if you are making a decision based on the whale guarantee.
Tours are usually around three hours and the style of boat can vary, from open-air Zodiacs to yachts with heated cabins. Zodiacs are fast and low to the water, but can be very wet (protective suits are usually supplied) are not recommended for young children (restrictions vary by company), and people with mobility issues or injuries.

The Victoria area is an amazing place to explore if you're inclined towards natural spots.

Because Victoria’s downtown is fairly small, most of the nightlife is within walking distance. Cabs aren’t too expensive and there isn’t too far to go to get from point A to B. Victoria's police force has an aggressive crackdown on drinking and driving, so take a cab, all you have to do is stumble to Douglas and eventually you will grab one before someone else. But if it’s a special night like Halloween or New Year’s Eve, expect a bit of a wait. Compared to clubs in larger cities, cover in Victoria is cheap, ranging from $3 to $10. Fridays and Saturdays: expect to pay $7 to get in the door and another $2 to check your coat. Compared to larger cities, Victoria's liquor is pretty pricey. There is a law in Victoria that requires all drinks to cost $3 at minimum for a serving of alcohol. Expect to pay at least $3 but most likely more for each drink. Beers and shots are about $5. Most bars have cash machines inside, and accept only cash as payment.
Lucky Bar, 517 Yates St, ☏ +1-250-382-5825, info@luckybar.ca. A bit small, but not nearly as costly as others. Wednesday night is Mod Night so dress in your hipster finest.

Upstairs Cabaret, 15 Bastion Square (in Bastion Square), ☏ +1 250-385-5483, info@upstairscabaret.ca. For a slightly older crowd.

There is a drug presence among people living on the streets and in the bars. This means that panhandling can be a problem. Panhandlers are aggressive despite laws against this behaviour. You may wish to avoid Pandora Ave between Cook and Quadra as this is where a huge majority hang out. Do not walk around parks and grassy areas in sandals or bare feet as there are many needles discarded in these areas, city workers are quick to clean them up but it is always a good idea to be careful in these areas. However there is a strong police presence on downtown streets during the summer, especially on weekends at night. This problem is generally confined to the tourist area bounded by Blanshard Street.
Because all the bars and clubs are very close together, many drunken people spill into the streets at 2AM on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night and are in fact more dangerous than the street people. If you are out and about at this time (or have your downtown hotel room window open) be prepared to deal with all that drunken idiots have to offer such as public urination, shouting and rude comments.
In the unlikely event of a major earthquake, duck and cover and stay where you are during the shaking, then go outside once the shaking stops. Buildings and other structures are unlikely to collapse. Your largest threats come from breaking windows and falling objects such as ceiling tiles and bookshelves. Try to get under a table, desk, or door jamb to reduce your exposure to these threats. You are more likely to be injured if you try to run during the shaking.
The area codes for Victoria, and British Columbia as a whole, are 250 and 778. Because their areas overlap, all numbers must be dialed with the area code, including local calls.

Victoria is only a starting place to explore Vancouver Island by bus, car or bike.
Five hours by car to the west, Tofino is famous for its surfing and nature. The small town of Comox and its neighbour Courtenay are cozy and full of beautiful beaches. Head to Shawnigan Lake for a really small town and hit the lake in a canoe or the trails by foot. Nearby Hornby, Denman and Salt Spring Island each have a distinct vibe and are worth the visit just to check out something a little different. There is a lot of hiking, biking and camping. And of course, for the more city-loving folk, ferries from Victoria take you to bustling Vancouver or Seattle.
Hitchhiking is relatively common on Vancouver Island and may be useful for getting around.
