Outdoor warning sirens are installed throughout Omaha to warn people who are outdoors of impending severe weather. An activated siren usually (but not always) indicates a tornado warning. If you hear a siren while you are outside you should seek shelter immediately.
Sirens are tested regularly March-October, on the first Wednesday of every month at 11AM. Testing is cancelled if severe weather is in the area. Tests outside of the regular schedule will be published by local media.
Sirens are not intended to be heard indoors. Severe weather radios should be used inside, most hotels and businesses have a built-in tornado warning system.
Omaha is generally a safe city, but still use common sense. Simply using caution and avoiding any situation in which you are uncomfortable will basically keep you out of trouble. The vast majority of violent crime occurs in North Omaha, roughly defined as the area North of Cuming St, between 24th and 72nd St. Exercise a bit of additional caution when in this area, especially after dark.
Omaha is in Tornado Alley, so severe weather can erupt between the months of April and August with the main threats being hail, high winds and street flooding, but tornadoes can sometimes be a threat. Tornado alert sirens are located throughout the city. At 11AM on the first Wednesday of the month, the sirens are tested. If in doubt, ask a resident. Local stations KETV Channel 7 (ABC), WOWT Channel 6(NBC) and KMTV Channel 3 (CBS) break into programming if a severe weather event is in progress. Radio services 1110 AM and 590 AM also provide severe weather coverage. Omaha is in Douglas County in the state of Nebraska, as meteorologists often point out warnings this way.
During winter months, Omaha often sees cold temperatures as well as snow or ice events. There are steep hills in the city, and precaution should be taken during slick driving conditions. Blizzards are often possible, the entire city normally shuts down during one of these.
