This article only covers the City of Brisbane. See Greater Brisbane for the four other local government areas that make up Greater Brisbane
For other places with the same name, see Brisbane (disambiguation).
Brisbane is the state capital of Queensland. Large enough to be cosmopolitan yet small enough to be friendly and accessible, Brisbane is a 'garden metropolis', famous for its leafy, open spaces and the pleasant pace of life that unfolds between the zig-zags of its iconic river. Brisbane's year-round warm climate, spectacular scenery, pleasant locals and world-class facilities have been the drawcards for many domestic and international visitors, making Brisbane the fastest-growing city in Australia. Despite this rapid development, it maintains a youthful enthusiasm and is considered one of the more laid-back and forward-thinking cities in the country.
The Greater Brisbane region has a population of about  million people and is Australia's third-largest city.
Brisbane, colloquially known as Brissie (pronounced Briz-ee), gained international exposure through multiple international sporting events and political summits, including the upcoming 2032 Summer Olympics. It is also known as the main setting of the animated kids TV series Bluey.
For many thousands of years prior to British settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera Aboriginal people. They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike". The Australian English phrase "hard yakka" – meaning "hard work" – comes from the Jagera people, and is certainly what the British settlers faced in Brisbane's humid subtropical climate.
The Moreton Bay area was explored by English navigator Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point which he named "Red Cliff Point", now Redcliffe after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay. In 1823, Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, intended to house dangerous prisoners in a remote location and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay. The original penal settlement was established in Redcliffe but was later moved to a location further down the bay where freshwater supplies were more reliable. Oxley named this new settlement "Brisbane" in honour of the Governor.
A series of major immigration events took place in the following decades which brought with it strong industry and commercial development in the region. In 1838, non-convict free settlers moved to the area and pushed to close the jail and to release the land in the area. In 1859, a gold rush led to the establishment of the colony of Queensland with Brisbane as its capital even though Brisbane was not incorporated as a city until 1902. In 1925, the Queensland State Parliament created the City of Brisbane Act that set up a single government for the city of Brisbane, still the largest metropolitan authority in Australia and one of the largest in the world by area. Over twenty small municipalities and shires were amalgamated to form the City of Brisbane. 1930 was a significant year for Brisbane with the completion of Brisbane City Hall, then the city's tallest building and the Shrine of Remembrance in ANZAC Square which has since become Brisbane's main war memorial. These historic buildings along with the Story Bridge which opened in 1940 are key landmarks that help define the architectural character of the city.
During World War II, Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign when the AMP Building - now MacArthur Central was used as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, chief of the Allied Pacific forces. In 1942, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel, Australian servicemen and civilians which resulted in one death and several injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane.
Postwar Brisbane had developed a "big country town" stigma, an image the city's politicians and marketers were very keen to remove but despite steady growth, Brisbane's development was punctuated by infrastructure problems. The State Government began a major program of change and urban renewal beginning with the central business district and inner suburbs. Trams in Brisbane were a popular mode of public transport until the network was closed in 1969 leaving Melbourne as the last Australian city to operate a tram network.
The 1974 Brisbane flood was a major disaster which temporarily crippled the city. During this era, Brisbane grew and modernised rapidly becoming a destination of interstate migration. Some of Brisbane's popular landmarks were lost sometimes demolished in controversial circumstances with much media coverage and public protest. Major public works included the Riverside Expressway, the Gateway Bridge and later the redevelopment of South Bank after the city hosted World Expo '88 starting with the Queensland Art Gallery and Performing Arts Centre.
In subsequent years there has been strong immigration into Brisbane and the surrounding region, both domestically and internationally with large influxes from Asia, the Europe, New Zealand and Polynesia. This was driven by cheaper house prices than in other Australian cities, a pleasant climate and good employment opportunities, especially within the mining and tourism sectors. Brisbane's population growth has exceeded the national average every year since 1990 at an average rate of around % per year.
Since 2000, Brisbane has gone from drought to flooding rains. In the mid-2000s, lower dam levels led to severe water restrictions for residents. The campaign to lower water usage was so successful that the city now boasts some of the lowest average water use per resident of any developed city in the world. These days you're not likely to find the tap dry or see any visible signs of the shortage. However out of respect for the locals, keep your showers relatively brief, try your best to conserve water and expect the locals to be horrified if you walk away from a running tap.
A number of extremely wet summers broke the drought and culminated in the January 2011 flood which devastated the city. In typical Queensland fashion, one of the largest volunteer workforces ever amassed: over 100,000 Brisbane locals and Queensland volunteers descended on the city to aid in the clean-up, earning the nickname the "Mud Army" and allowing the city to return to business just a week after the flood. The Mud Army were honoured with the naming of a new CityCat Ferry, the "Spirit of Brisbane" and then Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard described Brisbane residents as "the best of humankind", gifting a monument to the city to honour the volunteers.
When the wet season hits the northern Australian tropics, Brisbane experiences hot and clear summer days with stunning afternoon thunderstorms. Brisbane does not experience the distinct "four seasons" like the other Australian capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. When winter arrives towards the southern capital cities, temperatures are sent into the low tens (°C), while Brisbane's climate stays mostly dry and sunny, with daytime temperatures usually remaining above 20°C.
Summer (December–February) humidity is high and daytime temperatures frequently exceed 30°C, with night temperatures rarely dropping below 20°C. Occasional heat waves can raise the temperature in excess of 40°C, however these are not common. Just about any outdoor activity you do at the height of a regular summer day in Brisbane will leave you bathed in sweat. Loose-fitting clothing that protects you from the sun is appropriate attire for most casual activities, and air-conditioning will assure you a comfortable night's sleep or ride on public transport. Summer storms with hail and heavy rainfall are common in afternoons on hot, humid days. They usually pass quickly and often put on a good lightning show. Sunrise is as early as 4:45AM, and the latest sunsets are around 6:45PM.
Autumn (March–May) sees a cool change in Brisbane with average daytime temperatures between 20 and 30°C. Most tourists not used to a humid climate will find this the best time to visit Brisbane, as the humidity lowers and the region shifts into a more comfortable, dry and sunny weather pattern, perfect for outdoor activities. Night-time temperatures usually drop to 10-20°C, with ambient heat from the day still radiating from the ground, keeping the early evening still warm and comfortable, though a light jacket may be required later at night.
Winter (June–August) signals the region's dry season, with Brisbane experiencing cool, sunny, cloudless days. Temperatures typically go up to 25°C during the day with night-time temperatures rarely dropping below 5°C. The early-morning chill usually disappears by mid-morning and most of the daylight hours are relatively warm, however it is still recommended to have something warm to wear as this is not always the case. The eastern suburbs tend to be cooler as sea breezes blow in from the bay. Daylight hours run from 6:40AM to 5PM.
Spring (September–November) sees the revitalisation of the city with warmer days and fresh sea breezes coming in from the bay. Weather is similar to Autumn months, with increasing humidity as summer draws closer.
More detailed information on Brisbane climate and weather is available online at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Brisbane Visitor Information Centre and Booking Centre, Queen Street Mall, ☏ +61 7 3006-6290. M–Th 9AM–5:30PM, F 9AM–7PM, Sa 9AM–5PM, Su and public holidays 9:30AM–4:30PM; closed Good Friday and Christmas. (updated Apr 2019)
Brisbane can be accessed by plane via the main Brisbane Airport (BNE IATA), or by the less convenient but often cheaper Gold Coast Airport.
Brisbane Airport has direct flights from all Australian capitals and many Queensland centres. Major domestic carriers include Virgin Australia, Jetstar, and Qantas. The airport is serviced by many regional airlines and it is possible to fly daily to most Asian centres (and on to Europe), the United States and New Zealand, without flying via Sydney or Melbourne.
You can get a bus and train from the Gold Coast Airport to Brisbane, by using the Surfside buses to Robina and transferring to the train. A single fare costs around $17, and you can buy a single ticket or use a Go Card.
Both airports have a full range of rental car options.
Long distance rail services both arrive and depart from  Roma Street Station in the inner city. Services to New South Wales operated by NSW TrainLink depart from Platform 2 and all other Long Distance Services depart from Platform 10.
NSW Trainlink operates a daily return rail service from Sydney, with onward connections to Melbourne and Canberra. Unfortunately, the journey from Sydney takes around 14 hours and due to scheduling issues, the train roughly leaves at around 2–3PM at Sydney Central Station and arrives between 3–4AM at Roma St Station (with few onward connections at that time).
Queensland Rail has services to most centres in Queensland
Visitors from southern states can reach Brisbane by either the New England and Cunningham or Pacific Highways.
The Bruce Highway (A1) connects the northern coast of Queensland to Brisbane.
The Pacific Motorway (M1) connects Brisbane to the Gold Coast continues south along the New South Wales coast.
The Ipswich Motorway (M2) connects to Ipswich and surrounding Western Brisbane areas.
The Warrego Highway (A2) links Brisbane to the west through the Lockyer Valley, Toowoomba and the Darling Downs.
The Cunningham Highway (A15) links Brisbane to Southern Queensland and Central western New South Wales.
Most long distance bus services operate from level 3 of the  Brisbane Transit Centre near Roma Street Station in the inner city.
Premier Motor Service offers services between Sydney and Brisbane and Brisbane and Cairns.
Greyhound Australia link other interstate capitals to Brisbane via their extensive national network. In particular they operate regular services between Brisbane and Sydney, Brisbane and Toowoomba then onward to Roma and between Brisbane and Cairns. Pick-up is available from Brisbane Airport on some services.
Murrays Coaches operate services between Brisbane and Toowoomba and onwards to the small town of Miles, west of Toowoomba. Pick up is available from Brisbane Airport on some services.
Bus Queensland operate services under Government contract between Brisbane and many rural and remote areas. Key routes serviced by this company include services between Brisbane and Charleville via Toowoomba and between Brisbane and Mt Isa.
Brisbane has an international cruise terminal next to  Portside Wharf.
Ample public and private transport options can take you anywhere in the region with ease. Areas near the river are relatively flat and are perfect for walking or cycling. If heading further out, you'll likely encounter the urban sprawl with long distances, steep roads and a confusing street layout, and you should consider other options. If you find yourself lost, it's advisable to head to the nearest main road as more than likely it will be serviced by buses or trains. If you are driving, a street directory or GPS unit is an essential addition to your car. Locals are generally friendly and more than willing to help you out if you are lost, so don't be afraid to ask.
Brisbane is well serviced by public transport with a large network of buses, trains and ferries.
South East Queensland's trains, trams, buses and ferries are run by a single provider known as Translink. The Translink website and app can be used for researching public transport options between locations. Google Maps offers full public transport navigation, with real-time information across all modes of transport.
The region is divided into 8 concentric "zones" for fare purposes. All official public transport maps clearly mark the zones and zone boundaries. Zones 1 and 2 cover Brisbane City. Your fare is determined by how many zones you travel through. Travelling between zones 2 and 3 will cost you the same as travelling between zones 7 and 8. Major destinations like shopping centres and busway stations are often used as zone boundaries. Stops that form part of the zone boundary are considered part of both zones.
The go card is a contactless smart card that you can top up with funds. The card can be purchased from train station ticket counters, busway fare machines, and selected newsagents and convenience stores of which there are many. A deposit of $10 applies. The card can be topped up at the same locations, including fare machines at train stations.
The fare is deducted as you touch on and touch off each mode of transport. You must touch both on and off for all journeys regardless of the mode of transport. A failure to touch off will result in a fixed fare of up to $30 being charged to the card. Train stations and tram stops have fare gates or distinctive pink validators located on the platform. Buses and ferries are fitted with validators as you board.
Buying a go card removes the hassle of figuring out zones. Fares are discounted by 30% and free once you have paid for eight journeys within a week (Monday to Sunday). Translink uses the word "journey" to mean end-to-end journey including any required transfers, and the word "trip" to mean a single point-to-point trip. A journey can be made up of one or more trips on any mode of transport. When making a number of trips to get to your destination it is still one journey if you touch on within 60 minutes of touching off on your previous trip.
Getting a refund for the unused money and $10 deposit can be a hassle. If you have paid by credit card you need apply and have the money returned by cheque or by transfer to an Australian bank account. If you have paid by cash you can get a refund at a train station, including the airport train station.
Contactless cards (Visa/MasterCard/American Express) can be used to pay for train, tram and ferry journeys (buses will be available by 2025). This is far more convenient than purchasing a go card, and you don't have to worry about residual amounts remaining on the card when you leave. All the same benefits apply to using a contactless card as apply to using an adult go card.
Single paper tickets are available from train station ticket counters and all train and busway fare machines. They are only valid for one way journeys and come at a premium. Buses are now pre-paid only so you will need to purchase a paper ticket beforehand or use a go card or contactless card instead.
If you are going to be doing short-term extensive travel or using the Airtrain, you can buy a 3-day or 5-day unlimited travel SEEQ Card for $79 and $129 respectively. SEEQ cards work like regular go cards however provide additional discounts at various tourist attractions around South East Queensland. You don't have to worry about topping up and refunds, but you'll struggle to get value out of it unless you are catching the Airtrain.
You can be fined $261 for travelling without a valid ticket.
Brisbane has a sizeable rail network. Most services are through-running, travelling from one side of the city to the other. All trains stop at Bowen Hills, Fortitude Valley, Central and Roma Street, regardless of their origin or destination. Interurban services run between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, with connecting tram services at Helensvale. Interurban services also run between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, with connecting bus services at Landsborough. Trains generally run from 6AM to midnight, running later on Friday and Saturday nights, and finishing earlier on Sundays.
Brisbane has a large interconnected network of bus routes that service the whole city. The bus fleet is the most modern in Australia and can be identified by the vibrant blue and yellow colouring. All buses have a digital display of their route number and a brief description of the terminus and/or areas serviced. Most routes run frequent services from 6AM to 11PM at a minimum.
Brisbane's "busways" are dedicated bus corridors that provide high frequency routes between the northern and southern suburbs. Most busway routes stop at Roma Street, King George Square, Cultural Centre and South Bank. The busways interchange with the rail network at Roma Street and South Bank, and the two modes of transport combined provide very good coverage of the city.
In some of Brisbane's notoriously dispersed outer suburbs, services may be much less frequent or have reduced running hours, so it is advisable to check timetables if making these trips. Timetables are sometimes optimistic, especially during morning and afternoon peak hours when traffic is heavy, and buses are occasionally up to 10 minutes late.
As with many cities, Brisbane has a large number of express buses, so it should not be assumed that all buses observe every stop along the roads they travel. In peak hour there are even more express routes ("rockets" and "bullets") for commuters which make very few stops at all. Ask the driver if you are unsure.
All-night bus services known as 'NightLink' are operated on Friday and Saturday nights.
The following routes are convenient for travel around the inner city:
The 'Brisbane City Loop' (Route 40) is a free and convenient bus service travelling in both directions around the CBD. This bus operates M-F 7:00AM-5:50PM every 10 minutes from the distinctive bright purple bus stops.
The 'Spring Hill Loop' (Route 30) is a free and convenient bus service travelling around the Spring Hill area just north of the CBD. This bus operates M-F 8:25AM-6:05PM every 10 minutes from the distinctive bright yellow bus stops.
The 'Blue CityGlider' (Route 60) is a paid bus service for quick north-south cross-city travel between West End and Teneriffe, stopping at the distinctive light blue bus stops. This bus operates every 5 minutes in peak hour (M-F 7-9AM and 4-6PM), and every 10 to 15 minutes all other times. It operates Su-Th 5:30AM-11:30PM, and F-Sa 24 hours.
The 'Maroon CityGlider' (Route 61) is a paid service for quick east-west cross-city travel between Ashgrove and Coorparoo, stopping at the distinctive maroon bus stops. This bus operates every 10 minutes in peak hour (M-F 7-9AM and 4-6PM) and every 15 minutes all other times. It operates Su-Th 5:30AM-11:30PM, and F-Sa 24 hours (every 30 minutes after midnight).
Ferries have become an icon of the city and are a fantastic way to tour Brisbane along the river.
The CityCat is a high-speed catamaran service that travels up and down the river between Northshore Hamilton and UQ St Lucia. Popular stops include New Farm Park, Howard Smith Wharves, Riverside, South Bank, North Quay and West End.
The CityHopper is a slow-speed catamaran service that travels up and down the river between Sydney Street and North Quay. This particular service is free but often crowded as a result.
Taxis are numerous throughout Brisbane and can take you anywhere. The major companies are Yellow Cabs and Black & White Cabs. All cabs can be hailed down no matter where you are, provided their roof light is on, though in some areas they might not be able to stop, so it might be best to book one in advance. All cabs accept cash, credit and debit cards. Despite cabs being fitted with GPS units, you'll find it wise to check with the driver about your destination before departing and make sure they are willing to go there.
In the outer-suburban areas, cabs will pull over if you hail them down from the side of the road and can be found in designated taxi ranks in shopping centres, or near bars and pubs. The same can be said for the inner-city, however taxi ranks are more common and it's usually best to catch a cab from there. At night though, especially on Friday and Saturday, taxis exclusively pick up passengers from these ranks and you'd be extremely lucky if you get one elsewhere. These ranks are usually monitored by security and have ushers at night. From midnight-5:30AM on Friday and Saturday nights, all taxis from the CBD and Fortitude Valley become "FlatFare", meaning that there is a fixed price for any given destination and you will have to pay before entering the taxi.
Taxis can be expensive in Brisbane; a trip between the airport and the city can be in excess of $50–60 and can easily run to over $100 if you go beyond the metropolitan Brisbane region.
Uber, Ola and DiDi are available.
There are plenty of national car rental companies available to pick up from the airport. As is common with many hire car companies, you will often pay a premium to pick up or return at the airport location. If you are looking to cover a long distance by car, ensure your rental policy includes unlimited mileage – most economy to standard sized car rental include this already. Most car rental companies hire to people 25 years of age and over, some all age car rental companies do hire to younger drivers over 18 years of age (there are surcharges involved for under-age drivers).
Many of the roads in the CBD are one-way, making driving in this area complicated for people not familiar with the layout. Drivers used to city driving should not find Brisbane too much of a challenge, and parking is readily available in parking stations in the city, albeit often at a steep cost, around $40 to casually park for a day. $15 parking is generally available with early-bird deals (arrive before 9:00, leave after 16:00.) The CBD has limited street parking and issues parking infringements for illegally parked vehicles. All inner-city street parking is metered and signed and costs about $4 per hour. Avoid parking fines by only parking in designated parking bays marked by white lines. A yellow painted line along the kerbside indicates no standing and no parking.
Most CBD roads become clearways at 16:00 (unless signed otherwise), and any cars parked on the side of the road will be fined, towed or both. You have to pay for the towing to get your car back, and then expect a fine to follow in the mail. Check for signs and line marking when parking, or just play it safe and find a parking station.
If you are looking to visit the areas surrounding the city, then generally a car will be as quick as any other way of getting around, with the possible exception of the height of peak hour. Brisbane is notorious for having roads that bottle-neck and what would normally be a 15-minute trip could easily turn into well over an hour during peak times.
There are several toll roads in and around Brisbane (clearly signed and marked for approaching motorists), including the Gateway Bridge which crosses the river near the airport, the Clem-7 tunnel and the Go-Between Bridge. Cash is not accepted, toll users must have a prepaid transponder or post-pay via a website. Check the Linkt website for details.
Under Queensland law, 50cc scooters can be ridden by just about anyone who holds a car driver's licence. This makes them a good way to get around the CBD, due to limited street parking, and often-expensive off-street parking. Scooter and motorbike parking is free and plentiful. The down side to renting a scooter is that they are speed-limited to 55 km/h. If on a multi-lane road, stay in the left lane. Scooters are not allowed on highways. North of Brisbane you will find many beautiful scenic drives for motorbike enthusiasts. The North side is surrounded by many windy roads and great mountain roads on which any motorbike rider can enjoy a full day out on the motorbike of just about any size. There are services available throughout Brisbane and the Gold Coast which deliver both scooters and motorbikes right to your door-step. Some will even provide all the necessary gear as well.
Getting around the city and South Bank is easy thanks to the many cycle paths along the river.
Cycling on footpaths is legal in the Brisbane City Council area (maximum speed 10 km/h), however pedestrians have right of way. Keep left and take special care when riding through South Bank Parklands as the shared (and quite wide) foot and cycle path is often clogged with large groups taking up the whole path, pedestrians stopping unexpectedly for photos and playing children running heedlessly in front of you. It is often too noisy here to use your bell, so use your common sense, and dismount and push your bike through crowded pedestrian areas.
Maps showing extensive dedicated bikeways and shared paths in the Brisbane City Council area are available on the BCC websitedead link and a journey planner is available here. These bikeways offer a pleasant way to explore and enjoy Brisbane.
Some areas of Brisbane are very hilly. If your street map shows a tangle of winding streets close together that is a sign of steep roads. A short trip can quickly become a lot of work; stick to the river when possible, it's where you get the best views and it is almost entirely flat.
If you leave the cycle paths, footpaths, and minor streets you should be prepared to contend with busy urban traffic. Feel free to ignore any Brisbane motorists that may have resentment toward cyclists and ignorance of the road rules applying to cyclists; cyclists are permitted to travel on just about all roads in Brisbane. Special "bicycle lanes" on Brisbane's roads are becoming increasingly common and are often denoted by a narrow green-coloured strip of road adjacent to the curb.
Brisbane is an excellent city for walking and you should have no problems getting around the CBD. Within minutes of walking in virtually any direction you will be able to find a bus, train or ferry station. Maps can be purchased from bookstores, any tourist information centre or viewed online. There are also a number of shared pathways that offer relaxed walking routes away from roads and traffic. Beyond the CBD and inner-suburbs however, sights can become very spread out, so you might want to consider other modes of getting around.

Mount Coot-tha, Sir Samuel Griffiths Drive. Brisbane's tallest mountain. A popular make-out spot with a great view and good but overpriced cafe and restaurant. Large TV and radio antennas line some of its broad peak. You can take a scenic drive through the heavily forested Mount Coot-tha Reserve to the peak to see the almost-360° views of Brisbane and the surrounding region. The mountain is 287 m (941 ft) above sea level and forms the eastern extent of the Taylor Range. It is the most northern part of Australia to record snow. It is a prominent landmark approximately 6 km (4 mi) to the west of the Brisbane central business district and is visible from much of the city. Before the Moreton Bay penal settlement, Mount Coot-tha was the home of the Turrbal Aboriginal people. Early Brisbane people called it One Tree Hill when bush at the top of the mountain was cleared except for one large eucalypt tree. The Aboriginal people of the area used to come to the mountain to collect ‘ku-ta’ (honey) that was produced by the native stingless bee. Mount Coot-tha (Place of Honey), a derivative of the indigenous term, replaced the title ‘One Tree Hill' in 1880 when the area was declared a Public Recreation Reserve. Car is the most effective way to enjoy Mount Cootha at your own pace. There is ample parking at the peak. One can also hike the marked trail from the mountain's foot. See one of the best views of Brisbane. It is best to arrive just before dusk or dawn so you can enjoy the transition from day to night. Drive to the peak for a picnic dinner and admire the views. There are several walking tracks through the forests that surround the summit; some are difficult. It is a great place from which to watch the Riverfire fireworks in Sep.

The Scenic Rim. This describes the large arc of mountains, to a height of 1,375 m (4,511 ft), from the Mistake Ranges (south of Gatton) across the Main (Great Dividing) Range to the MacPherson Range that terminates at Currumbin on the Gold Coast. Apart from some well known locations on the Rim, such as Binna Burra and O'Reilleys guesthouses, Springbrook and Cunningham’s Gap, the largest proportion of these ranges are unspoilt and much of it near-wilderness. Many forest areas were previously logged, but the forest recovery has been excellent, and virtually all the logging tracks have disappeared except for those still used for foot access. At the previously mentioned sites, graded paths offer a taste, but for the more adventurous there are many hiking possibilities from day trips to sustained multi-day exercises. More information can be found on the web. Hikers should be properly prepared and conversant with navigation in difficult country and the rules of National Parks.

Brisbane's Fortitude Valley has the highest concentration of bars, pubs and clubs anywhere in Australia and in 2005, was given Australia's first and only "Special Entertainment Precinct" zoning, which protects and promotes the live music scene. In 2007, influential US entertainment Billboard magazine named Brisbane in the world's top 5 hotspots for live music. And in 2010 the city opened the Go-Between Bridge, named after the popular Brisbane indie rock band The Go-Betweens. There is no doubt that the locals love their music and a night out in Brisbane is not complete without experiencing some of the live music on offer. If you are looking for what's happening in Brisbane, most music and entertainment stores as well as some restaurants and cafés offer free entertainment magazines that list what's coming up within the next month or so. Brisbane and the surrounding South East Queensland region plays host to a myriad of music and arts festivals and are advertised in these magazines.
Though you might find most musicians playing in the numerous bars and clubs around the CBD, West End and the Valley, there are some venues which are geared specifically toward hosting bands or artists that are on official tours. Some events allows under-18s in, but not all, so it's best to check beforehand.

Football (multiple codes):  Suncorp Stadium is host to Brisbane Broncos NRL and Queensland Reds Rugby Union teams in winter, and Brisbane Roar soccer club in summer; in 2023 it staged soccer matches in the Women's World Cup. Other events such as the NRL State of Origin are also a big draw-card.

Brisbane's drinking and nightlife scene is separated into some distinct areas. Anyone planning a night on the town should be aware that after 3AM, no more patrons are allowed into pubs and clubs. This is a safety measure, coupled with increased security presence at taxi ranks. Additionally, smokers should beware of strict anti-smoking regulations. Smoking is now banned in "all areas where food & drink are served", both indoors and outdoors. This means that smoking is banned in all hotels, clubs, and cafés except in designated smoking areas.
The drinking age in Australia is 18 and only an Australian driver's licence, 18+ card or a foreign passport is accepted as proof of age. Other forms of ID such as a student card are not accepted. These regulations are strictly enforced - for nightclubs in particular, your ID will always be checked at the door, and while venues serving food may let you in, most are very prudent in checking ID if you wish to purchase alcohol.

The Fortitude Valley is a unique area of Brisbane catering to the live music scene. A large number of Brisbane's hippest clubs are located here. Through the 1960s and 70s it was seen as Brisbane's bohemian hub and has maintained a certain degree of that reputation. It became thought of as being one of the more dangerous areas of the city but this attitude is changing as the area becomes more popular and hence, safer. This attitude, however, has had an adverse effect on the area's creative vibe, as locals turn their back on the area, forcing the creative centre of Brisbane to shift towards other areas of the city such as West End and Paddington. As with anywhere, simple common sense, caution and courtesy will keep you out of harm's way.

Brisbane has a relatively low crime rate in comparison to other cities of such size. In most cases being aware of your environment and using common sense will keep you safe. Like Sydney and other large cities, trains and train stations are usually considered a common crime zone throughout the afternoons and nights, however trains and stations are patrolled by Police, Transit Officers, railway personnel and private security guards. Cameras are also used to increase security. It is advised to exercise caution when travelling on trains and buses during these periods of the day.
Here are some particular areas of note:
Outer Suburbs: Tend to have a higher crime rate than inner suburbs which should be taken into account when visiting these areas.
Days: Very safe during the day, but using common sense goes a long way. Avoid gangs of people, especially if they seem trashy or obnoxious and be mindful if a questionable person approaches you.
Nights: Like most other places, outer suburbs to get more dangerous. Most suburban streets are poorly lit or have no lighting at all. It is recommended that individuals walking in these areas at night take precaution or venture within a group.
City Central/CBD: Usually very safe at all hours.
Days: Very safe during the day thanks to a good police presence and most people only being there for work. Though during school holidays groups of youths can congregate, especially around Queen St and South Bank and can get rather rowdy, but they usually mind their own business.
Nights: Still relatively safe at night. Police presence isn't as strong, except on Friday and Saturday nights, but you're still urged to travel with others. Be careful if catching a train at night, even though the train stations and trains are well patrolled and watched by CCTV. Treasury Casino patrons often gather outside and unwanted attention can be received late at night due to drunks. However, security is tight and the entire area around the Casino is monitored by CCTV. Take extra caution if in South Bank at night due to groups of youths congregating there.
Fortitude Valley: Police presence very strong here due to the concentration of bars.
Days: Just as safe as the CBD during the day.
Nights (especially Friday and Saturday): Taxi ranks in particular can be a little dangerous due to many frustrated drunks having to wait for cabs. Wait only at ranks that have a security guard. Stay to the well-lit busy streets and never venture off alone, especially down back-streets or far away from a crowd. Especially for females, it is recommended to travel in pairs or groups to avoid any unwanted attention from drunken revellers, especially in the early hours of the morning.
Suburban pubs: generally less safe than inner-city pubs, bars and clubs due to less police and security. Drunks can be a hassle when in the vicinity of suburban pubs, especially around closing times. Fights in these venues are common.
Throughout Australia, the number for emergency services (Police, Fire and Ambulance) is 000. When using a mobile or cell phone, the numbers 000 and 112 are free of charge, and connect using any of the available networks.
Emergency numbers such as 911 and 999 do not work within Australia.
Probably the worst thing that can befall your trip to Brisbane is sunburn and other heat-related issues. The local UV Index is almost always in the extreme rating during the day (10AM-3PM) and precautions should always be taken. Do not be fooled though, even in the cooler months or when it is overcast you can still be affected by UV rays or the heat. Sunscreen, shirts, sunglasses and lots of water are essential.
The damaging effects of the Queensland sun should not be underestimated. The state has the highest per-capita rate of skin cancer in the world and tourists often come unprepared. On a sunny day in Brisbane, it is common to be sunburnt after as few as 15 minutes under the midday sun, but sunburn can also occur on overcast days. This is not exclusive to summer, but can happen all year round, even in winter.
If you are planning a long day outdoors, always cover up with sunscreen, loose clothing, a hat and sunglasses to protect yourself. Limit your outdoor physical activity in the summer until you are used to the heat. Immediately seek shade or an air-conditioned area and drink plenty of water if you are feeling the effects of heat exhaustion, including headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, confusion or fainting.
Many visitors to Brisbane take day trips to enjoy the very popular nearby beaches at the Gold Coast (south) or the Sunshine Coast (north). Beaches can be great fun and very enjoyable when safe. It is important to know that most of the coastal beaches are Pacific ocean beaches with little to no protection that coves and bays provide. They can become dangerous to swim in due to strong currents, rough or powerfully-breaking waves, and various harmful marine life. Ensure you only swim at beaches where and when lifeguards are on duty and between the flags displayed in front of lifeguard observers. Check with lifeguards for any present, or potential undercurrents, rips, tows, or for the presence of bluebottles, stinging jellyfish, or other potential dangers prior to swimming. Advise the on-duty lifeguards if you are inexperienced in swimming at a beach so they can give you more attention. Avoid going past waist-deep if you are not a strong swimmer. Parents should accompany their children while they swim as rips, undertows, strong currents, and rough breaking waves can cause extreme difficulty. Sadly there have been tourists who have drowned due to inexperience with swimming in an ocean setting. Do not swim after consuming alcohol as it can affect your ability to swim and has been a contributing factor in some drowning fatalities. Avoid swimming near anyone using equipment such as surfboards, windsurfers, parasails, sailing craft or power craft such as jetskis, and motorboats.
Brisbane provides a base for day trips to explore the southeast of Queensland. The North Coast of New South Wales can also be reached in an hour if traffic is light, but allow up to two hours travel if traffic is heavy or there is an accident on the Pacific Motorway. Queensland Rail also provides extensive services out of Brisbane to the north and south of the city and to the Gold Coast.
