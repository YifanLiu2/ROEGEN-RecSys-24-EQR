Vadodara lies on the bank of Vishwamitri River, 141 km from Gandhinagar, the state capital. The eastern part is the old city, while the western part beyond the Railway Station is the modern part of the city.
Vadodara came into prominence during the period of the Maratha confederacy, when the a general of the Marathas, Pilaji Gaekwad, conquered the city from the Mughals. He and his descendants ruled the region, initially under the vassalage of the Maratha Peshwas, becoming increasingly independent as the Peshwas weakened as a power. After the defeat of the Peshwas, the Gaekwads continued to rule the kingdom as one of the autonomous princely states under the British. Vadodara owes much to the Gaekwads, who were generally considered to be enlightened rulers, bringing industry and excellent educational institutions to the city. Many of the attractions for travelers are from those times.
The city has continued its tradition of being a being an industrial centre during modern times as well. It is home to people who have moved here from other cities in India, attracted by a lifestyle that combines the calm of a small town with the amenities you would expect from a major city. Vadodara has a significant population of people who have returned from a stay abroad (former Non-Resident Indians or NRIs) who have decided to settle here.
Apart from Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi and Sindhi are spoken by pockets of the population, Marathi due to the heritage of the Gaekwad rule and Sindhi by descendants of refugees from the Partition. Most people are easily able to speak passable English, and in certain areas you will meet people that are fluent in English.
