South African Airways fly to Lusaka from Johannesburg with multiple flights per day. Kenya Airways flies from Nairobi. and Ethiopian Airlines from Addis Ababa. (In Johannesburg the airlines have no control over baggage in transit and the airport's baggage concessionnaire is exempt from responsibility by contract, so lost and especially pilfered baggage can be an issue.)
Various other African airlines also serve Lusaka.
All Zambian airlines have been refused permission to operate services to the EU since 2009. This decision, by the EU Air Safety Committee, followed an International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) audit of Zambia, which discovered significant shortcomings in the ability of the Zambian civil aviation authorities to ensure the safe operation of airlines licensed by them. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office recommends against flying with any Zambian-based airline if a reasonable alternative exists.1

There are two trains per week to Lusaka from Livingstone. The Zambezi offers business class and sleeper compartments and is recommended for tourists. The other train is the Kafue, heavily subsidized by the government and therefore dirt-cheap but lacking most amenities. There are no differences in travel time between the two trains. Both trains connect with cities north such as Ndola and Kitwe, which are in the Copperbelt region. Timetables can be found on the website of the national carrier ZRL. By rail from Lusaka to Kitwe is 290 km and takes 15 hours. from Lusaka to kapiri Mposhi is 160 km. from Kapiri Mposhi to Mbeya is 1020 km and takes 20 hours.
It is also possible to buy train tickets for the TAZARA railway from Kapiri Mposhi to Tanzania at Tazara House opp the market corner of cairo road and Independence Avenue Lusaka or at the TAZARA Railway office in Ndola. students are eligible for a 50% discount. the Kapiri Mposhi Tazara train station is 162 km north of Lusaka. the Tazara railway is a good low cost way to get from Zambia to Tanzania. the 2nd class sleeper fare from Kapiri Mposhi to Mbeya Tanzania is K152. The 2nd class sleeper fare from Kapiri Mposhi to the Tanzania border at Tunduma 900 km is K131. the 2nd class sleeper fare all the way from Kapiri Mposhi to Dar Es saalam 1860 km is K272. The train departs Kapiri Moshi two times a week on Tuesday at 16:00 and Friday at 14:00 and you get to the Tanzania border the next day at around 11:00.
The small  Lusaka railway station is centrally located.
Since it is the commercial centre and governmental seat of Zambia, all the arterial roads lead to Lusaka. Buses run between Livingstone and Kitwe. Operators of this route regularly change, so ask locally before you travel. Mazhandu is the most reliable option.
For buses within Zambia Power Tools, Juldan Motors, UBZ are widely considered to be the best, most reliable lines by locals and expatriates. Buses leave from Inter-City terminal, near downtown Lusaka. they always run true to schedule, have a large fleet of buses with extras to be called into service in case of a break down, make stops at well-lit areas with decent bathrooms, tag your bags for you, and have courteous bus attendants. There are many buses a day between Lusaka and Livingstone, including the overnight bus. Several buses are "business class" with wider seats and greater legroom. the first bus departs about 06:00 and the last bus departs 19:30. It is 482 km from Lusaka to Livingstone and the trip takes around 7 hours.
International coach services are available to/from Johannesburg South Africa Malawi, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Mozambique to Lusaka.
Minibuses are ubiquitous, cheap, and, if already full, fast. Single rides generally cost (about US$). Most routes head to/from the 4 major bus stations in the city centre (referred to collectively as "town"), although there are a small number of alternative routes or short-cut routes, especially during the rush hours. A rider can get just about anywhere in the city with one connection in town. Going in to town is quite straightforward. Going away from town it's best to ask the driver where he's going. Routes and destinations are not posted on the vehicles themselves, but if a bus is taking on passengers the conductor will likely be shouting the destination through the window. Minibuses do run into the evenings, but become decreasingly frequent at the evening wears on.
For the uninitiated, then, a taxi might be a better option, at least initially. Taxis come in two colours - sky blue, and a light grey, and are usually Toyota Corollas. There are no meters in Zambia's taxis, so prices are somewhat negotiable but always on the high side for Africa. Be sure to set a price before getting in the cab, US$2 for a short ride is a fair tourist price. (Ask at a hotel lobby how much your trip should cost. If the cab driver states a higher price, mention that you're happy to ride a mini-bus. Watch the price drop. )
Take down a taxi driver's mobile number, most will be happy to do an all day deal, wait for you while you explore, pick you up early or late and take you to and from the airport.
Ride-hailing app Yango is available.
Walking is an option as distances are not that large, and there are a fair number of street names to help orient yourself. However walking at night does have its hazards - manhole covers are not Lusaka's strong point and there are many uncovered drains that could swallow you whole, hence a torch is a good idea - and drivers seem allergic to moving over for pedestrians walking on the road - so best to stick to the dirt paths at the side of the roads (these are more common than pavements or sidewalks).

An amusingly stark 'collection' of modern art on the ground floor, coupled with a more engaging exhibition upstairs covering Zambia's colonial history, village life, and witchcraft. Lots of old newspaper cuttings giving an interesting glimpse in to the prejudiced views of British Colonial Officers and their attitudes towards the 'natives'.

Levy 1, Church Rd. Yet more South African shops for you to browse, including a huge Pick'n'Pay, and a cinema.

Whilst not a gourmet destination there is some good eating to be had in Lusaka. The gradual shopping mall-isation of the city sadly means that uninspiring South African chain restaurants are multiplying - but there is still a good selection of independent places scattered around. Lusaka seems to specialise in Indian cuisine. Chindo Road is the closest thing that Lusaka has to a restaurant strip.
Dil offers some of the best Indian food anywhere and is reasonably priced (though not dirt-cheap). It's in the Ibex Hill area of town, about 15 minutes drive from the city centre, provided there's no traffic. Well worth the drive but a taxi fare each way will cost more than a meal.
Dong Fang Good local Chinese fare in Long Acres, near Ndeke Hotel.

Melsim Lodge Ethiopian Restaurant, Alick Nkhata Rd (north of the old airport, behind Flamingo Supermarket).

There are a number of mid-range accommodation options, as well. Of particular note are the 'executive lodge' type places - these are aimed at Zambian businessmen and civil servants on their travels and usually comprise a bedroom, breakfast, a pleasant bar and off-street parking - and are usually modern and clean and less than half the price of the top-end hotels.

They offer en suite rooms and genuine suites, too, for about US$30. Abundant Life is also a church, and they offer worship services on-site.

Hilton Garden Inn Lusaka Society Business Park, Cairo Road Lusaka ZM, ☏ +260 211324777. It must be one of Lusaka's tallest (and most aesthetic looking) skyscrapers. It has all the amenities of a Hilton Garden property (pool, gym, restaurant, wifi, etc.) and is located downtown. (updated Aug 2020)

The Pamodzi Hotel. Probably the nicest in Lusaka, having undergone a US$7 million renovation. Helpful staff. However, the food is generally disappointing.
The Intercontinental Hotel is a close second. Restaurant service can be slow.
The Southern Sun (ex. Holiday Inn, ex Ridgeway Hotel) is casual and comfortable, but expensive (US$200 per night).
The Protea Lusaka Hotel is near Arcades and is the newest hotel in Lusaka and will run you about US$150/night for a singe room with a king sized bed. The price includes a breakfast buffet and free wifi accessible from most areas of the hotel. The hotel and restaurant bar area is usually pretty quiet unless there is a conference being held at the hotel. If there is a conference the a la carte restaurant menu is not available, but there is a lunch buffet for about US$25. However, the best part of the hotel is its location in the Arcades, which houses a few of the city's better restaurants. Be wary of a room on the first floor as there is a nightclub in the casino below the hotel, which is noisy on Wednesday and Friday nights.
Lusaka seems to have obtained a bad reputation for being a city plagued by crime, but in reality, this is exaggerated — other African cities such as Nairobi, Johannesburg and Lagos are much more risky. However, travellers should appreciate that walking around the city at night is foolish and that you will become a target for pickpockets if you make your valuables visible. HIV/AIDS is endemic here, so if you have sex while visiting Lusaka, make sure to use a condom and take other appropriate precautions.
