Okayama (Japanese: 岡山市 Okayama-shi) is a major transit hub for western Japan. But with white peaches, a brooding black castle, and the famous garden of Kōrakuen, there are plenty of reasons to catch a later train and get out of the station to explore.
Among the attractions of Okayama, only Kōrakuen is widely known. Many travelers only pass through on the Shinkansen as they travel between Kansai and Hiroshima without giving Okayama any thought. But one key unlocks the city's unique charm: Momotarō, the Peach Boy.
According to the Japanese fairytale, an old, childless couple found a peach floating down the river, and inside they found a baby boy. They duly adopted him and named him Momotarō (桃太郎), or (quite literally) "Peach Boy". As he grew, he began to feel greatly indebted to the couple that raised him, and when he was finally grown, he announced that he would be going on a journey to Onigashima (Demon Island) to fight the demons that had been causing trouble in the nearby villages. The old woman prepared kibi-dango (see Eat) for him to take on his journey and bid him farewell.
On his way to the island, he befriended a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant by giving them each a piece of the kibi-dango. With their help, he defeated the demons; Momotarō took the demons' treasures back home and gave them to the old couple to thank them for all the things they'd done for him throughout the years. The couple rejoiced that he was back safely, and they all lived happily ever after.
Residents claim that Okayama was the original setting of the fairytale, and that it was based on the legend of Prince Kibitsuhiko's battle against the ogre Ura, who is said to have lived in Kino-jo (Demon's Castle) in the area around Soja. Today, Okayama is a busy city of some 700,000 people, and its main street is named Momotarō-Odōri in the Peach Boy's honor; you'll find statues from the tale along the way. Although the Culture Zone can easily fill a full day, try to set aside time for cycling the Kibi Plain - it's another fun way to explore the history of this intriguing area.
Okayama's documented history tends to get overshadowed by its folklore history, but of course it exists. The area has been one of the most important in Japan for centuries. In ancient times, the modern city was part of the Kibi Kingdom (吉備国 kibi no kuni). Situated between the Yamato to the east and Korea and other Japanese tribes to the west, the Kibi Kingdom excised a great amount of control over trade between the regions. At its peak, the Kibi Kingdom was said to have been equal in power to the Yamato and the large kofun (burial mounds) that still exist in the Kibi Plains are a testament to that.
In 645 AD the Kibi Kingdom was dissolved into four separate provinces; Bingo, Bitchu, Bizen, and Mimasaka. Most of modern Okayama City fell within Bizen Province. Development of the area into a large, unified city is accredited to Ukita Naoie who built up the domain as a castle town with Okayama as its capital. It was the same year he commissioned Okayama Castle to be constructed, although it was not completed until 1597. The Ukita continued to rule until they found themselves on the losing side in the Battle of Sekigahara. Kobayakawa Hideaki, who betrayed Ukita Hideie at Sekigahara, was given control of Okayama but he died after only 2 years as its leader, so the territory was awarded to Ikeda Tadetsugu, one of Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandsons. The Ikeda were powerful rulers that continued to foster growth and cultural development in the city, including the construction of Korakuen Garden from 1686 to 1700. The influence of the Ikeda extended well beyond the borders of their domain as they ruled until the Meiji Period when the provinces were reorganized into prefectures (1871) and they are still well-known and respected today. The city was bombed in World War II air raids in 1945, destroying much of the city center and Okayama Castle, which had been designated as one of Japan's great castles.
The city was rebuilt after the war. Although it had always been an important hub in Western Honshu, it experienced renewed importance with the extension of the Shinkansen from Osaka. Construction of the line began in 1965, a year after the line connecting Tokyo to Osaka opened and it began operation in 1972. Today Okayama ranks among Japan's most populated cities and a major economic center in the Chugoku Region.

Okayama is known as the "Land of Sunshine". The city is guarded by mountains which often take the rainfall before it can reach the city, so compared to the surrounding prefectures and most of the country, Okayama has more sunny days. It is not uncommon for it to be raining in the surrounding areas while Okayama is merely cloudy or even sunny. Likewise, snow is uncommon in the winter.
The Okayama dialect (岡山弁) is quite different from standard Japanese, with several vocabulary and sound-related distinctions. Some examples of its unique points include changing the standard da copula to ja (e.g., daijoubu da ("I'm/It's okay") is raku ja in the local dialect. Some other common Okayama-specific vocabulary include words like eroo or buchi (standard Japanese: totemo, meaning "very"), bokkee and banko (standard Japanese: sugoi, meaning "great/amazing") and oidensee (standard Japanese: irasshaimase, "welcome"). Though the Okayama dialect is used by men and women, it is thought (even by some locals) to sound somewhat "rough", and even unladylike when used by younger women.
Although it's outside of the Kansai area, the Kansai dialect can still be heard here, particularly the sound changing of the word-final -i of adjectives to a drawn-out -ee (e.g., sugoi ("amazing") to sugee).
Spoken English ability is generally poor, but some residents may surprise you with their fluency. Locals understand standard Japanese, but depending on the dialectical "severity" of the speaker, you may not understand their response. Of course, any use of the local dialect on your part will likely result in both surprise and good-natured amusement. Despite the lack of English-speakers, Okayama residents tend to be extremely friendly and willing to offer help.

Has maps and pamphlets in English, Chinese, and Korean. The staff here have a reputation for being both helpful and friendly to foreign visitors.
Momotaro Tourist Information Center, Basement No.6, Ichibangai Ekimotomachi (it's in the Okayama Ichibangai; exit Okayama Station, turn right and walk towards the Granvia hotel; there's an escalator/stairwell: the tourist information center is just below this stairwell), ☏ +81 86 222-2912, momotaro@okayama-kanko.net. 09:00-20:00. This is the city's primary tourist information center. The Okayama Station information center is best for quick questions and guidance, but those wanting more information should make their way here instead. They have an impressive array of pamphlets and information about Okayama City, as well as every other city/town in Okayama Prefecture. They even have information about places outside of Okayama. There are also travel books and magazines available to browse. They usually have at least one staff member that can speak English and sometimes serve free kibi dango and tea outside the center.
Izushi Shiromachi Studio, 1-6-6 Izushi-cho Kita-ku, ☏ +81 86 206-5124. 09:00-17:30. It's across the bridge from Korakuen Garden in a quieter part of town. It is most useful for drivers who won't go to the station or those who are already out and about. The information provided here is mostly limited to travel within Okayama City.
The local tourist association has a multilingual guide site.
Okayama Momotarō Airport (岡山空港 OKJ IATA). In the late 2010s, it was renamed for the popular hero of Japanese folklore. It offers flights to/from Tokyo (Haneda), Sapporo, and Okinawa. There are also direct international flights between Okayama and Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai and Taipei. Buses make a 30-minute run to JR Okayama Station (¥780).
If you choose to fly to Kansai International Airport (KIX IATA), there is a bus that departs every 2-3 hours that can take you directly to Okayama from the airport in 3 hr 40 min for ¥4750. It is faster (2 hr), but more expensive (¥8320 reserved seating), to take the JR Haruka limited express train to Shin-Osaka, and transfer to the Shinkansen to Okayama station (2 or 3 stops on the Nozomi or Sakura; trains likely bound for Okayama, Hiroshima, Hakata or Kagoshima-Chuo). Not only is this option faster, JR services are much more frequent than the bus.
Okayama is a major stop on the San'yo Shinkansen. All trains passing through Chugoku stop at Okayama. Nozomi trains depart Tokyo at 20-minute intervals between 6:00 and 20:30, reaching Okayama in as little as 3 hr 13 min (¥17660 reserved); one Hikari per hour makes the trip in 4 hr 15 min (¥17130 reserved; free with the Japan Rail Pass). Hikari and Sakura trains also make frequent runs, stopping at Okayama between Osaka, Fukuoka, and Kagoshima.
The Sunrise Seto/Sunrise Izumo runs overnight from JR Tokyo Station, leaving Tokyo at 22:00 and arriving in Okayama at 06:27. The return trip to Tokyo departs Okayama at 22:34 and arrives in Tokyo at 07:08. The trip cost is the basic fare of ¥10670 (waived for holders of the Japan Rail Pass) plus additional fees depending on the accommodation used. If you have a Japan Rail Pass, you can book a carpeted floor space on this service at no charge (¥3830 without the JR Pass). Accommodation fees for compartments and rooms range from ¥9900 to ¥17280. There are showers on board. Note that these trains are subject to cancellation in the event of inclement weather.
Okayama is also the starting point/terminus of the Marine Liner rapid trains which travel on the famous Seto Ohashi Bridge over the Seto Inland Sea to/from Sakaide and Takamatsu, and limited express trains to other destinations on the island of Shikoku. Many of these trains to Shikoku are timed for seamless connections with Nozomi arrivals. If you travel on the Marine Liner using the Japan Rail Pass, you have the option to upgrade to a comfortable Green Car seat for a small surcharge.
If you do not have a Japan Rail Pass, it is possible to travel cheaply overnight from Okayama to Matsuyama, Kochi, and Fukuoka during University vacation periods using Moonlight Special Rapid services. These are very popular and tend to get fully booked a month in advance.
Yakumo Limited Express Trains also connect Okayama to Yonago at the Sea of Japan coast. It's a scenic 2-hour trip across the Chūgoku mountains with a magnificent view of Mount Daisen. From Yonago it is another 1/2 hour to Matsue, and 1 hour to Izumo in the San-in Region.
Super Inaba Limited Express services connect Okayama to Tottori, another Sea of Japan destination, in two hours.

Map of Okayama - city center
Fares for public transport can either be paid in cash or by using a Hareca Card. Board trams and buses at the rear, take a boarding ticket, and pay your fare at the front when you disembark. The driver will not give change, but there is a machine on the tram that will change coins. Prepaid bus cards can also be used on the trams.
Two convenient tram lines of Okayama Denki Kido run from the east side of JR Okayama Station. The Higashiyama line runs along Momotaro-Odori to Okayama Symphony Hall (stopping at "Shiroshita" tram stop, which is the closest stop to Okayama Castle), and then turns south towards the prefectural government office before winding towards the terminus. The other line turns to the right about half-way along Momotaro-Odori, passes the central post office, and terminates at the Seikibashi intersection.
Buses run throughout the city. You can buy prepaid bus cards at several locations including the JR Okayama Station bus information booth and Omotecho Bus Center, in ¥2000, ¥5000 or ¥10,000 iterations. These cards work out to be slightly cheaper than paying cash at the end of each journey, but unused portions of the cards cannot be refunded. (When a card is "drained" of its prepaid charge, you can use cash to pay the outstanding amount.) Trips within the city cost no more than a few hundred yen; from JR Okayama Station to Tenmaya/Omotecho shopping mall costs ¥100.
Perhaps the most confusing thing is that different companies offer similar routes that depart at different times from different bus-stops. The staff at bus information centers are very helpful, but might not give information on rival companies running similar routes unless asked. For the most recent departures from Okayama Station, there is a bus departure list complete with times and stop number straight outside the Okayama Station ticket gates.
Some companies push the Hareca Integrated Circuit Cards (IC Cards, limited only to the trams and local buses run by Ryobi, Shimoden and Okaden companies) as an alternative to the disposable prepaid cards, but the deposit for a new card makes them more expensive than paying by cash, especially if you are only making a short visit.
Okayama can be an excellent place for biking. For those who want to bike from Okayama Station, there is a Rentacycle attached to the station. Upon exiting Okayama Station (Higashi-guchi Exit), turn to the right and walk straight along the station building. You'll pass the Hotel Granvia (left side) and the Renta-Car. It's about a 3 minute walk from the station exit.
Within the downtown area, the city also has its own Momochari. The name is a play on words. In Japanese, mama-chari is what they call women's bikes (typically bikes with baskets). Momo is the Japanese word for 'peach', a reference to the city's famous white peaches and Momotaro, the Peach Boy. To rent a Momo-chari, you must first get a membership card which can be purchased at any of the Momo-chari portals located by the bikes. They can be paid for with ICOCA/SUICA cards. The bikes cost ¥100 for the first hour and an additional ¥100 every 30 minutes after that. The maximum cost for a 24-hour period is ¥1000. If you keep the bike beyond 24 hours, it costs an additional ¥1000 per day. The Momo-chari Bike Portals are all located in the downtown area of central Okayama.
The Kibi Cycling Trail is a well-known cycling trail through the historic Kibi area of Okayama. There are Rentacycles located at Bizen-Ichinomiya Station and at Soja Station (Soja). If you rent a bike at one of these sites, you can return the bike at the other. This special system was designed to make the cycling course more enjoyable and appealing to travelers. You don't have to backtrack in order to return your bike. You can simply rent your bike at one station, cycle the trail, and then drop your bike off at the other station.
Upon exiting Okayama Station, the taxis are on the right side (toward Hotel Granvia). The base fair is ¥630.
Okayama is also home to Grace Taxi, a unique taxi service with all-female drivers. You must contact them by phone in order to use their services.
Statues of Momotaro are a popular Okayama photo-op. Arriving by train, you'll see your first at the east exit of JR Okayama Station, but there are Momotaro motifs all over the city - there is a Momotaro mailbox at the east exit of the station, and even manholes often feature the Peach Boy. You will also find individual statues of his travel companions the dog, monkey, and pheasant aligning both sides of Momotaro-odori. At the end of the island where Korakuen is located, look for the Riverside Peachbaby, a statue of Momotaro holding a peach to the heavens.
Many of central Okayama's main sights are clustered on the eastern side of the Central Business District in the area known as the Culture Zone. From JR Okayama station, take the tram three stops east to Shiroshita on the Higashiyama Line. All of the sites are within short walking distance.
English-speaking guides are available for free tours of the castle and garden. The guides are volunteers, so it's best to call ahead (☏ +81 86-224-1166) to ensure that they will be available.
View of Okayama Castle from Kōrakuen
Kōrakuen Garden (後楽園), 1-5 Korakuen (15-min walk from Okayama Station or 5-min walk from Shiroshita tram Stop), ☏ +81 86-272-1148. Apr-Sep: 07:30-18:00, Oct-Mar: 08:00-17:00. The name means "Garden of Pleasure After", a reference to a famous Confucian quote stating that a wise ruler must attend to his subjects' needs first and only then attend to his own. Construction started 1687 and was completed 13 years later. Despite slight changes, Korakuen largely keeps its form from the Edo era, with waterfalls, tiny shrines, teahouses, miniature maple forests, a lotus pond, and even a greenhouse filled with orchids and cacti. The rare red-crested white cranes are another notable feature. They are released for flying exhibitions on special occasions throughout the year. The large wooden building called the Enyo-tei was used to host daimyo (feudal lords), Emperor Meiji, and other members of the imperial family. The view from the veranda (usually off-limits to the general public) is considered the best in the park, and the strategic location of trees and hills/mounds in the park act as a natural frame. A local ordinance prevents high-rise buildings that would encroach on this view. The roof of a temple can be seen on the side of the distant Mt. Misaoyama, but it was built to enhance the view from the porch. There are two entrances to the garden: across from the Okayama Prefectural Museum, and across the Moon-Viewing Bridge (月見橋 Tsukimi-bashi). ¥400.
Okayama Castle (岡山城 Okayama-jō), 2-3-1 Marunouchi (15-min walk from Okayama Station or 5-min walk from Shiroshita tram Stop), ☏ +81 86-225-2096. 09:00-17:00. Popularly known as Crow Castle (烏城 U-jō), it is so named for its striking black color, rare among Japanese castles (which tend to be white, like neighboring Himeji Castle). Only a few protruding bits and the occasional lucky fish-gargoyle (金の鯱 kinnoshachihoko) are gilded. With the exception of one external turret, the current version dates from 1966, but the outside is much more accurate than most Japanese castle replicas, as the original blueprints were used to rebuild it. In the tower is a museum documenting the castle's history, although English explanations are few and far between. On the first floor of the castle, you can also make your own Bizen pottery for an extra fee. ¥300 (except during special exhibits).
Okayama Orient Museum (岡山市立オリエント美術館), 9-31 Tenjin-cho (Shiroshita tram stop), ☏ +81 86-232-3636. Tu-Su 09:00-17:00. An interesting museum of Middle Eastern art. The special exhibit details art and trade between China and Persia. If you can speak conversational Japanese, talk with the friendly docents; they will present some highly interesting explanations and background. However, the dates and areas are clearly marked, and the artifacts themselves are interesting enough that you don't need to have a guide to enjoy them. ¥300 adults, discounts with student ID.
Okayama Prefectural Museum (岡山県立博物館), 1-5 Korakuen (5 min from Shiroshita tram stop, across from Korakuen main entrance), ☏ +81 86-272-1149. Apr-Sep: Tu-Su 09:00-18:00, Oct-Mar: Tu-Su 09:30-17:00. An excellent museum with a variety of artifacts excavated from various areas throughout Okayama Prefecture from prehistoric artifacts to the Edo and Meiji Periods. Some highlights of the museum are the famous Bizen swords and Bizen pottery. It's just outside the main entrance to Korakuen, so it's well worth a stop. ¥250.
Okayama Prefectural Museum of Art (岡山県立美術館), 8-48 Tenjin-cho (Shiroshita tram stop), ☏ +81 86-225-4800. Tu-Su 09:00-17:00. A large museum housing approximately 2,000 works by famous artists throughout Okayama Prefecture. The museum's permanent exhibition features art dating back as far as the Muromachi Period (1336-1573), such as work by the priest Sesshu and the swordsman Musashi Miyamoto, as well as Bizen pottery and works by more contemporary artists. ¥350, discount with student ID.
Hayashibara Museum of Art (林原美術館), 2-7-15 Marunouchi (near Kenchodori tram stop), ☏ +81 86-223-1733. Tu-Su 09:00-17:00. A small museum which houses the private collection of the Ikeda Family, the former Lords of Okayama. The collection features Japanese and Chinese works, primarily calligraphy and scrolls. Pottery, beautiful textiles, samurai armor, and other works may also be on display; however, because the museum is not large enough to display the entire collection at once, the exhibits are rotated often. ¥500.
Yumeji Art Museum (夢二郷土美術館), 2-1-32 Hama (a 10-min walk from Shiroshita tram stop, just across the river north of Korakuen), ☏ +81 86-271-1000. Tu-Su 09:00-17:00. A museum featuring the works of Okayama-born artist Yumeji Takehisa, a well-known artist throughout Japan. He is best known for producing paintings and sketches of beautiful women, and many such works are on display in the museum. ¥700.
Okaden Museum & Mitooka Eiji Design (おかでんミュージアム＋水戸岡鋭治デザイン), 2 Chome 3-33 Higashiyama (Across from the Higashiyama Tram Station), ☏ +81 86-272-5520. 10:00-16:00. The Okaden Museum is a museum dedicated to Okayama's Okaden tram. Inside you can see the tram's "station master" cat, Momo along with videos, train models, and artwork. Overall, it's more of a fun place to take children who like trains/the tram than a museum. It really doesn't have any objects or information but instead features train and other toys that kids can play with. It's at the terminus of the Higashiyama Line so outside there are out-of-use trams and you can also see the trams coming and going. ¥1000. (updated Aug 2017)
The Kibiji District (吉備路), in the northeastern part of the city, from Okayama to Soja, was once the center of the Kingdom of Kibi (吉備国 kibi no kuni), whose power was said to equal to that of the Yamato. Strategically located between the Yamato and civilizations on the Korean peninsula, the Kibi Kingdom was highly influential. Its leaders continued to influence the Yamato government even after the Kibi Kingdom fell. Many of the historical and cultural sites are associated with the legend of Prince Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto (see Understand).
The Kibiji District is best explored by bike along its famous cycling route (see Do). However, all sites can be reached by using the train and then walking (or taking a bus, for certain locations). The information office at JR Okayama Station can provide a map of the Kibiji area, including the cycling route. If you begin your travels from Bizen Ichinomiya Station (bike rental is just beside the station), the following sites are listed in the order in which you will see them.
Kibitsuhiko Shrine (吉備津彦神社), 1043 Ichimiya (Bizen Ichinomiya Station), ☏ +81 86-284-0031. This shrine, rebuilt in 1697, is dedicated to Prince Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto, and has a unique architectural style. To get there, turn right after exiting the station and cross the train tracks. Free.
Kibitsu Shrine (吉備津神社), 931 Kibitsu (Kibitsu Station), ☏ +81 86-287-4111. Last rebuilt in 1425, this shrine is important for two reasons: it was once the head shrine of the entire Kibi Kingdom, and legend holds that Prince Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto fought the demon Ura on this site. He shot arrows at the demon, but the demon evaded his attacks by throwing boulders at the arrows. Finally, the prince shot two arrows at the same time, hitting the demon directly in the eye (but not yet killing him - read on). Free.
Ancient Kibi Cultural Properties Center (岡山県古代吉備文化財センター), 1325-3 Nishihanajiri (20-min walk from Kibitsu Station; on the mountain/hill behind Kibitsu Shrine.), ☏ +81 86-293-3211. 09:00-17:00. A small museum housing artifacts from the ancient Kibi Kingdom. Although the information is all in Japanese, one does not need to be able to read the information to appreciate the artifacts, which are mainly clay figurines and pottery. It is located. Free.
Koikui Shrine (鯉喰神社), Kurashiki (Near the intersection of Route 270 and Route 73), ☏ +81 86-287-4111 (Kibitsu Shrine). If you walk the trail with no prior knowledge of the area or the sites, Koikui Shrine will seem quite disappointing in comparison to the other shrines. However, Koikui is much more interesting than it appears. After the demon was shot by the prince's arrows, he transformed into a carp and swam away. The prince turned into a cormorant and followed him. Koikui Shrine is located on the site where the prince is believed to have caught and killed the demon. Free.
Tsukuriyama Ancient Burial Mound (造山古墳), Shinjoshimo Kita-ku (near Senzoku Bus Stop; buses depart from Soja Station), ☏ +81 86-226-7601. Along the trail there are actually two burial mounds (古墳 kofun) with the name "Tsukuriyama" that can be distinguished only when viewing the characters used to write the names. The tomb on the Okayama side of the trail (造山古墳) is the most interesting. This burial mound, believed to have been completed in the fifth century, was the largest in the nation at the time it was built. Because the tomb within the mound has never been excavated, it is not certain who is actually buried here; however, it is believed to be one of the former rulers of the Kibi Kingdom, as tombs of this size were reserved only for those in the highest positions. Although the best view of Japanese burial mounds is always from above (to see the key-hole shape), at this mound, visitors are permitted to walk on top of it. Atop the mound there is a shrine. Free.
Komori-zuka Burial Mound (こうもり塚古墳), Soja (10-min walk from Kibiji-Motenashinokan Bus Stop. Buses depart from Soja Station). Although the mound is quite small, it contains the one thing missing from the Tsukuriyama mound: a look inside the tomb. This tomb is believed to date back to the 6th century. Aside from this, not much else is known about it. Free.
Bitchu Kokubunji (備中国分寺), Soja (7-min walk from Kibiji-Montenashinokan Bus Stop. Buses depart from Soja Station), ☏ +81 86-694-3155. The Kokubunji temples were designated by Emperor Shomu as provincial temples throughout the nation. This one represents the Bitchu area (western Okayama Prefecture). The 5-story pagoda, constructed in 1844, is one of the highlights of the Kibi Trail. The area surrounding the temple is known as the Kibiji Fudoki-no-oka Prefectural Forest Park. To visit without travelling the trail, catch a bus from Soja. Free.
The above sites are along the main cycling path however, there is another path that branches off the main path between Koikui Shrine and Tsukuriyama Burial Mound. There are a few signs to guide bikers, but they are not as frequent here, so a map will be useful. They are listed below in the relative order that you will see them in. Near the Ashimori area is Kino-jo (鬼ノ城) in Soja. Those interested in the Momotaro sites will want to make the journey here as it is said that the demon Ura lived in a cave near the castle. You can visit the cave and the reconstructed castle to complete your self-guided tour of the Legend of Prince Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto.
Site of Takamatsu Castle (備中高松城跡), 558-2 Takamatsu Kita-ku (10-min walk from Bitchu-Takamatsu Station), ☏ +81 86-287-5554. Grounds always open, museum 10:00-15:00. While very little remains here of any part of the castle, it has great historical importance. In 1582, Toyotomi Hideyoshi defeated the ruling Mori Clan by diverting a river to flood the castle. The moat still exists, and is filled with lilies that bloom in the summer. You can also still see some of the old waterways. There is even a small museum with some artifacts and information on the site. Free.
Saijo Inari (最上稲荷), 712 Takamatsu Inari (5-min walk from Inariyama Bus Stop. Buses depart from Okayama Station and Bitchu-Takamatsu Station), ☏ +81 86-287-3700.

Cycle the Kibi Plain. The Kibiji District (吉備路), a 15-km trail extending from Okayama to Soja, is a scenic cycling path, voted as one of the top 100 cycling paths in the nation. There is no need to bring your own bike, because you can rent your bike upon arrival. Bike rentals are available near Okayama Station (lower daily cost, however this adds a few extra kilometers you must bike to the start), as well as adjacent to JR station Bizen Ichinomiya (upon exiting the station, the rental area is directly to the right). To reach Bizen-Ichinomiya from Okayama Station, transfer to the 'Local lines' section. Two lines run on this track, so ask an attendant which train to take to Bizen-Ichinomiya if you are not sure. The train ride should only take about 10 minutes. The rental cost at Bizen-Ichinomiya station is ¥1500 per bicycle per day. You can return the bicycle at Soja station, but this adds an extra ¥500 to the cost. You must return the bicycle to either your start point, or your final station point, by 6pm on the same day, as that is when the rental shop closes (at each end). The rental shop operators will provide you with a map, although the entire trail is quite well-marked. Signs along the path have "Kibiji District" written on them in English and Japanese. The sites along the trail are free, so expenses are quite nominal, making the cycling trail a highly affordable way to see a wide variety of cultural sites. The official estimated time to cycle the trail is two hours; however, if you take the time to thoroughly explore the sites, you can easily make it a half-day excursion, perhaps combining it with a visit to some of the other sites in the area. Although it is a cycling course, it is possible to use the trail for hiking. In order to see all the sites before evening, you should arrive at Bizen Ichinomiya Station no later than 10AM. (It is unlikely that you will be able to see any of the other sites in the area, since it will take most of the day to walk the trail.) Hiking the trail is ambitious, as you will also be walking around the grounds of each of the sites along the way, so make sure to wear appropriate footwear and bring food, because you won't reach the restaurants (which are mainly located in the Soja portion) until late in the day.

Saidaiji Eyo (naked festival)
Naked Man Festival (Hadaka Matsuri 裸祭り). 3rd Saturday in February. During the coldest month of the year, men wearing only fundoshi (traditional Japanese loincloths) fight to obtain one of two lucky sticks thrown by the temple priests. The men who catch the sticks will have an entire year of good fortune and also receive a cash reward from the festival's sponsors. All the lights in the temple are temporarily blacked out and other "less-lucky" sticks are also thrown down into the crowd of participants to create even more confusion. Spectators too jostle for viewing spots, but you can choose to pay to watch from the temporary spectator grandstand. The festival originated in the 16th century when people would request special talismans thrown out by priests. As word spread that the talismans were bringing those who possessed them good luck, more and more people came to get them, fights broke out and the talismans were damaged. Later this all evolved into a midnight festival with only male participants dressed in loincloths. Today, the festival continues to evolve, with the midnight highlight of the festival has been moved forward 2 hours to finish at 10PM. Price depends on seating proximity.
