The Great Church of Debrecen in winter
Debrecendead link is the "capital city of the Great Hungarian Plain", and the county seat and largest city of Hajdú-Bihar County in eastern Hungary. It is the second largest city in the country with over 200,000 inhabitants (2019), and historically the most important city in Hungarian Protestantism.
They used to say "who in their sane mind would build a city in the middle of nowhere where there are no mountains, forests, water or roads?" Still, the answer is a mystery, but Debrecen is the second (or third, depends on the census) largest city of Hungary.
It used to be Europe's largest Calvinist city (it was called "The Calvinist Rome"), and the Great Church (Nagytemplom) is a reminder of the city's heritage.
Debrecen also has a university with the beautiful main building.

The Nine-holed Bridge, Hortobágy.
Eger — best known for its castle, thermal baths, historic buildings (including the northernmost Turkish minaret), dishes and red wines.
Hortobágy — excellent for a day trip. This is an 800 km² national park in Eastern Hungary, rich with folklore and cultural history. The park, a part of the Alföld (Great Plain), was designated as a national park in 1973 (the first in Hungary), and elected among the UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1999. The Hortobágy is Hungary's largest protected area, and the largest semi-natural grassland in Europe. It used to be believed that this alkaline steppe was formed by the clear cutting of huge forests in the Middle Ages, followed by measures to control the course of the Tisza River, allegedly resulting in the soil's current structure and pH. However, Hortobágy is much older, with alkalinization estimated to have started ten thousand years ago, when the Tisza first found its way through the Great Hungarian Plain, cutting off many streams from their sources in the Northern Mountains. The formation was finished by grazing animals, mastodons, and wild horses during the Ice Age, followed by domesticated animals. The Nine-holed Bridge is a popular site. Traditional T-shaped sweep wells dot the landscape, as do the occasional mirage of trees shimmering in the reflected heat of the Puszta.
Lake Tisza (Tisza-tó). Also known as Kisköre Reservoir (Hungarian: Kiskörei-víztározó). This is the largest artificial lake in Hungary. It is at the southeastern edge of Heves county. Following the reservoir's completion, Hungarians began to flock to the site for holidays, since it compared favorably with the crowded and expensive Lake Balaton, the traditional holiday site. As a result, tourist infrastructure has been developed on the reservoir—renamed Lake Tisza—and the government has designated it an official tourism destination. - The lake (or reservoir) has a new local ecology with a diversity of birds, plants, and animals.
Nyíregyháza — a smaller city with several parks and squares and the water resort of Sóstó.
Szerencs - famous all around Hungary for its chocolate and medieval castle
