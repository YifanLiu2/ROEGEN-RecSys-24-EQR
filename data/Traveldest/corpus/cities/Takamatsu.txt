Takamatsu (高松) is the largest city in Kagawa Prefecture on the island of Shikoku, Japan.
The city developed over many years as a port town at one of the primary entry points into Shikoku and is therefore known as the "Gateway to Shikoku". It has come to be known as the "Udon Kingdom".

The closest major airport to Takamatsu is Kansai International Airport in Osaka. There is a curiously-named bus called the "Airport Limousine" which runs directly between Kansai Airport and Takamatsu that makes seven round trip runs per day (¥5150 one-way; 3½ hours). It is not, however, a limo.
Takamatsu Airport (TAK IATA). Takamatsu has a tiny airport but there are only a few places you can get to from it. Service from the Takamatsu Airport from Tokyo's Haneda Airport is offered by JAL and ANA, Japan's two major airlines. JAL also offers service to Kagoshima, and ANA also offers service to Okinawa. Asiana Airlines offers international service to Seoul Incheon Airport. But cheapest of all is Spring Airlines from Shanghai (twice a week, Tuesday/Friday), with fares starting at ¥3000 each way. Check the schedule for these flights (in Japanese). Limousine buses connect the airport to the Takamatsu train station (40 min, ¥760).
The Marine Liner is the main train service connecting Takamatsu to the Japanese mainland.
Train service between Okayama, on Japan's main island of Honshū, and Takamatsu began operation in 1988 after construction of the Great Seto Bridge, allowing the train line to cross the Seto Inland Sea. It is the only railway link between Honshū and Shikoku.
For getting to Takamatsu, the ideal train to ride is the Marine Liner (マリンライナー), which runs directly between Okayama Station and Takamatsu Station. Trains run twice per hour in both directions (¥1,470 one-way; 55 minutes). Because the Marine Liner is classified as a 'rapid' (快速 kaisoku) train, the Seishun 18 Ticket is valid. Reserved seating and First Class Green car seating are available in one bi-level car on the train (¥510 and ¥950 from Okayama respectively). Like all JR trains, the ride is free for those with a Japan Rail Pass, and you can make a free seat reservation for the reserved car if you wish. If you are traveling south to Takamatsu and you get lucky, you may be able to sit in one of the three Green car seats at the front of the train - right behind the driver - and watch the view from the front as the train makes its journey.
A limited express train (特急 tokkyū) called the Uzushio (うずしお) runs hourly to Takamatsu from Tokushima (1 hour, ¥3,070). A few Uzushio trains run between Takamatsu and Okayama on the exact same route as the Marine Liner; you have the option of using those trains if you have a Japan Rail Pass, but generally you should use the cheaper and more frequent Marine Liner.
Okayama Station, being a primary station on the bullet train line (shinkansen), is a convenient place to connect to and from other parts of Japan: Hiroshima, 1 hr 40 min; Osaka, 2 hr; Tokyo,  hr.
An overnight sleeper train called the Sunrise Seto (サンライズ瀬戸) makes daily runs between Takamatsu and Tokyo Station. The train ride lasts about 9½ hours. One-way prices vary, but a regular seat will cost at least ¥15,000, and a sleeper car will cost at least ¥20,000. Tickets and exact pricing are available from a JR ticket office or Japanese travel agency.
There are several options to travel by bus to/from Honshu, particularly the Kansai region. Buses can be booked online.
JR Shikoku Bus operates the following routes:
From Namba Station in Osaka (3 hr 20 min, ¥3,900 one-way, 48 round-trips daily).

Jumbo Ferry (ジャンボフェリー). This ferry runs 4 times daily between Kobe and Takamatsu. At both ends of the ferry, buses connect the ferry boarding point to the nearest major station - San'nomiya Station and Takamatsu Station, respectively. The Kobe-side connecting bus costs ¥200 and takes 5 minutes, the Takamatsu-side connecting bus is free and takes 15 minutes. The ferry sails under the Akashi Straits Bridge, and udon is available on board. Kobe to Takamatsu one-way ¥1,800, round-trip ¥2,990; bicycles ¥2,140 extra; cars ¥4,790 extra.
Shikoku Kisen (四国汽船). Ferries (50-60 minutes) and speedboats (25 minutes) between Naoshima and Takamatsu. Ferry: ¥520; speedboat: ¥1,220.
Utaka-Kokudō Ferry (宇高国道フェリー). This ferry offers regular services between the Uno area of Tamano in Okayama Prefecture and Takamatsu. The trip takes about 55 minutes, and there are 44 round-trips daily. The ferry boarding points at both ends are close to the respective nearest train station. The ferry sails across the Seto Inland Sea between several islands. One-way ¥390; bicycles ¥440 extra; cars ¥1,610 extra.
While it's possible to visit certain groups of sites on foot, it is not recommended. Many sites are spread out, so walking will be impractical and time-consuming for most travelers.
Takamatsu is extremely bike-friendly. In fact, it was designed with bike travel in mind.
To match the city's bike-friendly design, Takamatsu has one of the best rental cycle systems in Japan; you can keep your rental bike overnight and it is extremely inexpensive overall. The system is so good and there are so many bikes available that many locals use the system as well, unlike most rental cycles in Japan which are designed exclusively for tourists. You can rent a bike for just ¥100 per day ... and by "day" they don't mean until the end of the day, they mean a full 24-hour period from the moment you rent the bike. You can rent the same bicycle for up to 72 hours by informing the staff when you rent the bike.
There are seven rental cycle stations around town, including one in the basement of the bicycle parking area in front of Takamatsu Station. If you walk out of the station, just look for some stairways leading underground with bike signs above. Before your first rental you'll be asked to fill out a short application and submit some kind of official photo ID. You'll be issued a renter ID card for future rentals. Filling out the application and renting a bike in general with no Japanese should not be a challenge.
The Kotoden (琴電), or Takamatsu-Kotohira Electric Railroad, is also a viable means of getting around parts of downtown Takamatsu. The Kotoden is convenient for going between Ritsurin Park, Kawaramachi, and the Takamatsu Station/Castle area.
JR lines, used more for inter-city travel, don't run terribly often and are not very well-suited for getting around town, particularly the city center.

Takamatsu has many long arcade-style shopping streets, called shōtengai (商店街), giving the city's shopping a more traditional feel. You'll find shops of all sorts on these streets, and lots of udon shops. They are concentrated in the portion of the city between Takamatsu Station and Kawaramachi. They are:
Lion Avenue (ライオン通 Raion-dōri)
South Shinmachi (南新町 Minami-shinmachi)
Takamatsu is extremely well-known throughout Japan for its udon noodles, one of the three major types of Japanese noodle dishes. Udon noodles are distinctive in that they are white, fairly thick, and chewy. Although udon is widespread in Japan, Takamatsu does it better and cheaper than anywhere else in the country. There are literally hundreds of udon shops within the city limits. Because local foods are often a driving force in Japanese tourism, many people flock to the city for the udon, often doing "chain-eating" tours around the city to famous shops.
Udon made in Takamatsu and the Kagawa prefecture is sometimes referred to as Sanuki udon. 'Sanuki' was the historical name of Kagawa. While this can be considered a regional specialty of Kagawa, the Sanuki variety is so widely-loved throughout Japan that it is often thought of as the 'normal' type, and is what most people imagine when they hear the word 'udon'.
The average Takamatsu udon shop has a variety of udon dishes available. Some of the standard types are listed below but there are many more types; different toppings (raw egg, for example) lead to different names. It's rare for a typical bowl of udon to cost more than ¥1,000; the simpler types usually cost around ¥400, with some places offering noodle bowls for as little as ¥100. Ask locals about good udon shops since they are sure to know some. Udon is cheap, and it's a simple but tasty item that is easy to eat even for those who don't especially take to Japanese food, so travelers should make an effort to at udon at least once while in Takamatsu.
Kake udon - (Hot) The most basic variety. The noodles come in a hot dashi and soy-flavored broth and will likely have sliced onions thrown in. Some places may also add a slice of kamaboko (fish sausage) as well. You're likely to have a pinch of ginger added to the broth.
Kitsune udon - (Hot) Like kake udon, but with a large slab of fried tofu in the bowl.
Tempura udon - (Hot) Also like kake udon, but with a some tempura thrown in for good measure. Typically the tempura will be shrimp plus a vegetable or two, however at the cheapest places the tempura will be kaki-age, a vegetable-shrimp patty.
Kama'age udon - (Hot) Identical to zaru udon in manner of eating, however noodles come hot instead of cold. As far as taste is concerned, it's quite similar to kake udon.
Zaru udon - (Cold) Cold noodles come on a wooden tray. From there, you pick them up, dip them into a soy-based broth that comes with the dish, and then eat.
