Tianjin (天津 Tiānjīn) is a major city in North China that neighbours the capital city of Beijing. In 2020, it was home to almost 14 million people. Tianjin is divided into the old city and the Binhai New Area. Binhai New Area is growing fast, with many international companies establishing branch offices. It is a base of China's advanced industry, financial reform, and innovation.

Tianjin is a metropolis in northern China and one of the five national central cities of the People's Republic of China. Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea.
In terms of urban population, it is the sixth-largest city of the People's Republic of China. Tianjin's urban area is located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal in Tianjin. Tianjin was once home to foreign concessions in the late Qing Dynasty and early Kuomintang era.
Tianjin's climate is similar to, though slightly warmer than, its neighbour Beijing. Overall it can be described as continental; winters are cold and dry, as nights below −10 °C are not uncommon, and summers are hot and humid, with days reaching above the upper 30s °C not out of the question. The best time to visit is autumn, though if you do not mind dust storms, spring would also be an excellent choice.
Tianjin has been trading port since historic times and used to be called "Zhigu" (直沽), or "Straight Port". In 1404, the Yongle Emperor renamed the city Tianjin, meaning "the Heavenly Ford", to indicate that the Emperor forded the river at that point.
Due to its proximity to Beijing, Tianjin was involved significantly during the Opium Wars. Many concession areas in the city were run by the European powers as well as the United States and Japan, leaving many foreign architectural reminders of their rule, notably including churches and thousands of villas.
On August 12, 2015, Tianjin was rocked by a devastating series of chemical explosions at the Port of Tianjin in the Binhai New Area. 173 people died as a result with 797 receiving non-fatal injuries.
dead link Tianjin Binhai International Airport (天津滨海国际机场; TSN IATA) (is located in the east of the urban area, in Dongli District, which is 15 km (9 miles) to the east of the urban area). An alternative to the high-speed train, especially if wanting to reduce the added travel time and cost that comes associated with flying into Beijing -- about 120 km (75 miles) from Tianjin. The home base of Tianjin Airlines and the delightfully humble Okay Airways, domestic routes include most major Chinese cities. A few international routes are available, including destinations in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Mongolia.
Metro Line 2 connects the airport directly to Tianjin station, with a fare of just ¥3. There are also four Airport Shuttle Bus dead link routes, and the most expensive price is ¥25. No change is given on the bus, so make sure you have exact change for the fare.
China's main airport in Beijing is a good alternative for getting to Tianjin, especially for long-distance flights from Europe or the Americas. Ticket prices inside China may be lower as well, so this option is worth checking.
Take the Airport Express train into Beijing, the subway to Beijing South Station and the bullet train to Tianjin (see below). It takes at least 3½ hours.
There is a direct bus between Beijing Airport and Tianjin. It should take 2½ hours but is frequently late. The bus does not go to central Tianjin, but to a bus terminal a little outside. There is a metro station nearby (Anshanxidao, Line 6). From there you can have someone pick you up, or take a taxi.
Tianjin Railway Station, sometimes known locally as the 'East Station', is the main station in Tianjin.
It serves the bullet train to Beijing South train station. One-way tickets are ¥55 for Economy, ¥66 for Business, or ¥94 for VIP. The bullet train designation is a 'C' and takes about 33 minutes, traveling up to 300 km/h.
Metro Line 2 directly connects Tianjin Railway Station and Tianjin Airport.
There are shuttle buses between Tianjin railway station and Tianjin airport. A ticket costs ¥15 per trip. The bus stops about 200 m from the train station northern gate (back gate). When you get off the shuttle bus, walk along the pavement to reach the train station.
By taxi, the fare from Tianjin railway station to Tianjin airport is about ¥50-65. Use the official taxi stand (just follow the signage)- it is advised not to use any of the touts that offer taxi services.
If leaving the station by taxi, be prepared for a production-line approach to getting the punters into taxis. Marshals keep the queue moving so have baggage ready to stow and a destination in mind or possibly be forced to go to the back of the line and wait your turn again.
Tianjin South Railway Station serves as an intermediate station for bullet trains between Beijing South and Shanghai Hongqiao. It is far from the city center, but Metro Line 3 connects the station to the city center. Taxis here are mostly of the illegal variety, so plan accordingly.
Tianjin West Station is the terminus for trains between Tianjin West and Shanghai Hongqiao. It can be reached by Metro Line 1 and 6.
Binhai Station (滨海站) (formerly Yujiapu) is in the middle of the new financial district in the Binhai New Area, and just a few kilometers from the Binhai Library.
Tanggu Station (塘沽站) serves the seaside district of the same name.
The inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin have a number range between C2001 and C2298:
C2001—C2198: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, non-stop.
C2201—C2268: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (武清站) or Yizhuang Station (亦庄站);
C2271—C2298: From Beijing South Station to Tanggu Station of Tianjin.
Some spots in Tianjin, including roads and bridges, have names from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People (for example, Minquan Gate on Zhonghuan Road). Names harkening back to the era of the Republic of China on the mainland also appear (e.g. Beiyang Road). Many roads in Tianjin are named after a Chinese province or city. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four compass directions.
Tianjin has three ring roads. Unlike Beijing, the Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic and sometimes more than chaotic.
Tianjin is well connected with other cities via bus. The price from Beijing is about ¥30.
There are also two school bus lines linking Nankai and Tianjin Universities and Tsinghua University. They depart daily at 15:45 and 16:45 from Tsinghua's North-West Gate.
Tianjin is connected by passenger boat to Dalian and Incheon, South Korea.
Founded in 1904, the Tianjin bus system was the first in China, and the metro was second in the nation (1970) and today the city is well served by its public transportation. Within the city, traveling on a bus line that is less than 12 km (7 km) will cost ¥, while ¥1 will cover a journey on any line over 12 k, even if you travel less than 12 km (7 mi) but on a line that is over this distance, the cost is still ¥1. It's well worth your time to look up popular bus routes. Buses are comfortable and clean.
A light-rail line runs between Tianjin Railway Station to the seaside area Donghailu in TEDA.
Taxis are abundant. The minimum cost for 3 km is ¥8, (¥ per km thereafter). Taxis also charge for the time while the vehicle is stationary at ¥ for every five minutes (cost is exempt for less than five minutes). Avoid taxis from near the railway station. See note in the Get in-By train section above about how to avoid train station taxis. The same advice applies at tourist stops, it is best to walk a few blocks to a regular street to catch a metered taxi. Ride with illegal taxis at your own risk.
There are Tianjin tourist maps with destinations written in Chinese characters and English. Pointing at where you want to go will get you a long way with taxi drivers. It might be a good idea to take a magnifying glass along as many of the drivers have trouble with the small font.
You can rent a taxi driver for the day or even for just a few hours. The drivers are happy to wait, and the cost for two hours would be less than ¥100.
Another caution about taxis is that there are toll roads in some parts of China. In a taxi, you will be expected to pay the base fare plus the toll fee. The driver pays the toll and receives a receipt at the toll booth. At your destination, you ask for the receipt and pay that amount plus the base fare. If you are going a long way, you may also be asked to pay for the return toll fee. That is a legitimate request, although you could argue that the driver will pick up another fare to pay for the toll anyway. You may or may not succeed with the driver.
Tipping isn't common practice, as in most Chinese cities.

Colonial architectures and streetscapes that are a vestige of Tianjin's legacy as a treaty port. The architecture is concentrated in three main areas: the Five Avenues (五大道), Jiefang Road North (解放北路) and the Italian Town (意大利风情旅游区) located to the west of the train station (see the previous section). All of these areas are fairly compact and flat, lending themselves well to walking tours.
The Five Avenues (五大道; Wǔdàdào; lit. The Five Avenues), Wudadao, Heping, Tianjin (和平区五大道) (Best route: cross between Hebei Lu and Chengdu Dao — Chongqing Dao — Changde Dao — Dali Dao — Xinhua Lu — Machang Dao — Munan Dao — Hong Kong Lu — Chongqing Dao — Nanhai Lu — Hebei Lu).

Colourful architecture style range from the Renaissance, Greek, Gothic, Romantic, Eclectic, and Carson, which constitute a true fun of art. The second part is the residential area, with the first small Western-style residential area for foreign people who opened up concessions, whose residence next to the office area, close to Jiefang Road, around the former Italian concession in the east of Marco Polo Plaza. In the 20th century, due to the current situation, Tianjin's position in China had become very special and important. On one hand, social and political unrest made concessions a haven for ousted politicians and businessmen, on the other hand, Tianjin, had geographically profits for transportation and duty-free customs, was full of opportunities. Various dignitaries and rich people lived in Tianjin. Living in a small Western-style house was more comfortable and convenient than a traditional courtyard and the Fifth Avenue was located in a prime location of the British concession, thus people rushed in to build their houses here. The neighbourhood became Tianjin's rich area at that time. Tianjin was undoubtedly the first in term of the size of rich area among the affluent cities in modern China. (updated Oct 2023)

Tianjin is known to be as safe as any city in China.
Generally you do not have to concern about personal safety in China if you just follow the basics you would at home. Girls generally say they are happy to walk anywhere in the main city areas where there are lights. But if you come out of a night club drunk, you are an obvious target.
There are several pedestrian bridge crossing but few tunnel crossings like Beijing. Many people cross at traffic lights or zebra crossing. But generally especially since the roads are wide and new due to recent construction, road crossing should be done with care.
Make sure your cab driver turns on the meter. Many try to take a foreigner to their destination and over charge them. If they do not turn it on either ask them to stop and get a new cab or refuse to pay at the end. Cheating Hotline: +86 22 23549000
Being a new train station, there is a bit of confusion when getting out of the Tianjin Station to your next connection. There is a taxi and bus hub. At the same time, there are many offering transport or day tours. It is illegal and it is better to wait until you find a travel agency or use the public bus or meter taxi to get to your next destination. If you really want to get one, the price is generally below ¥30 to the downtown.
Tianjin Balitai Post Office (天津八里台), Weijin Rd, No. 215 District (Opposite The Gate of Nankai University), 23378621.
Though credit and debit cards are gradually becoming more widely accepted at department stores and supermarkets most stores and all attractions still operate on a cash-only basis and only the very largest or most expensive shops accept foreign credit cards. It's generally best to ensure that you have a decent amount of cash on hand when going out. ATMs are located at virtually all bank branches, and most of the large banks now accept foreign debit or credit cards. Bank of China branches all have the ability to take cards from foreign banks, and most offer English instructions. For more advanced financial transactions (converting currency or travellers checks, for instance) the best places to go are the Bank of China branch.
