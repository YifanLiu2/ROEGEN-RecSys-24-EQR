Wausau is a city in North Central Wisconsin. While the metropolitan area has a population of around 80,000, it has a big city feel and often leads one to believe they are in a larger city. Wausau has many great man-made and natural features, such as Dudley Tower/First Wausau Tower, the tallest commercial building in the state outside of Milwaukee, and Rib Mountain State Park/Granite Peak Ski Area.
Traveling north and south, Wausau can be reached via I-39/US-51, and traveling east and west, Wausau can be reached by State Highway 29. Wausau can be reached from Minneapolis in about three and a half hours via I-94 and State Highway 29. Milwaukee is about three and a half hours away as well via I-94 and I-39.
Central Wisconsin Airport (CWA), 12 miles south of Wausau, provides daily service to and from Detroit (Delta Air Lines), Minneapolis (Delta Air Lines), Chicago O'Hare (American Airlines or United Airlines).
Lamers Bus Lines offers a daily trip to/from Milwaukee via the Fox Valley which may be ticketed through Greyhound (or Amtrak if connecting to a rail leg).

Public transportation is limited in the Wausau Area. Metro Ride (formerly WATS or Wausau Area Transit System) operates eight bus routes in the City of Wausau which run at 30-minute intervals; one bus route in the Village of Weston, which runs at 30-minute intervals; and one bus route to Rothschild and Schofield, which operates at 60-minute intervals. Passengers can transfer between routes at the Metro Ride Transit Center, which is located at 555 Jefferson Street in the downtown Wausau, one block from the Wausau Center Mall. Passengers can also transfer between Route C and Route K at Shopko in Rothschild and between Route E and Route I at Aspirus Clinic in Wausau. Buses are clean and uncrowded but the limited schedule makes them somewhat impractical to all but the most dedicated transit user.
Travel by car is very easy in the Wausau area and the preferred method of transportation. Roads are well maintained and marked. Ample, free, at-door parking is available everywhere outside of the downtown area. Downtown, parking is easy to find and very inexpensive. As the city and surrounding area are oriented north/south, for trips from the far north to far south side or vice versa, it is quicker and easier to use the US 51/I 39 expressway which runs along the west edge of the city.

The Wausau Depot, 720 Grant Street. Wausau, no phone. Interior not open to the public. When most people think of Wausau, they probably envision the railroad depot created by Wausau Insurance Companies for a corporate logo. They can't find the depot pictured in the ads because it was drawn by an artist combining one depot building with the view of the city skyline from another depot. The depot featured in the logo still stands at 720 Grant Street. After Wausau Insurance Companies bought the building in 1977, a faithful reproduction was constructed at its corporate headquarters (Bridge Street exit of US Highway 51) for advertising purposes and the Grant Street depot was donated to the Boy Scouts. The Washington Street depot (Washington Street at the Wisconsin River) with the city backdrop depicted in the logo has been restored and used as office space.

For a city of its size, Wausau hosts a large number of festivals and activities. For a current listing of activities, visit Wausau Visitors and Convention Bureau website dead link. One of the largest events annually is Wausau's Artrageous Weekend, usually held the first or second weekend in September (check the Wausau Visitor's and Convention Bureau web site for exact dates). The event has gotten so big that it is held at three venues throughout the city with shuttle bus service between all locations. This event attracts thousands and it will be difficult to obtain lodging in the area that weekend unless one reserves well in advance. There is an extremely strong arts tradition in the Wausau area and the city's old wealth has given very generously to keep the tradition alive and well. The city's Performing Arts Center is in downtown's Grand Theater, a fully restored 1,200-seat house dating from 1927. A recent expansion has created a facility that covers nearly an entire city block and attracts diverse talent. Recent performances included Mozart's Marriage of Figaro by the Bulgarian State Opera and concerts by Mannheim Steamroller and Blues legend B.B. King.
