Friedrichshafen is a city at the northeastern corner of Lake Constance (Bodensee), near the lake's widest point in the German federal-state of Baden-Württemberg. The city has played a vital role in the history of aviation, as this is where Graf Ferdinand von Zeppelin developed and built his famous airships which dominated the skies in the early 20th century, and where similar smaller airships are made to this day. Friedrichshafen features a wealth of aviation-related attractions and museums. This city of 61,000 people (2019) has one of the longest waterfront promenades along the Bodensee.
This mostly modern city was almost completely rebuilt after bombing in World War II. It also has a nice view of Austria and Switzerland and the Alps across the lake on a clear day. In addition, the town's other highlights are three interesting museums and the dome-capped Schlosskirche, the premier remaining reminder of Friedrichshafen's baroque past. Friedrichshafen also was a major player in aviation history with the world-famous Zeppelin company, that still produces small airships. It is also home to the Dornier company, which, after several mergers and acquisitions, forms a part of the Airbus company.

It has direct flights from Toulouse, London-Gatwick (seasonal), Hamburg and Düsseldorf, as well as up to four daily flights to Lufthansa's largest hub, Frankfurt Airport. From the airport's train station (Friedrichshafen Flughafen), there are regular commuter trains to Friedrichshafen, and in the opposite direction to Ravensburg and an hourly service to Ulm. A cab from the airport to downtown will cost between €10-15, depending on where you go. (updated Jan 2019)

There is a regular train service from Stuttgart and Ulm to Friedrichshafen.

Both train stations are within walking distance of the city centre. In summer time, the trains to and from Friedrichshafen might be crowded with groups of cyclists.
The town of Friedrichshafen covers a fairly large area along the lake side and the hinterland. There is public transportation, including a fairly priced night-bus system, but the best way to get around is by bike or car. During high-season in summer and large exhibitions (e.g. Eurobike or Interboot) roads can get quite crowded and traffic jams getting in and out of Friedrichshafen are frequent. In particular on the B31 (Lindau-Friedrichshafen-Immenstaad-Hagnau-Meersburg-Überlingen).
There are plenty of opportunities to rent bikes in Friedrichshafen.
