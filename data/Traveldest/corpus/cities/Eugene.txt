View of downtown Eugene from the top of Skinner Butte
Eugene (population 173,000 in 2019) is a city in Oregon at the southern end of the Willamette Valley near the confluence of the Mckenzie and Willamette rivers. It is best known for being the home of the University of Oregon.
Citizens of Eugene are environmentally aware people who love their coffee and their microbrews. Residents range from arch-conservative Republicans to militant anarchists. However, overall the population is typical Pacific Northwest, i.e., leaning toward a greater degree of social responsibility, respect for nature, and diminished consumerism. Eugene is home to the University of Oregon, aka "The Fighting Ducks". Eugene was the second home to the rock band the Grateful Dead, and author Ken Kesey, a U of O grad, lived in nearby Springfield, leading some to see this city as a "hippie Mecca".
Along with neighboring Springfield and surrounding towns, Eugene forms part of the Eugene-Springfield Metropolitan Area.
Saturday Market has been continuously in operation since 1970, rain or shine and claims to be the oldest open-air market of its type in the United States.
