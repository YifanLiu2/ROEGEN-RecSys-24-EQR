Visa rules and prices change frequently. As of July 2023 two visas are available on arrival at the Airport: a one-month, multiple entry visa costs US$90, and a 3-day (2-night) transit visa is $40. Visas can be obtained from embassies prior to travel.
If you arrive by land you can only get a 3-day transit visa for 40usd. then you need to go to the immigration office in Bujumbura to get a visa extension 10 or 30 days for 20-50 usd.
Visa on arrival is only payable in US dollars: euros are often not accepted, Burundian francs (FBu) are not accepted (even if there is ATM in airport). Credit cards are not accepted even if the “Visa” and “MasterCard” acceptance logos are clearly visibles on airport stickers. Customs accepts only recent banknotes.
Bujumbura International Airport (BJM IATA), RN5 (close to the city —  km ( mi) north-west of Indépendance square), ☏ +257 223 707 (office), +257 223 797 (flight information).
Recording around 5 flights per day, Bujumbura International Airport essentially connects to East African hub airports, via the following compagnies:
Ethiopian Airlines, from Addis Ababa (ADD IATA) — 1 flight per day — ET807
Kenya Airways, from Nairobi (NBO IATA) — 2 flights per day — KQ444 and KQ448
RwandAir, from Kigali (KGL IATA) — 2 flights per day — WB482 and WB483
Brussels Arilines, from Brussels (BRU IATA) — 1 flight per week, on Sunday — SN451
there are direct Air Tanzania flights to neighboring Tanzania Kigoma and Dar Es salaam but none to Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Taxis are cruising all over the city; you need to negotiate the price with them. As of early 2010, rides in the city centre were about 1500-2500 FBu; rides to and from airport can be absurdly expensive (20,000 FBu) but there's little you can do about it. In the city, during the day, a cheaper option is a moto-taxi costing 500-1000 FBu a journey, but these have been banned from the city centre for safety reasons. Burundians typically rely on the many mini-buses, costing 300 FBu to anywhere in city centre in mid-2011, and 600 FBu to the suburbs. Minibuses serving the north of the city arrive and depart at the front of the central market (Marché Central), while those heading south use the parking lot in the back of the market near the Interbank head office. The last mini-buses leave around 22:00 as of 2011. It is not advised to walk at night after that; if you need to go anywhere, take a taxi.
To get a lift in any type of vehicle from the side of the road, hold out your hand with your palm facing upward. This works for taxis, buses, motorcycles, and all sorts of private and commercial vehicles. Mini-bus conductors will honk and use their fingers to show how many seats are available. If the bus is full, they will wave their hand with their palm facing downward. It is not uncommon for private vehicles to pick up foreigners requesting lifts during the daytime. They range from high-end SUVs driven by white-collar workers to flat bed pickup trucks where you must stand up. Payment is generally not expected for hitchhiking short distances, but working-class Burundians regularly give each other money for small favours, so there is no harm in offering.

Bujumbura is a moderately safe city, but common sense should prevail. Walking around during the day should be fine, but at night time (from 18:00) the streets get very dark and you are best off getting a taxi except for very short walks. Day or night there are very few police around. The area near the port feels pretty dodgy day or night.
English/French language broadcasts are available from BBC World Service on  MHz and  MHz.
Internet access is best at an expat restaurant with WiFi, especially Café Aroma on Boul. de l'Uprona. For those without their own device, Surf Internet Café (back of Rusca Plaza, Avenue de l'Amitié) has generally fast Internet on good quality computers during the day. In the evening, your best bet in the city centre is Face@Face near the Waterfront Hotel. 3G wireless sticks are available from Econet as of mid-2011, with other carriers planning to offer them soon.
