Bamako bridge crossing the Niger River
Bamako is the capital of Mali and straddles the Niger River. With a population of around  million in 2020, it's the largest city in Mali and one of the largest in West Africa.
Bamako has been continuously inhabited by humans since prehistoric times. In 1883 it was conquered by French troops, and in 1908 became the capital of French Sudan.
The city has only a few paved main roads (goudrons), the rest of the city's roads are unpaved, and get dusty during the dry season (November to May) and muddy during the rainy season, offering breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes.
The city can be hard to navigate through due to the lack of road signs, the complicated layout of the streets and the one way system in the city. The roads are very crowded both with motor vehicles and motorcycles who appear to fill every available space possible. Traffic police are particularly vigilant and will sometimes appear to enforce very arbitrary traffic rules. They are usually on motorcycles as well so it is unwise to try and outrun them in your vehicle as they will easily catch up.
Often the best way to navigate around the city is to hire a taxi-motorcycle to lead you to your destination. These are relatively cheap and depending on the distance can be as low as CFA 100. There is no meter and price is negotiated upfront.
Bamako-Sénou Airport (BKO IATA) (roughly 15 km (30–40 minutes) from the city centre). With flights from Paris on Point Afrique (cheap) and Air France (less cheap). Flights to Europe are also offered by Royal Air Maroc, via Casablanca—the main drawback to this option is that the flight from BKO to Casablanca leaves at 03:35. Taxi rides should cost about CFA 7000 from the city. Passengers flying Air France should consider pré-enregistrement, or early check-in. This can be done at the Air France office on the day of the flight, between 10:00 and 17:00. The office is located at Square Lumumba. Luggage is dropped off and boarding passes issued right then and there, as would happen at the airport, minus the crowds and the hassle!
Bamako is at the end of the railway line from Dakar in Senegal which used to transport passengers across western Africa. However, as of 2023, the only passenger service is a domestic train from the western city of Kayes. Rehabilitation of the full line from Dakar has been promised several times but is unlikely to happen in the coming years.
Bamako railway station, Rue Baba Diarra. Colonial-era station built in 1924. (updated Jan 2023)
Bus travel to Bamako is possible but often gruellingly slow. Some buses offers air conditioning, most don't. Segou and Mopti are common destinations, a journey time of about ten hours. International services are available from most regional capitals; with journey times of up to 40 hours it can be a very memorable, if quite unpleasant, experience.
Bamako has two major bus stations, with Sogoniko handling the most traffic.
Sogoniko Bus Station (Gare Routière De Sogoninko), Avenue de L'unite Africaine OUA (south of the river, along RN7).
Djikoroni Bus Station (Gare Routière De Djikoroni).
Mali National Park (take highway RN1 north out of downtown). This park sits slightly above the city under the outcrops of the Koulouba plateau and incorporates both the botanical garden and zoo along with a trail network. Located adjacent to the National Museum and Presidential Palace Complex, it is a patch of green in the overall arid area. (updated Jul 2020)
Bamako Botanical Gardens. Relaxing green setting.
Bamako Zoo (towards the presidential palace), ☏ +223 73 09 44 44. Reopened in mid-2013 after complete renovation. Fewer than 200 animals from more than 100 species. Nice lion exhibit.
Point G Hill (somewhere above the botanical garden and zoo, on the Koulouda plateau (inquire locally)). Houses caves with rock paintings, and offers good views across the city.
National Museum of Mali (Musée national du Mali), Place de la Liberté, ☏ +223 20223486. 09:00-17:00. Dating back to 1953, when it was known as the Sudanese Museum, this attraction on pleasant grounds displays ethnographic exhibits on the peoples of Mali with displays on masks, textiles, statues, and contemporary art from including Iba N’Diaye (Senegal), Outtara Bakari (Côte d’Ivoire), Koraïchi Rachid (Algeria), Malangatana (Mozambique) and Boghossian Skunder (Ethiopia). Might help to know some French to read placards, although English guides may be available. Entrance fee 3000 CFA for foreigners. (updated May 2021)
Museum of Women Muso Kunda Museum, ☏ +223 20241668. Tu-Su 09:00-18:00. Portraits and items related to women and Malian life. (updated May 2021)
Grand Mosque of Bamako. (updated May 2021)
Sacred Heart Cathedral. Dates to 1907 (although current cathedral built in 1925) after a Catholic mission nearby was relocated here. (updated Jul 2020)
Monument of Independence. open all hours. This is a rather remarkable looking monument to the independence of Mali, complete with a minaret on top. But watch out for heavy traffic in the area. (updated Jul 2020)
BCEAO Tower. The tallest building in Mali (20 floors high), with Neo-Sudanic architecture and features reminiscent of the Sudan-Sahelian architecture of mosques in Djenne and Timbuktu. A readily visible landmark on the Bamako skyline.
Bamako Coura. The birthplace of Modibo Keïta, the first president of Mali, credited as the "father of independence", nowadays the neighborhood consists of a Christian cemetery and an evangelical Protestant church.
King Fahd Bridge (Pont du Roi Fahd).
At the end of each January, Bamako hosts the finish line to the gruelling trans-Sahara rally, the Budapest-Bamako. Hundreds of rally cars and motorcycles arrive in the city on the last Sunday of January.
Casino de l'Amitie a Bamako (Friendship Casino of Bamako), Avenue de la Marne, Bamako Mali. Sa 11:00-04:00, Su-Th 11:00-03:00, F 14:00-04:00. In case you want to see what a Malian casino is like (apparently this is acceptable in Malian culture?) Gambling machines, roulette, even a restaurant with fine dining. (updated Jul 2020)
Cultural Palace Hamadou Hampaté Ba (Palais de la Culture Amadou Hampaté Ba). The national performing arts centre in Mali, the centre hosts various performances. (updated May 2021)
Prices are not fixed, and for many goods bargaining is expected. Beware, sometimes for common items (like food) the first price mentioned is just right. On the market it might be a good idea to first ask a couple of times at different stands before actually buying something.
Near the area of Bamako-Coura is the lively artisan market where traders from all over Bamako come to sell silver jewellery, leather, musical instruments and wood carvings. Prices are reasonable but the vendors expect their customers to bargain and enjoy it when they do. Once inside the market the atmosphere is relaxed and pleasant but be careful in the busy streets directly surrounding - it's easy to lose a bag to a thief.
All the Ecobank ATMs in Bamako take Mastercard and Visa card for cash withdrawal.
Pizzeria de Guido, Rue 250, off Blvd Nelson Mandela. Decent Italian restaurant - just don't expect taxi drivers to know where it is.
Love them or hate them, the French have left one decent legacy in West Africa: bread. Fresh delicious baguettes are ubiquitous, and travellers should not be worried about becoming sick because of the bread.
Vegetarians will have a hard time in Bamako. Asking for a meal without meat will usually be met with the kind of look reserved for children and elderly relatives one does not wish to upset. In a country where poverty is common and food is often scarce, turning down meat is an oddity.
That said, mornings beans, fries, and fried plaintains can be found streetside throughout the city. Morning, noon, and night you can find small streetside "cafes" where you can get a fried egg sandwich and some nescafe. Several varieties of fried dough are also easy to stumble upon. Lunch- rice and groundnut stew is most easy to find, in local restaurants a plate with meat shouldn't cost more than CFA 500, but can range up to CFA 1,500. Evenings you can find attcheke (cassava dish), spaghetti, beans, boiled eggs, and fries relatively easily.
Meat eaters will be pleased to learn beef and fish are exceptionally good. Beef kebabs and grilled Capitaine, a freshwater fish from the Niger river, are always a good choice. Chickens are usually left to fend for themselves, and tend to be on the scrawny side, especially compared to North American chickens. Although the situation is improving, you might want to avoid disappointment and just give chicken a miss while in Bamako. To avoid food-borne illness, stay away as much as possible from fresh vegetables, and make sure your food is piping hot before eating it.
Hotel Badala, Badalabougou (second road right after German Emabassy), ☏ +223 2023 2314. Very well run, little known restaurant/brasserie. Excellent food (the Pave du boeuf is yummy). Excellent service. Small pool, outside tables. Near the river. Prices are relatively high for Mali but in Bamako you need a treat sometimes!
Le Relax (Relax), Hippodrome, Route de Koulikoro, BP 2944 (Located on the Rue de Koulikoro just a few doors down from the Azar and Fourmi supermarkets.), ☏ +223 20 21 79 18. Reasonably priced restaurant (around 2000 to 5000 XOF). Vegetarian options are available. Cake, ice cream and other sweets are available in a wide various of flavours. (updated Jan 2024)
You can eat like the locals for a few hundred francs (CFA) a day, or shop in one of the western-style supermarkets.
There is one main market, in the centre of town, and several smaller markets in Bamako.
Supermarket-style stores are generally run by Lebanese businessmen.
La Fourmi. 9:30-18:00. (updated May 2023)
Azar. Daily 09:30-18:00. (updated May 2023)
Le Miniprix. Supermarket Le Miniprix is actually the best one with the best service and with the lowest prices. They have a very clean store and are open 07:30-22:30. They also accept US and Canadian dollars, and euro. (updated May 2023)
These stores will carry Western or Middle-Eastern goods, including cold cuts, fruits and vegetables, and dairy products including fresh milk and yogurt. Prices are generally higher than in Europe or the US, and choice more limited in a way reminiscent of a North American convenience store.
There are many restaurants where you can get nice omelette sandwiches for about CFA 250.
Many street vendors sell bread, rice, fries, salad, grilled meat; however, use precautions while eating on the street.
Le Bafing, Rue 309 (Quartier du Fleuve opposite the Service d'Hygiène), ☏ +223 6672 1139. Daily, 08:00-23:00. Bistrot/restaurant/bar in a small street. Eating in a courtyard. Very good and friendly service. Daily special includes local dishes, à la carte steak, fish or spaghetti. Well stocked bar. Recommended. around US$5 for main dishes. (updated Feb 2024)
African Grill (next to Place de l'OVMS). Restaurant serving good authentic African cuisine, on a square just off a main road. Not luxurious but good. Beer and wine are available but, because of the proximity to a mosque, don't be surprised if on Fridays they ask you to keep the bottles out of sight on the floor. They have a second location at the Musée National. around CFA 3000 for main dishes.
Appaloosa, Rue 311 (In Quartier du Fleuve), ☏ +223 7666 9999. Restaurant and bar. One of the strangest sights on earth. Malians in velour cowboy hats and vests serve Tex-Mex dishes in the restaurant while blond Russian professional women work the bar. Must be seen to be believed. The food isn't bad either.
Poularco (in Hippodrome quarter, just off Rue Bla bla). Another Lebanese joint with slightly higher class food than the rest. Nice shawarmas, pizzas, and good mixed salads are on the menu here
Bamako has many Lebanese and Chinese restaurants.
Bla Bla. Bla Bla is where Bamako's upper crust go to relax and have a (expensive) cocktail or bottle of champagne. With a small but delicious African menu, a wide range of cocktails, and cold draft beer - it is one of the most popular restaurants to see and be seen. A starter here is around US$15. Also this place frequently has art exhibitions for local artists. (updated May 2023)
La Terrasse (next door to the Bla Bla). La Terrasse is a very large bar/lounge on top of a night club. Very good atmosphere and salsa music, dancing. Good pizzas and other fare. (updated May 2023)
Le Relax. Popular Lebanese hangout in Hippodrome with quick food and free Wi-Fi access. Pizzas, shawarmas, and hummus are the stars on this menu. (updated May 2023)
Broadway Café Badala, ☏ +223 90 39 39 84. A Western style restaurant which is pretty much the only place you can find a "real" hamburger with "real" cheese. Also on the menu are breakfast burritos, chicken wings, and shakes. Great if you are missing the comforts of home. Burgers only run US$4 without fries but expect to pay up to $12 for a full starter. (updated Oct 2018)
The Evasion Jazz Club can be pretty cool on Fridays and Saturdays.
The Hippo d'Or (close to Hippodrome) is also a nice place for enjoying non-stop live music on Fridays and, even more, on Saturdays. There is a big casino near the Hotel L'Amitie. Ibiza, Blyblos and Terrace are still the hippest places to dance and drink. For some less seedy drinking establishments, try No Stress & Jet Set (formerly Privledge), which both have pool tables as well. Bla Bla and its twin in Badalabougou are known to get pumping on weekends.
Crazy Horse has some good food and is well priced.
Ibiza, Rud Princess. Weekends from midnight. Around midnight the Malians come alive; this is a nice nightclub with a variety of dance music from international to local dance tracks.

Hotel Yamey, ☏ +223 223 86 88.
Le Relais, Route de Koulikouro, ☏ +223 2021 0229, campa2@afribone.net.ml. Rooms are small and make sure that you get a room at the garden side otherwise don't bother unless you like to get up early with the traffic noise. Italian restaurant on ground floor is good but pricey for Bamako. Advantage is the Azar supermarket next door and the café/restaurant le Relax. US$90.
Azalai Grand Hotel, ☏ +223 2022 2492, azalaigrandhotel@azalaihotels.com. Swimming pool, tennis court, internet access. The hotel is by far one of the oldest in town. Nice-sized, very clean rooms with large windows that open. Good service. Restaurant reasonable but the breakfast buffet is a little overpriced. Both the jewellery lady and Tuareg crafts vendor in the lobby will try to massively overcharge you. Give them a miss: you'll do better at the Marché des artisans in town. Small book store in the lobby with a decent selection of Malian books and newspapers. Staff haven't figured out how to clean out the pool - give it a miss. Internet reliable and fast, by local standards.
Azalai Hotel Bamako, ☏ +223 44 90 49 44, azalaihotelsalam@azalaihotels.com. Most luxurious of the three Azalai hotels in Bamako, and one of the best in town. Very nice pool.

Laico Hotel de l'Amitié, Avenue de la Marne (In city centre), ☏ +223 22 43 21. This is probably the plushest of all the hotels in Bamako along with the Radisson.
Laico Hotel El Farouk, Boulevard du 22 Octobre 1946, Quartier du Fleuve, ☏ +223 2023 1830. Laico Hotels took this over from the Kempinski Hotel Chain.
Radisson Blu Hotel, Bamako, ACI 2000 Hamdallaye Hamdallaye, ☏ +223 4429 0000, info.bamako@radissonblu.com. This is one of the newer hotels in Bamako with excellent, large rooms and free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel for guests. The ACI 2000 area of Bamako is however quiet and removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Prices starting at CFA 132 000.
In Bamako you have a high chance of encountering the police. You should always at least carry a copy of your passport and visa. It is often not sufficient to just show your driving license and this might lead to a ride to the police office - if you're not prepared to bribe your way out. Notice that the police often stops taxis.
If the price of the 'ticket' seems high (more than, say, CFA 5,000 for a minor offence), ask to go to the police station. There you can get an official receipt which shows the true price of the offence. Many locals consider it a moral issue to pay proper fines rather than grease the pockets of corrupt police.
If you go gradually (doni doni) you'll be able to drink Bamako's quite chemically tasting tap water. You shouldn't drink the unmarked sachets with water or syrupy water as long as you don't drink tap water—though the branded sachets of mineral water are fine (CFA 50).
Or you can avoid any hassles and drink bottled water. If you're sticking around town for a while, try buying bottled water by the case.
The price will drop from about CFA 1500-1800 to CFA 600-700 per  litre bottle.
Clinique Pasteur is a more expensive toubab clinique, is fairly clean, and is within close proximity to the US Embassy in ACI 2000 area of Bamako. Dr Toure there speaks English, was medically trained in Canada and he can be reached via mobile at: +223 6674 0572. Don't trust Dr. Dolo with your pregnancy. Normally they want to have you taking all possible tests, and are notorious for recommending drastic unnecessary and expensive treatments. You first might want to consult a cheaper normal health centre like Clinique Farako in Hamdallaye, or the Centre Diagnostique (Dr. Catherine Cisse) near the old Pont de Martys. Even then, double check all recommendations online and with a doctor abroad before embarking on any treatment plan or surgery.

Siby is a town a one-hour drive from Bamako on asphalt road. Once you are there in Siby, you may want a 4-wheel drive vehicle to explore the sandy roads to several touristic sites within a 30 minute drive. It has very nice scenery, rocks to climb, and the Saturday market. There is a historic grotto, a 45-minute hike to a mountain side, a natural arch where rock climbers can get a panoramic view of the city and countryside, a cascading waterfall and surprisingly cool pool which makes for a wonderfully fresh plunge, about a 30-minute drive from the city's main road.
This city travel guide to Bamako is a usable article. It has information on how to get there and on restaurants and hotels. An adventurous person could use this article, but please feel free to improve it by editing the page.
