Anchorage is the largest city in Alaska, in the Southcentral region. Anchorage is a cosmopolitan port city with a population of 288,000 (2019). It is a consolidated city-borough referred to as a municipality. The urbanized city is defined by Muldoon Road to the east, Rabbit Creek Road to the south, and Cook Inlet to the north and west. Several small suburbs are within the Municipality of Anchorage while physically outside what most Anchorageites would call the "Anchorage" proper area. These include Eagle River and Chugiak to the north and Girdwood to the south.

Let's be clear, if you are looking for the "real Alaska" this is not it, but you can see it from here. Anchorage is a city — a real city with freeways, traffic, giant malls, tall buildings, crime and most other things one expects to find in an American city. It is an important hub and the gateway to other marvelous areas including the Alaskan Interior and the Kenai Peninsula, but is not really a tourist destination. While it is not the administrative capital of Alaska, it is the economic capital. There are good places to eat and plenty of shopping, but the city is just that, a city. A great place to gear up for a trip, but it's not particularly "Alaskan" except for the weather and its spectacular setting.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Alaska is well known for its winters—but most visitors come in the summer, when the days are long and the temperatures are moderate.
Many people consider the period between May and early September to be the best time to visit Anchorage. The month of June usually has the best combination of long days, good weather, and warm afternoons.
As you would expect in the high northern latitudes, the longest days come around the summer solstice, 21 June, and they get quite short around the winter solstice, 21 December. In the summer, Anchorage gets up to 19½ hours of sunlight between 4:30AM and 11:30PM, the sun sets just before midnight especially early in the season. Under clear skies, the sky wouldn't get completely pitch black in June. At the start of winter however, the area only gets 5 hours of sunlight each day - sunrise can be as late as 10:15AM and the usually cloudy winter days further limit the amount of daylight, with sunsets around 3:45PM.
The Anchorage-area climate, including the Kenai Peninsula and Prince William Sound, often sees summer temperatures in the mid-70s F (24°C). Winter temperatures may fall into the -20s and -30s (-30s°C) for a short spell.

Anchorage International Airport (lower center), NASA
Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) IATA is served by many major American airlines. The main passenger airline that serves Anchorage is Alaska Airlines. Air travel is the cheapest and fastest form of transportation in and out of the state. Non-stop flights are available from Atlanta, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Newark, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Seattle/Tacoma, and more locations in the summer. Many arriving and departing out-of-state flights are late-night "red-eyes," but there are often many daytime flights to and from Seattle. Anchorage is the fourth busiest airport for freight due to its location along "great circle" routes between Asia and the lower 48.
Anchorageː Air Crossroads of the World
There are non-stop flights from Canada, Germany, Iceland, and airline hubs in the lower 48. The South Terminal (domestic) serves Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Condor (departures), Delta Air Lines, Grant Aviation, Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines All regional intrastate carriers also use the South Terminal. The North Terminal (international) serves Condor (arrivals), Icelandair, and Yakutia Airlines. The Anchorage airport is connected to the Lake Hood Seaplane Base, but not Merrill Field. A shuttle bus runs approximately every 15 minutes between the North and South terminals. There are two visitor information centers in the Airport: one in the South (Domestic) Terminal, C Concourse, in the Baggage Claim Area, ☏ +1 907 266-2437, open daily; and one in the North (International) Terminal, ☏ +1 907 266-2657, open mid-May through mid-September. The main visitor center is in downtown Anchorage at 4th Avenue and F Street.
The airport is 5 miles (8 km) southwest of downtown Anchorage. Taxis, shuttles, and rental cars are available. Route #40 of the Anchorage People Mover bus system serves the airport's North and South terminals once every 15 minutes on weekdays and 30 minutes evenings and weekends, connecting it with the downtown Transit Center (6th Avenue between H and G Streets).
Anchorage is also accessible from the Contiguous United States (locally referred to as "the Lower 48") and Canada via road. The Alaska Highway starts in northern British Columbia and terminates in Fairbanks. You can get to Anchorage via either the Parks Highway from Fairbanks or the Glenn Highway from Tok (the first major Alaskan town after crossing the Canadian border). The Seward Highway serves traffic entering Anchorage from the Kenai Peninsula to the south and its Alaska Marine Highway System terminals. Whittier has a ferry that goes directly to Juneau with a connection to Bellingham, Washington. The ferry ride takes 5 days.
Make sure to pick up a copy of The Milepost, which is widely regarded as the premier road guide for western Canada and Alaska. Most roads in these regions have small white posts every mile or so indicating the number of miles from the start of the road. The Milepost has extremely detailed route descriptions of all of the roads, pointing out everything from scenic viewpoints and campgrounds down to the names of small creeks the roads pass over. If you're flying in to Anchorage and then driving around the state, wait and pick up a copy of The Milepost at one of the local Costcos or Wal-Marts—the price there is around half of list price.
Aerial picture of Port of Anchorage
Because of the shallow conditions of the inlet and powerful tides, as much as 30 ft ( m), only one large cruise ship, from Holland America Line, regularly calls in the summer on the Port of Anchorage, 2 mi ( km) north of downtown. Since the port is mainly a cargo port, cruise passengers can not just walk through the port; instead, passengers are shuttled from the dock to the downtown mall.
The vast majority of large cruise ships (over 200 calls each summer) stop at one of two deep water ports much further away from Anchorage: Seward, 127 mi (204 km) south on the Kenai Peninsula; or Whittier, 65 mi (104 km) southeast (mainly Princess). Whittier is also the closest harbor to Anchorage served by the Alaska Marine Highway. Many cruise lines provide transportation from their terminals in Whittier or Seward to Anchorage and may even include tours or your return air travel out of the state.
Interior Alaska Bus Line, ☏ +1-800-770-6652, akbus2@aptalaska.net. Year round service on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday between Tok and Anchorage, and Tok and Fairbanks. Trips between Tok and Anchorage stop along the way at locations including Glennallen and Palmer. Trips between Tok and Fairbanks stop along the way at locations including Delta Junction. Trips depart from Tok in the morning and return to Tok in afternoon. Therefore to travel involving switching between the routes at Tok requires multiple nights stay in Tok. Be sure to reserve in advance and allow some flexibility in your schedule as buses may be rescheduled based on demand. Travel time from Tok is -7 hours, from Glenallen is -4 hours, and from Palmer is an hour. (updated Aug 2022)
The Alaska Railroaddead link runs from Seward through Anchorage, Denali, and Fairbanks to North Pole, with spurs to Whittier and formerly Palmer. The railroad is famous for its summertime passenger services; but it also plays a vital part in moving Alaska's natural resources — primarily coal — to ports in Anchorage, Whittier and Seward as well as fuel and gravel for use in Anchorage. Their cargo trains connect to the lower 48 through the Port of Seattle by barge, but there are no passenger connections to Canada (Via Rail) or to the lower 48 (Amtrak).
The Alaska Railroad Depot in Anchorage is downtown at 411 West 1st Ave, ☏ +1 907 265-2494; ☏ +1-800-544-0552.
While not nearly comparable to the size of major world cities (the city is several thousand square miles, but most of it is uninhabited and mountainous), the developed part of the Municipality of Anchorage is fairly spread out and not very walkable—with the exception of the compact downtown area.
Most of Anchorage is built on a grid system laid out by the railroad: numbered streets run east-west, starting at First Avenue in the extreme north of the city (at the Port and train depot) and ending up in the mid-hundreds at the south edge of town. Lettered streets run north-south, starting at A Street in the middle of downtown and going up to the west; east of A Street, the street names begin with sequential letters and are named after Alaskan cities and towns (Barrow, Cordova, Denali, etc.) This makes finding yourself on a map fairly easy, although the system gets less coherent outside of the downtown area. The Seward Highway becomes Gambell and Ingra streets, while the Glenn Highway becomes 5th and 6th Avenues.
You'll often hear Anchorageites use the following terms when describing areas of town. These areas used to be separate communities that merged as the city grew.
Downtown: the historic core of the city at the northwestern tip next to the waterfront, roughly north of 10th Avenue and west of Gambell Street. Home to most of the tourist activities, gift stores, hotels, and the railroad depot
Midtown: the largely commercial area immediately south of Downtown roughly between 15th Avenue and Tudor Road (becoming more industrial south towards Dimond Boulevard)
South Anchorage: Dimond Boulevard and south. Largely suburban and residential with some major commercial development west of the Seward Highway.
West Anchorage: the area along the water southwest of Downtown, encompassing the historic Bootlegger's Cove and Turnagain residential areas, the famous Earthquake Park and the airport.
Spenard: smashed between Midtown and West Anchorage and spilling over and overlapping the boundaries a bit, it used to be a separate city and catered to the racier aspects of Anchorage living. It's still a bit of a red-light district, especially along Spenard Road. Be careful at night. (The airport is at the extreme west end of the Anchorage peninsula and abuts the southwestern edge of Spenard.)
East Anchorage: everything east of the Seward Highway and north of Tudor Road. Mostly residential; little of interest to the tourist except for the universities, hospitals, and (at the extreme northeastern corner) the Alaska Native Heritage Center.
Hillside: part of South Anchorage, it's everything east of the Seward Highway and south of Abbott Road. Completely residential, and many homes there are on the ritzier side (worth $350,000-$M, where the average home is about $220,000). Anchorageites think of the Hillside like Angelenos do of Beverly Hills — if you own a home there, you must be doing well, even if the trees (or your snowmachine trailer) block your view of the lesser people below. Above the Hillside homes is the immense Chugach State Park, popular for easily accessible hiking. (The most-hiked mountain in Alaska, Flattop Mountain, is fairly easily accessed via the Glen Alps parking area at the top of Upper Huffman Road.)
Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek: suburbs north of the city. They provide access to Chugach State Park, especially Crow Creek Pass and Eklutna Lake.
Indian, Bird, Girdwood: small communities south of the city along the Seward Highway as it skims the north shore of Turnagain Arm. Very small, tourist-service oriented.
The area that can be explored by walking is the relatively compact downtown area. To plan your visit, drop in the unique Visitor Information Center, an authentic sod-roofed log cabin, at 4th Avenue and F Street, ☏ +1 907 257-2363, to pick up maps and brochures of the many points of interests and events (e.g., summer music concerts) within walking distance. In summer, downtown Anchorage, alive with flowers and alit with thousands of lights at night, is very popular and often crowded with tourists and those awaiting departure for, or arriving from, cruises. To extend your walking range, take advantage of the various free shuttles from downtown in the summer. Or rent a car or bike, or use the People Mover bus system, which has its Downtown Transit Center at 6th Avenue between H and G Streets.
Anchorage's Ted Stevens International Airport is served by all of the major national rental car chains as well as a number of independents. A few companies have off-airport locations and may even offer courtesy shuttles (though these shuttles will not pick up from the airport). Renting from these locations avoids the 11-12% airport concession recovery fee and $ per day airport facility fee. If you're renting for more than a few days, it might be worth the hassle to rent your vehicle at an off-airport location, which usually involves taxi rides or shuffling between hotel and rental car courtesy shuttles. Check with each agency or search off-airport rental cars using an online travel agency to see what cost savings may be available.
If you're arriving in the summer, plan ahead, as most rental companies are pretty much sold out from mid-June through the end of August. In the summer, cars are often not available without reservations, and even if they are, be prepared to pay top-dollar for them, especially four-wheel-drive vehicles. Renting a car in Alaska can be more expensive than pretty much anywhere else in the United States, ranging up to (and occasionally even over) $200 per day for a large vehicle sufficient to carry multiple passengers and outdoor gear during the peak season. In the dead of winter, however, you can sometimes grab a vehicle for under $10 per day.
Some of the major car rental companies serving the Anchorage area are:
Alamo (in-terminal): ☏ +1 907-243-3406
Avis (in-terminal and downtown): ☏ +1 907-243-2377
Budget (in-terminal and midtown): ☏ +1 907-243-0150

Thriftydead link (in-terminal and midtown): ☏ +1 907-276-2855
Most airport rental agencies are open from about 5:30AM or 6AM to about 2AM (3AM at the latest) in the peak summer season. With the number of red-eye flights serving Anchorage, it's especially important to be sure your flight doesn't arrive after your rental agency closes. None of the major chains is open 24 hours, so the only option for after-hours arrivals is a cab or hotel shuttle to an area hotel or to sleep on a bench until the agencies open.
Two main taxi companies serve the Anchorage area: Alaska Yellow Dispatch (☏ +1 907-222-2222) and Checker Cab (☏ +1 907-276-1234). The airport maintains a taxi stand on the arrivals level. As of September 2023, the municipality-set rate for all taxis is $ are the flag drop and $ per mile; time based rate ~$.63 per minute. The average fare to downtown runs about $25 one-way.
Many hotels also offer courtesy shuttle vans that stop at the airport near the taxi stand. Several courtesy phone banks are inside the baggage claim areas.
Drivers tend to be aggressive in Anchorage year round, and many of the roads are heavily damaged by severe winter conditions and the use of studded tires. If you are visiting in winter and not used to driving in winter conditions, be very cautious, do not pass, keep excessive following distance, and allow plenty of time to stop. If it's snowing, no matter what time of the day, have your headlights on (the Seward Highway south of Anchorage requires headlights to be on at all times). A roadway covered with black ice may look completely dry but provide no traction whatsoever.
If you're determined to save money or are traveling the USA without a car, you can use the PeopleMover, Anchorage's bus system. Fares are $2/trip, exact fare only, or a $5/day pass. PeopleMover has an app for payment of the bus fare as an alternative. For more information, call the PeopleMover Ride Line at ☏ +1 907-343-6543.
Anchorage features an extremely well-developed bike trail system, with over 200 miles (320 km) of developed trails (120 of which are paved) winding their way throughout the city's parks and three green belts. The popular Tony Knowles Coastal Trail parallels the waterfront from Downtown to Kincaid Park near the airport. Several companies offer bike rentals and trail tours. In the winter, many of the trails are groomed and used as ski trails.

Dall sheep in Chugach State Park
The Anchorage area is home to moose, brown and black bears, Dall sheep, and many migratory bird species. A visitor should be able to find moose fairly easily by driving any neighborhood on Anchorage's Hillside (actually the foothills of the Chugach mountains). It is not uncommon to hear of bears being spotted in residential areas, but visitors who hope to see wild bears should plan excursions to either Denali National Park or Katmai National Park. Dall sheep, a species similar to the big-horn sheep found in the American Rockies, can often be spotted by driving down the Seward Highway south of Anchorage. A good way to spot sheep is to notice congregations of other tourists photographing them. A good place to view waterfowl and eagles is the Potter Marsh boardwalk, immediately south of Anchorage on the Seward Highway.
One of the best places to hike or bike to get to know Anchorage would have to be the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail. Awesome views. Starting from downtown, it's a well maintained 14-mile paved track around the coast, with housing developments and forests on one side, and the ocean of Cook Inlet on the other. You can come back via an inland loop right around the airport. This has some on-road sections, but takes you past Lake Hood, a busy and interesting seaplane base. It's a very popular track for bikers and joggers during the summer months.
For a more challenging hike, drive east on O'Malley Road (south Anchorage) and follow signs for Glen Alps trailhead in Chugach State Park. There is a $5 day parking fee at the trail head (parking is free if you stay 30 minutes or less). If you don't have a car, a shuttle provides round-trip transportation between downtown and the trailhead for $22, Flattop Mountain Shuttle. From this launching point, there are numerous hiking options for all levels in the Flattop Mountain Trail systemdead link. The shortest hike is to the Anchorage overlook, a 5-minute walk north of the parking lot, which offers the best view of the city of Anchorage. There is also a mountain biking trail to the east of the parking lot leading up towards Powerline Pass. To the south of the parking lot is the trail leading to the Blueberry Loop, a saddle at the base of Flattop Mountain, and a steep trail off this Loop up to Flattop peak. Climbing Flattop Mountain is Anchorage's most popular day hike,  miles one-way with an elevation gain of 1300 feet, which would take 1 to 3 hr depending on your hiking ability. There is a bit of scrambling over rocks at the end to reach the top of Flattop. Be aware of climbers above you as they can dislodge rocks. Summit is often cold and windy, so bring appropriate clothing. All the trails are well maintained and there is little risk of being lost in the immediate area, however, for the maximum experience it's a good idea to bring water and plan your hike with a great guide, such as "55 Ways to the Wilderness", Southcentral Alaska or Chugach State Park editions, available online or at any local Alaskan bookseller. This is a great place to see moose in the summer. In the fall, Flattop Mountain is covered with wild blueberries.

Alyeska Resort. In Girdwood about 40 mi (64 km) south of Anchorage on the Seward Highway is Alaska's largest alpine (downhill) ski resort. Alyeska often has the highest annual snowfall of any ski area in North America and has a wide array of intermediate and expert terrain. Beginner terrain is fairly limited, but Alyeska has a fairly good ski and snowboard instruction program so it is not a bad place to learn.
Hilltop Ski Area. In south Anchorage about 15 minutes from downtown. It is a fairly small area in the Chugach foothills with one chairlift and a surface lift and exclusively beginner terrain.
Alpenglow at Arctic Valley. A volunteer operated resort with two chairlifts and a T-bar. While the terrain is not as steep as some of the expert-only terrain at Alyeska, it is not for beginners and the snow is often windblown and hard. Alpenglow offers free lift tickets for volunteers, and thus is a great option for ski bums and budget travelers.
Hillberg Ski Area. On Elmendorf Airforce Base to the north of downtown Anchorage, and is open to the public: civilians who don't have authorization to enter the base must be signed in and escorted by someone who does. Hillberg has only beginner terrain, but tends to have shorter lift lines than Hilltop making it a better option for people who can get access.
Chugach Powder Guides. Offers helicopter and snow-cat skiing in the Chugach mountains with a professional guide for advanced intermediate to expert skiers and boarders.
Tordrillo Mountain Lodge. Located in the Tordrillo Mountain Range about 75 miles west-northwest of Anchorage. The Tordrillo Mountain Lodge offers Winter & Summer heli skiing and heli snowboarding opportunities for novices and pros.

White Spot Cafe, 109 W 4th Ave (4th and A), ☏ +1 907 279-3954. The place is not much more than a small kitchen and a counter with room for 10 patrons. Arguably better burgers and definitely better halibut sandwiches than Arctic Roadrunner. Study the menu carefully before daring to order, or Sheri will put you in your place. The food is way worth the attitude, though. $.
Kami Ramen, 3807 Spenard Rd (at intersection with Minnesota Dr), ☏ +1 907-313-3582. 10AM-10PM. Ramen is probably going to taste good on a cold day. Ramen or katsu around $15 (Jan 2023).

A wonderful pizza location, similar to the Moose's Tooth described below (although the menu differs a bit). It also features a movie theater in which you can eat dinner (they deliver it right to your seat) and imbibe from the wide selection of microbrews and wines. It mainly plays art house films and those that have been released for some time. It's a great place to spend an evening before taking a red-eye flight out of Anchorage as it's quite close to the Anchorage airport. Buy tickets in advance on the weekends—it can be very busy. The attached Bear Tooth Grill offers very different but equally delicious choices in a more traditional bar/grill restaurant setting. (updated Aug 2016)
Glacier BrewHouse, 5th Ave between H and G St, ☏ +1 907 274-BREW (2739). A very popular place to eat in downtown Anchorage. Wide selection of food, impressive selection of beers from their brewery. Hard to go wrong with this one if you're looking for a place to eat downtown.

Solstice Bar & Grill, 720 W 5th Ave (between H and G Sts), ☏ +1 907 276-7676. While not as popular as Glacier BrewHouse, Solstice Bar & Grill offers meals of a similar quality for a slightly cheaper price in the lobby level of the Westmark Hotel (almost directly across from the BrewHouse).

Southside Bistro, 1320 Huffman Park Dr (in the far south end of town), ☏ +1 907 348-0088. Fresh seafood and innovative preparations of meats and lighter fare make this a great stop for those heading south or those wanting to get away from the hustle of the touristy areas. Bar with microbrews and a good wine list.
Snow City Cafe, 1034 W 4th Ave, ☏ +1 907 272-2489. Open for breakfast and lunch only, except on Wednesdays when there is an excellent Irish jam (and sometimes dance!) from 7-11PM. There is often a long wait for a table and for good reason, food is fresh and affordable; breakfast is available all day and there are plenty of hearty fares for the health-conscious. If you're not health-conscious, the macaroni and cheese is to die for!
Tequila 61, 355 E St (Fourth Avenue across from Hard Rock Cafe).. A Mexican gastropub.
Crow's Nest, 4th and K (top floor of Hotel Captain Cook), ☏ +1 907 276-6000. AAA four-diamond rating and Wine Spectator awards. Seafood, "French and American" cuisine.

ORSO Ristorante, 5th Ave between H and G Sts, ☏ +1 907 222-3232. Next to and owned by the same company as Glacier BrewHouse, this restaurant offers higher-priced meals inspired by traditional Italian fare. In the same block as a number of art galleries and smaller boutique shops, one can keep occupied while waiting (which in the summer season, is typical).
Simon and Seafort's, 420 L St (end of downtown near the coastal trail), ☏ +1 907 274-3502. Semi-fancy seafood restaurant and bar. On the expensive side, but it's worth it to get some of the best seafood in Alaska (and being Anchorage, there's no dress code). They also have excellent non-seafood selections and a great lunch menu. You can also see the sunset over the water by the window. Menus online.
Ginger, 425 W 5th Ave, ☏ +1 907 929-3680. New restaurant. Trendy, modern, upscale dining. Sort of an Asian-Alaskan fusion, with things like wasabi mashed potatoes. Extensive saki list. Try the fries for an appetizer; they're freshly made and delicious.
In Girdwood (45 minutes south):
Double Musky Inn, Mile 3 Crow Creek Rd, ☏ +1 907 783-2822. The Double Musky has Alaska's best Cajun cuisine with a local seafood slant. They have a "rustic yet formal" (but still no dress code) atmosphere. It is a great place to take a date, not just for the great food but also for the beautiful drive south along the coast. Also very warming after a day at the local Alyeska Ski Area.
Anchorage has many, many bars. Bars must close by 2:30AM M-F, 3AM Sa & Su under municipal law. Bars can stay open until 5AM in the cities of Palmer and Wasilla, about 45 minutes north. Anchorage also probably has more micro-breweries per capita than anywhere else (except maybe Portland, OR). All bars and restaurants in Anchorage are non-smoking. Also see "Bear Tooth Theatrepub", "Glacier BrewHouse", and "Moose's Tooth" under "Eat."
First Tap Thursday - On the first Thursday of each month, Bear Tooth Theatrepub celebrates a new Broken Tooth Brewing draft beer with live music.
Bernie's Bungalow Lounge, 626 D St (between 6th and 7th; across the street from Nordstrom's entrance), ☏ +1 907 276-8808. This is a fashionable and friendly "martini-and-cigar" type of place. Good place to sit outside on the lawn in the summer, or to go upstairs to the Paradise Room for a fancy place to have a drink (although the upstairs is often booked for private gatherings). It's popular with well-dressed young people and businesspeople (during the daytime). The evening crowd is generally younger and the bar is embracing a larger hip-hop crowd. Usually busiest after midnight.
Chilkoot Charlie's, 1071 W 25th Ave (in Spenard), ☏ +1 907 279-1692. This is the largest bar within about 1,400 miles (2200 km). It's a huge spot that is always busy on weekends. The outside facade is deceptively small - there is a map on their website to navigate through all 10 or more bars. There is usually at least one band playing every night (and usually a cover charge). Popular place to pick up dates, if you can hear above the noise.
Darwin's Theory, 426 G St, ☏ +1 907 277-5322. A quintessential "dive bar," Darwin's is popular with the locals. If you're interested in avoiding the generic tourist watering holes, Darwin's will wet your whistle. It's just a basic corner bar.
Humpy's Great Alaskan Alehouse, 610 W 6th Ave, ☏ +1 907 276-BEER (2337). Humpy's has dozens of beers on tap and a great pub food selection (esp. seafood) until midnight. It's popular with just about everyone. Beer-battered halibut—yum!
49th State Brewing Company, 717 W 3rd Avenue, ☏ +1 907 277-7727. Popular micro-brewery on the edge of downtown Anchorage. Good micro beers and decent pub food. Often have live entertainment. A treat is to sit out on the second floor landing on a sunny afternoon with excellent views of Cook Inlet and the Port of Anchorage. Sometimes you can see military aircraft doing training runs into Elmendorf Air Force Base. (updated Jan 2019)
Since about 2000, major hotel developers from the Lower 48 have been building new hotels along C Street from International Airport Road to just north of Tudor Road, making this half-mile stretch of C Street a new "hotel row" in Midtown (about 3 mi south of downtown and 3 mi east of ANC).

Anchorage has a reputation for being a dangerous city — a reputation that's not entirely unwarranted — but the average traveller should not be too overly concerned or cautious of their surroundings. A lot of the crime occurs between those involved in the drug trade or organized crime.
Like most cities, location is very important as security changes from place to place. Areas close to downtown are safer to walk at night. Stay in populated areas, avoid poor neighborhoods, especially at night, and don't walk there at any time if you are alone. Vicious beatings have been reported at resorts by people who have travelled alone, so stay alert for any suspicious-looking individual.
Certain areas in the northeast of the city (Mountain View, north of the Glenn Highway and east of Merrill Field airport) and central (Fairview, 6th to 15th Avenue, east of Ingra) have higher crime than other spots.
As in all other cities these crimes receive a disproportionate amount of attention from local media. These tragic events, however, are typically not random so they will probably not impact your visit. You are more likely to be a victim of crimes of opportunity; however, most violent crimes in Anchorage are usually domestic disputes.
Also, areas around the airport like Spenard are known for increased drug activity and sex work. In earlier times, the downtown area around 4th Avenue was like that, but a concerted effort over the last eight years has mostly moved the activity into Spenard.
A constant problem is car break-ins at parking lots. Do not leave any valuables visible.
The trails close to and around the university are unsafe when it is dark. During the colder months there are increased attacks on females going to and from the housing and library.
Also, stay a good distance away from moose. Although they may appear harmless, they can and will protect their young ones from people, and can charge if they feel cornered or threatened. Never approach them, as they are best viewed from a distance.

There are only two roads out of Anchorage, the Seward Highway which goes south to the Kenai Peninsula and ends/starts at Seward, and the Glenn Highway which goes northeast to Glennallen and continues as the Tok Cutoff to Tok where it ends at the Alaska Highway. The Glenn Highway junctions with the George Parks Highway about 35 miles north of Anchorage, continuing northwest to Denali National Park and Fairbanks. Driving from Anchorage to Fairbanks usually takes 6–8 hours (356 miles) and driving from Anchorage to Seattle, WA usually takes at least 3 days.
The Alaska Railroaddead link offers daily service between Anchorage/Seward, Anchorage/Whittier, and Anchorage/Fairbanks during the summer. The Anchorage/Fairbanks run (Aurora) offers flag drop service between Talkeetna and Hurricane - it is the only railroad in the U.S. that will pick you up if you flag the train from the side of the tracks.
There are numerous small plane flying services which have scheduled flights to small villages, or the capacity to charter flights to different villages. For travel to villages outside of the south central region, it is usually cheaper to take a regular commercial flight to the appropriate regional hub (Bethel, Unalakleet, Dillingham, Unalaska, Kotzebue, Nome, Barrow, Fairbanks, or Juneau) and arrange to fly from there to your destination.
Alaska Car & Van Rentals, 854 E 36th Ave. A mom and pop rental company that offers low rates by not being at the airport. The only caveat is you must have your own car insurance.
