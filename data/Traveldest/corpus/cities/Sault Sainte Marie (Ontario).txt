Sault Ste. Marie is a city of approximately 72,000 people (2021), in Northern Ontario. It is the beginning and end point of the Agawa Canyon Tour Train. Directly across the St. Mary's River -- and the Canada/US border -- is its twin city, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.
The twin cities of Sault Ste Marie (Ontario) and Sault Ste Marie (Michigan) straddle the international border between Canada and the United States of America; they are connected by a bridge across the St. Mary's River.International Bridge
The area boasts rugged shores, sandy beaches, untouched forests, winding rivers, and two Great Lakes.

The history of the area involves an eclectic mix of cultures; once called "The Meeting Place", it drew inhabitants from all over Europe and from North American tribes.
The Ojibwe First Nation (Indigenoys) people called this area Baawitigong, meaning "place of the rapids." The rapids long represented an obstacle to voyagers heading westward to Lake Superior; since at least the era of the French coureurs du bois, traders needed to portage here. In the 1600s, Sault Ste. Marie was established as a fur trading post. From 1668 to 1817, Sault Ste. Marie was a single settlement on the St. Mary's River in North America's Great Lakes region from 1668-1817. Later, it was divided by the establishment of the Canada-US border to form the twin cities.
In the War of 1812, while the city was still a single settlement, it was a strategic point on the frontline due to its control over access to Lake Superior. Later in the 1800s, canal locks were constructed on both sides of the boundary to bypass the rapids. During the 1900s, Sault Ste. Marie was a site for steel making.
Today, Recreational craft and tour boats in the area use the Sault Ste. Marie Canal, on the Canadian side of the border. Large, ocean-going cargo vessels use the Soo Locks on the American side.

Mobile service from Sault Ste. Marie westward through Thunder Bay to the Manitoba border is operated by TBayTel. The rugged landscape of this area, combined with the significant gaps between towers, means that a signal is by no means guaranteed.
In Sault Ste. Marie, limited cellphone coverage can be expected outside the city centre, especially north (Fifth Line, Hiawatha Park) and west of town (Airport, Pointe des Chênes, Gros Cap). Coverage on Highway 17 north from Sault Ste Marie to Wawa is sporadic; huge areas have no coverage at all. Leave the beaten path (the Trans-Canada Highway or the few cities) and there's nothing. Much of the road to Wawa is parkland with few services of any kind.
Roaming is supported for clients of the three major Canadian 3G networks (UMTS/WCDMA on 850/1900 MHz). There is no 2G capability. While TBayTel advertises something it calls `4G` in limited areas, this is HSPA+ (a faster version of the 3G UMTS standard) and not LTE.
Unless your handset supports 3G/UMTS on the North American frequencies, you will get no service... not even to call 9-1-1 in an emergency.
Do not rely on having cellphone coverage on this route! Before heading out on this relatively remote section of highway, it is strongly recommended to carefully examine your cell provider's coverage maps and bring appropriate supplies for use if stranded by a breakdown.
Branches of the Sault Ste. Marie public library offer free Wi-Fi access.
Sault College and Algoma University provide free Wifi for guests on their campuses.
Customers of Shaw Cable from anywhere in Canada can take advantage of the numerous Shaw Go Wifi hotspots present in the Sault. Look for a ShawOpen SSID; after connecting, log in with your Shaw email address and password.
As a rule, the most pressing concern for travellers in Sault Ste. Marie is property crime. Violent crime is most prevalent between people who already know each other (e.g. organized crime; domestic violence); stranger-on-stranger violence is uncommon.
Do not leave any kind of valuables in your car. Thieves may break into your vehicle for a trivial amount of goods, causing much more damage than the stolen items are worth. If such items need to be left in your car anyway, at least conceal them.
Valuables to safeguard include not only cash, but also electronics (including cell phones and GPS systems), firearms, alcohol, tobacco, and medication. In particular, opioid pain medications are a common target for theft.
Do not leave bicycles unattended -- they will likely be stolen.
Winters in Northern Ontario are often severe, making auto travel in winter an unpredictable venture. Whether travelling locally or on the highways, one must be prudent, allow extra travel time, and be prepared to be flexible with one's travel plans. See the Winter driving topic for a general backgrounder.
Highway 17 North from Sault Ste. Marie to Wawa sits in a snowbelt and receives heavy amounts of snow every year. The prevailing westerly winds pick up moisture as they blow across Lake Superior, which then gets visited on the shoreline as lake-effect snow and snow squalls. As such, this section of highway is frequently closed in winter, sometimes for days at a time. Closures may occur because of crashes, because of whiteouts that reduce visibility to near zero, or because snow is simply accumulating too quickly for the snowplow crews to keep up.
Highway 17 East is also occasionally closed by crashes or inclement weather, though considerably less often than the northern route. To the south, into the United States, US-2 is sometimes closed, as is the Mackinac Bridge; I-75 is very rarely closed, though if surrounding roads are, travel on it may be inadvisable as well.
