Nanning (南宁; Nánníng) is the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south-west China. It is a large, modern city and a transport gateway for travellers to and from Vietnam.
District: Jiangnan District, Xingning District, Qingxiu District, Liangqing District, Xixiangtang District, Wuming District, Yongning District
Though the older people speak Cantonese (白话 báihuà), the younger generation mainly speak Mandarin (普通话 pǔtōnghuà). Nanning is regarded as one of the most successful cities in China in terms of popularizing Mandarin or 'common language'. So it is a very good place to learn Putonghua. Universities offering Chinese courses are many, including Guangxi University for Nationalities and Guangxi University. However, be aware that Nanning people, like virtually all Chinese in the south, have a non-standard pronunciation for many of the basic sounds of Mandarin (which comes from the northern Han people). The local dialect of Cantonese has a distinctive accent that is noticeably different from standard Cantonese, though it will still be largely comprehensible to fluent speakers of standard Cantonese.
Nanning, as the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, embraces the Zhuang ethnic language, and virtually all public building signs in Guangxi display the Zhuang written text alongside Chinese. It is not to be confused with pinyin, the romanized phonetic transliteration of Mandarin.
Nanning Wuxu International Airport (NNG IATA 南宁吴圩国际机场). Serves domestic and international flights, though the latter feature is only offered on a few destinations on a non-daily basis. Since Nanning City is China's gateway to Southeast Asian countries, the local government is putting a lot of emphasis on connecting Nanning to the capitals of every Southeast Asian country.

Taxis are also available. Fixed price to downtown is ¥100. A taxi from the airport to Langdong bus terminal will cost ¥120-130, but it is still possible to bargain for ¥100-110. The drivers might refuse to use the meter but the price is not exorbitant as it may even cost more with the meter.
All long-distance services use  Nanning Railway Station (南宁火车站, 南宁站, Nanning Station), 82 Zhonghua Road, Xixiangtang District (西乡塘区中华路82号) (Metro Line 1, Nanning Railway Station Metro Station). It's at the north end of Chaoyang Road just north of city centre. Chief cities served include Beijing (13 hours by fast daytime train or 23 hours by sleeper), Guilin (2-3 hrs), Guangzhou for Hong Kong and Macau (3-4 hours), Kunming (5 hours), Pingxiang on the border with Vietnam (3-4 hours), and Hanoi in Vietnam. This last service departs nightly around 18:00, takes four hours to the border, then a couple of hours each side for exit / entry (time zone change one hour), then another four hours to Hanoi Gia Lam. The return leaves Hanoi around 21:00 to reach Nanning for 10:00. Sorry, no one in mainland China will exchange your Vietnamese money.Although it has high-speed trains, this is a small old-fashioned station by modern Chinese standards. There's no catering or ticketing within the transit / waiting area, you'll have to go out to the station precinct, or better still completely out of the station into the underground food mall - especially if you're taking the Hanoi train, with no catering on train, along the route or on arrival. But then you need time and documentation to get back in through the gates. (updated Dec 2018)
