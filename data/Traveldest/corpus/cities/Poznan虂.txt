Poznań (German: Posen) is the largest city in Greater Poland, in the west of Poland, and one of the largest metropoles in the whole country. Situated roughly equidistantly between Warsaw and Berlin, it serves as a major economic hub, and a centre for industry and commerce. The Poznań International Trade Fair grounds host the most important trade fairs and exhibitions in Poland, making Poznań an important business destination, but the city has plenty of history and attractions to share besides that. Its relative compactness and easy access by road, rail and air make it a convenient tourist destination for visitors to Central Europe.
Poznań is a town steeped in history, as it was the first capital (with Gniezno) of Poland and seen by many as the birthplace of the Polish nation. Today it is a diverse and vibrant town, with many university students living here and much to divert the traveler. It has a stunningly rejuvenated central square, thriving night-life, fascinating museums and many attractions in the surrounding area. For train buffs, Poznań is the home of Europe's last surviving steam-hauled passenger service. With a strategic position on the Berlin – Moscow train line, Poznań will be for many their first experience of Poland.

Poznań is a compact city and has a decent public transport system, consisting of trams, fast trams (similar to metro), and buses operated by the city's transportation authority (MPK).
The center is navigable on foot, but if you decide to use trams (buses don't usually run in the center), here are the prices of tickets (Jun 2024):

24-hour ticket which costs 15 zł
7-day ticket which costs 50 zł.

The Poznań Card is a combination of ticket and discount card. Prices: 30 zł one-day, 40 zł two-day and 45 zł three-day.

You may transfer as many times as you wish, but ride as long as the ticket is valid. Night buses have the same tickets and fares.

Full price list is available here.
There are only a few bike rentals in Poznań. Expect to pay at least 100 zł per day for basic mountain bike. If you can bring your own bicycle, Poznań is an okayish place to cycle.
A bicycle will make it much easier for you to visit greener parts of the city, including all the large lakes and forests. Paths in leisure areas are usually of good quality and will enable you to ride fast. In urban areas, cycling is more of a hit or miss affair, with bike paths suddenly pushing you into roads or sidewalks. Importantly, it is usually easy to travel west-east, but it can be quite challenging to travel north-south. The best districts for cycling are in western parts of the city which have a coherent path network with good signage; the worst places for cycling are unfortunately those most important for tourists: the Old Town and other inner city districts (Jeżyce, St. Lazarus, Wilda), where cycling is mostly limited to painted bike lanes often alongside heavy traffic. Beware of Głogowska Street near Poznań Main Station, as Municipal Guards (pol. Straż Miejska) will look for cyclists riding on sidewalks (which is illegal here), because they know it is unsafe to ride on bicycle on this street.
Going outside the city is hard, as there are no good connections between Poznań and suburbs. You will be forced to ride alongside cars in heavy traffic or on muddy footpaths. Yet, this way you can reach Wielkopolski National Park, which has really scenic trails and is one of the best places for leisure cycling in the region.
In the city centre, you will have no problem getting by with English, but outside of it English is quite limited. Even at the train station, you might find that you need to communicate with store vendors using body language (the international train office employees do all speak fluent English). If you need directions, try to ask young people who look like they might attend university. If you speak Russian, you can try to look out for migrants as most of them come from Ukraine or Belarus. They usually know Russian natively or at least very well, some old people may have basic Russian knowledge. Despite Poznan's proximity to Germany, very few people speak any German, and if they do, it is often nothing more than a few words.
The old town square in Poznań
Mechanical goats on the town hall's clock
Stary Rynek (Old Market Square). The old town square, one of the finest in Europe. This is the centre of old, medieval Poznań, and has been superbly rebuilt after severe destruction in World War II. Cafés and bars line the square and it is a superb spot for ordering a drink and watching the world go by. (updated Nov 2023)
Town Hall, Stary Rynek 1. M Tu F 10:00-16:00, W 12:00-18:00, and Su 10:00-15:00. The Town Hall is the centrepiece of the Rynek. It was built in the a Gothic style in the first years of the 14th century. It was later rebuilt in Renaissance style by Giovanni Battista di Quadro from Lugano. It is said to be the most beautiful non-church renaissance building north of the Alps. The building houses the Historical Museum of Poznań (built as the headquarters of municipal powers and the city court), displaying exhibitions about the history of the city since the 10th century. Two things to watch out for here are the ornately decorated Great Entrance Hall and the mechanical goats which appear from the roof of the building each day at noon to butt their heads together a dozen times. €. (updated Oct 2016)
The City Church of St. Stanislaus and Our Lady. This church was reopened in 2007 after total refurbishment, one of the most beautiful baroque churches in Poland. It was built as a Jesuits' church; it is now the parish church for the Old Town. Many tourist come here for the sounds of its organs, built here in the 1870s by one of the most famous organ masters of that time: Friedrich Ladegast from Wesenfels (Germany). The organs can be heard during services (regular on Sundays and on weekdays: 03:00 or 04:00 and 13:00) and during organ concerts (each Saturday, 12:15, entrance free). Entrance € (2009).
The former Jesuits' College. It was an old Jesuits' school build by the monk in the same period, as the neighboring church, now houses the City Office - so it's possible to get in to see the interiors, but only halls and corridors. In the early 19th century it was the quarters for emperor Napoleon I during his march toward Moscow. Few years later - the concert place for Frédéric Chopin (his original instrument is still exhibited in Poznań in the Museum of Musical Instruments - see below). In front of the City Office is the monument of two goats - the symbol of the city. (updated Nov 2023)
King's Castle. The King's Castle (Zamek Królewski) - rebuilt by King Przemysł II in 1290s, but erected by his father, Duke Przemysł I as a duke's residence for Poznań county. The only remnants of the original building are the foundations, and - what tourists mostly look is the newer part of the building dated from the second half of 18th century. Now it houses the Museum of Applied Art and from the walls you can watch the panorama of the Old Town. Poznań King's Castle was the place of the First Prussian Homage in 1492 (however more famous is the second one presented on famous picture painted by Jan Matejko). The hill was also the place, where the arms of Polish first dynasty (Piasts) - the White Eagle - became the official national symbol. (updated Oct 2016)
The Franciscan Church. It is a rather typical church from the turn of 17th and 18th centuries​, but is really worth coming here at least for a few minutes for its beautiful paintings on the vaulting and wood carvings created by two ingenious monk - brothers Adam and Antony Swach from the Czech territories. More religious visitors come here for the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Incessant Help - the Lady of Poznań (the picture in left side-aisle). The undergrounds of the church house two Models of Old Poznan.
The Gorka Palace. The Gorkas were a famous late-medieval noble family in Poznań and erected their palace in mid-15th century, rebuilt in 16th century in Renaissance style (a marvelous portal from the eastern side). The palace houses the Archeological Museum (see below).
The Holy Blood of Lord Jesus Church. The church's erection is connected with a legend about desecration of the host done by a group of Jews. During services the priest stands backward to the people, and the church is used both by Roman Catholics and Greek Catholics (service each Sunday at noon in Ukrainian).
Imperial Castle (Zamek Cesarski w Poznaniu), Św. Marcin 80/82, ☏ +48 61 6465272. Erected 1905-1910 by Franz Schwechten, the Berlin court architect of German emperor Wilhelm II. The huge neo-Romanesque building, which alludes to medieval constructions, was officially opened by the Emperor. It was the seat of Polish President in the inter-war period and Hitler's residence during World War II, when it was remodeled under the Albrecht Speer. The dominating element of the building is the Tower, originally 74-m high, after World War II was lowered (due to the damage in the lat period of the war) by about 20 m. In the Rose Courtyard (opposite site to the main entrance) one can find a fountain modeled on the 13th century lions fountain in Allhambra (Spain). The castle houses the Castle Culture Centre, the Animation Theatre and many other institutions. It's also a place of many exhibitions, meetings, concerts and festivals. (updated Aug 2018)
Stary Marych, ul. Półwiejska. A very unusual monument os. Stary Marych, at the very beginning of Półwiejska Str. (a shopping pedestrian zone), which is probably the only monument in the world of a man walking with a bike (all other cyclers ride). The Monumemo is dedicated to Stary Marych (Old Marych), a fictitious person, who features in local newspapers or in local radio stations (from 1983), and all his speeches about the actual problems are written (and read) in local Poznań dialect. It’s also the only monument of local dialect in Poland.
The system of forts surrounding Poznań in 19th century, all located nearby former round-road, just few km from the nowadays centre. Most of them are in poor technical state and are used for many (not really historical) purposes. Anyway it is worth going to Fort VII (Polska str., accessible from the centre by trams #2, #17 and #18 to the final Ogrody stop, from the a short walk), where the Museum of Martyrology is located. The sightseeing of some forts on your own can be simply dangerous!
Środka district. Located a few minutes from the Cathedral Island, it was a merchants' and craftmen's district working for the duke or king court in first half of 13th century, as the Cathedral Island had become overpopulated. The name come from the Polish name "Środa" (Wednesday), as weekly markets took place on Wednesdays. You can get from the Cathedral Island to Środka district using a pedestrians and cyclists' bridge, bearing the name of bishop Jordan (968-982), who was the first bishop of Poznań and Poland.

The church was erected for the Johnnites order, who were running a hospital for the poor people nearby. The entrance is free, but as well limited to moments before or after services. This is also the only place in the city, where holy masses for dead people take place.
Ostrów Tumski (Cathedral Island). Ostrów Tumski; famous as the spot on which Poznań was founded, is a quiet island, with a permanent population consisting mostly of bishops, priests and monks. It was supposedly here that the town was founded, after three brothers Rus, Lech and Czech met here after not seeing each other for years (poznać being Polish for 'to meet'). It is also the spot where Poland adopted Christian baptism in 966 and where the first church (still existing Poznań Cathedral) of polish territories was built (968).The island is accessible from the centre or Old Town by trams 4, 8 and 17 and bus 63 (other lines, not really useful for tourist are 67 and 83). The cathedral is open for visitors every day from 08:00 to 16:00-19:00 (depending on the day), but is closed for sightseeing during services (esp. Sundays). Admission €.
St. Peter's and Paul's Cathedral, Ostrów Tumski 17, Poznań. St. Peter's and Paul's Cathedral was the first Polish cathedral and the only one between years 968 and 1000. Burial place of 8 Polish dukes and kings from the Piast dynasty: original graves from 10th and 11th centuries of Mesko I and his son Boleslaus the Brave preserced in the cellar; as well as the baptism bow. It was a probable baptism place of Duke Mesko I. In the cathedral, pay attention to the chain of chapels around the main aisle, not touched by bombings in 1945. The most precious ones are: the Golden Chapel (which a present memorial place of Mesko I and Boleslaus the Brave, in the sarcophagus on the right-hand side) and the Holy Cross Chapel. (updated Oct 2016)
The Our Lady Church. Our Lady Church was built in late Gothic style (approx. 1430), not very significant for its present shape and values, but important for its role in the 10th century, when in the place the duke's palace and a small chapel were built. The chapel was probably erected one year before the official baptism of Poland. The interior (due to archaeological excavations) is closed for visitors.
The Archbishop's Palace (Pałac Arcybiskupi). The palace was built at the same time as the cathedral, but its present shape comes from the 2nd half of 18th century. It is closed to visitors.

As of Aug 2022, city centre has 5G from all Polish carriers, while outlying districts and the approach highways have 4G. Wifi is widely available in public places.
In general you should feel safe in Poznań, crime (including petty crime) is low. City is not very popular among tourists, so prevalence of pick-pocketing and various common tourist scams is very low. Walking alone at night should not be a problem in most of the city. However you need to expect some weird looks if you are openly homosexual or are not white, especially in suburbs.
Do not trust strangers on Stary Rynek or Wrocławska street who want you to visit a club/bar with them. They are going to scam you, possibly steal your credit card data or at best bring you to a very overpriced place.
On Friday and Saturday evenings in summer a lot of youth go to west bank of Warta river close to city centre. It is one of the few places in the city where you can legally drink alcohol outdoors, resulting in a large number of drunken people and troublemakers gathering there. Do not venture to west bank especially late at night, you may be insulted at best or beaten and robbed at worst. Instead go to the much calmer east bank of the river.
When looking for acommodation or food avoid places close to rail, rail stations (e.g. Poznań Wschód, Poznań Dębiec) and final bus/tram stations (e.g. Rondo Rataje, Górczyn PKM). These places may feel unsafe as they tend to attract homeless and beggars.
For those arriving by train from Berlin, it would make sense to travel south to the cities of Wrocław and Kraków, or on to Warsaw. Another opportunity is to travel to the north - Gdańsk.
Dziekanowice (35 km northeast) — accessible only by car, village in Greater Poland containing ethnographic museum with traditional houses and Dutch windmills. Further behind museum there are ruins of palace on island of Ostrów Lednicki one of contenders for title of first capital of Poland
Gniezno (50 km northeast) — first capital of Poland and a minor city, easily accessible via Intercity and commuter rail. The city has one of oldest cathedrals in Poland used for coronation by Polish kings and containing relics of Adalbert of Prague. Behind cathedral there is old town with variety of architecture and food. There is also Museum of the Beginnings of the Polish State.
Kórnik (18 km southeast) — Poznań suburb accesible by suburban bus with a beautiful old town containing gothic church and numerous lakes. There is also a neogothic castle complete with original furniture and surrounded by a dendrological park with well kept bushes and trees, best visited in May/June during flowering period.
Licheń (100 km east) — two large basilicas and important Virgin Mary pilgrimage site in Poland. Worth a visit if you are a devout catholic, or if you enjoy absurd architecture.
Owińska (17 km north) — village suburb with baroque Cistercian Nuns Monastery and dilapidated von Treskow family palace with park. Good starting point to visit Puszcza Zielonka or forests north of Poznań via pedestrian/cycling bridge with observation tower.
Puszcza Zielonka (10–15 km northeast) — large forest complex to the northeast of the city. Many walking and cycling trails, lakes with fishing spots. On the forest boundaries there are numerous wooden churches. Contains free observatory on top of Dziewicza Góra open during daytime except for Mondays providing great view of Poznań and its suburbs.
Puszczykowo (15 km south) — easily accessible by commuter train, interwar era suburb with many villas, contains travel museum of a Polish traveler Arkady Fiedler including gifts from many tropical tribes. Good starting point for wandering or cycling in Wielkopolski National Park that preserves post-glacial landscape of Greater Poland. Numerous hills and scenic lakes.
Rogalin (16 km south)— accessible only with car or bike, baroque-classicist palace of Raczyński family with their famous painting collection and horse cabs. Surrounded by oak trees (in total: more than 500), including three natural monument oaks over 800 years old: Lech, Czech and Rus;
Szreniawa (15 km southwest) — village, easily accesible by train. Huge Agriculture Museum built on site of former folwark showcasing history of agriculture, crop cultivation, animal husbandry, vehicles (including aircraft and infamous Polish Tarpan trucks). You can also try beer from local brewery, pet sheep and goats or take part in one of numerous events in museum. Museum is free on Saturday. You can also go to the Bierbaums watch tower.
Wolsztyn (70 km southwest) — a town with operating steam-locos depot, which is the only one in Europe. There is annual steam locomotives parade which happens in May and brings large crowds. Choo! choo!

Gdańsk — 3 hr 30 min. to merchant city with beautiful gothic old town and granaries
Kalisz — 2 hr 30 min to supposedly oldest city in Poland, which traded amber with Romans
Kraków — 6 hr to the capital of Polish Kings, tourists favourite
Warsaw — 3 hr to the capital of Poland, rebuilt after war, dynamic metropolis with lots of commerce and night life

Zielona Góra — 2 hr to small city on top of a hill known for its wine and cute old town.
Berlin — about 3 hr on train, closer than to Warsaw
London — easily accesible via plane, very cheap connections available
