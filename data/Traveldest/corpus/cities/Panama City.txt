For other places with the same name, see Panama City (disambiguation).
Panama City is the capital of Panama. Sitting on the Pacific end of the Panama canal it has long been a point of transit for travelers and freight and these days Tocumen Airport has become the busiest in Central America and one of Latin America's most important transfer hubs.
Panama City is a very multicultural place, with large populations from many different parts of the world. Spanish is spoken by most, and many speak some form of English. Customer service is slowly improving, and surprisingly dismal in hotels. However, on the streets, Panamanians are for the most part extremely friendly and helpful and would love to give you some advice.
There's great shopping, from high-end stores in the malls around Paitilla and in the banking district around Via España, to veritable bargains around La Central (Central Avenue, now turned into a pedestrian walkway) and the Los Pueblos outdoor mall. You can also find many ethnic stores (mostly Chinese and Indian), in certain parts of the city.

Panama City used to be the de facto headquarters of the US control over the Panama Canal and as the canal was and is of vital strategic and military importance, there were a bunch of military airfields built to defend the canal. The Americans have greatly reduced their presence, and Panama turned its former military airports over to civilian use, giving Panama City three airports:
Tocumen International Airport (PTY IATA) (in San Miguelito, 32 km northeast of Panama City - the Panama metro serves a station near the terminal since 2023). See the airport article for full information.
Gelabert/Albrook Airport (PAC IATA) (This airport does have a metro station in close proximity, however the airport terminal is at the western side of the runway (and the metro station is to the east near the Albrook bus terminal) and walking to the metro station is not feasible). Domestic flights arrive at this former US military airfield (Albrook Air Force Base). Domestic airlines are safe, and many fly very modern small jet aircraft. There are daily flights from every major town and city in the country. The only carrier is AirPanama. (updated Feb 2019)
Panamá Pacífico International Airport (BLB IATA) (taxis ask $30 for a ride to the city; you'll cross the Panamá Canal on the way). A small airport that used to be known as Howard Air Force Base. Wingo offers daily flights from Medellin and Bogota. (updated Feb 2019)
The only train service is between Panama City and Colón on the Panama Canal Railroaddead link. It's mostly a freight train, but it has a very nice passenger car. The train ride offers excellent views of the Panama Canal and the tropical rain forest. In a way it is the only "transcontinental commuter rail line" in the world as some people live in Colon and work in Panama City or vice versa and commute using this train. Trains arrive at  Corozal Passenger Station (Estación de Pasajeros de Corozal) (in western suburbs near Albrook Airport). As of February 2024 the train has been reopened for service, but only for passengers on excursions from cruise ships.
Panama City has one of the most modern bus terminals in Latin America, the  Gran Terminal Nacional de Transporte (commonly referred to as "Albrook") 1 . It's the main hub and well organized. The bus terminal is next to the Albrook airport (the domestic airport), part of a shopping mall of the same name, and it is very easy to find a bus here.
The long(er)-distance buses leave from the eastern side of the terminal on the ground level and you have to go through turnstiles by paying $. Arrivals are usually on the first floor above the terminal building. All of the international buses ("tica buses" too) start and end in this terminal which are:
Ticabus (Transportes Internacionales Centroamericanos), Gran Terminal de Transportes Albrook, boleterias 32 y 32A (ticket windows 32 & 32A), ☏ +507 314-6385. International bus company going across the Central American isthmus between Panama City and Managua via San Jose. From Managua one route goes to Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula in Honduras while another continues towards San Salvador, Guatemala City and Tapachula in Mexico. They also have another north-south route connecting El Salvador to Honduras.
Expreso Panama (Panaline), Gran Terminal de Transportes Albrook, boleteria 17 y 18 (ticket windows 17 & 18), ☏ +507 314-6837. Only between Panama City and San Jose. Passengers transfer in San Jose to continue towards Nicaragua and the rest of Central America. (updated Jun 2018)
The metrobuses serving the bus terminal arrive and leave from the western side of the bus terminal (between the bus terminal and the Albrook Mall).
Within the terminal, you can buy a "RapiPass 3en1" card which can be used in the metrobus, metro and terminal ($ terminal fee at turnstiles and toilet use). The card costs $2 and needs to be topped up. Turnstiles can only be accessed with this card (no cash payment possible), however people are generally very helpful and you can ask someone to swipe you through and giving the $ to that person instead.
There are two food courts in the terminal, one at the southern end and one at the northern end. There are many drinking water fountains throughout the terminal. Toilets cost $, are clean and can be paid with a $ coin or with the RapiPass. Access to the metro station is via a bridge in the center of the terminal.
A Metro opened in 2014, and is by far the preferred method to get to the places it serves. However, there are still many places of interest not served by it. Line 1 is roughly equal parts elevated and underground with the part from Albrook to El Ingenio being the underground section. Line 2 , serving the northern suburbs, opened in 2019. There is a grand plan for many further lines which are hopefully going to enter service as the 2020s and 2030s progress.
A single ride is 35 cents regular price with discounts for the elderly and students. The last train leaves at 10PM all week, with the first train leaving M-Sa at 5AM and Su at 7AM.
One of the easiest ways to get around town is by taxi. Taxis do not have a meter. Fares are set by the authorities and are determined based on what section of the city you are starting at and what section of the city you are going to, with a surcharge for every additional person. The cab driver should have a table (which may include a map) that will show the costs for the fare, and they are required to show it to you if you ask or you can check Autoridad del Tránsito y Transporte Terrestre.
Fares are around $ for travel within one zone, and the longest fares within the city at about $5. The former Canal Zone is in a different section, and it will be at least a $5 fare. The surcharge for additional passengers should be $/additional passenger, and there's also a $ surcharge if you call a cab (at least these were the prices a few years ago). A taxi to or from the international airport typically costs $30 including tolls if you take the Corredor Sur highway. A taxi to the Amador Causeway costs $5-10. Cab drivers do not expect tips, and they may pick up additional passengers along the way. The rule is that unless there's little to no deviation from the first person's route, the first person picked up is the first person dropped off, otherwise, they will ask if it's ok to pick up the other fare. Cabs can also be rented for the day, and the fares again are set (probably around $20-25). In this case, they will expect a little extra (tip and/or lunch).
Beware, taxi drivers will frequently try to overcharge visitors, sometimes up to many times the actual price, and will not have or know about any table as mentioned. If you are clearly a visitor and asking for the price, chances are the driver will say whatever they think they can get away with and you can try haggling down. It can help to ask locals what the price should be and then negotiate based on that.
Uber is also available in Panama City.
Getting around by bus is also cheap and convenient. Fares are $ and the destination of the bus is written across the front windshield in large letters. Buses are privately owned and drivers usually compete with each other for passengers. For this reason, buses have colorful decorations to attract customers. During rush hour some buses can get crowded, and it is not unusual to see 3 people seated on a 2-person bench and lots of people standing along the aisle. It is not advised to use buses during these hours.
In 2013, the "red devils" were phased out from the main city routes, but they still connect the city with outlying suburbs.
The city has begun replacing the flamboyant "red devils" with modern, air-conditioned city buses ("MetroBus," look for the orange sign to find stops), but the red devils are still around. The MetroBus buses do not accept cash, so make sure to buy a fare card at one of the city's many malls before using them.
Bus fare is $ for regular route and $ for corredor route (Corredor Norte and Corredor Sur) and the same prices for transfer. You can buy and recharge MetroBus cards at many places around the city (Puntos de venta).
There are no maps or schedules at the stations so using the bus system can be frustrating without knowing the common name of the destination and/or adequate Spanish for inquiring.
Car travel in Panama City is notoriously difficult. During weekday work hours, traffic jams are continuous. Many street intersections lack traffic signals creating right-of-way confusion. Short distances may be quicker on foot or other means of transportation. During holidays like Carnival, the traffic can be expected to be worse.
Car rentals are available from major corporations like Hertz at Panama's Tocumen International Airport.
All taxis in Panama must be painted yellow by law. Hitchhiking is not uncommon.
Checkpoints run by the national police occur at strategic locations to prevent the movement of illegal persons and goods.
Panama Canal. Not only one of the world's most important shipping connections, but also the very reason for which the modern country of Panama was created, the canal is probably the single most iconic thing to visit in Panama. There are different ways to explore the canal: the easiest but pricey way from Panama City is to visit the Miraflores Visitor Center/Miraflores Locks. In addition, it is also possible to book a luxury train ride along the canal, or a boat ride on the canal.
Miraflores Visitor Center/Miraflores Locks (From platform 'D - Via España' at Albrook, there is a direct Albrook-Miraflores metrobus line for $, which stops right in front of the visitors center. A one-way cab to Miraflores Visitor Center should cost around $6.). 09:00-18:00 daily. The most visited place along the canal is the Miraflores Visitor Center at the Miraflores Locks. It consists of an air-conditioned museum, a movie theater, an expensive restaurant, a gift shop, and a viewing platform from where you can watch the ships pass through the locks. Be aware that the Miraflores Locks are located along the old canal with its more than a hundred-year-old locks. It's still interesting to watch the ships, but if you want to see the new, expanded canal with the new locks and much bigger ships, you'd have to go to the Agua Clara Visitor Center in Colon (Panama), on the Caribbean side of the canal. Also, while it is nice to watch the ships from the viewing platform. The 3D movie with Morgan Freeman was excellent (2023). Panama Canal in 3D "A Land Divided a World United". The exhibition hall is temporary closed due to COVID-19. The entire exhibition is 4 small rooms. If you decide to come here, make sure you'll see some ships during your visit; check the visitor center's 1 to see at which times the ships pass through the locks. Foreigners: adults $10, children 6-12 years $12; residents: adults $5, children/students/seniors $. (updated Jul 2022)
Casco Viejo. Casco Viejo is the historic part of town, where you will find many colonial style government buildings, cathedrals and museums including a Canal Museum or a small Panama History Museum. It is under massive renovation, with crumbling shacks next to beautifully restored colonial buildings. You can find in-expensive walking tour guides if you look. There are a number of accommodation options in Casco ranging from hostel pricing up to very expensive colonial suites. The area hosts a large number of eclectic events ranging from operas and musicals at the national theatre to block parties and fashion catwalks in the open plazas. Casco Viejo also offers some of the finest dining options in Panama City. Getting here from the airport by Metro bus, you can get off at 5 de Mayo stop (popular stop under a highway) then walk about 15-20 min heading south towards the water on Avenida Central, a pedestrian mall with many shops and markets, which leads directly to the old town. Together with the archaeological site of Panamá Viejo, the Casco Viejo is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. (updated Oct 2023)

It is well worth the visit but read the safety warnings and ask park employees about where it is safe to visit as the park is surrounded outside by one of the city's dangerous areas. Together with the old town Casco Viejo, the site of Panamá Viejo is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Adults $12, children and students $5; prices include the museum, park and lookout.
Amador Causeway (Calzada de Amador) (it is possible to travel to the end of the causeway by metrobus (line: Albrook-Amador), which runs from the central bus terminal (Albrook) from 'E - Corredor Sur, Zona Este' platform (with frequency of about one bus per hour); taxi fare from central city is around $7). The Amador Causeway connects four little islands (Naos, Culebra, Perico and Flamenco) to the mainland. From the causeway, there is a lovely view of Panama City, the Puente de las Americas, and the numerous islands far in Panama Bay. Many Panamanians like to spend their weekends jogging, riding a bicycle or roller-blading down the causeway, or having a meal or drinks in one of the many restaurants and bars on the islands. Bikes are available to rent in many different varieties including recumbents and multi-person bicycles, starting at about $ per hr.

The owners of the boats can either hire local help or look for volunteers in exchange for the experience, food and drinks. The process takes 2 days due to long waiting times and the slow movement. You sleep on the boat during this time. It is a unique way to experience the Canal, sailing and have a closer look at the locks.

There's an abundance of Chinese restaurants, and some can be very affordable. Try some around El Dorado, they should be pretty authentic.

Don Lee is a Panamanian chain serving Chinese fast food, and definitely worth a try.
Doraditos Rosticería Y Pizzería in Chanis. An extremely popular Panamanian restaurant that's always full and can take an infuriating amount of time to order. That said it's likely always filled by locals because the prices are cheap and the food is extremely good. In particular the rotisserie chicken (a full one costs about $5) is a local favorite with two types of chimichurri to choose from.
Fish market outside of Casco Viejo. Entering Casco Viejo is the main fish market for the city. There are some restaurants upstairs where the fish is obviously very fresh and the prices are cheap.
Lung Fung, on Transistmica Avenue. Serves some of the best Chinese food in the city. It will be a different experience. Try dim sum any day of the week (expect long lines on weekends), although it has lost some of its charm now that the wait staff speaks such good Spanish instead of only Cantonese or Haka.

ALERT: 2023-Nov Be aware there are National Demonstrations occurring across the country, which may cause travel disruptions. They have led to roadblocks and the suspension of public transport. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time.
Be careful in Casco Viejo and the Panama la Vieja ruins area. There are tourist police aplenty in these neighborhoods but do not wander too far in these areas alone (even in the day) and certainly not in the evening (as of 2010 these areas are very safe, lots of activity and tourist traffic)
Stay out of El Chorrillo, Santa Ana, Curundu and San Miguel. It is very dangerous right now due to infighting between drug gangs. Tourists have been kidnapped right off the street. El Chorrillo borders San Felipe so it is very easy to accidentally walk into it. When driving, car doors should be locked.
The central neighborhoods of Marbella, El Cangrejo, Obarrio, San Francisco, and the Banking Area are generally the most safe. In any case, be careful of your belongings, even if sitting in a restaurant, as people have had things snatched without noticing it, especially when enjoying a glass too many of Panama's great wine selection. It is never a good idea to drink heavily and walk back to your hotel.
It's always a good idea (in any country really) to spend a few minutes to find out exact taxi fares before taking a taxi and always have exact change for the correct fare. This avoids over-charging and problems with some drivers. Having to ask a taxi driver how much the fare is the equivalent to wearing a "kick-me" sticker on your shorts, as you're telling him you don't know. Some have paid $20 to get from El Dorado to Via Argentina, but the real fare for one person is $.
Outside of Multiplaza, Albrook and Multicentro are some very good looking Taxis. The drivers wear nice shirts and the Taxis have proper signs on the roof. The drivers will most likely ask you if you are interested. never take these taxis. All they do is wait for foreigners and then charge 4x the price.
Some taxis at the main bus station prey on visitors. Never put your belongings in the trunk. Sit in the back seat along with your belongings and have your luggage firmly grasped while entering and exiting the vehicle; otherwise, they can drive away with your things while you are still trying to get in. Lock the doors once inside. Avoid and ignore anyone who approaches you to "get a taxi for you"; go to the curb to get one yourself. At best they will want money for this "service" amounting to half the taxi fare; at worst, they are setting you up to be robbed with certain drivers with whom they work. Lastly, the cabs are marked on the door with a unique registration number -- memorize it or write it down and secretly tuck it safely away on your person before entering any cab.
Never lose your temper with taxi drivers or police (or anyone else really) no matter how bad you may find a situation or service in some places. Exert your rights politely but firmly.
Look both ways before crossing the street! Panamanian drivers are notoriously aggressive when the traffic allows and will not slow down for you even if you're lucky enough to find a crosswalk. There's only one way to cross the road here. Wait for a break in the traffic and walk. Once you start, keep going. Drivers will stop (99% of the time...). Otherwise you'll be stuck for hours waiting.
