Addis Ababa (Amharic: አዲስ አበባ) is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. It had an estimated population of almost 4 million in 2023 and it is growing very rapidly like many African cities. The city is an important center of diplomacy, and despite being a relatively young city, Addis is a good introduction to Ethiopia and its culture.

While Ethiopia is regarded as the original home of humans, and there has been several earlier settlements in the region, Addis Ababa was founded only in 1886 by King Menelik II and Queen consort Taytu Betul. Since that, Ethiopia has went through a lot of events that have left a mark on the city, such as two cathedrals built to commemorate victories over Italians, sites where emperors lived and worked, monuments to them, and a memorial museum to the victims of the red terror during the Derg regime. The museums of the city lets visitors experience much older times too – indeed you can see a replica of the hominoid Lucy at the national museum. In addition, the restaurants and cafés of the city let you sample Ethiopian cuisine, its famous coffee and the national drink tej.
There are more than 120 international missions and embassies in Addis Ababa, making the city a hub for international diplomacy concerning Africa. The headquarters of the African Union and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) are both in the city. The European Union and the United States both have two delegations in Addis Ababa, one for bilateral relations with Ethiopia and one for the African Union.
The city is divided into ten boroughs, known as subcities, then further divided into wards (kebeles). Suburbs include Shiro Meda and Entoto in the north, Urael and Bole (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, Nifas Silk in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and Keraniyo and Kolfe in the west. Many of the wealthiest people live in the southeast (Bole), southwest (old airport), CMC, Ayat and Lamberet parts of town. The city is one of the first in Sub-Saharan Africa to have rail based public transit. The light rail system built with Chinese help is often credited with a rapid change of connected parts of the city.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Addis Ababa features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb), a variety of the temperate oceanic climate, with wet summer (comparable to Mexico City). The average highs are between 21 °C (70 °F) and 25 °C (77 °F), the average lows between 7 °C (45 °F) and 11 °C (52 °F). The warmest months are February to May, but not "hot" as people imagine Africa; most hotels do not have air-conditioning. Temperatures and climate can vary due to elevation. Addis Ababa has 132 rainy days per year and records 1,165 mm ( in) of rainfalls annually.
Temperatures in Addis Ababa are remarkably constant from month to month: the annual temperature variation is low with around 4 °C ( °F). However, due to its altitude of 2,400 m (7,900 ft), the diurnal temperature variation is high with around 14 °C (25 °F) difference between day and night in average. It is often 27 °C (81 °F) at lunchtime and 3 °C (37 °F) at night; always take a second layer with you during the evening.
The dry winter season is from October to March. Nighttime lows can drop below +10°C, but daytime highs are comparable to the following summer months. The warm summer season around April and May is almost unnoticeable in Addis Ababa (more visible in other parts of Ethiopia), though the nights are warmer and the likelihood of rain increases.
The monsoon season is from June to September. Even if temperatures are similar to other months, July and August appear colder and less comfortable due to 80% relative humidity, few hours of sunshine and daily rains: tonsillitis and common cold are frequent. Rains also cause mud and make dirt-roads soapy. Floods happens on roads, creating traffic jams, notably at the beginning of the rainy season (end-June), when the water drainage pipes are corked by dust and wastes accumulated during 8 months of dry season.
Thunderstorms (short but with heavy rains) are frequent and isolated. In instance, it not uncommon to move to another area of the city for a 2-hour lunch in Bole and discover wet roads when coming back to Arada. In August, it is also possible to experience some hail.
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (ADD IATA) is the busiest airport in East Africa. It is the main hub for Ethiopian Airlines, one of the most successful and reputable airlines in Africa. Ethiopian has several times more destinations than the other airlines combined, from African, European, Asian, North and South American destinations. If you travel nonstop from somewhere further away, you will fly on Ethiopian. Other than that, airlines from the Middle East, North and East Africa serve Addis Ababa from their home bases.
There are two terminals. Terminal 1 (the older, smaller one) is for all domestic flights and most flights to cities in neighbouring nations (Djibouti, Nairobi, Khartoum, etc.). Terminal 2 (the newer 2003 building) is for all other international flights of Ethiopian Airlines and most other companies (arrangements may change so check first). Terminal 2 is said to be the largest terminal in sub-Saharan Africa. There are ATMs accepting Visa and Mastercard and forex services taking a wide range of currencies.
Access into the terminals is restricted, as of July 2019. Taxis and anyone who comes to meet you will be out in the carpark, though a dozen of the top hotels still have a booth inside the arrivals area. Similar rules apply at the other airports in the country, for both arrivals and departures. Many hotels will send a vehicle to pick up guests if you have arranged it. The Sheraton Addis, Dreamliner, Hilton Addis, most other hotels, and many popular guesthouses provide a regular shuttle service for guests. There is a public transport stop a bit outside, under the highway (Ring Road) bridge.
As of 2024, the airport is still more than 4 km ( mi) from the closest Light Rail Transit Station, which makes it unconnected in practice. That's not much less than the distance to central Addis, so for most travellers there's little use to go to and from the airport using light rail. In the future, a new line is planned to connect Bole Airport to the rest of the Light Rail Transit network.
There are fixed taxi fee of 150-300 birr to get from the airport to practically any place in the city center, as of April 2024 . Taxi drivers gather in a parking lot next to the airport. Most likely they will approach you shouting "Taxi!". Legit drivers should have their car marked in yellow/green color and place a license in a visible place.
Foreigners are often greeted by a throng of locals attempting to "help" load their luggage into cars. They're largely harmless and just looking for a tip, but it could be easy to lose a bag. An appropriate tip for a minor task like loading luggage into a car is 5 to 15 birr (ignore requests for more money just because you are a foreigner). If you have one person help you, twenty will ask for a tip. If you have a driver pick you up at the airport they will typically take care of any tips for you. Avoid walking alone around the airport, especially at night.
There are several Ethiopian ticket offices in Addis; including the main one at Churchill Road near the Ethiopian National Theatre and another one in the Hilton Hotel.
Most of the major roads are in good condition:
From Asmara and Dese: Highway 1
From Axum and Bahir Dar: Highway 3
From Djibouti and Nazret (Adama): Highway 4
From Gambela National Park and Gambela: Highway 5
From Jimma and Giyon: Highway 6
Trans-African Highway 4 from Cairo and Bahir Dar passes through Addis Ababa en route to Nairobi and Cape Town.
Autobus Tera (አውቶቢስ ተራ የረጅም ርቀት ባስ መናኸሪያ) (corner of Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis St and Central African Republic St / Somalia St, on the north-west side of Mercato). This is the main bus terminal where most of the national buses arrive and depart. (updated Feb 2020)
Ras Mekonin Avenue (near the railway station). Buses to/from Adama (Nazret), Bishoftu, Dire Dawa, Nairobi, Lalibela, Shahemene, Awasa and Bahir Dar are or were here. July 2011 - Ras Makonnen - or La Gare - closed and moved to the Akaki Kality District on Sierra Leone St (Debre Zeit Rd). (updated Feb 2020)

Map of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway
The railway line connecting Addis Ababa with the port city of Djibouti, via Dire Dawa opened in 2016/17. Journey time is about  hours to Dire Dawa, a mandatory overnight stay and another 12 hours to Addis and as of 2024 there is a train every second day. Tickets can be bought at the railway station or at a ticket office next to the old colonial Legehar station (a portmanteau of the French name for station, la gare) on Churchill Ave.
Addis Ababa Furi-Lebu railway station. This impressive new station is unfortunately located almost 20 km (12 mi) south of the city center, far away from anything. Taking a taxi is the best option, expect up to 45 minutes for a trip to the central city. (updated Jun 2019)
Very few streets have names and those that do may not be named correctly on a map; use landmarks to navigate the city.
Blue and white minibuses/taxis travel quite efficiently around town. Since they are full with people most of the time, it is very cheap too; usually between a few birr depending on how far you are going. To catch a minibus, stand on the side of the road and hail it. This can be done anywhere it is possible for the bus to stop. The conductor inside will call out the destination, and if that's where you want to go: get on. You pay the conductor when he signals to you that he wants money (which might take a few minutes). To get change. To get out say "woraj alle", or just "woraj". It is worth having an Ethiopian guide with you if it is your first time using these taxis, since it can be quite chaotic to find out what minibuses go where, and from what places.
These buses connect the whole city for a fare of –3 birr (2016). There are no schedules or maps available, however if you wait on a major street where a crowd gathers you can ask other people or the cashier – which is always in a cabin at the back door – for your destination. Line 31 for example is a convenient line from Meskel Square to the National Museum or Trinity Church. The buses are often overcrowded, so watch your belongings
Uber does not operate here yet, but there are a few alternatives. Zayrides is one that has worked, albeit somewhat more wonkily. It's often easier to find a cab on the street, unless you're somewhere inside a restaurant or hotel until the driver arrives. They will typically call you when they accept the ride to confirm your location and then again when they arrive. The car's location in the app will often not update.
Small blue Lada taxis are more expensive. Negotiation is the norm and you often have to press quite hard to get a bargain as a foreigner. They can be contracted for a single trip, an hour, or a full day; just negotiate. Do not be surprised if the price of the taxi increases at night for the same trip. For example the trip Piazza-Bole Airport can be as low as 100 birr at day, but rises to 150 after dark (2016).
Yellow and green taxis usually hang around hotels like Sheraton. They are more expensive, but reliable. If you're willing to pay for peace of mind, slightly better drivers and a car that wasn't featured in the Flintstones, use these cars.
Map of the Light Rail Transit
The Chinese built a system of light rail lines (one of the first in sub-Saharan Africa) in the 2010s. There are two lines that cross near Meskel square:
West–East green line 1 is from Tor Hailoch station to Ayat.
North–South blue line 2 is from Kality station to Menelik II Square station (aka Piazza).
Cost is 2 birr for an 8-station trip and up to 6 birr to go everywhere. Development along light rail stations is going on at breakneck pace and many former slums have been replaced by relatively upscale housing businesses and retail.
During peak hours the light rail is so crowded as to be almost dangerous. Pickpockets are common, and riders are not used to the concept of letting people off before they get on. As a result, you may need to physically shove passengers out of your way to get off the train – if not, it may be several stops until you can get off!
Amharic is spoken by the majority of the population, with other languages (namely Oromo and Gurange) spoken by a minority. For all intents and purposes, learning basic Amharic words and phrases will be enough for any trip, as it is unlikely you will encounter anyone who doesn't speak some Amharic.
Increasing numbers of young people can speak English, especially those who are more affluent. Be aware that Ethiopians usually speak English with a heavy accent, which can be difficult for an American or British person to understand. In the city centre, most people you encounter will speak English fluently. However, if you venture into residential neighborhoods, especially poor areas, you may find that hardly anyone can speak English well.
If you walk along the road from Meskel Square to Sidest Kilo, you'll probably find it quite entertaining and interesting. You'll see the Africa Hall, the palaces and the Parliament building, the Hilton Hotel, the marvellous architectural adventure of a building hosting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Sheraton Hotel, the first modern school (which Emperor Menelik II built in the 1880s), the Trinity Orthodox cathedral, the National Museum, and the Addis Ababa University (which hosts a former palace and museum).
Arat Kilo Avenue is marked by a statue built in commemoration of the Ethiopian day of victory during the Second World War, while Sidest Kilo Avenue is marked by a statue commemorating some 39,000 residents of Addis Ababa killed by Italian fascist troops. Around Arat Kilo, you will find part of an old town known as Serategna Sefer (literally, the residential area of labourers).
If you go past Sidest Kilo, the road becomes steeper and many of the attractions will be on the right side of the road. The Entoto college (previously Teferi Mekonnen School) and the US Embassy are on this side of the street. After the Embassy there's an open market called Shiro Meda where traditional craftsmen sell their homemade fabrics, pots and other craftwork. The marketplace is at the foot of the Entoto Mountains, which rise up to 3,300 m (10,827 ft) above sea level.
You can take a taxi or a bus to the mountain unless you are of a mind to try it yourself. On the mountain, you will find the first churches of Addis Ababa, called Saint Mary and Saint Raguel, and a smaller palace of Menelik II. Walking the mountain, especially between the churches, is refreshing and gives the chance to see rural life, the city, forest and unbelievably beautiful landscape intersected by farmlands and farmers trails. It is from here that Menelik II and Queen Taitu conceived the establishment of Addis Ababa. You can get a sense of the city plan by viewing the city from here.

Addis Ababa University is the largest and the oldest university in Ethiopia. It was originally named "University College of Addis Ababa" at its founding, then renamed for the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I in 1962, receiving its current name in 1975. Although the university has six of its seven campuses within Addis Ababa (the seventh is located in Bishoftu, about 45 kilometres away), it also maintains branches in many cities throughout Ethiopia, leading to the claim of being "the largest university in Africa."
The government assigns qualified students to these universities upon completion of secondary school. Students also attend other private colleges, such as Unity College. Addis Ababa University was founded in 1950 at the request of Haile Selassie by a Canadian Jesuit, Dr Lucien Matte as a two-year college, and began operations the next year. Over the following two years an affiliation with the University of London was developed.
There is also Theological College of the Holy Trinity, a theological school of higher education located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It provides religious and secular education to both clergy and lay members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, as well seeking to be a centre of theological and ecclesiastical study for all Oriental Orthodox Churches as well.
Founded as a high school by Emperor Haile Selassie in 1942, the college division was added in 5 October 1960, and the elementary education section eliminated on 18 December 1961 and the college became one of the chartered units of this first National University of Ethiopia.

Many expatriates work in NGOs and small start-up IT companies.
Compared to other African cities, Addis Ababa has a high number of big, medium and small computer training schools, governmental and private learning institutions. Many students who attend there hope to land an IT or consulting job in the city's very tight job market.
Fabric for sale in the Mercato
The mercato. M-Sa. (Italian for market, as the main covered market still in use dates from the colonial administration of the late 1930s) is the largest outdoor market in the world, and you can get anything from tourist goods (t-shirts, wood crafts, etc.) to fabric to metal goods there. Haggling and bargaining are standard procedure, and foreigners (especially those of European ancestry) should expect to be charged higher prices. To ensure a positive experience, maintain a sense of humour, don't be afraid to negotiate aggressively, and above all don't let yourself be bullied by the many "brokers" who frequent the market, and will try to steer you towards certain stores in exchange for a kick-back from the merchant. You will be able to negotiate lower prices if you can avoid brokers, and especially if you have a local friend or guide to buy things on your behalf.
Shiromeda Market (Between Sidist Kilo & Mt Entoto). If the madness of Mercato isn't for you, Chiromeda is a pleasant alternative. Haggling and bargaining is still the status quo, but you could walk away with a traditional dress from as cheap as 100 birr.

Ethiopia operates a cash economy. Domestic credit cards are non-existent, and international cards are accepted in very few locations (mostly those catering to expatriates).
ATMs/cash machines are found throughout Addis Ababa. Dashen Bank is a principal member of both VISA and MasterCard International and has ATMs. Some of the ATMs found at D.H. Geda Tower (next to Friendship City Center) accept Visa and MasterCard, Dembel City Centre (quite hidden, use the main entrance, than to the left, at the window), Edna Mall, in some hotels (Hilton, Sheraton, Intercontinental, Wabi Shebelle Hotel, Ethiopia Hotel, Semein Hotel, Harmony Hotel). Also near the National Museum (Lucy Gazebo Restaurant), ground floor of Getu Commercial centre just at the entrance and some branches of Dashen Bank.

Warning: Some ATM machines are targeted for "skimmer" scams, allowing thieves to steal your ATM card information. To protect yourself, the safest ATMs to use are the ones located at the Hilton (Dashen, Zemen, CBE); Radisson Blu (Dashen, Zemen, Wegagen); or Sheraton (Dashen) hotels.
There is an illegal black market where you can get a slightly better rate, especially if you bargain. Check your money very carefully before you leave and do not allow it to leave your hand after your final count. Most souvenir shops off Churchill Rd and Zambia St do it.
Food is generally cheap. Make sure you try the national dish injera at least once, since there is no other food like it. It is a yeast-risen flat bread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. It is traditionally made out of teff flour. In making injera, teff flour is mixed with water and allowed to ferment for several days, as with sourdough starter. As a result of this process, injera has a mildly sour taste. It's what the locals eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Most ordinary Ethiopian restaurants have it, and a serving for 2 people with free refills can be as cheap as 15 birr.
This page uses the following price ranges for a typical meal for one, including soft drink:
Addis has hundreds of cake and coffee cafes. They sell various coffees, tea - black unless you ask for "machiatto" - and sometimes fruit juices. There are also juice beits. The cafes along Bole Road and around the Piassa area are of a high standard and relatively inexpensive. Most are very similar to each other.
Most cafes serve the common drink called 'sprice juice' (fruit pulp served in layers in a glass). There are usually three layers from a selection of avocado, mango, papaya, banana, guava etc. The juice is eaten with a spoon. It is colourful and tastes delicious. Single fruit juices are also great, such as orange, papaya, mango, and pineapple - beautifully fresh. 7 birr up to 25 birr in Hilton.
Purple Cafe (City Cafe on Bole), Africa Ave. has delicious cakes and pastries as well as high quality Ethiopian espresso coffees or machiattos. You can sit on the porch and watch the activity on one of the main roads in Addis.

Police officer on a light rail train
Addis is safer than most cities in Africa. Gang violence and similar serious activities are unusual. However, you may encounter some pick-pockets and con-artists around and inside Bole Airport, Mercato, Piazza and many other areas. Keep your belongings close, and pay attention to your surroundings. A common tactic is to show you a tray of things to buy with one hand and to try your pocket with the other. The good news is most of these pick-pockets are unarmed and young boys. If they know that you are aware of what they are up to, they may get intimidated and go away. However, some can be quite persistent and even involve older boys.
Watch out for the spitting scam which happens in Piazza area. Typically it involves someone "accidentally" spitting on you, offering a handkerchief / tissue to clean it up, trying your pockets while you are distracted by this "accident" and then jumping into a companion's car with your belongings.
Someone might also grab your arm and act crazy pretending to kick you as a distraction while his accomplice tries your pockets.
As most Ethiopians are very welcoming, there is an infamous scam where young locals "befriend" tourists and invite them over after a nice day together to celebrate a "special holiday". You will get fed a lot of khat leaves, a chewing drug, and have a good time with them, but in the end you will be asked for a tremendous amount of money for the khat as they claim it is a "special" quality. Be aware of too friendly locals and ask if there is a price to anything, even if they claim you are invited.
Be aware of your belongings on Line Taxis: They usually get very crowded – keep your wallet/phone/bag close to you.
The major and important roads and areas are patrolled by the 'Federal Police' or, as the city residents refer them Federal. They have a reputation of being merciless with suspected criminals. In contrast, the Addis-Ababa city police, who most of the time patrol the less important city streets, markets and neighborhoods are more tolerant and less respected police officers.
For all emergencies ☏ 911. In Addis, major streets are generally safe at night.
Unlike in other African cities, in Addis-Ababa, police officers never approach foreigners to ask them to present a passport, ID or "legal" papers. Once you show your passport at the airport, you are free to move around pretty much anywhere. The only time you need your passport or ID is for hotel reservation and other similar and few instances. However, it is important to have your ID with you at all times.
Watch what you drink or you can fall sick. It is important to remember to only drink bottled water. There are many brands to choose from; always check the plastic seal on all bottles before paying any vendor. Visitors are warned against eating vegetables such as those in salads that may have been washed in water. Try limiting fruits and vegetables to those you peel yourself such as oranges, mangos, etc.
Pollution. Addis Ababa is badly polluted because of badly maintained diesel vehicles and dust. If you have any sensitivity to this, it is worth wearing a dust mask as is popular in many Asian countries.
Be prepared for culture shock. If you take photos of the people, ask first and offer to show them their picture if you have a digital camera with a display screen. Children enjoy seeing their pictures a lot of the time.
Overwhelmed. Many first time visitors may feel overwhelmed if they have not experienced this type of culture difference before. Be polite but not intrusive. It is OK to ask questions of the locals, but you should be prepared to be hassled a lot of the time, especially if you are white. Additionally, for foreigners who are black, it may be possibly to "blend in", precautions are in order (depending where you are, in Addis on Bole road they are used to seeing foreigners compared to the countryside). If you prepare yourself before arrival, you will be better able to cope.

Ethiopia uses a GSM network operated by Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation. There is decent coverage around big cities such as Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, Bahir Dar, Debre Markos, Dese, Gonder, Harar, Mekele, and Nekemete. It is expanding into most small cities.
Roaming charges are very steep. your best option for mobile access is to buy a local SIM card.
An easy option is to buy a SIM card, at 30 birr (June 2019). Ask a cell phone retailer or better still an Ethiotel shop. Be prepared: you will need a passport-sized picture and a photocopy of your passport that the seller will keep. The SIM card has to be registered before it will work properly. The registration can take 24 hours to be completed by the network. The SIM card will need to be cut to size as they are supplied as mini SIM's. Cutting will cost 20 birr in a shop. The Ethiotel service is not 100% reliable. Monthly internet bundles are available - 1GB for 100 birr. Dial *999# and follow the prompts to subscribe. For internet access, the APN is etc.com
In Addis Ababa, especially in Bole Subcity, you can find quite a number of internet cafes. Some still use dial-up connections, but broadband is becoming more popular. Most of the high-end hotels have internet connections (either Ethernet or Wi-Fi), which are reasonably fast and often free for hotel guests.
A general problem with the Internet in Ethiopia is the unstable international high-speed connection. If it is not working, even broadband cafes only deliver dial-up speeds and less. The local definition of highspeed broadband is 128Kb! Another general problem is the shortage of electricity, forcing daytime blackouts of whole areas 1–2 days a week, so it is good to plan ahead where you are going for internet access.
Skype and VoIP service are legal in Ethiopia. According to local press, Ethiopia today has the fourth worst internet in the world.

TG Business Center, Bole, from Airport (big roundabout) to the right, junction with Cameroon Rd (locally known as "Bole-Tele") has broadband but only 3 seats. Most of the time it is not crowded, so a good connection can be expected.
DMG Internet Center, near Edna Mall next to Kaldi's Cafe just off Djibuti St (the road leading from Tele Bole towards 22), has broadband connection and 11 terminals. 2 MB speed Internet, which translates to pretty decent speed for the country. Open M–Sa 08:30–20:00.
3G Internet services (known as WCDMA or UMTS) are available in many parts of Addis Ababa. A special SIM card and capable phone is needed. Price is  birr per 100 KB. CDMA is also available, which needs special devices (prices around  birr per minute, around 128 kbit/s). EV-DO requires a USB device and is faster than CDMA but requires monthly payment of 500 birr for 2 GB data plan. CDMA and EV-DO are also available in all regional and most zonal capitals in Ethiopia.
