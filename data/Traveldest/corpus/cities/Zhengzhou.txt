Zhengzhoudead link (郑州 Zhèngzhōu) is a city on the south bank of Yellow River (Huang He) in China. It is the capital of Henan Province. Zhengzhou is a convenient starting point to explore a series of Chinese cultural sites, like Kaifeng, Luoyang and Shaolin Temple.
ZhengzhouThe name Zhengzhou comes from a city in the Sui Dynasty, but its actual location was in modern day Chenggao. During the Tang Dynasty, the name switched here. The area remained an unimportant backwater until it was selected for development by the Chinese Government after 1949. Zhengzhou is now a major transportation hub in the center of the country, and a rapidly growing city.
Zhengzhou City is located in the north-central part of Henan Province, where the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River divide.
By the end of 2022, the resident population of Zhengzhou City was  million.
According to the division of "Shangshu - Yugong", Zhengzhou belonged to the "domain of Yuzhou" among the nine states in the ancient times.
China's second slave dynasty, the Shang Dynasty, established its capital in Zhengzhou more than 3,600 years ago as the founding capital, Bo Du.
During the Ming Dynasty, a reform of the nation's local establishment was carried out, with the introduction of a three-tier system of provinces, prefectures (directly subordinate prefectures) and counties, and the Guancheng County was transferred to Zhengzhou. At that time, Zhengzhou still had four counties, Xingyang, Xingze, Heyin, and Sishui, but they were subordinate prefectures (county-level). Together with Zhongmou, Xinzheng and Mi counties, it was subordinate to Kaifeng Prefecture.
In October 1948, after the liberation of Zhengzhou by the Central Plains Field Army, Zhengzhou City was established in the urban area of Zhengxian County, directly under the leadership of Henan Province.
In 1954, Zhengzhou City became the capital of Henan Province.
Zhengzhou City is a national transport hub for railway, aviation and mail. As of September 2023, Zhengzhou has 2 terminals, 2 runways, 162 air routes, 6 railway stations, 2 main railway lines, 6 high-speed railway lines, 9 metro lines, 11 motorways, and 37 BRT lines.
Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport (CGO IATA 郑州新郑国际机场) (about 30 km outside of town). It has one terminal, confusingly named Terminal 2. Terminal 1 is the old terminal that has been closed.
An airport shuttle bus leaves from Zhengzhou Hotel, centrally located and costs ¥15.
A public bus runs from the airport to the Aviation Hotel (民航酒店 Mínháng Jiǔdiàn) on Jinshui Road (金水路 Jīnshuǐ Lù). It costs ¥25.
Taxis to the airport will cost around ¥120-140. While the distance implies it should only be ¥60, you're charged for the round trip driving. Bargaining seldom helps as locals pay this price as well.
The airport is now served by the Zhengzhou Metro Line 2's Chengjiao (Suburban) extension. The first and last trains depart at 06:30 and 20:00 respectively. Additionally, mainline rail service connects the airport to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng (mostly to Zhengzhou East Station), at intervals fluctuating between approximately 30–60 minutes.
Zhengzhou is China's biggest train hub; you can get here from nearly every major metropolitian area in China. There are several arrivals each day from Beijing (about 11 hours, or 5½ hours by high-speed rail), Guangzhou (about 18 hours), Xi'an (about 5 hours, or 2 hours by high-speed rail) and Shanghai (about 14 hours, or 6 hours by high speed rail). Trains arrive from other places less often. The Hanoi to Beijing train also stops here.
Be sure to clarify which of the two stations your train will arrive at or depart from:
Zhengzhou Station (郑州站) (in the main city centre). Serves all regular and some high-speed trains.
Zhengzhou East Station (郑州东站) (on the east side of town in the Zhengzhou New Area). Exclusively serves high-speed trains. 45 min by metro from Erqi Square (二七广场).
Zhengzhou Hangkonggang railway station (郑州航空港火车站), Zhongmou County Airport District 107 National Road Po Liu Village, ☏ +86 37112306, toll-free: +86 37112306. Zhengzhou Airport Station is in the middle of Zhengzhou Airport Economic Comprehensive Experimental Zone. (updated Sep 2023)
Across from the train station, you will find a long-distance bus station. Buses arrive regularly from almost anywhere in Henan province. Buses may be less comfortable than the trains, but are cheaper and you do not have to push and shove your way in and out of the train. You are guaranteed a seat but sometimes buses wait to fill up, rather than leaving at a set time, and be aware that long-distance buses may be sleepers rather than seated if the trip is very long.
The city's focal point is Erqi (February 7) Square (二七广场). This large public square comes alive at night, when an entire market fills the space with vendors and locals hanging out. From the square, several main streets fan out to different areas of the city.
Since Zhengzhou was handpicked to serve as a transportation hub - and does not have a very long history as a large city - the urban planning is more noticeable here than in other places of China. This means there is plenty of green space, tree-lined streets and logical arrangement to the city.
Zhengzhou is relatively spread out, but most sites are accessible by public bus, which costs ¥1 or ¥2 per ride - depending on whether or not there is air-conditioning, those with A/C being more expensive but usually less crowded.
Taxi fares begin at ¥8 in the day, and ¥10 late at night (after 22:00), with each kilometer after the second costing ¥. All taxis are metered but sometimes the drivers will try to cheat foreigners.
Local taxis and private car owners often ask '走不走'(Pinyin: zōu bǔ zōu, 'Going or not?') to solicit passengers.
The Metro system has seven lines in operation:
Line 1 runs east-west that connects Zhengzhou Station, Zhengzhou East Station and a few other points of interest.
Line 2 is a north-south route, and runs to Nansihuan (with through services to Zhengzhou International Airport on the Chengjiao line). You can transfer to Line 1 at Zijingshan (紫荊山) station.
Line 3 is an L-shaped line connecting the northwest with the southeast. It runs south from the Henan Sports Center in the southern part of Huiji District and then turns east after reaching Erqi Square before eventually reaching Henan Orthopaedics Hospital in Guancheng District.
Line 4 is another L-shaped line running from northwest to southeast. It begins at Laoyachen in Huiji District, intersects with Line 3 at the Henan Sports Center, then continues east until it reaches Dragon Lake, whereupon it turns south and heads toward Langzhuang in central Guancheng.
Line 5 functions as a loop line around the city center.
Line 14 serves the CBD area to the west of the city, though as of January 2021, only 3 stations have opened.
Chengjiao line is a suburban metro line, starting from Nansihuan in Guancheng and ending in Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport. There are through services through Line 2. The southern extension of Chengjiao line to Zhengzhou South Railway Station is expected to open in 2023.
On most lines, the first train leaves each terminus at 06:00 and the last at about 23:00. However, on the Chengjiao line, trains stop running at 22:00, and on Line 14, the trains only operate from 08:00 to 20:00.
Fares are calculated by distance traveled, ranging from ¥2 (within 6 km) to ¥9. A journey shorter than 6 km costs ¥2; ¥1 is charged for every 7 km after 6 km, every 8 km after 13 km, and every 9 km after 21 km. Children under 130 cm may ride for free when accompanied by an adult. Single journey tickets can be bought from ticket vending machines at every station.

The museum is one of the three key museums in China along with one in Beijing. If you are into modern art, this is not the place for you. It generally has acceptable squat toilets on the first floor. There is an English audio tour you can rent, and there are cheapish lockers to store your stuff.

If you generally enjoy zoos, you may very well walk away sad at how the animals are cared for, or not in this case. Entry fee is ¥30, cable car tickets are ¥10 one-way.
There's relatively few things to do in Zhengzhou but a possible evening might involve eating at a Sichuan or Henanese restaurant, buying yourself a bottle of decent Dynasty wine, parleying with the local clientele, getting lazy, and rounding off the evening at a KTV bar.
Museum Area. One thing worth knowing about is that the museum area is also the area of the 2 branches of government - federal and communist - so the area is much nicer. We are talking trees and some flowers along with a more neighborhood feel that might remind you of Shanghai. Do not expect wild nightclubs, but it is a more pleasant place to be if you are looking for a walk. Erqilou is fine, but a bit dirty, so see this other side of Zhengzhou if you get a chance. Also, some nice places to eat are in this area.
Century Fun Park (郑州世纪欢乐园), 1 Shihua Road, Guancheng Hui District (管城回族区石化路1号) (20-30 minutes away from Er Qi Square; about  km north of Qili River Station on Metro Line 5; bus routes 321, b15, s126, and s163), ☏ +86 371 63282288. 09:00-17:30 (March 15th-October 14th), 09:30-17:30 (October 15th-March 14th), 17:00-22:00 (extended opening hours on select days).

Zhengzhou Fonte Happy World, People's humanities road (intersection of Zhengkai Avenue and Humanities Road). This is a cultural and technological theme park featuring science fiction and interactive experience. $39.
Large department stores and international brands tend to be concentrated around Erqi (February 7) Square. The two major department stores are Kingbird (金博大) and Beijing Hualien (北京华联), which are next to each other. Both stores have supermarkets in their basements.
Some of the most interesting gifts can be purchased at the city's antique market. Most of the shop owners will have a calculator handy so you can bargain by typing in prices. Consider that you got a good deal if you pay half of what they originally quoted. The people are friendly but many of the shops sell fake antiques made to look old. Nevertheless there are interesting items that will decorate your walls or look great on a stand back at home. You can even impress your friends by telling them you bought them an antique from China.
Some of the small shops sell real antiquities. You'll know when you're buying one because the prices will rise dramatically from about ¥100 or less for fake goods to well over ¥5,000 for the real deal.
China will not let foreigners take antiques out of the country that are over 200 years old or possibly even more recent items depending on their cultural value.
Make sure you know where your wallet is at all times. There are some unsavory characters in the markets. This is, in fact, true of Zhengzhou in general, which has a reputation for pickpockets. Buses are especially risky. Keep your wallet in your front pocket.

Zhengzhou has a diverse array of fine Chinese cuisine. Its location at China's center means you can find almost any type of Chinese food here. The city is big enough to have a scattering of cosmopolitan restaurants, and while there are a number of imitation Korean, Japanese, Indian, and Western options about, you will do best to stick with Chinese food.
One of the most representative delicacies in Zhengzhou, braised noodles.
Zhengzhou braised noodles are made from high-quality fresh lamb and lamb bones. After soaking, the bones and meat are boiled together over high heat to form a white soup, and then flour is mixed to form a soft noodle. After repeated kneading, the noodles are manually pulled into strips of varying widths and thicknesses and placed in the pot. The lamb is then paired with yellow cauliflower, black fungus, and vermicelli. When dining, small dishes such as coriander, chili oil, and sugar garlic are added to make the taste more fresh.
There is the usual assortment of dumpling shops and noodle joints on every street and back alley.
There is a good number of Sichuan restaurants, which makes sense considering the proximity to the Province of Spice.
You should not miss a special breakfast in Zhengzhou (hulatang), it is a special soup, a little spicy. You better go to Shunhelu where you will find the best hulatang in town.
Noodles, especially the mutton noodle (羊肉烩面 yangrouhuimian) and beef noodle (牛肉拉面 niuroulamian) are must-eat in Zhengzhou. There are three good yangrouhuimian restaurants with many locations, ask a taxi driver to take you the nearest one, and you will taste the best delicilous huimian in Zhengzhou:
Other cheap eating places include:
Night market in Erqi (February 7) Square. A good place for a snack and scenery.
Some of the finest Chinese restaurants are located on Jingsan Road (经三路). To find these restaurants, ask a taxi driver to take you to Xiaonanguo Restaurant and just look around. You will find a number of options about:
Xiaonanguo (小南国), 经三路北16号. Excellent restaurant featuring regional dishes from all over China.
Tudali (near the corner of Wenhua Road and Huanghe Road). Korean-style restaurant and bar. If you have an affinity for soju, this is the place for you.
Muslim halal food is available all throughout Zhengzhou, with the banner on the entrance board saying Mata'am al muslimeen (Restaurant of the muslims) in Arabic. The food tastes delicious. Once you go and eat at these restaurants you just feel like coming back again, especially those yangrou chuars (lamb kababs) taste yummy:
Muslim Restaurant, Erqi Square (Near the mosque and Beijing Hualian Mall).
Crowne Plaza. A good place for Western cuisine with an Italian restaurant and a Western-style pub. It offers a buffet during dinner including Brazilian Rodizio and a dessert bar. There is also a smattering of pizza and pasta joints called Cappuccino around the city.

Each plate is a small portion but overall the set meals are a great deal, for ¥75-200 you get many plates of very good food. Make sure to ask for the dishes to come one at a time for the best dining experience.
Toscana Cafe, Weilai Road at Wei Wu Road, Jin Jiang Garden, ☏ +86 371 - 65628899. 11:00-23:00. A very good Italian-style restaurant in North-eastern Zhengzhou. Considering the owner and staff have never been outside of Zhengzhou or China, it is pretty decent food, and not badly priced. Lasagna noodles are made in house and they have an American chef to try to help them become "more authentic". He updated the Caesar Salad dressing, and it is well worth a try! ¥40-200.
There are bars around the city, but the best area for drinking is around the tree-lined Weiyi Road:
Target Pub, On the southernmost block of Jingliu Road (经六路) near the corner of Weiyi Road (纬一路). Old ex-pat favorite. Lao Wang, who speaks great English, is the proprietor of this staple Zhengzhou dive bar.
Helen's, Just north of Target across the street. ¥6 Tsingtao for foreigners, popular
Tao Bar, Near the corner of Jinshui Lu and Jingqi Lu. A lively new bar opened near the corner Jinshui Lu and Jing Qi Lu.
Bird Bar, On Jing Qi Lu, a ways off Jinshui Lu, the main road. A small bar on Jing qi Lu. Laid-back mood, fooseball, etc.
Western Pub, Nongye Road (to the right of the Henan Provincial Museum). For an unusual drinking experience, consider this pub, located in a bunker-like concrete building. This place features a cabaret-style show with a mix of song, dance, and jokes. Unless you understand Chinese, it will be mostly incomprehensible, yet the experience will give you insight into Chinese drinking culture. The place is noisy, smoky, crowded, and occasionally bizarre. You can order half-a-dozen or so bottles of beer by the bucket. Try to get there early, around 19:00, as the show ends around 22:00 or 23:00. This building also houses one of Zhengzhou's movie theaters.
Zhengzhou is not a major backpacker stop, so there are few cheap lodgings in the city. That said, there are some hotels that offer real value for money if you are more than two people. As with most Chinese cities, there are several a bit run down hotels to be found near the train station. These might be your cheapest options. Most likely English is not spoken but you can get a room for ¥50 or even cheaper if there are two people splitting a bill for a double room. Bargain, especially if you are staying more than one night.

Kaifeng is a laid-back town about 90 minutes to the east of Zhengzhou. Enjoy ancient temples and an escape from Chinese skyscrapers. Sizeable night market comes to life in the evenings too. Kaifeng was the capital of several dynasties before it slid into irrelevance the last 200 years. Buses leave every half hour from Zhengzhou central bus station (90 min). Alternatively, there are quite a few trains in the morning and evening to Kaifeng station (45 min) from Zhengzhou station. High speed trains depart half hourly to Songchenglu station from Zhengzhou East.
Another great city nearby by is the ancient capital of Luoyang, home to the Longmen Grottoes. The city is worth a look, with an interesting old section and easy walking downtown. It's about three hours by bus, which leave Zhengzhou every hour or so. An express - the "elephant bus" or kuai che - costs ¥40. One train in the morning departs from Zhengzhou station straight to Luoyang Longmen station (45 min) very close to the grottoes.
Yuzhou is a small and relatively undeveloped city, off the main rail network, but well worth a visit to see the Jun Royal Kiln Museum and to get an insight into life in Henan off the tourist trail. One and a half hours by bus, and very walkable once you get there.
