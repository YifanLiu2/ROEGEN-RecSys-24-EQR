Banyan Tree - On the grounds of the Edison and Ford Winter Estates
Fort Myers is a booming town with great weather, entertainment and a casual feel in Southwest Florida. It was the winter home of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, and it remains a popular spot for "snowbirds" from northern states.
According to a handbook authored by Francis Asbury Hendry who lived from 1833–1917, Fort Myers first appears in about 1841 when it was first manned as Fort Harvey. The military fort was abandoned in 1842 then re-established in 1850 and named in honor of a U.S. Army officer named Abraham C. Myers, a Colonel. The fort was a center for command and control operations during war against the native Indian tribes that lived in Florida until they were defeated and relocated out of the state to regions of western United States. However, some of the Seminole Indian tribe never surrendered and remained in the Florida wilderness. Colonel Myers reportedly resigned his commission and joined the Confederate army when the Civil War started. Under Confederate control, African slaves were transported to the area from Virginia to support cultivation of crops.
During the Civil War, the fort changed hands between forces of the North and South once or twice more. An African-American Infantry of Union soldiers was stationed in Fort Myers during the period of 1863 to 1864. Under the authority of Monroe County, the first school for African-Americans in the area was formed near Fort Myers on the property an emancipated slave by the name of Nelson Tillis in 1885. Although Thomas Edison operated telegraph services for the northern side of the Civil War, in 1886, Edison purchased a winter home in Fort Myers after marrying his second wife earlier that year (National Park Service, 2012). In 1890, the first female African-American school teacher (Annie Moore) was hired to teach in the area (Lee County Black History Society, 2011).
A county entitled Lee County, named so in honor of the southern commanding General, Robert E. Lee was established in 1887. By about 1908, the population of Fort Myers was approximately five to six thousand (Captain F.A. Hendry Reunion Committee, 2002). In 1912 the first local Black population only public school was established in Lee County (Williams Academy). Henry Ford bought the home and land next door to Thomas Edison in 1916. In 1920 the Jones-Walker Hospital was opened for the Black population only. Bunche Beach was dedicated as the first local beach intended for the Black population only in 1949. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled to end segregation in public schools. However, this decision was not implemented by integrating local Lee County schools until 1969. The Williams Academy was relocated to Clemente Park located in the Dunbar section of Fort Myers in 1995 and is the primary center for African-American history in Lee County. The museum and administrative offices are established at 1936 Henderson Avenue (Lee County Black History Society, 2011).

Peak hurricane season is August through October, with hurricanes possible as early as June and as late as the end of November. Fort Myers has significant experience with hurricanes, as a damaging event happens every few years. In August 2004, Fort Myers was sideswiped by Hurricane Charley, a category 4 hurricane that made landfall north of the area. In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma struck south of Naples, but caused extensive damage nonetheless in Fort Myers and its southern suburbs. In October 2018, there was Hurricane Michael. In September 2022, Hurricane Ian destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, especially in Fort Myers Beach. Travelers should be prepared to leave early and as soon as evacuations are planned.

While Fort Myers is mostly safe, there are a few scattered neighborhoods, especially east and southeast of downtown, where it is wise to use a bit of caution, especially at night. The most reliable method of identifying what portions of the area are least safe is to consult the Lee County Sheriff Department. They provide Web services that graphically depict all of the high crime areas. Visitors will find that opinions not supported by statistics from the Lee County Chamber of Commerce or, Lee County Sheriff Department may not be based in fact. The Lee County Sheriff Department web-site address is:
Fort Myers Florida Weekly – local version of a weekly newspaper published in several Florida cities. Includes extensive information about upcoming local events. Available for free at newspaper racks downtown.
The News-Press – daily local newspaper, available at some supermarkets.
Cape Coral, the wealthier town right across the river
Everglades National Park – the most popular parts of the park are easier to get to from Miami than from Fort Myers, but Shark Valley and the islands near Everglades City are within day-trip distance.
