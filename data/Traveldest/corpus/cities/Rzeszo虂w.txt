Rzeszów (ˈʒɛʃuf; Ukrainian: Ряшів, Riashiv) is the capital city of Subcarpathian Voivodeship in the south east of Poland and has almost 200,000 inhabitants (2021). It was a private town of the Lubomirski family for centuries. It has a fine old town, two synagogues and some castles.
The oldest written records of Rzeszów date back to 1354, when the place was granted city rights. The Lubomirski family, the owners of the town, were patrons of culture, arts and science. Under their reign Rzeszów developed quickly and its role and position in the region noticeably increased. Since then, the town has been a meeting point of many European nations from the Byzantine East and Mediterranean West and people from the southern and northern parts of Europe. It is a great example of how a young, vibrant and dynamically developing city is adapted to its historical heritage.

Rzeszów is a rather safe place for travellers. You should be aware of pickpocketing like in any other city. Use your mind and do not start an argument with young, bald men dressed in sweatshirts. Try to not present your liking to football or speedway clubs, since there is an eternal struggle between hooligans sympathising with competing teams. Do not buy 'occasional bargains' from guys wandering around parking places (they sell shoddy stuff, like binoculars). Of course, this is a general remark for whole Poland and nothing makes Rzeszów more dangerous than any other city in the country.
Łańcut is practically a suburb and well worth a visit. It is located 17 km from Rzeszów and is easy accessible by coaches or trains.
Further afield are Jarosław and the city of Przemyśl (both are also accessible by train and coaches).
Rzeszów is in the middle between the two cultural hubs Kraków and Lviv.
If you feel like hiking, head to the Bieszczady range south of Rzeszów.
