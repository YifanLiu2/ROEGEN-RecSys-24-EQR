Ponta Delgada is the largest city in the Azores archipelago. It is on the island of São Miguel, and was home to 67,000 people in 2021. It is an important administrative, industrial and agricultural centre, and the home of the University of the Azores.
Ponta Delgada (POHN-tuh dehl-GAH-duh, /ˈpõ.tɐ dɛɫ.ˈga.dɐ/), the city on São Miguel island, is not to be confused with Ponta Delgada, the rural civil parish on the north coast of Flores island.
Ponta Delgada has a mild maritime climate: warm summers, with moderate precipitation, and mild, wet winters. Much like the rest of the Azores, the city is shaped by the Gulf Stream, and consequently has a narrow temperature variation. Mean temperatures vary between  °C ( °F) in the winter to around 22 °C (72 °F) in the summer and daytime highs vary between 17 °C (63 °F) in the winter to 25 °C (77 °F) in the summer. Temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F), or below 4 °C (39 °F) have never been registered.
The Gulf Stream also contributes to unstable weather that varies greatly during autumn and spring, making weather forecasting on a daily basis difficult. Winters are generally milder and summers are generally humid when compared to those of continental Portugal.
