Myrtle Beach is a major tourist destination and the central focus of the Grand Strand coast of South Carolina. It is widely known for its wide beaches, numerous golf courses, seafood restaurants, and outlet-style shopping, as well as one of the highest concentrations of miniature golf courses you'll find anywhere. A popular spring break destination, Myrtle Beach is heavily developed and crowded, in contrast to other Southern beaches, such as the Outer Banks in North Carolina, and attracts a lot of tourists from other Southern states or "Snowbirds" from the North, who may own a condominium or timeshare along the coast.
Myrtle Beach's rapidly growing skyline
Myrtle Beach International Airport (MYR IATA), 1100 Jetport Road. Most guests arriving from either the west coast or overseas fly into a major hub, such as Atlanta or Charlotte before connecting to their final destination in Myrtle Beach. The busiest routes to MYR are from Atlanta (Delta) and Charlotte (American), with several flights each day. Spirit Airlines offers regular flights from New York (LaGuardia) and Boston, among other destinations. American Airlines and United Airlines each have one daily flight from their hubs in Dallas and Newark respectively. There are summer seasonal flights from Toronto on Porter Airlines. Taxi from the airport to the resort area costs about $15.
Grand Strand Regional Airport (in North Myrtle Beach). Serves the area and is used mostly by private or chartered flights.
Myrtle Beach sits at the intersection of US 17, which runs along the coast of the Carolinas, and US 501, which travels inland. From Interstate 95 South, take US 501 south for 66 miles.
There is no direct rail service to Myrtle Beach. The closest passenger stations are in Dillon, North Charleston, Florence and Kingstree, which are served by Amtrak's Silver Service and Palmetto trains.
Florence, SC is the closest station but it is about 70 miles away from Myrtle Beach, so the best option is to arrange a limousine, or a shuttle or bus service for the final hour or two ride to the beach.
One aspect of Myrtle Beach that is less-than hospitable are its roads. A tourist may find the style of driving in Myrtle Beach to be aggressive, reckless and hard to manage. Myrtle Beach has one of the highest accident rates in the state, due in part to its impatient drivers and oddly-placed roads.
If you must drive, plan ahead - if you are going a short distance (under five miles), then take one of the main roads that runs adjacent to the beach. If you are going a longer distance, try and take one of the interstate roads that branches further out - these are generally clear of traffic, and thus are much more bearable than the city roads.
There are several car rental companies located in Myrtle Beach, including Alamo Rent-a-Car, National Car Rental, Avis Rent-a-Car, and Budget Car Rental.
Coast RTA is the bus system for the Myrtle Beach area. Routes run along major thoroughfares and to and from neighboring towns. Service hours are quite limited. Schedules are available at all Myrtle Beach Area Conventions and Visitors Bureau offices. Fares are $ adults, $ students, $ children.
Another alternative for those without cars are charter buses. Coach buses are cost-effective for large groups of people who want to relax and enjoy personal service, and travel locally as well as out of state. Reservations for charter buses are best made a few weeks in advance and prices are determined by the location of the destination.
There are several private cab services in the area which can run up to $50 for a trip across the Grand Strand.
The rate is $ a mile $1 for extra passenger, rates are set by the City of Myrtle Beach.

The namesake of Myrtle Beach is, of course, the beach. During the high season the beach can be crowded and parking scarce. Staying at a beachfront hotel or within walking distance can make for a more pleasant visit. For those on a budget, however, don't fret - the beach is still public, although you may have to fight for a spot during the day. Never underestimate the beauty of the shoreline at sunrise, when the sands are basically abandoned, the temperature modest, and the seashells from the night before have yet to be picked.

One of the main reasons many people come to Myrtle Beach is the many golf courses in the area, of which there are so many that Myrtle Beach can rightfully be (and has been) called the golf capital of the world. Most of the courses in Myrtle Beach are available to be played as part of a package deal with other courses, lodging, and meals. It is usually much less expensive to play, eat and stay in Myrtle Beach if you take advantage of this option.

The colorful signage of North Ocean Boulevard
Kings Highway, the main road through town, is lined with many discount beachwear stores. Be warned though: the prices they advertise on the signs out front are often flat-out false.
