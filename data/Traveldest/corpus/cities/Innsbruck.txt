Innsbruck is the fifth-largest city in Austria and the provincial capital of Tyrol, as well as one of the largest cities in the Alps. It is in a valley of the river Inn between mountain ranges of above 2000 m above sea level, halfway between Bavaria and northern Italy, and is a hub of a region popular for skiing and other mountain-related activities and a busy tourist destination. Its popularity as a winter sports resort was underscored by its hosting the Winter Olympic Games twice.
Innsbruck offers the traveler an intriguing mix of contemporary and imperialist history, culture and architecture with a variety of architectural styles waiting to be discovered in every street.
The first mention of Innsbruck was during the reign of Augustus, when the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at the locality named Oeni Pontum or Oeni Pons, which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), the important crossing point over the Inn river, to protect Via Claudia Augusta, the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg.
Innsbruck became the capital of Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as emperor Maximilian I moved the imperial court to Innsbruck in the 1490s. Many old buildings from the Middle Ages and modern times survived in the heart of old town.
Snow covered peaks loom over Innsbruck in winter.
The city is well known for its sporting opportunities, especially alpine sports, as it is in the Alps and surrounded by mountains. Innsbruck also hosted the 1964 and 1974 Winter Olympics. Several ski resorts are situated inside the city territory or within short distance. Innsbruck was one of the centers of snowboard boom in the 1990s and the derived distinct subculture endured until today. The population of skateboarders, snowboarders and people alike is therefore above average and nothing unusual to the people. This culture is also celebrated by a lot of events in and around Innsbruck especially in the winter season, attracting (predominantly young) people from all around the world.
There are two universities and several colleges in Innsbruck, with over 30,000 students altogether, making the city's nightlife very lively.
Innsbruck has also become one of Austria's most eco-friendly cities, due to a very good public transport system and a partial ban on cars in certain areas of the historic old town.

International connections offer a budget friendly alternative for train travel, a one way ticket from Munich to Innsbruck with a stop in Garmisch-Partenkirchen costs ca. €11.
Innsbruck is reachable through both of Tyrol's motorways:  Inntalautobahn (A12) and  Brennerautobahn (A13) which intersect in the south of Innsbruck.
During holiday seasons, when Europeans either try to get in or out of Italy over the  Brenner Pass in summer or try to reach or return from ski resorts in winter, heavy traffic should be expected on both motorways particularly during weekends. Snowfall inevitably makes the traffic situation worse, so it is recommended to tune in to Radio Tyrol at  MHz FM for the latest traffic updates.
Innsbruck can be reached on the Inntalradweg from Passau to St. Moritz. Even in the city this bicycle trail is signposted with small green road signs.
Most one-day visitors don't use any transport: all of the major Old Town sites are within a reasonable walking time.
The classic walk into old Innsbruck follows.
From the main station (Hauptbahnhof) to the city center is a relatively short and enjoyable 10 to 15 minute walk. Walk out of the Hauptbahnhof, cross the street at the train station cross walk, turn to your right, and go down to the next street to your left. Walk on this street until Maria-Theresien Strasse, then turn right toward the city center. Taking this street all the way leads to the pedestrian zone and the Golden Roof.
Big parts of the downtown area are declared (fee-based) short-term parking zones. For longer visits, it is highly recommended to park off-site and use public transportation.
Public local traffic (6 tram-lines, and a dense network of buses) is operated by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe and a couple of private operators. All public services are organized in Verkehrsverbund Tirol, which means that tickets are valid in every public transport line (including buses, trams and trains). All buses and trams are modern low-floor vehicles.
Sometimes bus lines are split up into different destinations and so it's important to pay attention to the destination displays (outside and inside) and the spoken announcements. Single-fare tickets are €3 in the city fare zone if paid by the driver or € if purchased at ticket machines. 5-trip tickets are available for € or €, respectively. Regardless of the door you enter, go to the driver and pay, exact change not necessary. daily tickets, weekly tickets and other sorts of tickets are only offered at multi-language ticket machines to be found at many stations. They can also be purchased at the identically looking machines for short-term parking tickets. You must validate the ticket when you get on your first bus or tram. See the website for all available tickets.
The special bus line "TS" ("The Sightseer") connects the major sights like Schloß Ambras, Bergisel and Alpenzoo to downtown. However special fares apply for this line. If you don't plan to visit every museum it might be reasonably cheaper to use the normal 24 hour ticket without this bus.
Two tram lines lead to two villages in the neighbourhood of Innsbruck.
Tram line nr. 6 connects Innsbruck and the mountain village Igls, which is worth a visit. The line passes the uplands with vast forests and gives some spectacular prospects for travellers either on Innsbruck or on the lovely landscape between Aldrans and Igls. It provides stops immediately near Schloß Ambras and the bathing-lake Lansersee (ice skating in Winter is also possible there). The terminus Igls lies within the city fare zone, so no additional ticket is needed.
Tram line STB is 18 km long and connects Innsbruck with several villages in the Stubaital valley. This tram provides also access to Bergisel (Tirol Panorama) at the station Sonneburgerhof. This station is also situated within die city fare zone. In Mutters, Nockhofweg access to an easy skiing area, the Mutteralm, is provided (10 minutes walk). A beautiful hour's ride will take you at least the small town of Fulpmes. The new red liveried trams offer great scenic views on the journey. It is recommended to make a trip around Halloween, when the larch-trees on the Telfer Wiesen have got their best autumn colour.
A suburban train system called S-Bahn with five routes (S1 - S5) connects Innsbruck to villages and towns around the city, from Landeck to Kufstein or Kitzbühel and from Mittenwald to Brenner. Timetables and fares can be found on the VVT website. Inner city VVT tickets are valid between the Hauptbahnhof and  Westbahnhof (west station),  Hötting,  Allerheiligenhöfe, and  Kranebitten.
Cycling is common in Innsbruck and especially popular among students. Innsbruck has some bicycle paths, but they are not very well interlinked within the city. A map of all bicycle ways/lanes is available here. In 2012, Innsbruck was awarded Fahrradhauptstadt (cycling capital) by VCÖ (an Austrian traffic advocacy group).

The Lower Castle is home to armouries featuring numerous masterpieces preserved as evidence of the armourer's art from that era.

The Spanish Hall will be one of the highlights of any visit, located above the Lower Castle and decorated with a wood-inlay ceiling and walls adorned with 27 portraits of historic Tyrol royals. It remains one of the best examples of German Renaissance architecture. As one of Innsbruck's most popular attractions, waiting lines at the entrance are often long.

Patscherkofelbahn. Accessible via bus line J, destination "Patscherkofelbahn" or "Olympiaexpreß" and tram line 6 to Igls.
