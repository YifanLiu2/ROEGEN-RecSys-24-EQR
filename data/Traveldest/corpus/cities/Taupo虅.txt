Taupō, also written Taupo, is a town on the northern shore of Lake Taupo, New Zealand's largest lake, in the central North Island. It is a popular tourist destination due to its lake, boating, trout fishing, geothermal attractions, waterfalls, outdoor activities and proximity to the North Island's highest mountains.
It is built around the lake's outlet into the Waikato River, the country's longest river.

The Lake Taupo area is on a volcanic plateau. The lake, famed for its trout fishing and boating, fills the caldera of one of the largest supervolcanoes in the world, in a still active geological region. About 26,000 years ago, the lake area was a volcano that erupted in an enormous explosion that ejected about 1,200 km3 of material, spreading it over the central North Island and forming the Volcanic Plateau. The resulting depression became Lake Taupo after it filled with water draining off the surrounding hills. It last erupted around 180 CE, reportedly turning the skies over China and Rome red. The prehistoric eruption was VEI-8 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index scale, one of the largest ever. The 180 CE blast was VEI-7, still enormous.
Today, Lake Taupo is New Zealand's largest lake by area, covering 616 km². It feeds the Waikato River, New Zealand's longest, with the water to run eight hydroelectric power stations. After leaving town, the river rushes through the tourist attractions of Huka Falls and Aratiatia Rapids.
Taupō has a temperate climate with distinct seasons, mild summers, cool winters, and regular rainfall. Due to its inland location and relatively high altitude (360 m above sea level), the climate is cooler than in other parts of the North Island and is more akin to the lower half of the South Island.
Taupō and the Waikato River from the air
Taupo Airport (8 km ( mi) south of the town centre), ☏ +64 7 378 7771. Air New Zealand Link operates daily flights from Auckland, and Sounds Air has scheduled flights from Wellington most days. The airport provides for private jets and other aircraft and is the busiest parachute drop zone in New Zealand. (updated Jan 2019)
Intercity offers coach services to Taupō several times a day from throughout the North Island. Adventure travel networks in the form of Kiwi Experience, Stray and Contiki also visit Taupō (daily in summer).
Taupō is at the junction of State Highway 1 (SH 1), which runs the length of the country, and State Highway 5 (SH 5), which runs south-east to Napier and north to Rotorua and Tirau.
Approximate distances and drive times are:
Auckland – 275 km, 4 hr along SH 1 (alternatively, you can leave SH 1 at Pokeno, travel along SH 2 and SH 27 via Matamata and meet back up with SH 1 at Tirau, therefore avoiding Hamilton)
Hamilton – 153 km, 2 hr along SH 1
Rotorua – 81 km, 1 hr along SH 5
Napier – 142 km, 2 hr along SH 5 (there are two electric charging stations en route, but no petrol stations – if you're not driving an EV, check your fuel level before leaving Bay View, on Napier's outskirts)
Wellington – 370 km, 5 hr along SH 1
The urban centre is very compact and is within easy walking distance of most hotels, motels and hostels, as are a number of the more popular activities. To explore further, there are several car rental companies and the popular "Hot Bus" shuttle, which has regular trips to the most popular tourist sites. In addition most activity operators offer a free pick up, drop off service. It is also possible to hire push bikes and motor scooters. Accommodation providers will be able to assist with all transport arrangements.

The rapids in the Waikato River before the Huka Falls
There are many sights of interest in the Taupō region, most of which are free of charge, and you should set a day aside to check out some of the sights. To get around the sights transport is a must: a mountain bike at the very least for people with some fitness or perhaps a rental car or shuttle for those who prefer to relax while on holiday.
Aratiatia Dam, Aratiatia Rd (13km north of Taupō, off SH 5). The first dam in the Waikato Hydro power scheme. The gates are opened daily at 10AM, noon, 2PM and 4PM in summer and 10AM, noon and 2PM in winter, which causes the spectacular recreation of the Aratiatia Rapids.
Huka Falls, Huka Falls Rd. New Zealand’s most visited natural attraction located just to the north of town on the Waikato river. New Zealand’s largest river is forced between a narrow split in the bedrock. Quite impressive with flows often exceeding 220,000 litres per second.
Kinloch. A pretty lakeside village 15 minutes drive west of Taupō.
Lions Walk – A walkway starting in town and heading south for about 5 miles following the lake edge. Paved in places through the efforts of local service clubs.

Being in the heart of the Taupo Volcanic Zone you don't have to travel far to encounter geothermal activity. There are several examples and, though not as heavily marketed or developed as those in nearby Rotorua, they provide a fascinating insight into the fragility of our planet.
The Wairakei steam field, 10 minutes north of town on Wairakei Rd, can be accessed by car and provides an insight into the tapping of the earth's heat for electricity generation. The 175-MW  Wairakei Power Station opened in 1958, the first geothermal plant in New Zealand and only the second commercial-scale geothermal plant in the world. Today, geothermal power stations in New Zealand produce 15 percent of the country's electricity requirements. Further north along State Highway 5 is the newer and smaller, but more prominent,  Ohaaki Power Station. Its 105-metre-tall natural draft cooling tower, like those typically found at nuclear power stations, stands out from the landscape for miles around.
Craters of the Moon, Karapiti Rd, Wairakei (a few minutes drive north of town on Wairakei Rd). Summer 8:30AM-6PM, winter 8:30AM-sunset. An easy 45 min ( km) walk through an active and ever-changing other-worldly geothermal wonderland. Adult $8, child (5–12) $4, family $20. (updated Feb 2016)

A sailing school on Lake Taupo
There is no shortage of activities on offer in Taupō, be it an adrenaline rush or the more sedate. There is something for everyone, from the ever popular bungy, to Taupō being internationally known as a mecca for skydiving, to jet boating, trout fishing, scenic flights, and simple pleasures such as the AC Baths and the one and only Starlight Cinema. Lake Taupo is widely considered to be the rainbow trout capital of the world and the lake's tributaries contain some fine brown trout.
