Palma de Mallorcadead link is the island's only true city. A city on the island of Mallorca, one of the Balearic Islands off the Spanish east coast. Mallorca is one of Europe's major holiday destinations, with many tourists coming from everywhere, every year. Palma is a city of modern hotel chains, and flashy shops, yet, is dated and still retains much of the old architecture, with the Old Town having narrow streets, and showing the restored cathedral standing proud in the centre of town.

Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Balearic Islands, is the largest city in Mallorca. The population of Palma municipality was approximately 410,000 in 2018. Half the population of Mallorca lives in the city of Palma.
The city occupies the northwestern end of a bay in the southwest of the island of Mallorca. The city council also has jurisdiction over the sub-archipelago of Cabrera including the islands of Cabrera, Conejera, Estells, Imperial, Rodon, Foradada, Plana, and Pobra.
The name Palma dates back to the Roman settlement on the site of the present city, although the area had been settled during the Bronze Age. In the early Middle Ages it was conquered by Arabs, who named it Madina Mayurqa. In 1229 it was conquered by King Jaime I, ruler of Valencia and Aragon, and became an important trade city. Palma saw its Dark Ages in the 16th century, when a significant decline was caused by attacks from Turkish and Berber Pirates and through plague. Lasting until the 18th century, Felipe V changed the government which made Palma the capital of the Balearic Islands. Later, Carlos III established a free trade pact with the Indies, which had a huge impact on Palma's economy.
The city became a tourist destination in the 1950s, and tourist numbers have continually increased in the subsequent half century. Palma is a busy commercial and cultural center of Mallorca. This independent region of the Balearic Islands of Spain has over half of the island's population.
The holiday season lasts from the end of April until October. Temperatures range from 20–28 °C (68–82 °F) and may require a jacket in the evenings.
Palma de Mallorca, during the 19th century, more sea traffic would come in bringing in much economic growth for the island.
