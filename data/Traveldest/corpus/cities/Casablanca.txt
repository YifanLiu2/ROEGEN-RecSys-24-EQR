Casablanca (Arabic: الدار البيضاء, Dar al-Bayda) may be the cosmopolitan, industrial and economic heart of Morocco, and its largest city, but it is one of the less endearing of the country's sights. With a small, unassuming medina and a traffic-congested ville nouvelle, travellers arriving via Casablanca may be tempted to find the first train out to nearby Rabat. The awe-inspiring Hassan II Mosque and happening nightlife and architecture (mostly colonial times buildings), however, are worth at least a day of your Moroccan itinerary.

The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa. The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755. The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there. The French occupied the city in 1907, establishing it as a protectorate in 1912 and starting construction of the ville nouvelle.
During World War II in Africa, Morocco became part of Vichy France, a non-belligerent puppet state of Germany. Casablanca became a haven for spies, as well as well-off Europeans who wanted to escape the war, with a prospect to flee to the New World. The 1942 film Casablanca presented the intrigues of the city in a romanticized manner.
Morocco gained independence in 1956, and Casablanca is now Morocco's largest city with a population of almost 4 million. It has the world's largest artificial port, but no ferry service of any kind. Casablanca is also the most liberal and progressive of Morocco's cities. Young men flirt brazenly with scantily-clad women, designer labels are the norm in the chic, beachfront neighbourhood of 'Ain Diab and many young Moroccans speak to each other in a mix of Arabic and French.
But not everyone is living the Casablancan dream. Tens of thousands of rural Moroccans who fled the drought-ravaged interior to find work in the city are struggling under high unemployment rates and expensive housing. The poverty, prevalent in slums on the city's outskirts, has led to high rates of crime, drug use, prostitution and the rise of Islamism.
Casablanca is a mixed bag of Moroccan extremes.
Casablanca's airport is the busiest gateway to the country. Royal Air Maroc flies to New York JFK, Washington Dulles, Montreal, many cities in Europe, and has connecting flights to African countries such as Nigeria, Central African Republic, Senegal and others. WizzAir flies from Rome.
Mohammed V Int'l Airport (CMN IATA). There are two terminals: Terminal 1 handles domestic and international flights, Terminal 2 - only international ones. Airport has ATMs, bank branches and currency exchange, post office, pharmacy, cafes, grocery stores and duty-free outlets. Arrive at the airport a tad earlier as there is a very slow security check after the train. (updated Aug 2022)
The only available public transport is train, departures are every hour, journey time 45 min, 70/50 dirham for 1/2 class (as of Jan 2023). Operating hours: 3:00 - 22:00 for departures from the city and 04:00 to 23:45 for departures from the airport; trains leave at 50 minutes past the hour. The train schedule is available at the ONCF websitedead link.
Taxi, the fare to Casablanca is 280 dirham (as of Nov 2022).
For more international connections and budget flights you may also want to consider flying to the airports of Rabat, Marrakesh, Fes or Tangier. From there you can take an intercity bus or train to Casablanca. From Tangier there is also a high-speed train.
The most convenient way to reach major Moroccan cities is by train. Trains are divided into first and second-class compartments; the first-class ones generally cost an extra 50%, but have more room and guarantee a seat. In case of boarding second-class compartments and not finding available seats, head to first class and pay the difference to the ticket collector.
Casa Port station is closer to the center but it serves only a couple of trains, while the main station is Casa Voyageurs. It has trains to Meknes/Fez/Oujda, Marrakech or Tangier with stops in between. Trains for Rabat leave half-hourly. The trains are comfortable with boards displaying the time of departure/arrival. ONCF sitedead link for checking the schedule.

CTM and other private companies run services to most Moroccan cities as well as a number of European cities:
Marrakech – every 1-2 hr, 4 hr, 80-95 dirham.
Essaouira – 3-4 buses per day, 6-7 hr, CTM 140 dirham / regular 110 dirham.
El Jadida – hourly, 1½ hr, 25 dirham.
Rabat – at least hourly, 1½ hr, 30-40 dirham.
Other longer-distance routes exist (sometimes overnight) from Meknes, Fez, Ouarzazate.
Gare CTM, 23 Rue Leon l'Africain. M-Su 04:00-00:00. Bus station for CTM buses. (updated May 2019)
Gare Routière, Ouled Ziane. The main bus terminal serving all destinations. The fares are slightly cheaper and buses tend to leave more frequently than CTM, however their quality might be lower and sometimes slower (always ask if they use the highway autoroute). (updated May 2019)
Getting there/away: Gare Routière is on the outskirts of the city. Local buses are obscure and unreliable, buses #10 and #11 supposedly run there. A taxi from downtown (or Casa Voyageurs) should cost no more than 12 dirham, although you may have a hard time getting this fare (especially from downtown). There is a grand taxi rank about 200 m south of Place des Nations Unies, get there for 6 dirham per person.
There is a well maintained toll that runs from Tangier to El Jadida, passing through Casablanca and Rabat.
The minimum driving age in Casablanca is 21. Always carry your driver's licence and passport while driving. Avoid driving if possible: car rental prices are high as is the accident rate. If you are leaving Casablanca by car, make sure to fill up in the city. Gas/petrol stations becomes scarce outside Casablanca.
A government department puts out an exhaustive map of Casablanca in book form called Carte Guide de Casablanca that you can find in bookstores or online; in all likelihood, though, it isn't necessary.
Other than that, Casablanca is like any European city: the streets (mostly) have signs, and passersby are extremely helpful in French or Arabic and, more rarely, Spanish or English. The Medina can be hard to navigate, but it's so small that no matter how blindly you wander into it, you're never more than ten minutes from an exit.
Casablanca tram at Place Mohammad V.
Casablanca is one of the two Moroccan cities with a tram. The first line opened in late 2012. Service runs from 05:30 to 22:30 with frequent trains (during the day, the interval seems to be shorter than 10 minutes).
Most vending machines only take coins. One journey is 6 dirham with a rechargeable card, 8 dirham otherwise. A fee of 2 dirham will be added for the card when you buy a ticket. Tram stops are announced in Arabic and French. Further information including the network ("réseau") and schedule ("horaires") is available in French and Arabic on the Casa Tramway website.
The Al Bidaoui service (i.e. airport service) also has some stops in the city, although they are spaced out much further from each other compared to the tram.
Many bus companies run through the city, the bus routes are the same for a given number, although the route remains completely unclear (Google maps has some bus stops for Casa though).
Going by bus is the cheapest way to get around (5 dirham) but some companies such as Hana Bus have vehicles in a disastrous state. It could be worth taking the chance given the cost-saving and experience of what many locals experience, but watch out for pickpockets.
All taxis red in colour, drivers know how to get to every single place in every single guide book, even if you tell them just "the restaurant on Blvd. Hassan II." Check the meter is running to avoid being overcharged at the end of the trip. Don't be surprised if the taxi stops to pick someone else up. The minimum fare is 7 dirham. White "grand taxis" are another local alternative. They have a defined itinerary so you should know in which station you should take it depending on your destination (ask locals, they will inform you easily). They only leaves when they are full, which means two people on the passenger seat and four people in the back, so expect to be packed likes sardines. However, it is cheaper than the red taxi, especially for longer distances.
Entrance to medina (Bab el-Kebir)
Almost all of the things to see in Casablanca are in the north of the city; very few maps even show the southern end of this sprawling metropolis.
King Hassan II Mosque, Blvd Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdallah (Half an hour walk from the closest tram stop at Place des Nations Unies, taxi from anywhere in central centre shouldn’t be more than 20 dirham), ☏ +212 5 22 48 28 86, +212 5 22 48 28 89. Tours: Sa-Th 09:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:00; F 09:00, 10:00 and 15:00. In summer (Mar 15-Sep 15) also at 16:00. The largest mosque in Morocco and the third largest in the world. The 210 m high minaret is the tallest in the world. It opened in 1993, after six years of construction. It is one of the two main mosques in Morocco open to non-Muslims. Beautiful interior complete with water features, a roof that opens to the sky, a huge hammam in the basement (not in use), and beautiful tile work. 130 dirham for Mosque, 30 dirham for museum, 140 for combined ticket. (updated Jan 2023)
Old Medina (north of the Place des Nations Unies). This is a small traditional walled town in the north of Casablanca. If you are in town it's worth a visit, but it is nothing compared to the glories of Fez or Marrakesh.
The Corniche. A neighborhood on the ocean, west of the Hassan II Mosque. Decades ago it was a thriving resort area - hotels line the ocean side of the Boulevard de la Corniche, and nightclubs line the other side. Most look like they've seen better days. Along the Boulevard de l'Ocean Atlantique are many newer, fancier hotels. The Corniche is also home to many western fast food chains. A new western-style movie theater can also be found here, but the best option is to walk up and down the street, resting at one of the many ocean-view cafes.
Shrine of Sidi Abderrahman. Built on a rock off shore, well past The Corniche, and only accessible at low tide. The shrine itself is off-limits to non-Muslims, but visitors are permitted to explore the tiny, medina-like neighborhood that has sprung up around it. A better bet is to walk to it along the beach and catch a view of the beautiful white walls before taking a cab to less remote areas.
Mahkama du Pacha. M-Sa 08:00-12:00 & 14:00-18:00. This is a Hispanic-Moorish building comprised of more than 60 ornate rooms with delicately carved wooden ceilings. There are many stuccoes and intricate wrought-iron railings as well as beautifully tiled floors. While entrance may be free it is not easy to get in. You need to find a guide to accompany you. Ask around - especially if you speak some French - it is worth it. To get there take bus 81 on Boulevard de Paris.
Central Post Office. Come here to send your postcards in style! Built in 1918, the façade is composed of both round and rectangular shapes. Once you approach you will get a good view of the excellent mosaics.
Museum of Moroccan Judaism (متحف اليهودية المغربية), 81, Rue Chasseur Jules Gros, ☏ +212 5229 94940. The only museum devoted to Judaism in the Arab world. Within the museum, visitors can find artifacts of Moroccan Jewry, including the bimah (c. 1944) from the Beni-Issakhar Synagogue in Casablanca, mezuzahs, and Hanukiah menorah. The museum also touts a considerable collection of Berber history, including costumes, jewelry, and Fatima pendants. (updated Sep 2021)
Art galleries (commercial - they live off earnings they make by selling art, and you can usually enter for free):
Villa des Arts, 30, Boulevard Brahim Roudani, Casablanca (located slightly southwest of Parc de la Ligue Arabe on Bvd Brahim Roudani), ☏ +212 522 29 50 87, fax: +212 522 27 86 07. Tu-Su 09:30-19:00 (except public holidays). Run by the charity ONA, it is a place for the Moroccan art scene. free of charge.
Galérie d'art l'Atelier 21, 21, rue Abou Mahassine Arrouyani (ex rue Boissy-d'anglas), ☏ +212 522 98 17 85, fax: +212 522 98 17 86, latelier21@gmail.com.
Galerie Shart, 12, rue El Jihani, ☏ +212 5 22 39 49 80, info@galerie-shart.ma.
Loft Art Gallery, 13, rue El Kaïssi, ☏ +212 5 22 94 47 65. M-F 09:30-12:30 and 14:30-19:30; Sa 09:30-12:30.
Galérie Nadar, 5, Rue Al Manaziz, ☏ +212 5 22 23 69 00, galerienadar@gmail.com.
Hammam (Turkish baths):  Solidarité Féminine Association's Hammam, 4 rue Ahmed Chaouki, Palmier (Red taxi or Tramway station Wafasalaf), ☏ +212 5 22 99 23 94. Tu-Su 08:00-21:00, M 08:00-18:00. The Association "Solidarité Féminine" has implemented an applied training program to encourage the socio-economic integration of women in single mother situations edifying employment. Therefore, making them co-founders of worthy life-plans for both themselves and their children. Entrance 40 dirham. (updated Jun 2016)
Football:  Stade Mohammed V (ملعب محمد الخامس), Rue Ahmed Lazrak, Maârif, ☏ +212 634 602690. This is multi-use but primarily for soccer. It's the usual stadium for the men's national team, and home ground for Wydad AC and Raja CA, both playing in Botola the top tier. The stadium was built in 1955 and last renovated in 2015, with a capacity of 45,891. In June / July 2025 it hosts matches in the Africa Cup of Nations, including the final. (updated Feb 2024)
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco. Around the old Medina it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of knicknacks, but it's all for the tourists. Much better to wait until you're in Fes and can bargain with someone who sells things to both Moroccans and tourists.
The Maarif neighbourhood (near the twin centre, around Boulevard al Massira al Khadra) has many name-brand European and American fashion chains, such as Zara. Designer glasses, leather shoes, and "genuine" belts, bags, and shirts can be had at bargain prices.
Morocco Mall. A huge mall including a variety of shops and a cinema (supposedly it's north Africa's second largest shopping centre). It is located at the very southwest of the city (further down from Ain Diab/Anfa).
The Derb Ghalef neighbourhood has a huge souq that is not for the faint of heart. A cluster of small shanties, each one is loaded with "genuine" mobile phones, "genuine" watches and "genuine" "brand name" clothing. The shops are separated by alleys no more than three feet wide, some of which double as drainage ditches. There are numerous fruit smoothie stands in the centre, which make a good spot for regrouping and planning your excursion. The stall owners are, of course, kings of negotiating, and without a good grasp on Arabic and a strong backbone, you're likely to pay well over the going rate for anything.
People interested in art find a decent amount of art galleries (the renowned galleries can be found in the "See" section).
Restaurants in Morocco are like restaurants in Spain - they don't open until around 19:00 at the earliest, and most people don't eat until much later. Be sure to call first and make sure your restaurant of choice is actually open.
Brasserie La Cigale, Blvd Brahim Roudani (just south of the Rampwan de L'unite Africaine). An unassuming bar close to the Park of the Arab League, with a restaurant in front that serves only basic food (sausage or kefta sandwiches, salads, and the like.) The bar in the back is more crowded and has live music most nights. Beer is served with a plate of olives or popcorn, and it's one of the few Moroccan-style bars where women can drink in peace. Wine and spirits are available, but only when eating in the restaurant. A few phrases in Arabic to Aisha, the barkeeper, will win her heart and ensure a constant supply of olives. (updated Mar 2022)
Solidarité Féminine Association's restaurant, Rue de Bethleém (Red taxi or Tramway station Wafasalaf), ☏ +212 6 19 11 11 16. M-F from 12:00 to 14:30. The Association "Solidarité Féminine" has implemented a training program to encourage the socio-economic integration single mothers. 35 dirham for the dish of the day, a salad and home made bread. Mint tea and Moroccan pastries available. (updated Apr 2022)
La Corrida, 59 Rue el Araar, ☏ +212 22 27 81 55. From the outside, it's easy to miss this restaurant, but look for the little sign ringed in blinking lights. It has a nice outdoor courtyard, but the inside is the main attraction. It's decorated like with memorabilia from Spanish bull fighting tournaments and has a dark, candle-lit vibe that's perfect for dates. The sangria is tasty, as is the Tapas menu (which changes daily). Seafood is the specialty, and the steamed mussels should not be missed.
Taverne du Dauphin, 115 Blvd Felix Houphouet, ☏ +212 22 22 12 00. A little seafood place within walking distance of the old medina, the port, and the Park of the Arabic League, this place can get crowded at meal times. An excellent selection of seafood and one of the widest beer selections in all of Morocco (though that's only 5 or 6 different brews) makes this a very popular lunch spot. The fish is fresh from the fishermen at the port, and the shellfish (oysters, mussels and so on) are delicious. When paying, however, keep an eye on the waiters: they'll "help you count the money," which can turn into an elaborate shell game where they'll slip some of the cash into their own pocket.
Le Kobe D'Or, 9 Rue Abou Salt El Andaloussi (just off of Brahim Roudani), ☏ +212 22 98 07 25. An Asian restaurant that is hard to miss, as it has an enormous red neon sign. The inside is nicely decorated in dark red, with lots of mirrors and Asian details. The food is ho-hum; the soups are great but the chicken tends to be overcooked. Still, a nice place for a quick snack close to the Maarif, a good shopping area.
La Sqala, Blvd. Des Almohades, ☏ +212 22 26 09 60. Built in the remains of an old fortress, this place is worth as much as a cultural attraction as it is a restaurant. On the outskirts of the old medina, it has cannons, walls, defensive positions, and portcullises as well as a nice, clean eating environment. The atmosphere tends to be a little on the touristy side, but the food is a good modern look at traditional Moroccan foods. Some dishes are vegetarian and vegan. They also have the obligatory Moroccan pastries and teas if you're just in the mood for a snack. Great photo opportunity.
Al Mounia, 95 Rue Prince Moulay Abdullah, ☏ +212 22 22 26 69. This restaurant has an excellent courtyard with a hundred year-old tree. The main drawback is that since this restaurant is listed in most guidebooks, it fills up with tourists at an early hour. The cooking is mostly traditional Moroccan foods, with some of the best couscous in the country. There is also an extensive wine list.
La Cocina, 55, Rue Mustapha el Manfalouti, Gauthier, a 20m de Zerktouni, ☏ +212 522 463369. The real Spanish taste in Casablanca. Located in the center of Casablanca, this restaurant offers a variety of Spanish dishes, very good rice and paellas dishes and a great selection of authentic Spanish tapas and local and imports wines and beers. Open from noon until midnight without interruption, its nice decor and friendly service make it a must in Casablanca.
Pâtisserie Bennis Habous, 2, Rue Fkih El Gabbas, ☏ +212 5 22 30 30 25. This place is famed for having some of the best pastries in Morocco. Try one of their famous hornes des gazelles. You should also try the bastilla (one of the most luxurious and prestigious dish in the Morocco's gastronomy, and Benny's is undoubtedly the best one. Choose the pigeon or farm chicken version. You must book it in advance. (updated May 2022)
Rick's Cafe, 248 Rue Sour Jdid, ☏ +212 22 27 42 07, info@rickscafe.ma. This restaurant claims to have recreated the eponymous cafe from the movie Casablanca. Excellent location, within a 20-minute walk of the Hassan II Mosque and in the walls of the Old Medina bordering the ocean. The food is excellent, though expensive. Eat at one of the tables on the second floor for an excellent view of the seats below and the niveau-Moroccan decorations or eat on the ground floor to be nearer the piano player who plays, of course, "As Time Goes By" every night. Excellent selection of wine and liquor and, for Morocco, a thorough beer selection (5 different brands). The staff, in tuxedos and fezes, are superb. Dress code. Do not show up in shorts. dinner for 2 ~800 dirham..
YoSushi, 12 Rue Mohammed Abdou, ☏ +212 22 98 11 90. Sushi is catching on in a big way in Morocco. This little place, on a side street near the prefectural police headquarters, is one of the best. New, clean and trendy, you're unlikely to find anyone in it before 22:00. They serve all the sushi classics: Nigiri, Sashimi, Hosomaki, Maki, Futomakis and assorted other fish items. Though tasty, it can get expensive if your aim is to fill yourself up. Not very many options for vegan diners.
La Table du Rétro, 22 Rue Abou Al Mahassine Arrayani, ☏ +212 05 22 94 05 55, contact@latableduretro.ma. French cuisine 350 dirham menu.
Nightlife in Casablanca has mixed reviews. Women might feel a bit uncomfortable with the mostly male crowds in many bars and nightclubs. But if you dig a bit, you'll find some excellent spots to drink, dance and people watch. Certain clubs are flooded with prostitutes at night.
If you want a drink in your hotel room, supermarkets like Acima and Marjane carry a wide variety of liquor and wine, though the beer selection is fairly stunted. The best places to drink are either European-style restaurants, which usually have a decent selection, or hotel bars, which are inevitably safer and more relaxed. Many western-style nightclubs exist in the Maarif and Gironde neighborhoods. Pubs will cost around 100 dirham per head, it will be half if visited in the happy hours from 19:00-23:00. Pubs to visit Tiger House, La Notte.
Restaurant Le Kazbar, 7 Rue Najib Mahfoud, Gauthier (On a street between Blvd Anfa and Blvd Souktani.), ☏ +212 22 20 47 47. A dark and atmospheric place to grab a drink or dinner. Any kind of attire will fly, but if you want to dress up, a night at Kasbar is your chance. (updated Oct 2016)
La Bodega, 129 Rue Allal Ben Abdellah (Near the old downtown and Medina). A Spanish tapas bar, quite original. There can be a wait to get into the basement bar; but once you get inside, you're rewarded with bartenders who eat fire. It's pretty expensive, though, and only frequented by tourists. (updated Jan 2023)
Petit Poucet, 86 Boulevard Mohamed V. A bar that has been around for decades, apparently Little Prince author and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry already stopped by here. Somewhat worn-down. (updated Oct 2016)
This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:
Hotel Terminus, Ave Bahmad, Place de la Gare, Casa-Voyageurs (150 meters to West from the train station). Located directly across from the Casa Voyageurs train station. The price is very high for what it is. 250 dirham for a 2-bed room with a sink. There are communal toilets on each floor and a shower behind the reception desk. Stay here only if you don't have another choice because all things in the hotel are very old and very dirty I could not sleep at all. 200 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)
Hotel Central, 20 Place Ahmad el Bidaoui (Located in the Medina). Located in the Old Medina, this simple hotel is a good budget option. The owners are friendly and have been known to give complimentary cups of mint tea to weary travelers. Keep your wits about you as the Medina isn't the safest area at night. 350 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)
Hotel Guynemer, 2, Rue Beloul Mohamed (ex. Pegoud), 20 000 Casablanca, ☏ +212 522-27-57-64, fax: +212 522-47-39-99, hotelguynemer@yahoo.com.

Hotel Ajiad Casablanca, Angle Rue Kamal Mohamed et Rue Fakir Med. This central hotel has 24-hour reception, free parking and air-conditioned rooms. 800 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)
Hyatt Regency Casablanca, Place des Nations Unies (In the commercial district), ☏ +212 22 43 1234, sales.casablanca@hyattintl.com. Check-in: 12:00, check-out: 15:00. You can choose rooms with views of Hassan II Mosque. Has a pool and several good restaurants. Live entertainment in the evenings. 3300 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)
Novotel Casablanca City Center, Angle Zaid Ouhmad, Rue Sidi Belyout, ☏ +212 522466500, H6572@accor.com. A four-star hotel with over 200 rooms, this is a great spot for conferences and people looking for a bit of luxury. Expansive buffet breakfast, although a touch pricey. Located near the Old Medina and Hussan II Mosque and across the street from Gare Port. 1000 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)
Sheraton Casablanca Hotel & Towers, 100 Avenue Des F A R, ☏ +212 522 43 9494. This modern hotel houses 6 bars and restaurants and the popular nightclub, Caesar's. There's also an outdoor pool and a fitness center. 2,700 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)
Atlas Airport Hotel (There is normally a bus waiting outside the airport building), ☏ +212 522536200. A modern 4-star hotel very close to the airport. This is the default accommodation for passengers with missed connections, so the price will most likely be covered by the airline. Food is basic but adequate. Wireless internet is available in a few places in the building, but you have to search for the signal - try the ground floor near the gift shop. Double 1000 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)
Unsurprisingly, all three Moroccan mobile operators (Inwi, Orange, and Maroc Telecom) are available in Casablanca.
Internet access is available in cyber cafes around the city. Service is usually around €1 per hour.
Many hotels and cafes have wifi.
Mobile monthly plans usually start from 50 dirham, which includes 5GB.
Common sense will alleviate 99% of problems; try to look as little like a tourist as possible, do not flash large quantities of cash, and so on. Faux guides are much less of a problem here than in the rest of Morocco and are limited mainly to the area around the Old Medina. It is inadvisable to walk alone in Casablanca at night. Women, as in all Moroccan cities, should dress modestly to avoid harassment (which almost always consists of lewd comments, but nothing physical.)
Pickpocketing and moto-drive-by theft seem more to be a problem here—hide your valuables!
Casablanca is unlikely to cause North American or European travellers a lot of headache. Plenty of European/American food: pizzas and hamburgers are as frequent as tajines and couscous. In some areas, such as the Maarif and Gironde neighborhoods, seeing a man in a djellaba or a donkey pulling a cart of vegetables are rarities. If even the trappings of Moroccan culture such as these are too much for you, any hotel bar or restaurant is going to be just like home for a few hours.
