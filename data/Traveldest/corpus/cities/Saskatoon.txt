Downtown Saskatoon as seen from the University Bridge.
Saskatoon is a city in West Central Saskatchewan. With a metropolitan population of approximately 317,000 people (2021), it is the province's largest city, and its economic and cultural hub. It has a beautiful setting along the South Saskatchewan River, and makes the most of it with parks and bridges. It's a little oasis among wheat fields.
Saskatoon is located on bluffs along the South Saskatchewan River. Early planners set aside the riverfront for parks. Several bridges cross the river, affording gorgeous views of river, trees, and skyline.

Founded in 1906, with growth driven by immigration, railway links, and mining wealth, Saskatoon offers cultural sophistication and wealth of Art Nouveau architecture. That, together with the river and its bridges, gives it the nickname of "Paris of the Prairies".
The foundation of Saskatoon's economy is potash and other resource mining; oil and gas extraction (fracking and conventional); and wheat and other agriculture. These are abbreviated as "POW". The city hosts corporate headquarters of world-leading firms like PotashCorp (potash) and Cameco (uranium). Until the commodities slump of 2014, Saskatoon had been one of Canada's economically most vibrant cities. From its earliest days, Saskatoon has been home to the University of Saskatchewan. It boasts "The Canadian Light Source", Canada's only synchrotron.
The name Saskatoon comes from a Cree word for a berry that grows along the river called missaskquahtoomina.
Roads which run generally east-west are usually named "street"; those running generally north-south are usually named "avenue". The major north-south road called Idylwyld Drive, Louis Riel Trail, and Highway 11 marks the division between "east" and "west" streets. 22nd Street (west of the river) and Aird Street (east of the river) mark the division between "north" and "south" avenues.
The Meewasin Park along the river, from just past University Bridge in the northeast to just past Idylwyld bridge in the southwest, is the heart of the traveler's beat. It is a beautiful, peaceful place to stroll, ride bikes, or skate.
On the east side of the river, the University of Saskatchewan lies just north of University Bridge and College Drive (highway 5); Nutana is between University Bridge and Idylwyld bridge, to 8th Street East on the south and Clarence Ave South on the east; and the Broadway Avenue district (within Nutana) runs from the Broadway bridge eastwards, particularly between 8th Street and 12th Street, and generally including roughly a block on either side, full of interesting shops and restaurants.
On the west side of the river, the Central Business District is bounded by 19th Street East on the south, Idylwyld Drive - Louis Riel Trail (highway 11) on the west, 25th Street East on the north, and the Meewasin park on the east. (Streets here are "East".) It is pedestrian-oriented, with many shops and restaurants. 21st Street East and 2nd Avenue North and South are the main arteries, and the intersection of these two is the "heart" or centre of the city. Bus lines pass through a transit terminal here.
"Alphabet Soup" is the informal name for the alphabetized avenues west of Idylwyld Drive - Louis Riel Trail (highway 11), from Avenue B through to Avenue Y, south of 33rd Street West. (Streets here are "West".) It is considered to be sketchy, with more crime than other areas. Gentrification is nibbling away at the sketchiness, along major roads and near the river. There's little reason for tourists to be outside the gentrified areas in this part of town anyway.
These neighbourhoods are useful references for travellers, but don't cover the whole city. Other attractions and important transportation hubs are also outside of these areas.

Saskatoon has a fairly high crime rate per capita, but this tends to be concentrated in small areas of the city.
The majority of the alphabetized avenues west of Idylwyld, from Avenue B through to Avenue Y (often referred to as "Alphabet Soup" by locals) are considered to be sketchy, with a lot of gang/drug activity, violent crime and prostitution. It's probably best to avoid this part of town, particularly the alphabet avenues south of 22nd Street, and also immediately surrounding the 33rd Street intersection with Idylwyld. It's usually relatively safe during daylight hours, and there's little reason for tourists to be in these parts of town anyway.
The east side of the river has the general reputation among locals of being safer than the west side.
The usual common-sense rules apply, and you should be fine.
There is a free wireless internet network in the whole of Saskatoon’s downtown core, Broadway Avenue, and on the University of Saskatchewan campus.
