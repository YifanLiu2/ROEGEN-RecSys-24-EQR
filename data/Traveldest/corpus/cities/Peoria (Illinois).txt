Peoria is a city in Illinois and the county seat of Peoria County. It serves as a regional hub for the primarily rural and agricultural center of the state. Peoria is a small but diverse city of approximately 115,000 people that anchors a three-county metropolitan area of nearly 400,000.
Situated on a river bluff with excellent natural resources and easy river access, the area has been settled since prehistory, with artifacts and burial mounds showing settlement as far back as 10,000 BC. Peoria was first settled by French explorers in 1680 and is one of the oldest continuously-occupied European settlements in what is now Illinois. Thanks to its position on the Illinois River, Peoria enjoyed comfortable growth from shipping business in the 1800s and early 1900s. Like Muncie in Indiana, it became known as an Average American Town, leading to the famous phrase used by Jack Benny as a radio punchline (and the Nixon administration for political spin) "Will it play in Peoria?" Peoria is also a place of history as the scene of historical debate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas on the subject of slavery.
Residents may rankle at the implied lack of sophistication in the phrase; right or wrong, they take fierce pride in what their city has to offer, and they see the only differences between their city and Chicago as being size and cost-of-living. Today, most of Peoria's economy revolves around Caterpillar, manufacturer of the iconic yellow construction equipment used worldwide, as well as business conventions and the large medical center. Illinois high school sports tournaments are also a major draw for visitors. Famous natives include Richard Pryor, for whom a street leading from town to the airport is named, and Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique.
The Peoria Area Convention and Visitors Bureau can help groups and individuals plan an itinerary in Peoria.

Peoria weather varies considerably throughout the seasons. Like much of the Midwest it has a humid continental climate, and consequently four distinct seasons. The cool and pleasant springs are followed by humid summer days, beautiful autumn vistas full of color along the bluffs, and cold winter days. Even on the nicest days it is usually wise to have a jacket available in case a storm or front suddenly comes through, and the weather suddenly changes. Though rare, tornadoes are a possibility outside of the winter months in Peoria. The occasional snow storm may cause traffic to bottleneck for several hours until the streets have been plowed.
Many visitors fly into Chicago or St. Louis and drive to Peoria. Each city is approximately 150 miles (250 km) from Peoria and the drive takes 2½-3 hours, depending on traffic. Indianapolis is 200 miles (320 km) away and takes 3½-4 hours to reach by car.
