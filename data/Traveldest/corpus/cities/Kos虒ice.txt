Košice (pronounced Ko-shi-tse) is the second largest city in Slovakia, with a population of almost 240,000 (in 2021). It was the European Capital of Culture in 2013. Despite its relative remoteness, you may likely find Košice a hidden, unknown and approachable gem when seeking for a lesson in less known European history, lively arts scene or for a less spiritual entertainment thanks to its vibrant party scene.

Košice has had a colourful history with its ever changing medieval and modern rulers of Hungarians, these days hardly imaginable Turks for a while, Czechs and nowadays Slovaks. Serving its part as a centre of what may best be described as a frontier of Slovak hill country, Hungarian lowlands and Ukrainian/Russian/Soviet East, it has become a predominantly Slovak city in what was then Czechoslovakia after its emergence in chaos of reconciliations after the First World War. Until these days the city is inhabited by descendants of east Slovak dwellers with many relations in the gorgeous rural surroundings of the city who were flocking to the town during its industrial boom after the World War II and a large Hungarian speaking minority along with its fast growing underprivileged and often resented population of Gypsies (or Romas as is their official naming).
A smart, patient and crying with the wolves traveller may find the city suffer from what may best be described as a small man syndrome, a feeling shared by many locals probably best attributed to being the second city in Slovakia and a place not often visited from elsewhere. This may however help in engaging with many residents who may seem to be one of those lovely people who actually enjoy foreigners visiting their place.
The city prides on being known as "The City of Peace" thanks to non-violent ethnic and national tolerance throughout its history. Visitors can get a view into the history of a lesser known corner of Europe, and at the same journey enjoy a lively art scene and nightlife.
Košice sits in a basin, above 200 m above sea level, where the Hungarian plains meet the Carpathian mountains. A few suburbs have been built on the mountainsides, though not much higher than the rest of the city. Towards the south, along the Hornád river the plains open up; but unlike what one might expect of a city and a river, it passes through the suburbs of Košice rather than going right through the core. A landmark south of the city is a massive steel plant, the U. S. Steel Košice, employing over 10000 people.
Speaking of the core of the city, it's centered around the St. Elisabeth cathedral and is the largest protected historical downtown in Slovakia. There you can find much of the city's attractions, restaurants and bars. The periphery of the city is mostly made up of apartment blocks from the Communist times and have little to offer the average visitors aside from a few cheap places to sleep.
The mountains surrounding Košice, especially on the western side, and their forests are excellent places for hiking which is a popular pastime with locals. Outdoor areas such as Kavečany, Jahodná, Bankov et Čermeľská dolina can be accessed by public transport.
The region has been inhabited since the Stone Age. Celtic peoples settled in the region around 300 BC, Slavic people in the 5th century AD. In the 9th and 10th century it was part of Great Moravia, the first Slavic kingdom to be established in Central Europe. Towards the 11th century the region was Christianized, became part of the Hungarian Kingdom and got the name Abov. During Hungarian rule, a city started growing here, fortified during the rule of King Emeric (ruling 1196–1204) and first described as Villa Cassa in 1230.
A few years later the Mongols invaded the region, and in 1241 a battle was fought in Jasov 22 km from Košice. After they were expelled, the region was repopulated with German settlers invited by king Béla IV. In 1250 the Dominicans had a church built, which is the oldest standing building in the city, and the order still occupies the adjacent convent. The fortifications were strengthened throughout the 13th century and in 1290 Košice was granted city status. With the death of king Andrew III in 1301, the House of Árpád went extinct and this resulted in a war of succession where Košice supported different kings, with a major battle fought in Rozhanovce just east of the city in 1312. Eventually peace returned and Košice got the status of a royal city in 1347. In the 15th century the city grew both in population and importance, among other things the cathedral was built and Košice had around 10,000 inhabitants in 1480s – a lot for a city during the Late Middle Ages.
Košice saw troubles again during the following centuries. In 1526 Hungarians fleeing the Turkish invasion sought refuge in the city. A fire ravaged the city in 1556. And in 1597 the Catholic bishop of Eger, fleeing the Turkish advance, settled in Košice which was Protestant stronghold. He wanted to make the cathedral to a Catholic house of worship, and made a coup in the city in 1603 to further his goals with the support of the Austrian emperor. This led to a series of uprisings against the Habsburgs over the following century, ending in the Peace of Satu Mare (Szatmár in Hungarian) in 1711.
This was followed by two centuries of peace and prosperity. Hungarian aristocracy made the city a home, and many grand buildings were built during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Industrial Revolution reached Košice in 1791 when a hat factory was built, in 1860 the first train services arrived and horse-pulled trams started serving the city in 1891 (they were electrified in 1914). After the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867, when Hungary regained some of the privileges that had been taken away by Austria after the uprising of 1848, authorities made the formerly trilingual (Slovak-Hungarian-German) and -cultural city a more Hungarian one. In that, the cathedral was renovated, the State Theatre was built, and the remains of Francis II Rákóczi (leader of the 1703 rebellion against Austria) were brought to the city.
Having been part of the Hungarian kingdom for almost a thousand years, Košice became part of Czechoslovakia which was formed after WWI. The city briefly became Hungarian again in 1938 when annexed by Hungary, and during WWII Hungary was occupied by Germany. Jews made up about 20% of the city's population before the war, and they were deported to concentration camps in 1944. In January 1945 Košice was liberated, was reinstated as part of Czechoslovakia and even served as the temporary capital of the country as Prague was still occupied.
After the war the city grew in size and population, many suburbs were built, and in the 1960s a large metal plant in Šaca south of the city. Like Prague and other places in Czechoslovakia, Warsaw Pact troops invaded Košice in 1968 after the Prague Spring. The Velvet Revolution in late 1989 saw a strike at the university followed by tens of thousands of people demonstrating on the streets. After the fall of Communism, also the Czechoslovakia separated into two separate countries in 1993, and Košice went from being the fifth largest city in the former country to the second largest in Slovakia.
In the 21st century the city is finding its new role as one of the easternmost centers of the new European Union. It provides a look into the not-that-long-gone way of living in an eastern European country while also serving as a lovely example of a booming and rapidly changing place with rich ancient history best served by its stunning historic city center, with an impressive cathedral quickening the hear-beat of every picture hunting traveller.

In the old town, walking is the only practical way to get around as there's no public transport and many streets are pedestrianized.
Most of Košice's attractions are along the main pedestrianized street, known as Hlavná ulica (Main Street), Námestie Maratónu mieru (Peace Marathon Square, the north end of Hlavna), and Námestie osloboditeľov (Square of the liberators, at the southern end of Hlavna) at various parts.
With its unique atmosphere Hlavná ulica creates the heart of the town. In the past, it used to be a medieval square and the whole town started to grow from this point. Now this place is flat, however in the past it used to be hilly and even a stream flew there.
The "Čermeľský potok" (The Tshermel stream) used to create an island on the main street, where the Saint Elizabeth cathedral is located now. Due to developing infrastructure, this stream was filled in in 1899 and was renewed only symbolically during the renovation of the main street in the 1990s.
Today, all the traffic from the main street is excluded, therefore it is a very pleasant pedestrian site. Except the Saint Elizabeth Cathedral, you will find also the Saint Michael Chapel, Urban tower, the State Theater, the so-called singing fountain (a unique fountain in Europe), as well as many stylish original bourgeois houses.
