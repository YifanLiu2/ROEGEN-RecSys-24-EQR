Surat Thani (สุราษฎร์ธานี) is a city and a province on the Central Gulf Coast of southern Thailand.
Surat Thani (often just "Surat") is the largest province of southern Thailand. Surat Thani means City of Good People, the title given to the city by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI). It is a gateway to the islands of Thailand's Gulf Coast: Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, and Ko Tao are much-visited destinations, as well as Ang Thong National Marine Park and the famous Khao Sok National Park.
Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), Talad Mai Rd, ☏ +66 77-288-818. M-F 08:30-16:30. The TAT office on Talad Mai Road is the only government tourism office on mainland Surat Thani. TAT has brochures and maps for both local tourist destinations as well as those in other provinces. Clean public toilets are also available free of charge. TAT does not sell anything, they are only there to promote tourism. The other tourism offices around the city (like the one at the airport and the ones near Talad Kaset 1 and 2) are not official tourism offices and will try to sell you tourism packages or ferry tickets. Do not buy anything from these private tourism offices as they are usually offered at an inflated price. For ferry tickets, only buy them directly from the ferry operator or from Phantip Travel.
Parallel to the railway in a north-south direction runs the Asian Highway AH2 (Thailand Route 41). The major east-west road is Thailand Route 401 connecting Takua Pa with Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Thailand Route 44|Rte 44 goes southwest from Kanchanadit to Krabi. Rte 44 was built as part of the land bridge project connecting the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea. Unlike other highways there are no crossing intersections. The wide space between the two lanes is reserved for pipelines and a railway.
As of 2014, the province has two international airports: Surat Thani International Airport in Phunphin and Samui Airport on Ko Samui. Surat Thani Airport is served by five airlines: Thai Airways International (operated by Thai Smile from Suvarnabhumi Airport), Nok Air, Thai Lion Air from Don Mueang International Airport, Thai AirAsia from Don Mueang and Chiang Mai, AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Samui Airport is served by Bangkok Airways and Thai Airways International from Suvarnabhumi Airport, Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Penang.

Surat Thani railway station, Tha Kham, Phunphin District
The province is crossed by the southern railway, with Surat Thani Railway Station in Phunphin, about 15 km from downtown. A branch line to the west ends at Kirirat Nikhom Railway Station. It had been planned to run to the coast next to the island of Phuket, but construction ended in 1956. There are 32 railway stations in Surat Thani Province.
Surat Thani Railway Station (สถานีรถไฟสุราษฎร์ธานี), Phunphin District, Surat Thani. The Surat Thani train station, despite its name, is in Phun Phin, about 12 km west of the town centre. Most comfortable are the overnight trains from Bangkok, which arrive in early morning. There are always many who try to catch the tourists and sell them trips to Surat or the islands directly. Usually the most aggressive sellers are the most expensive. However, it's not a big problem to reach the city itself from the railway station. Municipal buses depart the train station for Surat Thani every 30 minutes and cost 20 baht, though the service seems to stop around 17:00. After that, the only option is a taxi, the drivers of which will come in to the station to try and find passengers. If you go outside and turn immediately to the left, there is a taxi stand with taxis charging a fixed price of 140 baht to Surat Thani. The price is clearly indicated on a printed canvas sign attached high up. (updated Oct 2022)

Chak Phra Festival (ชักพระ). Celebrates the return of Gautama Buddha from heaven to earth to be greeted by multitudes. The celebration takes place every year immediately after the end of three month rain retreat, about October. It is celebrated in many parts of southern Thailand, but especially in Surat Thani. The evening prior to Chak Phra Day, billboards are erected showing Buddha's story around the city and celebrations continue day and night. On land, the splendidly adorned floats are pulled across the town by the participants. At the same time, on water a float decorated with colourful Thai designs carries Buddha's image.
