Shenyangdead link (沈阳 Shěnyáng), known as Mukden in the Manchu language, is the capital of Liaoning Province in China. Shenyang is the largest city in the northeast of China, and it is steeped in history.
Nurhaci built his imperial palace and was laid to rest in one of the first two imperial tombs of the Qing Dynasty, Fuling Tomb. His son Hong Taiji is buried in Zhaoling tomb, which is the second of the first two imperial tombs. The imperial palace and the two tombs are all listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was in Shenyang that the Russian army was defeated by the Japanese in 1905, resulting in Japan taking control of the Liaodong Peninsula from Russia. It was also here, on September 18, 1931 that Japan would stage the Mukden incident in order to use it as a pretext to occupy all of Northeast China. This city was also the home to the warlord Zhang Zuolin and his son Zhang Xueliang who ruled over the Northeast during the 1920s. In the 20th century, Shenyang developed as a major industrial centre. Today the city is rapidly losing its older structures with large scale construction throughout the city, as in all other cities in China.

The city is served by the Shenyang Taoxian International Airport, and by several smaller, regional airports. There are direct flights to Shenyang from most Chinese airports.
Shenyang Taoxian International Airport (沈阳桃仙国际机场; Shěnyángtáoxiān Guójìjīchǎng SHE IATA) (by car 15 miles (24 km) south of the city). Direct international flights include Seoul and Cheongju in South Korea; Pyongyang in North Korea; Irkutsk and Khabarovsk in Russia; Frankfurt, Osaka, Tokyo and Vancouver.
Tramway line 2 connects the airport with the Shenyang subway system. With the transfer to the subway, it takes a bit over an hour to get into downtown. An airport shuttle also runs from the airport to the main China Northern Airlines ticket office (117 Zhonghua Road; 中华路117号; Zhōnghuálù) and back frequently.
Shenyang is connected by a major expressway, the 6-lane Jingshen Expressway, from Beijing, some 685 km (425 mi) away. Expressways also link Shenyang with Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. The Shenda Expressway connecting Shenyang and Dalian was the first expressway ever built in China (383 km/238 mi). It is the fastest highway (8-lane) linking one of the largest port cities to Shenyang.
Train service is provided through two train stations, the North Railway Station and the Railway Station. The North Railway Station handles the majority of the long-distance trains while the Railway Station handles most of the northeast trains and does local service around the province. Some trains travel to both stations so be aware of which station you need to board your train. High Speed Rail is available from both stations (D train). The train stations are connected with metro.

Sights in the old city, Shenhe District, can be walked between, but other areas such as those in Beiling or Dongling require transport.
The Shenyang Metro has three lines. Line 1 runs east-west across the city (serving Shenyang rail station). Line 2 runs north-south (serving Shenyang North rail station). Line 9 runs in an L shape, from northwest to southwest to southeast. Line 10 runs in an L shape, from northwest to southwest to southeast.
Shenyang has a comprehensive bus system, but it can be incomprehensible if you do not read Chinese. Make sure you pick up a city bus and area map at either train station. Very handy to help get around. Buses charge ¥1-2 and major bus lines congregate around the train stations. Bus 203 travels between the two train stations.
There are plenty of taxis whose meters start at ¥8 for 3 km, then ¥ per kilometer. Make sure you get a taxi in which the meter is mounted on the dashboard and easily visible from your seat instead of behind the gear shift - it is possible the driver may be pulling some sleight of hand to increase your fare.
