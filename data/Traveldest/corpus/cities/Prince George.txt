Prince George, locally known as PG, is a city in the North Coast-Nechako region and a major service centre in Northern British Columbia, Canada. It is the largest city north of Kamloops in BC, and known as BC's Northern Capital. Prince George is at the crossroads of Highway 16 (East-West) and Highway 97 (North-South), in a large valley at the confluence of the Fraser River and the Nechako River, both significant, high flow rivers.
From the very beginning, Prince George was built around the forest industry. Today, the forest industry is still the largest employer in town. Prince George has a significant industrial areas North and South of town, along the Fraser River. This includes 3 pulp & paper mills, several chemical factories, several saw mills and an oil refinery. Since its beginnings, Prince George has diversified significantly. Today, Prince George has a large government presence, an important court house, a large provincial jail and the University of Northern British Columbia, one of five British Columbia universities.
Prince George is commonly divided into three regions: the Bowl, the center of town west of the Fraser River; the Hart Highlands, the community around Highway 97 north of the Nechako River; and College Heights, the area south of the Bowl.
Prince George has several interesting and exciting natural features, and a few notable museums, the superb Coldsnap music and entertainment festival in January, a fabulous art gallery, a fantastic seasonal farmer's market, and much more; however, for many, Prince George remains a service center for transiting tourists, and not a destination on most travelers' itineraries.
