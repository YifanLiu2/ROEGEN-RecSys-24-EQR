Spokane is a city in the Palouse region of eastern Washington, also known as "The Inland Empire", pre-dating by nearly a century the use of the same title by a region in Southern California. It is the second largest city in the state, and the largest between Seattle and Minneapolis.
The city is pronounced as "spo-CAN," but often mispronounced as "spo-CANE."
Spokane is named for a Salish-speaking tribe of Native Americans who were the original inhabitants of the area. The original spelling, Spokan, was given an e by the adoption of the name of the original building, Spokane House (a trapping house built by early European arrivals).
Spokane is the economic hub of an area that serves roughly  million people. The largest city between Seattle and Minneapolis, its immediate metropolitan area, which includes neighboring Kootenai County, Idaho, is home to roughly 680,000 people. The city is home to just over 200,000. Politically, Spokane is as conservative as most regions its size across the west, but within city limits, it typically votes for Democrats. Despite immigration from other areas of the country and world, Spokane has a fairly small racial minority population of around 15%.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Spokane receives only a fraction of the rain that falls in Seattle and western Washington. However, winters are a lot colder with much more snowfall. Summers are hotter, but still more mild and less humid that those in the Midwest and East. Even temperatures of 95 °F (35 °C) to 99 °F (37 °C) are often followed by cold early mornings with temperatures not much more than 50 °F (10 °C). Always have a jacket handy year-round.

Interstate 90 (I-90) connects Seattle with Billings, Montana via Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and Spokane. Spokane is accessed from Exits #279 (US Hwy 195) through #285 ( "Appleway Blvd and Sprague Ave" from the eastbound lanes and "Sprague Ave" from the westbound lanes) just east of town.
US Route 2 is a more scenic alternative to I-90. If coming from Seattle, it winds its way eastward through Leavenworth and Wenatchee in the North Cascades. It continues north and east towards Northern Idaho and Montana after leaving Spokane. From the north, US Hwy 2 and US Hwy 395 go through town as N Division St into downtown. US Route 2 runs concurrent on I-90 between Exit 281 (Division St) and 277("Spokane Airport Davenport") where it continues west towards Davenport as a separate road.
US Route 195 connects the Palouse country in the southeastern part of the state to Spokane. It passes through the southwestern neighborhoods of Spokane as a freeway and ends at I-90, at Exit #279 west of downtown.
US Route 395 connects Spokane to Tri-Cities through Ritzville (at freeway speeds, and shares its route with I-90 into Spokane after Ritzville). From the north, Christina Lake, BC (mostly a two-lane highway) goes through Colville and Kettle Falls in the northeastern part of the state. US Hwy 395 and US Hwy 2 go through Spokane as Division St, but with the new freeway, just US Hwy 2 will be Division St. and US Hwy 395 will be the North-South Freeway.
E Trent Ave goes across the northeastern part of town, parallel I-90, towards Rathdrum, Idaho via Antoine Peak Conservation Area. It becomes ID-Hwy 53 in Idaho.
W Francis Ave begins from N Division in the northwestern part of town. It eventually leaves town alongside the Spokane River towards Long Lake.
For those originating or passing through the Salt Lake City area, there are two freeway routes with nearly the same distance. I-15 north to I-90 west is slightly shorter than I-84 west to US-395 north. However, whichever route has the best weather at the time (especially in winter), would be the better choice. The I-15/I-84 split is about 75 miles north of downtown Salt Lake City.
The STA (Spokane Transit Authority) is an excellent way to get around to the north, south, and west sides as well as to the Valley and Liberty Lake in the east. Public transit is a great way to get to meet the people of a city. Bus route maps can be found in a few stores and gas stations. Most drivers are very friendly and helpful so ask any questions you may have.
The STA offers 2-hour and all-day passes. You must ask the driver for a pass before you put your fare in the fare box.
Eyes on the road at all times!
Do not use or hold your phone while driving, even while stopped in a red light! Police across all of Washington State have also been on the lookout for drivers disobeying the law while distracted for all other reasons (i.e. eating, drinking, grooming). A hefty fine of $136 for the first offense is issued in addition to a mark on your insurance that is equivalent to driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), upon which the law is colloquially called E-DUI.
Should you need to use your phone for navigation, use a speaker while hiding your phone or use a phone holder that you can hang onto your dashboard. Input your destination before you drive or have a passenger do it for you. It is not recommended to place it on your lap as you might still have the tendency to look down on it, or as it may easily fall off. Should there be a need to answer or make phone calls, pull over to park or sync your phone with the car's entertainment system before driving so that you do not need to hold onto it. However, the minimal use of a finger to activate, deactivate or initiate a function of a personal electronic device while driving is still allowed.
Car rentals are available in many locations, mainly near the Spokane International Airport. All the major companies are there. Returning cars at the airport can be a little confusing. The main entrance to the rental return is an entire mile before the airport terminal (left at Flint Rd.) You can also drop off passengers and turn right at Flint Rd. just past the terminal. Note there are no directional signs for rental cars between these two places.
Interstate 90 is an excellent way to cross town east-west. A north-south freeway is under construction, and won't be finished for years. Allow more time if you have to go very far in this direction, as there's no express route yet. (The construction is unlikely to cause you any delays, as it's not on the main roadways.)
Spokane has many uncontrolled intersections in older residential neighborhoods. Watch for cross traffic and yield as necessary. Also, on the northwest side of the city, Maple Street (northbound) and Ash Street (southbound) are one-way thoroughfares. Be extra careful where Northwest Boulevard intersects Ash and Maple at a 45 degree angle.
Check with Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) for current driving conditions.
The area's roads are designed more or less around a grid system, where most addresses are numbered based on their distance from the city center (Sprague & Division). Nearly all streets run with the compass directions with Sprague Ave (going east-west through downtown to Spokane Valley and in Airway Heights) and W Riverside(west of downtown, west of Walnut St) divide north from south while Division St (US Hwy 2 and 395) north of I-90 and Grand Blvd south of I-90 divide east from west. The "Avenues" run east-west, parallel to Sprague, while "Streets" run north-south parallel to Division & Grand. Most streets are named except the east-west avenues south of Sprague in downtown (and south of downtown) and in Airway Heights which are numbered streets. This also applies to much of the extended areas of unincorporated Spokane County such as Spokane Valley, Liberty Lake, Country Homes and other surrounding areas outside the Spokane city limits. The addresses in places like Cheney, Deer Park, Medical Lake and Sprangle have their own numbering system and are not based on Spokane's numbering system.
Monroe Street Dam on the Spokane River
Within the past five years, Spokane has rapidly developed its bicycling infrastructure, adding both protected and unprotected bike lanes, traffic-separated bike trails and paths, and bike parking areas downtown and in major commercial districts. As a result, biking is a convenient and desirable way to commute. Within the six-month period from April to October when the weather is most reliably bicyclist-friendly, it is not uncommon to see throngs of bicycle commuters traveling downtown or to the various districts, like South Perry and Garland. Many employers now offer showers and changing facilities to their employees to encourage cycling.
The Centennial Trail runs along the Spokane River from downtown Coeur d'Alene through the Spokane Valley and downtown Spokane, ending in Riverside State Park. The nationally-recognized trail is a favorite among bicyclists, runners, and skaters. Be on the lookout for the particularly dramatic section near Mile 23. Here trail users exit the up-and-coming Kendall Yards neighborhood to downtown (when traveling eastbound) and cross under the century-old Monroe Street Bridge, exposing beautiful views of the Spokane Falls. Be sure to take enough time to enjoy this true gem that makes Spokane one of the most beautiful downtown urban areas in the United States. And don't forget a camera.
Downtown Spokane. The hub of the region dubbed "The Inland Northwest." It is the center for all of your shopping centers, medical centers, main attractions and hotels. Skywalks connect much of the downtown shops, useful in winter. Riverfront Square is a "mall" containing a parking garage, theaters, restaurant, bars, department and specialty shops, and a food court. (updated Jun 2023)
Riverfront Park, ☏ +1 509-625-6600, fpinfo@spokanecity.org. 6AM-midnight, Skyride 10AM-6PM. The host of the 1974 World's Fair. A few of the pavilions still exist, and the park is beautifully maintained. Maps of downtown Spokane (which include a park map) can be found in most hotels and stores and gas stations nearby. The park has fun features: the river and its waterfalls, the dam, two suspension footbridges, a rare, beautiful, and priceless hand-carved Looff Carousel (complete with rings and a target; sit on an outside horse if you want to participate!), the rather frightening gondolas over the falls, a small amusement park, bike rentals, an IMAX theater and game room, concert areas, and annual events including concerts, plays, "Pig Out in the Park", powwows, Battle of the Bands, and children's activities. The striking clock tower is the only remnant of the ugly train yards that once occupied the parkland, and a good place to meet up if you get separated. (updated Sep 2020)
Manito Park (between 18th Ave and 25nd Ave, West of Grand Blvd. East of Bernard Street). Its steep hills make it a popular and well-used wintertime sledding spot; be careful of the trees, however. A zoo until 1933, Manito is now a year-round home to a friendly flock of geese, ducks, and turtles. Visit the park's Rose Garden in the Summer, the formal Duncan Gardens near the greenhouse (open until dusk), the Japanese Gardens on the Bernard Street side of the park. There are two playgrounds, one for smaller children near the duck pond and the main entrance, another with a waterpad near the ball fields on the south end (25th Avenue). A small restaurant operates in the summer in an old stone building near the perennial gardens, open for lunch and maybe breakfast. Parts of the park are rustic and undeveloped; tennis courts are near the main entrance. The park, like all those in the city, closes at 10PM and is patrolled periodically.
Monroe Street Bridge. This bridge was built in 1911 and is the largest arch bridge in the United States. It is one of the finest examples and also one of the last remaining bridges among the several dozen bridges that once crisscrossed the falls and made Spokane world-famous as the "City of Bridges" during the latter half of the 19th century (i.e, Spokane had the largest number of bridges of any city in the world at the time). Take an inspiring walk across the falls of the Spokane River while admiring the buffalo head sculptures adorning the covered observation decks across the span. The Monroe St Bridge is in the heart of Downtown immediately west of Riverfront Park, the former site of the old train station and rail yards (locals know it well, just ask one). It was restored in 2003-05.
Riverside State Park, ☏ +1 509 465-5064. Summer;6:30AM-dusk; Winter: 8AM - dusk. Bowl and Pitcher is basalt rock formations in the middle of the fast flowing Spokane River.

Gonzaga Bulldogs, McCarthey Athletic Center, 801 N. Cincinnati St, ☏ +1 509 313-6000, tickets@gonzaga.edu. The sports teams of Gonzaga University, officially nicknamed "Bulldogs" but affectionately called "Zags", are one of the city's great institutions. While the Zags have teams in nine men's and nine women's sports (though not football—the school dropped that sport during World War II), by far the biggest attraction is men's basketball, which has developed into a national power in the 21st century, making the championship game in 2017 and 2021. The McCarthey Athletic Center, home to basketball, always sells out for men's games and often for women's games (the capacity is only 6,000). Usually, one men's game a year is played at the much larger Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, and a second men's game is taken to Seattle. Most other Zags teams play on campus, and tickets are much easier to get than for basketball.

People in Spokane are generally quite kind and hospitable. The city is safe, and violent crime is rare. That said, Spokane has had ongoing challenges with property crime and vehicle theft. As such, use common sense––if parking a vehicle, be sure to lock the doors and ensure that all valuables are in the trunk. Also, use caution when walking through Riverfront Park or on the Centennial Trail at night.
Do not swim or wade in the Spokane River, as this is very dangerous; drownings are not uncommon. While Spokane has a few hospitals (typical for a city its size), it does not have a Level 1 trauma hospital. While the need is rare, patients are flown by air ambulance to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.
Spokane is one of a few cities nationwide that has Wi-Fi access just about everywhere Downtown. The entire Downtown area is a Wi-Fi hotspot or an area where wireless Internet is provided free of charge (2 hours per day) if your computer is equipped for Wi-Fi. There is also free Wi-Fi at the airport (with commercials before access).
During the first Sunday in May, Spokane hosts the Bloomsday 12-km timed street run, while the Hoopfest basketball tournament is on last weekend in June (could be June 30th/July 1st). These are both hugely popular events with tens of thousands of visitors. If you're not interested in either, avoid the area altogether on these two weekends, as traffic will be extremely bad, and accommodation impossible. Even Thursday night should be avoided for Hoopfest. Barring some unusually severe weather, the other 50 weekends each year should be just fine for visiting.
Although the destinations of Seattle, Portland, Glacier National Park, Mount Rainier, and Mount St. Helens are popular with locals, these are not day trips, and even a two-day excursion will seem rushed. The distance to Mt. St. Helens is easily underestimated, as the only access is from I-5 between Seattle and Portland (with substantial backtracking).
The area to the west and south before the mountain ranges can be considerably hotter in summertime than it is in Spokane. Bring plenty of drinking water.
Being in the foothills of the Rockies, Spokane has excellent skiing in the wintertime, including cross-country. Forty-five minutes (by car) north of city lies the closest local ski area; Mt. Spokane Ski Resort
If you don't ski, Mt. Spokane State Park, has camping and daytime recreation. In the Selkirk Mountains, at the top of the 5,883-foot summit there are great views as far as Canada. US Hwy 2 north to Mt. Spokane Park Dr. (Hwy 206), then 19 miles east. (Don't use Day Mt. Spokane Road, as this goes into the backcountry.) Entry to Mt. Spokane requires a Washington State Parks Discover Pass (including the privately run ski resort.)
Also, 40 minutes east of downtown is the lakefront tourist town of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. It's also known for its quaint downtown. (Note that all marijuana is illegal in Idaho, and their laws are very strict.)
Fairchild AFB, just west of Spokane International Airport on US Highway 2 (only for special events open to the public; otherwise a current Department of Defense ID card is required)
Grand Coulee Dam — About 88 mi (142 km) from Spokane, the largest electric power-producing facility in the U.S., and one of the largest concrete structures in the world. A laser light show is sometimes held after dark on summer nights (check schedule).
Walla Walla — It has been known for its funny name and famous sweet onions. Traditional crops have been replaced by the vineyards of over 100 area wineries. Due to the distance (157 mi/256 km) and large number (for its size) of hotels and Bed and Breakfasts, many visitors stay overnight. If too pricey, accommodation in Pendleton, Oregon is much cheaper.
