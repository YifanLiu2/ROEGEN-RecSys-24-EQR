Bloemfontein is much safer than most other cities. You can walk around downtown during the day time (although it will be eerily quiet after the shops close). The Waterfront and other shopping malls are safe and patrolled with 24-hour security, and 2nd Street (the main restaurant strip) is fine day and night. The dodgy areas to avoid if possible are near the train station and anywhere east of the railway lines (where the traditional townships are located).
Visit the beautiful Karoo Heartland town of Graaff-Reinet and the Mountain Zebra National Park in the south.
Heading east you will reach Thaba 'Nchu, 60 km outside Bloemfontein, which has a luxury hotel and casino complex as well as Maria Moroka Nature Reserve. 130 km from Bloemfontein is the pleasant town of Ladybrand close to Lesotho and its capital city of Maseru.
The N6 will take you to East London and the N1 will take you to Gauteng (which is a toll road) or Cape Town
