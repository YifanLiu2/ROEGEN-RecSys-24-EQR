Larnaca has a reasonable claim to being the oldest city in Cyprus, with evidence of habitation up to 6,000 years ago. Major landmarks are the Church of St. Lazarus, and the Hala Sultan Tekke.
Modern Larnaca, like other Cypriot coastal towns, is divided into an older city centre and a wide sprawl of hotels and restaurants along the beach.
Larnaca Glafcos Clerides International Airport (LCA IATA) (6 km to the west of the city centre). The largest airport on Cyprus. Taxis to the city take 15 minutes, and there are also scheduled city buses. You'll likely take bus 425 to and from the airport. There are left luggage/baggage storage facilities at the airport by departures. €10 per large bag.(update April 2024) (updated Apr 2022)
Shared taxis (dolmus) connect Larnaca to Nicosia and Limassol.

Larnaca is a thin ribbon of a town and you can walk around most of it. The seaside Larnaca Promenade (Phinikoudes) is particularly pleasant for a stroll in the evening.
Bus fares (daytime) cost € cash or € with a pre-paid card (April 2024). A card costs €5 and is valid for 10 years. It can be used for multiple passengers on the same journey.
The bus 425 goes from the airport to the town centre every 20 minutes during the day.
By law, taxis should charge by the meter, but many cabbies will refuse to use it. Metered fares should be 65 cent; to get in plus 22 cent/km, night surcharges apply after midnight.
The Church of St. Lazarus, Ayios Lazaros Sq. An Orthodox church dating to the 9th century. It is reputedly built around the tomb of the biblical Lazarus, brother of Mary. (updated Mar 2015)
Larnaca Salt Lake (to the west of town near the airport). In winter (November to March), flocks of pink flamingos can be seen here. (updated Mar 2015)
Hala Sultan Tekke (perched by the side of the Salt Lake). The mosque is said to be the tomb of Umm Haram, the foster mother of Mohammed. (updated Mar 2015)
Faneromeni Church (Ekklisía tis Faneroménis). This mashup of various architectural styles used to stand in the centre of the city — until 1974. There is a marble mausoleum next to it.

There's also a replica of the Stele of King Sargon II (722-705 BC) of Assyria. The original is on display at Berlin Pergamon Museum. (updated Mar 2015)
Diving the wreck of the Zenobia
Football: AEK Larnaca play soccer in the First Division, the top tier in Cyprus. Their home ground AEK Stadium (capacity 7400) is 2 km west of the city centre.
Anorthosis also play in the First Division. They were forced to relocate from Famagusta, now part of Turkish Cyprus, and play at Papadopoulos Stadium (capacity 10,200) 2 km north of the centre.
Diving: the main reason to dive in Larnaca is the wreck of the Zenobia, a ro-ro ferry that sank in 1980 on her maiden voyage only a few hundred metres from the harbour due to a fault in the ballast computer. Fully laded with trucks and their cargo, the ship now lies on its side at a depth of 42 m, with the top of the wreck at 18 m and thus easily accessible even to PADI Advanced Open Water divers. If your flight comes in right, you can even see the shadow of the wreck as you land at Larnaca airport.

The beaches of Larnaca are littered with identikit seafood restaurants catering to tourists. The easiest way to find a good place is to simply walk along until you find a restaurant packed not with tourists, but with Cypriots!
Eating in Larnaca can be quite expensive. However, if you're travelling on a budget, there are a few bargains to be had. Possibly the cheapest way is by grabbing a hotdog at the 'Enjoy kiosk' on, you guessed it, Phinikoudes Avenue. Hotdogs are just €1 and rather enjoyable.
