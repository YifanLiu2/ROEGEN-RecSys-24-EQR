Dubrovnik is an old city on the Adriatic Sea coast in the extreme south of Croatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist resorts of the Mediterranean, a seaport and the centre of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its population is about 43,000 in 2011. Dubrovnik is nicknamed "Pearl of the Adriatic" and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The city of Dubrovnik (Latin: Ragusa) was built on maritime trade. In the Middle Ages it became the only city-state in the Adriatic to rival Venice. Supported by its wealth and skilled diplomacy, the city achieved a remarkable level of development during the 15th and 16th centuries. Furthermore, Dubrovnik was one of the centres of the development of the Croatian language and literature, home to many notable poets, playwrights, painters, mathematicians, physicists and other scholars.
Today Dubrovnik is the proudest feather in Croatia's tourist cap, an elite destination, and one of the most beautiful towns in the Mediterranean. Just like many destinations in the Adriatic, it is much more expensive and tourism-centered than other places in Croatia. It has managed to survive many centuries, with constant threats to its territory, particularly from the mighty Ottoman Empire and Venice. As early as the 19th century, it was discovered by celebrities as a place to be seen. George Bernard Shaw once said that "those who seek paradise on Earth should come to Dubrovnik and find it". Royalty, presidents and diplomats have all favored the city. The late Pope John Paul II was a fan of Dubrovnik and was even made an honorary citizen. Of the 23 top luxury hotels in Croatia in 2010, 13 were in Dubrovnik. The city became famous for a new audience in the 2010s as one of the sets of the Game of Thrones television series.
Dubrovnik is steeped in stunning architecture and sculptural detail, and boasts spectacular churches, monasteries, museums, and fountains. A multitude of typical towns and excursions include: the Elaphiti Islands, the attractive town of Cavtat, the Konavle valley, Mljet Island, Korčula Island, Ston and Peljesac Peninsula. The neighbouring towns of Kotor and Perast in Montenegro or Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina also make for intriguing day trips.
Dubrovnik Airport (DBV IATA) (is about 20 km (12 mi) to the south of the city.).
The following airlines operate flights to/from Dubrovnik Airport:
Aer Lingus (Dublin-seasonal), Aeroflot (Moscow - seasonal), Air Serbia (Belgrade-seasonal), Austrian Airlines (Vienna), Bmibaby (East Midlands-seasonal), British Airways (London-Gatwick-seasonal), Croatia Airlines (Amsterdam, Athens, Belgrade-seasonal, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, London-Gatwick, Munich, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Pula, Rome-Fiumicino, Split, Tel Aviv, Vienna, Zagreb, Zürich), DanubeWings (Bratislava), EasyJet (Berlin-Schönefeld-seasonal, London Gatwick-seasonal), Geneva-seasonal, Liverpool-seasonal, London Gatwick-seasonal, Milan-Malpensa-seasonal, Paris-Orly-seasonal), Finnair (Helsinki), Eurowings (Berlin-Schönefeld, Cologne/Bonn, Hamburg), Iberia Airlines (Madrid-seasonal), Iberia operated by Air Nostrum (Valencia-seasonal), Israir (Tel Aviv - seasonal), TUIfly Belgium (Brussels-seasonal), Jet2.com (Belfast-seasonal, Edinburgh-seasonal, Leeds-seasonal, Manchester-seasonal), Lufthansa (Munich), Luxair (Luxembourg), Norwegian Air Shuttle (Bergen, Oslo-Gardermoen, Stavanger, Stockholm-Arlanda, Trondheim, Warsaw),Tarom (Bucharest - Henri Coanda, seasonal) Thomson Airways (London Gatwick, London-Luton, Manchester-seasonal), Turkish Airlines (Istanbul-seasonal), Vueling (Barcelona-seasonal), Wizzair (London-Luton-seasonal)
The exact list of destinations and airlines, especially the low-cost ones, changes each year, but there is always a year-round service to/from Zagreb and seasonal scheduled and charter flights to/from many other airports in Europe.
Croatia Airlines operates buses between the airport and the main bus station in Kantafig (€6, 45 min), which is  km northwest of the Old Town. Taxis from the airport to the centre will cost €43. Going to the airport a bus aims to leave the main bus station 2 hr before each international flight, and costs €10 one-way and €14 return, as of Jan 2024. Departure times are also displayed in the tourist information office at Pile Gate. The bus passes close to the Old Town en route to the airport and you can board this bus at the bus stop on Petra Kresimira 4 just above the Old Town, by the lower cable car station. Make sure you wave furiously otherwise the driver may not stop.
The trip from Split along the coastal road (Jadranska magistrala or D8) is a beautiful scenic journey passing small, quaint villages and other tourist destinations. Just know that in the summer months the trip is likely to take several hours longer than anticipated. What looks like a short trip on a map can take six hours.
A much faster way of simply getting from Split to Dubrovnik by car is to take the A1 highway to Ploče and then continue via Opuzen towards Dubrovnik.
Traditionally, both routes to Dubrovnik required you to briefly cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the Pelješac Bridge bypassing B&H opened in July 2022. It spans from Komarna to the Pelješac peninsula and is slated to cut an hour off the drive time to Dubrovnik. Unusually for an expensive new megaproject, there are no plans to levy a toll on the bridge. The temporary downside of this option is the connecting roadworks on the peninsula haven't all finished, and so you'll partly be using narrower, older roads until you rejoin the D8 after Ston.
If you choose to stay on the old D8 road (called M2 in Neum), you will need to cross two border checkpoints: from Croatia to B&H, and back into Croatia. B&H is outside the EU, so full customs and immigration checks are carried out and delays are common in summer.
The main bus station is in Kantafig, near Port Gruz and the Tudjman bridge,  km northwest of the Old Town. Local bus 7 operates between this station and Babin kuk, and bus 1 serves Old Town.
Direct buses run to/from Zagreb (€28-31, 11 hr, 7 daily), Korčula (€14, 3 hr, 1 daily), Mostar (€14, 3 hr, 2 daily), Orebic (€14,  hr, 1 daily), Rijeka (€53, 12 hr, 3 daily), Sarajevo (€21, 5 hr, 1 daily), Split (€14-21,  hr, 14 daily), Zadar (€27, 8 hr, 7 daily). In the high season, there is also a daily bus leaving at 11:00 going to the Montenegro cities of Herceg Novi, Bar, Kotor, and Budva. And at 15:00 to Prijedor and Banja Luka (10 hr) in Bosnia. A one-way trip to Budva costs €10. The return tickets are much cheaper and advisable, just look out for the choice of the bus company.
When coming by bus from Split or cities further north, police officers may board the bus and you may be asked for a valid identity document when crossing the Neum corridor which belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina. While the bus companies list trip duration of approx. 4 hr, be prepared for a ride of closer to -6 hr, including two lots of border checks.
For the best views, sit on the side of the bus facing the sea; from Split and Bosnia-Herzegovina this is on the right, and from Montenegro and the airport this is on the left.
A departure listing for the international bus station is available at the website of the city bus operator. Further details can be found online.
On all intercity buses you pay a separate fee of €2 to the driver for luggage. So keep some change ready.
Cruise ships often visit, usually docking at Port Gruz near the main bus station,  km northwest of Old Town. The easiest way to get downtown is on local buses 1, 1A and 1B, which circulate almost constantly. Some cruise ships anchor offshore and tender passengers directly into the Old Port.
Ferries from Rijeka: Jadrolinijadead link ferries run along the coast, calling at Split, Stari Grad, Korčula and Sobra on the way. Journey time is up to 20 hr, so get a cabin. The restaurant has decent food at reasonable prices. While the journey is scenic there is nothing in the way of entertainment. Come prepared with a good book or just sit on deck and watch the Adriatic Sea go by. This is more than enough entertainment for an afternoon.
Ferries from Bari in Italy: the dull engine vibration or the swaying of the boat from high winds are likely to keep you awake. Cabins are strongly recommended. Although you can sit comfortably enough inside with the cheaper deck pass, interior temperature is 16⁰C or below and makes for a chilly night even in the height of summer.
With your own boat: There are several marinas in Dubrovnik and along the coast, but if you are entering or leaving Croatia you must clear immigration and customs. The year-round facility is Gruž Harbour by the ferry terminal, across the bay from Frapa Marina. It's open 24 hours, call +385 20 772 065 or tune in to the Coastguard frequency and follow instructions. The facility further south at Cavtat is only open in summer.
The Ćiro Trail is a 157-km cycling route from Mostar in Herzegovina. It's a rail trail following the tracks of a dismantled Austro-Hungarian narrow gauge railway, and crosses several 19th-century tunnels and bridges.
42°38′26″N 18°6′32″EMap of the Dubrovnik Old Town
The Old Town can be comparatively difficult to navigate on first appearances, as it really is a warren of little streets. There are however signs at the entrances to many of these streets advertising what businesses, shops, restaurants and accommodation are to be found in that direction.
Some of these signs appear to be either intentionally misleading or woefully out of date. For example, there is no office of any bus company within the Old Town, despite what the signs may say.
The city is completely pedestrianised and easily small enough to get around on foot, some of the streets are a little steep though.
The sea taxis (like a motorboat) operate from the bay area, and go to the castle, they accommodate about 3-4 people and are a generally good option. Not expensive, but not cheap either. Still, it's a worthwhile choice for families.
If you are not staying in Old Town, it's relatively simple get there by bus, as just about every one leads to the Old Town. However, it might be advisable to get a timetable 1 just in case. It costs € for tickets bought at any kiosk, or €2 bought on the bus; ticket valid for 1 hr. At selected kiosks (including the international bus station) you can purchase a day pass for €4. This pass is valid for 24 hr of unlimited travel on the city bus network, starting from the first validation. The easiest way to get from the Main Bus Station to the Old Town is by using the (mostly modern and air-con equipped) buses number 1, 1A and 1B, which circulate almost constantly. These buses can be boarded from the bus stop just outside the Main Bus Station. Apart from this, there is another bus service which comes inside the bus station and drops you directly at the Old Town. Schedules are available at the information counter of the Main Bus Station. Buses in Dubrovnik are operated by Libertas and a map of the bus network can be found in their website.

Dubrovnik was heavily bombed in late 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence (part of a series of wars in the region). Almost all of the damage has been repaired; however, if you look closely around the old town, mortar damage in the cobblestone streets and shrapnel marks in the stone houses are visible. The Dubrovnik Pass (€35 one day, €45 three days, €55 seven days) is worth considering, as it has the same price as the entry to the City Walls, and includes most of the museums in the Old Town, in addition to unlimited bus rides within the town for the duration of the pass.

The uniform Baroque architecture of the houses in Placa, with shops on the street level and their 'knee-like' entrances, got its present-day form in the restoration of the City taking place after the disastrous earthquake in 1667, when a large number of luxurious Gothic and Renaissance palaces had been destroyed. The architectural design of Placa reveals effective solutions and the business sense of the Dubrovnik Republic in those difficult times. Today, Placa is still the shopping centre and venue of major events.

These were put in during the Tito era and are ideal for one or two sunbathers. Walking further along is an excellent local fish restaurant - ideal for ending the day. The walk back is not particularly well lit, but perfectly safe.

Above the entrance to the fortress is an inscription that says "Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro" which translates to "Freedom is not sold for all the gold in the world".

Dubrovnik is an excellent starting point for exploring southern Adriatic coast primarily Elaphite islands, Korčula, Pelješac and Mljet. There are many charter agencies where you can charter a sailing or motor yacht which are based in Dubrovnik. Majority of them operate from ACI marina Dubrovnik (42°40,3’ N 18°07,6’ E) which is based in Komolac about 2 nautical miles away from the entrance to the port Gruz, and 6 km away from the old town. It is open throughout the whole year.
AYachtCharterDubrovnik.comdead link operates from Komolac and offers a unique selection of yachts and other type of sailboats great for a family vacation.
Dubrovnik is characterized by Mediterranean climate and generally light NW winds, making a yacht charter holiday very popular with couples with younger children and less experienced skippers and crews. A strong north wind known as the Bora is more usual during autumn and winter.
When you charter a yacht through charter agency and arrive to designated marina there are a few things that need to be done. The most important thing is the yacht check-in (usually Saturday around 16:00). Take your time doing yacht check in. Familiarise yourself with the chartered yacht and with the yacht equipment.
The rule of thumb is the more time you take for the yacht check in, the less time you will need for the yacht check out. After that you have to do the shopping for the charter vacation.
Don't neglect the grocery shopping because the sea is unpredictable and you don't want to get stuck on the boat without anything to eat or drink. You can do the shopping in a marina however the prices are usually much higher there, or you can order from yacht provisioning services who usually deliver the products to the marina at no extra fee.

Directions to the Cable Car are difficult to find in the Old City. €16 round trip.
A lane with tourist shops in Dubrovnik
There are few ATMs outside the Old Town. Avoid Euronet cash machines located in touristy areas since they may charge random extra fees depending on your card. OTP Banka doesn't charge any extra if you choose charging in the local currency.
There are many local artisans who specialize in domestic crafts. Popular purchases include: handmade tablecloths, linens and napkins. Many merchants claim that the necktie was invented in Croatia. Another local speciality is little dolls dressed in local garb.

You're probably aware of the 2011-2019 TV fantasy series called Game of Thrones. GOT is everywhere in Dubrovnik, and is believed to have added significantly to tourist congestion.
Somewhat surprisingly, some car parts shops in the Dubrovnik area sell bicycles; they are easy to notice, as new bikes are standing outside in front of the shop. These shops may also carry some bicycle accessories and spare parts, but they don't do any bicycle repair. As of 2014, there was no dedicated bicycle shop in town; there was one person (Tonći Kera, see below) who works as a bicycle mechanic in his spare time, in a shed next to his apartment building, while having a day job elsewhere.
Tonći Kera, meštar za bicikle, P. Zoranića 1 (ask at the garage), ☏ +385 20 436-776. This is not a regular bicycle repair shop, however the operator of this local garage offers a service.
Sponza Palace (Palača Sponza)
There is a wide range of restaurants in the Old Town, mostly offering a very similar menu of local seafood and some meat dishes. The cuisine may not be very imaginative, but it is usually of good quality and very fresh.
Restaurants can be crudely separated into (slightly) cheaper tourist-trap places, and more expensive but first class gastronomic restaurants. There are a few pizzerias, mostly wood-fired and quite acceptable. The Kraš chocolate sold at stores is delicious. Dubrovnik, more so than the rest of Croatia, is well aware of its status as a tourist hot-spot. Rents for restaurant premises are high and consequently the prices on the menus reflect this.
Note that in the off peak season of November–March nearly all the top-end restaurants close, leaving only a handful of desperate tourist trap enterprises operating and still charging high prices. You can however still eat well and discounts can be negotiated.
Dubrovnik cuisine is characteristically not very spicy and is famous for traditionalism. Many popular meals are characteristic of Dubrovnik such as zelena menestra (it is the name for many sorts of cabbages and other vegetables with meat), the meat dish pašticada and the famous caramel-based dessert dubrovačka rozata.
Since Dubrovnik restaurants are quite popular, many mid-range and high-end establishments provide the option of online reservation. English-language menus are found everywhere.

Lady Pi-Pi (from Pile Gate second street on left right at the top of the steps).

The most popular spirit in Croatia is home made rakija. This is a very strong distilled drink made from a variety of fruits. Examples include šljivovica, made from plums, loza, made from grapes, and orahovica, made with walnuts. All are quite strong.
There are many excellent local wines from both the Pelješac Peninsula and Konavle and it is often less expensive than soft drinks like Coca Cola. However, be careful when purchasing wine from unlicensed dealers. Though the price is very attractive, with some being as low as € per litre, it can sometimes be of low quality. Croatian beer is also good and popular, though none is made in the Dubrovnik region.
There are numerous cafes throughout the Old Town and the entire city with prices varying according to the location (particularly, those located on the Stradun are by far the most expensive but you are paying for the ambiance and people-watching as well). Most cafes serve a wide variety of drinks all day.
Walk towards the sea from Stradun near the Ploce gate, and you'll hit a tiny square with outdoor seating by 4 or 5 different pubs, with live music playing, and large cocktail pitchers with very low alcohol content.
Cafe Buža, Iza Mura (Follow a sign that says ‘cold drinks’ and enter through a hole in the wall on the south side of the Old Town. Just wander up the stairs (on the right side of Stradun coming from Pile gate), until you hit the city walls, and then walk all the way down.). The tables and chairs are set out on the side of the cliff and the beers are served in bottles and plastic cups. You can sunbathe on the rocks or do some cliff-diving but do watch for rocks below. This is lovely in the evening, when the sun is setting and you gaze over at island of Lokrum. Eclectic chilled out music plays unobtrusively in the background. There isn’t much in the way of shelter apart from some palm leaves so Buža won’t open in bad weather. Higher price range. (updated Feb 2018)

Beer Factory, Ul. Miha Pracata 6. Despite its sterile sounding name, this place has a lovely courtyard out the back. Its real draw however is that it is possibly one of the cheapest places to get a beer in the old town. Some reasonably priced snacks are also available. (updated Aug 2017)

Walk into it, turn right, pass a small building, then ascend a lot of steps.), ☏ +385 20 312 674. Dingy club, predominantly metal but seems to cater for anything deemed alternative.

Dubrovnik is a very safe city, though the usual precautions should be taken to protect yourself from pick-pocketing.
The streets in the old town can be quite slippery as they've been smoothed down for centuries by people walking over them. At night, avoid the smaller old town streets and stick to the more modern ones with street-lighting (Victorian gaslamps on brackets).
Since the summer of 2023, using suitcases with wheels in the old city can lead to a fine of at least €250.
