Harare is home to some two million people, with most in central Harare but some 500,000 in the surrounding districts of Rural Harare, Chintungwiza and Epworth. Once a city of modern buildings, wide thoroughfares, numerous parks and gardens, it suffered from increasing disrepair thanks to Zimbabwe's economic crisis, though there has been some improvement since the adoption the US dollar as Zimbabwe's currency has facilitated some investments.
Harare's airport is the major gateway for flights into the country. Air Zimbabwe also operated a small network of domestic flights before ceasing operations. However, an increasing number of foreign airlines are flying into Harare these days. They include South African Airways with direct flights from Johannesburg. Ethiopian Airlines from Addis Ababa, Kenya Airways from Nairobi, TAAG Angola Airlines from Luanda and Egypt Airdead link from Cairo via Dar es Salaam and KLM from Amsterdam.
Taxis from the airport to the main hotels cost $25. This exorbitant fixed price, given the relatively short distance and great age of the taxis, is attributed by the drivers to the high fees that they have to pay to the airport authority.
Bulawayo has departures three times a week at 20:00, arriving next morning around 08:00. $12 for a sleeper and $10 for a seat. Trains from Mutare, at the border with Mozambique, run three times a week departing Mutare also at 21:00, arrival time in Harare is early morning at 18:00. $7 for 1st class sleeper. $5 for 2nd class sleeper. There are no international trains to Harare except occasional cruise trains.

The condition of the roads in Zimbabwe has deteriorated dramatically since the government has failed to maintain them. Most of the country is now without street lights. The main highways are still in a good state of repair outside of the cities: traffic is so light now that damage from trucks is minimal.
A good road from Johannesburg allows easy access. However, be careful of the sometimes frightening drops at the side of the roads, at the edge of the tarmac, particularly with oncoming trucks at night. Driving at is not advised.
You should be all right without a 4x4 unless you head into rural areas and game parks. If you enter from South Africa, ensure that your insurance waiver is valid for Zimbabwe.
Buses from Johannesburg are easily available ranging from Eagle Liner (for R330). Greyhound (for R450) and Intercape (R420). The bus takes between 16-24 hours. Delays at the border are very common and typically range 3-8 hr, but they can be as much as 20 hr at Christmas time. Intercape, which has the largest intercity network in southern Africa also have buses from Mutare, Masvingo, Gweru, and Bulawayo.
Most ordinary long-distance bus services arrive at the Mbare Terminal, 3 km southwest of the Central district. The terminal itself is giant, hectic, confusing, and dangerous. There are several disconnected regions of the terminal, and finding something as simple as a taxi can require walking over 500 m through markets and alleys. Although minibuses to Mbare depart from the 4th Street Terminal in Central (at 4th and Mugabe), it may be worth taking a taxi, which will be able to find a bus to your destination for you.
"Luxury" buses (including Eagle Liner/Greyhound/Intercape) arrive and depart from the modern Roadport terminal at 5th & Mugabe.

Harare is very spread out. The best option to get around is by car, which is easier now that dollarization has made fuel shortages a thing of the past.
