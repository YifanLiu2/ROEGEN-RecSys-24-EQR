Jodhpur (Hindi: जोधपुर) is the second largest city in the state of Rajasthan. It is called the Gateway to Thar, as it is on the edge of the Thar desert. It is also called the Sun City as the sun shines (bright and hot) almost every day of the year.
The Blue City of Brahmpur from the ramparts of Mehrangarh Fort
The word jodhpurs (riding breeches, cut at the hips but tight fitting from knee to ankle, usually worn while riding horses or playing polo) owes its etymology to this city.
Jodhpur is a historic city and the origin dates to the year 1459 AD when it was founded by Rao Jodha, the Rajput chieftan of the Rathores. The Rathore kingdom was also known as the Marwar and was the largest in Rajputana.
The city was built as the new capital of the state of Marwar to replace the ancient capital Mandore, the ruins of which can be seen near what is now the Mandore Gardens. The people of Jodhpur and surrounding areas are hence also commonly called as Marwaris.
Jodhpur is also known as the Blue City, because most houses in the old city are painted in shades of blue. This is particularly noticeable on the north side of the town, known as Brahmpuri due to the many Brahmins that live there.
The forts and palaces, temples and havelis, culture and tradition, spices and fabrics, colour and texture, a booming handicrafts industry, combine to make this historic city worth a visit.

By car, bicycle and motorcycle
The narrow lanes of the inner walled city of Jodhpur are best traversed by cars, but can also be explored by bicycle or motorcycle/scooter. There are many car rental companies available.
Mehrangarh Fort. Dominates the city and is the largest fort in all Rajasthan. Founded in 1458 as the site of Rao Jodha's new capital — hence the name, Jodhpur — the city has grown around it, and in the 500 years that have passed the fort has never been taken by force. It's easy to see why: it occupies the entire top of a 150-m hill with commanding views all around, with 3 km of massive ramparts built around the edges. An English-owned company 'Flying Fox' operate a zipline tour in the beautiful Chokelao Gardens within the fort. ₹ 600.
The name "Fort" belies the size of the complex, which houses the Maharaja's palace, several temples and, tucked away in the back, an extensive garden still farmed to this day. Highlights within the palace include:
Chamunda Mataji Temple. Tucked away at the far end of the battlements, this temple is devoted to Rao Jodha's favourite goddess and remains a local favorite to this day.
Moti Mahal. (Pearl Hall). Pearl-coloured inside and decorated with coloured glass windows, this is where the Maharaja held his audiences, with the five alcoves on the far wall allowing his queens to listen.
Phool Mahal. (Flower Hall). The most extravagant of them all, this was the Maharaja's pleasure chamber, for dancing girls and revelry.
Sheesh Mahal. (Mirror Hall). Just what the name says.
Zenana Deodi. The inner sanctum of the palace once guarded by eunuchs, this is where the Maharaja's wives whiled away their days. The delicate sandstone screens and carvings are exquisite.
A number of people are employed here and there to add flavour by dressing in period costume and doing photogenic things like playing traditional instruments and smoke opium (yes, the real thing). Snap away, but they'll appreciate a tip if you do. The museum also includes galleries devoted to howdahs (elephant-mounted seats), palanquins, fine arts, weaponry and the inevitable Turban Gallery.
Entry for foreigners is ₹600, and includes an excellent audio guide, or ₹400 for foreign students. ₹100 photography fee.
Entry to the fort is free each year on its birthday (about the 12 May), and is not as crowded as you would think.
Jaswant Thada (1 km downhill from Mehrangarh (easily walked).). Royal cenotaphs built in marble, with a picturesque location next to a natural desert lake with lots of birds. Great view over the city and of the fort, as well as small well-kept gardens. Entry ₹50 foreigners, ₹30 Indian. It is also free on the birthday of the Fort (about the 12th of May).
Mandore (7 km outside the city). The ancient capital of Marwar, before Jodhpur was built.
Umaid Bhawan Palace. Clearly visible to the south of the city and completed only in 1944, this is the last great palace built in India. The Maharaja of Jodhpur lives here to this day, but half the building has been converted to a 5-star hotel (see Sleep) and there is also a small museum on grounds (₹100 for foreigners, ₹30 for Indians, ₹10 for children 5 to 11 years, open 9AM-5PM). A few vintage cars are also on display in glass enclosures. You'll have to take a rickshaw to get here, and it's best to ask them to wait: around ₹100 for a round-trip with an hour's waiting time.

Fabrics for sale, Sardar Market
The city's main shopping area is Nai Sadak, lined mostly with sari and shoe shops and leading into Sardar Market, a bustling Indian market with a riot of sights, sounds and smells. The clocktower in the centre is a useful orientation point. Best try different shops by yourself, as rickshaw drivers and other locals will do their best to direct you into certain shops where they can earn a commission for sales; you can expect to get better prices if the shopkeepers do not have to pay a percentage to these other guys. And be prepared to spend a good hour or more in a shop chatting with the very friendly owners over a cup of masala chai. This is the true highlight of Rajasthani hospitality. You will find Rajasthan (and especially Jodhpur) to be full of amiable and kind people who will be quick to offer you chai as a symbol of genuine hospitality first and foremost (not at all significant of an attempt to coerce you to buy). It is not uncommon for them to turn their shop upside down to show you all of their goods, as many are quite proud of their business. Popular souvenirs include:
Handicrafts these are handmade (made to look like old antiques), the handicraft industry is a booming industry in this city.
Mojris or Jootis. Shoes with a pointed front, a must-have accessory if you plan on dressing like a Rajput Maharaja.
Spices and tea Expect to pay ₹100-150 for each 200 g packet of spices or 150 g packet of tea. Among the highlights are the various masala mixes: different one for vegetables, rice, meat, fish, etc.; individual spices: especially cardamom, vanilla, and saffron; tea: including the cinnamon-infused Kashmiri Khawa, masala mix to add to assam/darjeeling, and ginger tea. Be sure to stop in various different shops as each store has their own recipe for mixing their own blend.

Google Maps: the application is quite reliable about the streets and routes of Jodhpur. Incase needed the same can also be used when in need.
This is a comparatively safe city, however it is advisable not to venture out late in the night alone. Only take advice on directions, travel and other things from the concierge desks at the hotel where you are staying or from some other reliable and trustworthy people. Local district administration is extremely helpful, so they too may be contacted in case the need arises.
While travelling in trains or buses, avoid any snacks offered by seemingly well meaning strangers. There have been some incidents where tourists or even locals have been drugged and robbed after consuming narcotic-laced biscuits or tea. Though the incidents of rape or sexual assault are far and few in between, women should avoid wearing revealing clothes in public places since hooligans are known to harass women. Wearing a hijab or having a male companion will avoid this.
The following numbers can be dialed from any mobile or fixed line phone.
Ambulance - 102, (+91-240)-2473301, (+91-240)-2473302
Beware of touts selling rail tickets or promising reservations on trains. It is a criminal offence to buy and sell tickets except from recognized agents or the reservation offices.

Ranakpur - Ranakpur is widely known for its magnificent marble Jain temple devoted to Lord Adinath and is a "must see", between Jodhpur and Udaipur, in a valley on the western side of the Aravalli Range. Easily accessed by road, Ranakpur is around 100 km north of Udaipur. Light colored marble has been used for the construction of this grand temple. The temple, with its distinctive domes, rises from the slope of a hill. Over 1444 marble pillars, carved in exquisite detail, support the temple. The pillars are all differently carved and no two pillars are the same. There is one beautiful carving made out of a single marble rock where there are 1008 heads of snakes and numerous tails over the head of Lord ParsvaNatha. One cannot find the end of the tails. The image faces all four cardinal directions. The temple is designed as chaumukha—with four faces. The construction of the temple and quadrupled image symbolize the Jain Tirthankara's conquest of the four cardinal directions and hence the cosmos.
