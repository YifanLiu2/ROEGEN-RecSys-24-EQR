Quebec's Îles-de-la-Madeleine (occasionally Magdalen Islands) are an island chain in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, off the coast of Prince Edward Island and the Gaspé Peninsula. Acadian culture is strong and vibrant in this mostly-francophone region.
The Magdalen Islands or Îles-de-la-Madeleine are a windswept chain of islands connected by sand dunes and beautiful cold water beaches. Lagoons, caps, green valleys, red cliffs and brightly coloured houses form the panorama of this archipelago in the heart of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Havre-Aubert, on the island of the same name, is a member of "Les plus beaux villages du Québec".
All of the dozen islands of the archipelago are connected to each other by land with the exception of l'île d'Entrée which can be reached by local ferry. The population of the archipelago is about 12,600. Although part of Quebec, Acadian culture is very much alive in the Magdalen Islands ("mon île, mon pays"). The islanders are known for having retained their unique accent and for their warm hospitality.
There is one small town, Cap-aux-Meules, where most services are located; the rest of this isolated group of islands is rural, with a few tiny villages.
Accommodation is often in rented cabins. Bed and breakfasts are also available and often cheaper for 2 persons. Camping is possible; however, exposure to wind (given the lack of trees and proximity to the ocean) can make this unpleasant.
Prices for excursions and various tourist activities are variable but generally expensive, something to consider for the budget traveller. During the high tourist season (July-August) lodging can be expensive and booked out. Early September would be a wonderful time to visit this region.
The Îles-de-la-Madeleine use the Atlantic time zone (UTC-4 in winter), an hour ahead of the rest of Québec but the same time zone as the three Maritime provinces.
If you have only one full day (and a car) you can easily drive from Cap-aux-Meules to each end of the islands and back, but it would be rushed, and wouldn't leave you much time for exploring the dunes or walking on the beaches. Two days will give you a much better experience. With a third day, you could take the ferry to Île d'Entrée to roam its trails, or lie on the beach or spend more time exploring the dunes. The islands would be an ideal place to "get away from it all" for a week or months.
The amalgamated Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine municipality covers most of the archipelago. Created in 2002 by the fusion of all former municipalities on the archipelago, Cap-aux-Meules, Fatima, Grande-Entrée, Grosse-Île, Havre-aux-Maisons, L'Étang-du-Nord and L'Île-du-Havre-Aubert, it holds both "municipality" and "municipal regional county" status.
The municipality of Grosse-Île regained its independence in 2006, so Grosse-Île (or Grosse Isle in English) is the only municipality on the islands not part of "la municipalité des Îles-de-la-Madeleine".
94% of residents are francophone and 6% anglophone. When visiting Îles-de-la-Madeleine, if you speak even just a little bit of French everyone will be a lot more friendly and go out of their way to help.
The anglophone communities are Grosse-Île, Old Harry and l'île d'Entrée.
Île d'Entrée. The only inhabited island in the archipelego that is not joined by land to the others.
Île du Havre Aubert. The most isolated, largest (by area) and southernmost island of the archipelago is also the most wooded, as it has the only real forest on the Magdalen Islands. Two parallel sand dunes join the island to l'île du Cap aux Meules in the north; the Havre-aux-Basques dune (which carries Route 199) and the west dune. At the eastern end of the island, the Sandy Hook dune extends as a long beach toward l'île d'Entrée. This island, the first of the archipelago to be permanently inhabited, hosts two villages: Havre-Aubert and Bassin.
Île du Cap aux Meules (Grindstone Island). The central and second largest island of the archipelago includes a hospital and other centralized services. The port of entry to the Magdalen Islands, it serves as the starting point for fishing boat trips, viewing the cliffs and visiting the three settlements on the island: Cap-aux-Meules, Fatima and L'Etang-du-Nord.
Île du Havre aux Maisons. Includes three settlements: Cap-Rouge, Pointe-Basse and Dune-du-Sud. Hosts the only airport on the archipelago, as well as a maritime research centre (le Centre de recherche sur les milieux insulaires et maritimes) affiliated with the Université du Québec à Rimouski. Mytiliculture (mussel farming, "l'élevage de moules") is carried out here.
Île de la Pointe aux Loups (Île aux Loups). Includes the village of Pointe-aux-Loups; this island is known for its huge beaches.
Île de Grosse Île (Grosse Isle). The only part of the archipelago that is not part of "la municipalité des Îles-de-la-Madeleine", this island contains the most important protected areas in the îles de la Madeleine.
Île de Grande Entrée (Île de la Grande Entrée). The last of the islands to be permanently inhabited, includes the anglophone community Old Harry and the larger neighbouring francophone community of Grande-Entrée. Designated as lobster capital of Québec (capitale québécoise du homard) in 1994.
Île Brion (Brion Island). The northernmost in the archipelago, most of this land was expropriated from its owners in the 1980s and is now an ecological reserve.
