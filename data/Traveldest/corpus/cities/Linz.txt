Linz is the third largest city in Austria. It is primarily known as a major industrial centre, but also has a very picturesque historical old town including Austria's largest central square, surrounded by an impressive ensemble of Baroque architecture. Linz has tried to reposition itself as a cultural hub with numerous new museums and events. The tourist slogan of the city is "In Linz beginnt's" ("It starts in Linz").
Linz has 205,000 inhabitants (2018). It sits on the banks of the Danube (Donau) river. It is the capital of the federal province of Upper Austria (Oberösterreich) and forms the heart of Austria's second strongest economic region.
Linz is an industrial city with huge steel and chemical works on the Danube, about halfway between Salzburg and Vienna. While it does not have the touristic significance of these cities, it is an attractive and interesting destination in its own right. The fact that you are less likely to be trampled by hoards of travellers is a bonus.
The area where Linz now stands has been inhabited since prehistoric time. The name of the city supposedly stems from the celtic word for 'bent', referring to the bend of the river Danube just east of Linz. During the Roman Empire Linz was a border settlement with a Roman castle (Lentia). In the Middle Ages and the beginning of the modern era, the city profited from its location on an important crossing of the Danube. Nevertheless, Linz never gained the historical significance of cities like Salzburg and Vienna and remained fairly small well into the 19th century. In 1900, Linz had around 80,000 inhabitants. The city's fate took a significant turn after Austria became a part of the German Third Reich in March 1938. In May 1938, construction started on a gigantic steel mill on the site of a former village in the southeast of Linz ('Hermann-Göring-Werke', now part of the steel concern voestalpine AG). Linz turned into an industrial hub. Consequently, Linz was bombed heavily during World War II. Fortunately, the raids were centered on the industrial areas and the main train station, which meant that the historical city center escaped relatively unscathed.
Starting in the 1950s, Linz saw an industrial boom. However, while the population grew and the economy prospered, the city also had to learn to live with the severe environmental fallout of its factories and businesses. Linz gained a reputation as a dirty and unappealing city. While this reputation continues to this day in the heads of some Austrians, it has become completely undeserved. Extensive plant modernizations in the last three decades (as well as an industrial crisis in the 1980s) mean that air and water quality in Linz are now as good – or even better – than in the other big cities of Austria.
While Linz is still cultivating its image as a 'steel city', it has also taken great (and expensive) steps to become better known as a city of culture, music, and art. Several new museums have been constructed since the 1990s, and in 2013 the city finally inaugurated its long-planned opera house. Linz also gets a lot of international media attention because of its annual Ars Electronica Festival. It also hosts the "Klangwolke" ("sound-cloud"), a big cultural open-air spectacle with modern and traditional music and a massive light show, which is held each year in September. Linz was the European Capital of Culture in 2009.

The Main Square (Hauptplatz) with the Trinity Column (Dreifaltigkeitssäule)
When strolling through the heart of the city, one can literally sense its history. The lanes of the old town, which lies directly at the foot of the castle, communicate the feeling of past ages. Splendid town residences and chapter houses are worthy of closer scrutiny, as are the many inner courtyards hidden discretely behind arched gates. Moreover, the spacious, baroque main square with its lively hustle and bustle is never far away.
Linz is also a city of churches. With its 134-m tower and space for 20,000 people, the New Cathedral is Austria´s largest church.

The height of the tower was limited to 134 m (as it was not permitted to surpass St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna). The cathedral can accommodate 20,000 worshippers and is also notable for its stained glass windows, including the famous Linz Window with scenes from the history of Linz (left front).

St Martin's Church (Martinskirche), Römerstraße/Martinsgasse. This is regarded as the oldest original church still in existence in Austria. It was first documented in 799. A rectangular building that is no longer visible, partially extending into the nave, probably dates from the Agilofingian period (before 788). During the Carolingian period (after 788), the central structure was erected using debris from Roman buildings. This can be seen on the inside and outside, while the ground plan is marked by stone slabs. The building was redesigned as a bay church in the 11th century and the pillar arches were filled in. There are Romanesque and Gothic door and window arches dating from later alterations. Inside the building, Roman stone inscriptions and a furnace can be seen. The first bay contains a copy of the Volto-Santo picture by Lucca (around 1440). The interior of the church can be viewed through a glass door.

These announce the dedication of the column to the Holy Trinity by the guilds, the Emperor and the people of Linz in gratitude for deliverance from the dangers of war (1704), fire (1712) and plague (1713).

The latter is adorned by a stone coat-of-arms (1481) bearing the inscription "AEIOU" ("The whole world is subject to Austria") and the imperial initials. Around 1600, during the rule of Rudolph II, the castle was redesigned and expanded according to plans by the Dutch master builder Anton Muys. The powerful four-story block with two inner courtyards and the main gate to the city (Rudolfstor 1604) date from this time. During the Napoleonic wars the building served as a military hospital, and it was here that the great city fire of 1800 broke out (destruction of the south wing and a part of the transept). Beginning in 1811, the remaining buildings were used as the provincial prison and from 1851 until 1945 as a barracks.Between 1953 and 1963, the fortress was rebuilt and restored as the Schlossmuseum Linz. It contains permanent exhibitions of art from the Middle Ages to the present day, historical weapons and musical instruments, coins, folklore and technical history, as well as the Kastner collection.

Drinking in Linz is varied and not that cheap; although if you drink outside of the city centre you will find that the cost of drinks are less than in the centre.
Local beers and warm "Glühwein" (hot, spiced/mulled wine) in winter. Upper-Austrian's "national drink" is Most (it´s cider but not fizzy), and Zipfer, Gösser, and Kaiser beer. There are many Austrian beers, of course.
