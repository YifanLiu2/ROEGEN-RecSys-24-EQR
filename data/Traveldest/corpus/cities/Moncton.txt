Moncton is a city in Southeastern New Brunswick, Canada, inland of the Bay of Fundy and Acadian Coast. Moncton has a population of about 72,000 (2016), with a metropolitan population of about 145,000 (2016), making it the largest city and the largest metropolitan city in New Brunswick.
The city adopted the motto "Resurgo" meaning "I rise again" after its rebirth from the collapse of being a railway centric town. The city's economy is stable and diversified, with core strengths in a bi-lingual workforce, primarily based on its traditional transportation, distribution, retailing, and commercial heritage, and supplemented by strength in the educational, health care, financial, information technology, and insurance sectors. Moncton's economy has received national recognition and the local unemployment rate is consistently less than the national average.
Just to the east of Moncton is Dieppe (population 27,000 in 2019). It is the fourth-largest city in the province, and the largest predominantly francophone city in Canada outside Quebec.
Across the Petitcodiac River from Moncton on the south bank is Riverview, with about 20,000 people in 2016.
The Moncton area was settled by Europeans in 1733, but is considered to have been founded in 1766 with the arrival of Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants from Philadelphia. It began as an agricultural settlement. The city was named for Lt. Col. Robert Monckton, the British officer who had captured nearby Fort Beauséjour a century earlier.
A significant wooden shipbuilding industry had developed in the community by the mid-1840s, allowing for the civic incorporation in 1855, but the shipbuilding economy collapsed in the 1860s. In the 1870s, the community's economy rebounded, mainly due to a growing railway industry. In 1871, the Intercolonial Railway of Canada had chosen Moncton to be its headquarters, and Moncton remained a railway town for well over a century until the closure of the Canadian National Railway (CNR) locomotive shops in the late 1980s.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
The climate tends to be more continental than maritime during the summer and winter seasons, with maritime influences somewhat tempering the transitional seasons of spring and autumn.
Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny. Daytime high temperatures usually range a few degrees below the freezing point. Major snowfalls typically average 20–30 cm (8–12 in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably over the course of the last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result.
Summers are warm and humid. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30 °C (86 °F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. It can occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during November to mid-January.
