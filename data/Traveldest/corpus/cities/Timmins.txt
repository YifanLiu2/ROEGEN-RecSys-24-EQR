Timmins is a city in Northern Ontario with a population of nearly 41,000 (2021 census). The city stretches over approximately 2,962 km² (1,840 sq mi) of land, making Timmins one of the largest cities in Canada, larger than Luxembourg.
The city is in one of the richest mineral producing areas in the Western Hemisphere. It is a leader in the production of gold and base metals. Main attractions are mining tours and outdoor recreation.
Human settlement in the area is at least 6,000 years old; it's believed the oldest traces found are from a nomadic people of the Shield Archaic culture.
Until contact with European settlers, the land belonged to the Mattagami First Nation peoples. Treaty Number Nine of 1906 pushed this tribe to the north side of the Mattagami Lake, the site of a Hudson's Bay trading post established in 1794. In the 1950s, the reserve was relocated to the south side of the lake, to its present location.
Gold discoveries in the Porcupine Camp during the early years of the 20th century attracted investors to the area. The gold rush of 1909 earned Timmins the nickname of the “City with the Heart of Gold”. The area became home to dozens of prospectors during the "Porcupine Gold Rush" who explored the areas around Porcupine Lake and the Frederick House River. Rich ore deposits in the Canadian Shield led to Timmins being founded as a company town to house Hollinger employees. In 1912, mine manager Alphonse "Al" Paré named the mining settlement for his uncle, Noah Timmins, who was President of Hollinger Mines.Most settlers grouped around Porcupine Lake and the Dome, one mile from the lake. Four miles down the road, around the McIntyre Mine, the hamlet of Schumacher was established. The gold mines declined in the 1950s.
Timmins has very cold winters, being in northern Ontario. Temperatures in late summer and autumn tend to be among the coldest for any major city in any Canadian province, although during the spring and summer it can get hot.

Due to the close proximity of Porcupine Lake, many lives were saved. However, one unusual tragedy occurred when a mine manager by the name of Robert A. Weiss thought he could save his family by taking them down a mine shaft. Sadly, the fire used up all the oxygen in the shaft and the whole family perished. Most bodies of the fire victims were sent home, but 17 were buried here. A monument was erected in their honour by the Toronto Board of Trade.
Gold Mine Road, This road is known to the locals as the “Backroad”. A number of mines were on this road. Since 1960, most of them have been torn down. The first mine on your left is Porcupine Gold Mines - Goldcorp (formerly Dome Mine and Porcupine Joint Venture); the only gold mine which has been in operation since 1910. The story of the discovery of the Dome reports the accidental finding of a vein of gold by a prospector who slipped on some moss while climbing the side of a mound (or dome), exposing the vein of gold. Hence, the name “Dome Mine”. Further on to your right, is the Paymaster Headframe. The Paymaster Mine was closed in 1934.

If you're driving in to the area, be warned that the roads can be snow-covered and icy in the winter and early spring - take to heart everything discussed on the winter driving page. Your best bet is winter tires (chains aren't allowed), however taking a bag of sand or kitty litter in your trunk can help you if you're stuck and spinning your tires. Most locals are happy to help push if you get stuck. In case of a breakdown, make sure that you take along a standard road safety kit with flares, gloves, and a warm blanket.
The forests surrounding the city are home to potentially dangerous wildlife such as black bears, always take caution when traversing the walking trails or when camping. One suggestion is to carry a whistle or arm yourself with bear spray to ensure your safety when enjoying the outdoors, both alone or with a group.
