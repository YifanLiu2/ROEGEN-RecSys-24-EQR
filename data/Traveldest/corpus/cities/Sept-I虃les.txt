Sept-Îles (French for "Seven Islands") is a city in Sept-Rivières on the North Shore of Quebec, approximately 230 km northeast of Baie-Comeau, on the Route des Baleines and the Route Nature aux mille délices (gourmet route).
It is the northernmost town in Quebec with any significant population. It is among the northernmost locales with a paved connection to the rest of Quebec's road network. The population is about 25,000 in 2020 according to the 2011 census, with an added population of around 3,000 First Nations (Indigenous) people living in the Uashat mak Mani-Utenam Indian Reserve in the city.

The only settlements on the road network that are farther north are Fermont, Radisson and Chisasibi, the latter two in the extreme western portion of the province at the north end of the James Bay Road. The remaining settlements at higher latitudes in the province are mostly isolated Cree, Innu, or Inuit villages, with access limited to seasonal gravel roads.
Sept-Îles is the largest city on the north shore in eastern Quebec. This city offers many cultural and artistic attractions (performance halls, artists' and craftsmen's studios, sculpture symposium) and historical points of interest (reconstruction of the Old Post Office and Amerindian prehistory). In addition, with its several sandy beaches, forests as far as the eye can see, countless bodies of water, and privileged sites for hunting and fishing (notably for salmon fishing), Sept-Îles and surrounding areas are a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts.
To get to Sept-Îles, one of the only options is to come by car. It is about 638 km from Quebec City, and 926 km from Montreal. The trip should take you 7-8 hours and 10-11 hours, respectively. The nearest town is Baie-Comeau, 232 km to the southwest (pop. 25,000), but there are some villages along the way.
The main road through the region is Route 138, which follows the north shore from Montreal through Tadoussac and Sept-Îles to Kegashka, a tiny village just beyond Natashquan. Beyond this point, there is no road at all for 450 km (the few villages are served by outport ferry from Sept-Îles). Route 138 briefly reappears at Vieux-Fort and crosses from Blanc-Sablon into Labrador.

Hitchhiking from Montreal to Quebec City is very easy; many people commute daily between those two cities.
Between Quebec City and Sept-Îles, there is only one main road (Route 138) going north-east along the shore of the St-Lawrence river. As such, hitchhiking is pretty straightforward. People travelling on this road are likely to accomplish long distances because towns and cities are few and far between. However, just going from Quebec City to Sept-Îles in your own car takes around 8 hours; add the waiting time, and getting to Sept-Îles is likely to take you 2 days of hitchhiking.
Wild camping is pretty easy during the summer months, but winter in Quebec is quite harsh and camping in winter is impossible without specialized gear (waiting for a ride at -30°C is also dangerous). Nevertheless, if you leave very early from Quebec City (or east of there), it is possible to arrive in Sept-Îles in one day.
Car is the best way to get around the city. For places within the city, walking is quite easy, but if you want to go to the beach, or any place remotely outside the city, you will definitely need a car.
At the tourist office, you can rent bicycles for $10/day. Helmets and bicycle locks are included.
There are also taxis. If you go out in the evening, a taxi is your only option if you don't want to walk.
