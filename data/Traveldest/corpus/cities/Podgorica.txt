Podgorica (Montenegrin: Подгорица) is the capital of Montenegro. While not a typical European eye candy, the city is definitely worth visiting, owing to its interesting mix of old and new, its café culture and nightlife, and its laid back Mediterranean atmosphere.
Besides being the capital of Montenegro, Podgorica is also the country's largest city, having a population of some 186,000 people (2011). The city is in central Montenegro, in the scarce Montenegrin lowlands between the Dinaric Alps and Lake Scutari.

The Podgorica area has been continuously inhabited since the Illyrian and Roman eras, with settlement on the site of today's Podgorica being firmly established during Ottoman Empire rule. Podgorica was reincorporated in Montenegro in 1878, when the city started to take a more European shape. Nazi and Allied bombings during World War II destroyed much of the historical Ottoman and Montenegro-era Podgorica architecture, and the city was reborn as the capital of Montenegro in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The city was then rebuilt and expanded in a manner typical of Eastern bloc countries, so it is mostly a modern planned city, and by no means a principal sightseeing destination.
Montenegro's coastal cities (Bar, Budva and Tivat) and its mountain resorts are within one hour's drive from the city and Tivat one hour and 45 minutes, so it is an excellent starting point for day trips to anywhere in Montenegro.

Morača River, near the road from Podgorica to Serbia
Podgorica Airport (TGD IATA) (12 km ( mi) south). Podgorica Airport airlines include Air Serbia, Austrian Airlines, Ryanair, LOT Polish Airlines, Turkish Airlines, and WizzAir. It is a hub for Montenegro's national airline carrier, Air Montenegro.
By bus – Supposedly there is a minibus, which usually waits in front of the terminal.
By taxi – Taxis can be found in abundance in front of the terminal but cost a hefty flat rate of €12–15 to the city centre, which the drivers often interpret as "per person". As with all taxis in Montenegro, you should haggle out a price in advance. From the city centre (Republic Place) to the airport, a metered taxi costs €5–6.
Since there is no bus service from Podgorica airport to the coast, as soon as you exit the terminal, you will be surrounded by guys asking if you want a taxi. At this point, they are competing to see how much they can squeeze you for. Montenegro is most definitely not a cheap country, but still, keep your wits about you. Hotels in Kotor will offer airport transfer for €70-80—probably half is more realistic. So, don't listen to guys quoting €120 or more for the drive to the coast. If you say "forget that", and take a taxi to the centre, they may try to bargain when you are in the car—at least here it is one-to-one.
By train – There are no buses or means of public transportation. The only other alternative is to turn left as you leave the terminal, trod alongside the dusty road for about 1 km until you get to a bridge, to the left of which is the totally dilapidated Aerodrom train station. Trains run roughly every hour in each direction (Bar = ca. 1 hour, Podgorica = 8 minutes). If you just hop on for Podgorica, the conductor usually won't bother you, but even if he asks you for a ticket, you can buy the ticket from him for €. Train schedule can be found here.
A taxi from Tivat Airport, a coastal city, takes 1 hr 45 min to Podgorica, and has a fixed price of €30 as of June 2018.
Train station (železnička stanica) (near the city center). Trains from coastal city Bar costs € and arrive from there at 10:22, 14:35, 15:12, 18:06 and the last one reaches Podgorica at 21:38.
One day train ("Tara") and one night train ("Lovcen") take nine hours from Belgrade via Rakovica (for Belgrade suburban lines), Bijelo Polje and Prijepolje, and continue from Podgorica to Bar; they're chronically an hour late. The day train is still cancelled (by 2022). In Belgrade for some years these trains departed from Topcider, the dreary motorail terminal in the southern burbs, but they now run from Centar station.
Bus station (Glavne autobuska stanica), Trg Golootočkih žrtava (Next to the railway station. City centre is 10 minutes walk from there. If you have any luggage, it's recommended that you either take a minibus (combi) or some of the taxis usually waiting at the station entrance.), ☏ +382 20 620430. Cashdesk 05:00-24:00. Serves number of domestic destinations, as well as those in neighbouring countries. Station tax €1–2 per person (e.g. for online tickets). (updated Mar 2023)
