Leipzig is the largest city in the German federal state of Saxony, with a population of approximately 600,000 (Oct 2019). It is the economic centre of the region, known as Germany's "Boomtown" and a major cultural centre, offering interesting sights, shopping and lively nightlife. The Gewandhausorchester is the biggest and one of the most prominent classical orchestras in Germany, and Leipzig Zoological Garden is one of the most modern zoos in Europe. The Neuseenland, outside of Leipzig, is a huge lake district.
Leipzig is well known for its large parks and the Neuseenland (lake district) outside the city centre
First documented in 1015, and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165, the city of Leipzig has fundamentally shaped the history of Saxony and of Germany. It was founded at the crossing of two ancient trade routes, Via Regia and Via Imperii. Leipzig has always been known as a place of commerce and still has large trade fairgrounds and exhibition halls known as the Leipzig Messe north of the city. Before it became common to dedicate a specific area to trade fairs, they took place in the city. Which is why many of the historical buildings were constructed by merchants, as were Leipzig's unique system of arcades and courtyards.
Other forms of exchange soon followed the trade of goods. The University of Leipzig (Latin: Alma mater lipsiensis) was founded in 1409, which makes it the second-oldest university in Germany. University facilities are scattered throughout the city, and you cannot miss the central campus at Augustusplatz. Leipzig acquired the nickname Klein Paris ("Little Paris") in the 18th century, when it became a centre of a classical literary movement largely led by the German scholar and writer Johann Christoph Gottsched.
The city is also the home of the Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas) – the starting point of peaceful demonstrations against the East German regime which led to German Reunification. The collapse of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) regime hit Leipzig's economy very heavily (as had communism), but after being on the mend since 1990, it has emerged as one of the success stories of the "New German States".
Traces of Leipzig's history are everywhere: the ring of streets around the city centre marking the former course of the city wall, the city trade houses, abandoned and repurposed industrial buildings in Plagwitz, small town structures in the outskirts where surrounding towns were incorporated during phases of rapid growth, and the battlefields of the Napoleonic wars in the south and southeast of the city.
Today it competes with long time rival Dresden for the title of "biggest city in Saxony" . In the 2011 Census, Dresden overtook Leipzig, but according to 2016 estimates, Leipzig has an edge once more. Leipzig's trendy districts are rapidly gentrifying, especially the Südvorstadt neighborhood and it has thus gained the nickname "Hypezig" which is both used derisively and somewhat appreciatively.

Leipzig is a transportation hub in Saxony and offers fast connections by rail, road and air throughout Germany. Important east-west and north-south routes have crossed here for a long time and they still do today.
Leipzig can easily be reached by car, as it is very well connected with the Autobahn system. The nearest Autobahns are A14 (North, Northeast), A9 (West) and A38 (South).

Long distance buses connect Leipzig with several major German cities. Buses stop at a bus terminal next to the Central Station's east exit and/or at the airport railway station. Bus operators include Flixbus.
An IC train at Leipzig Hauptbahnhof
Leipzig Hauptbahnhof. Leipzig was one of the most important rail travel hubs in Germany as early as the 1830s when the first long distance railway in continental Europe linking it to Dresden was built and it has regained this position after German reunification. Since December 2017, Leipzig has been one of the most important hubs for German high speed rail with the main North-South trunk line linking Munich and Berlin (via Erfurt and Nuremberg) passing through town. Due to the station being a terminus station, some trains are routed via Halle instead, but a quick S-Bahn ride gets you to Leipzig from there. Along the West-East spine from Frankfurt to Dresden high speeds are limited to the Erfurt-Leipzig section, but construction is underway to upgrade the other parts of this route and flights from the airport to Frankfurt are already becoming rarer due to better travel times.Leipzig's Hauptbahnhof is the largest terminal railway station in Europe with 26 platforms (18 plus 2 tunnel platforms still operating), and also includes a large shopping mall, a good way to waste an hour or two between connections.
Deutsche Bahn operates regular train service between Leipzig and nearby cities such as Halle (€, 25 minutes), Dessau (€14, 45 minutes), Chemnitz (€19, 65 minutes), Dresden (€30, 65 minutes), Magdeburg (€31, 75 minutes), Weimar (€22, 75 minutes), and Jena (€21, 85 minutes).
High speed trains are available to major cities in Germany including Lutherstadt Wittenberg (€21, 30 minutes), Erfurt (€28, 42 minutes), Berlin (€49, 75 minutes), Nuremberg (€87, 2 hours), Frankfurt (€88, 3 hours), Hamburg (€106, 3 hours) and Munich (€117, 3:15 hours). Prague (€59, 4 hours) can be reached with a transfer in Dresden, but direct busses between Leipzig and Prague are faster.
If you book well in advance reduced-fare (limited refunding, set date and train) tickets are available starting at €29 (€ with Bahn card 25, no Bahn card 50 discount). Your best chance on reduced fares are off-peak hours on weekdays. Even if you buy your ticket one day prior to departure on an ICE, you have a good chance of finding a reduced fare that is cheaper than the full prices (called "Normalpreis" in German) quoted above. However unlike with the Normalpreis you will have to use the train you booked and can't change it. If you aren't travelling alone, it might make sense to see whether there is a discount for the second person travelling the same route or for groups. For more on the price system of German trains see rail travel in Germany..
Also Flixtrain serves the city.
Leipzig/Halle Airport (LEJ IATA, sometimes called Schkeuditz Airport) (22 km (14 mi) north-west of central Leipzig). The airport is the biggest airport in Eastern Germany not serving Berlin, but it's still not all that busy. The airport is one of the busiest in terms of freight though which has attracted Amazon and DHL among others. Trains run between the airport and the city every 30 minutes; the trip takes 14 or 18 minutes and costs €. When arriving at the main station from the airport you have to go up the stairs for connecting services. The tram network is also directly reachable from the City-Tunnel with departure times clearly marked on displays at the exit to the trams.
Berlin Brandenburg airport (BER IATA) is just two hours away by train and offers more options. As an intercontinental flyer you should also consider Frankfurt Airport (FRA IATA). During daytime, hourly direct trains take you from the airport station Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof to Leipzig Hauptbahnhof in about 4 hours for €74 (book in advance and you can get tickets for as little as €29). Many (but not all) airlines flying to/from German airports offer rail&fly. For more see rail air alliances
The primary means of public transport is the tram. LVB operates trams and buses in Leipzig. Most lines run every 10 minutes during the day and at least hourly at night. A single-trip ticket costs €. A full day bus & tram ticket, valid until 04:00 the next morning, costs €; a day ticket for 2-5 people travelling together costs €. A weekly pass costs €. After 20:00, you must enter buses through the driver's door and show/purchase your ticket.
The tram network is structured like a star with a circle in the centre. Tram lines generally lead from the outskirts into the city, which they half-circle on the ring, and continue to someplace else in the outskirts. Bus lines provide additional direct connections that often do not touch the centre.
Trains ("S-Bahn") cross the city centre in a north-south direction through the city tunnel, connecting Hauptbahnhof and Bayerischer Bahnhof via underground stations at Markt and at Wilhelm-Leuschner Platz. From both ends of the tunnel, lines branch off in several directions towards Leipzig suburbs like Connewitz, Stötteritz, Thekla, fair area and Miltitzer Allee and beyond. The city tunnel provides fast connections north - south, but is not of great help in the east - west direction.
LVB is part of the regional integrated transport network MDV. Tickets to nearby towns and cities (e.g. Halle) are available at LVB ticket offices and vending machines. They are valid for all participating means of transportation. The fares quoted above are for MDV fare zone 110, which is more or less identical with the city. A single-trip ticket includes transfers to other lines. You have to complete your trip within one hour. Buy tickets from:
Vending machines at some stops and at all train stations, payable with coins or (small) bills
Vending machines inside the trams. Coins only
One of the LVB service offices
Some tobacco, stationery, or press shops
Stamp your ticket after boarding the first bus or tram on your itinerary, or on the platform when using a train. Week tickets are issued for 7 days from the set date, month tickets for calendar months. Day and week tickets are valid until 04:00 the next day after their validity has ended; month tickets until noon the day after their validity has ended.

A leaflet listing all the benefits is available onlinedead link.
Regular services operate until around midnight. A network of Nightliner bus lines (N1...N10) takes you around at night. All Nightliner buses start from Hauptbahnhof at 01:11, 02:22, and 03:33. They service most parts of the main tram network, but on different routes. Each line makes a loop, returning to Hauptbahnhof at the end. Check the blue network plans at stops or inside trams.
Plenty of taxis are available. They wait for customers in various designated locations around the city. You can also wave a taxi on the street if its sign is lit up. To order a taxi to your current location call 4884. Pubs, restaurants and hotels will be happy to do that for you if you are their customer. Expect a fare of €15–20 for a trip from the outskirts to the centre or vice versa.
Leipzig suffers from the same traffic problems as all cities of its size. Access to the city centre is restricted, so don't plan to go anywhere inside the inner ring of main streets.
If you still want to use a car within the city, be prepared to pay a fee for parking around the centre. Car parks are available at Hauptbahnhof, Augustusplatz, Burgplatz, and several other locations. A parking guidance system is installed on the main streets. Around the inner ring, signs point you to the different car parks and display the current number of unused parking spots. Signs are colour-coded, each color representing a car park location. Since the city centre is pretty compact, for most purposes it won't matter much where you leave your car. When you visit the Gewandhaus or the opera, the car park underneath Augustusplatz is the most convenient option with exits to both buildings.
Watch for the trams when making turns. They are stronger than your car and sometimes come from behind beside the street. At marked tram stops, if the driving lane is to the right of the track, you have to wait behind a stopping tram and let passengers get on and off. After everyone is off the street, you may pass slowly.
Most of the city of Leipzig is a designated low-emission zone (Umweltzone). Cars operating within city limits must comply with strict emission standards and have a special green sticker (Feinstaubplakette). If you enter the city without the sticker, or with a yellow or red sticker, you risk being fined.
Neues Rathaus - New Town Hall
Altes Rathaus - Old Town Hall at the Market Square
Old Town Hall (Altes Rathaus), Markt 1, ☏ +49 341 9651320. Tu-Su 10:00-18:00, M closed. Built in 1556 in the Renaissance style and remains one of Germany's largest. The position of the tower follows the ancient ideal of "golden mean". Located on the pretty main square of the city, it is a good orientation point. The Old City Hall was built 1556 by Hieronymus Lotter on basements of two Patrician houses. It is a beautiful Renaissance style building, 90 m long with arcades (1906–09), six gables and a tower. In the 18th century the tower was enlarged and it received a Baroque spire. Until 1904 the Old City Hall was home of the city administration. Then it became home of the city museum. Most impressive is the huge Banquetting Hall with Renaissance interior (open fireplaces). Many fine works of medieval religious art: altars, paintings, wood-carved sculptures, etc. Most of them were saved from churches which were deconstructed in Leipzig's surrounding. Very impressive are the rooms with interior from old Patrician houses. Also interesting: the treasure chamber (steep and narrow staircase!). This Renaissance building was erected in just nine months in 1556–57 under the direction of the architect Hieronymus Lotter. The municipal government moved into the New Town Hall in 1909. If you have a bit of luck you are allowed to visit the cellar of the building. Here you find the chamber of torture and the jail. Leipzig's Renaissance City hall contains a museum of city history which possesses the original of the only confirmed painting of Bach produced in his lifetime. It contains interesting information regarding the public executions that used to take place in the market in front of the city hall. The most famous execution was that of Woyzeck, which was made famous by the Büchner play and the opera of Alban Berg. The interior of the Old City Hall (built in 1556) is far more interesting than the outside view. Inside there's an interesting museum covering the history of Leipzig since its beginning in the 12th century. It is one of the most touristy places in the city. €6 adults, €4 concessions. (updated Oct 2021)
New Town Hall (Neues Rathaus), Martin-Luther-Ring 4-6, ☏ +49 341 123-2323. Seat of the municipal government since 1905. The building also features a 115-m tower which can be accessed by tour M-F at 11:00 and 14:00. Tower tour: €3.

Modern architecture in the style of New Objectivity, covered with a traditional red porphyr stone. Easily to be confused with a modern office building, this church dedicated in 2015 is the largest newly built church building in Eastern Germany since unification. The location is almost on historical ground, as the neighbouring New City Hall is on the spot of the medieval Pleissenburg, where Martin Luther defended his theses in the "Leipzig Debate" of 1519. The steeple, 50 m high, contrasts the (still much higher) tower of the New City Hall. During construction the official entrance had to be switched to the back side of the church, as otherwise the postal address would have been "Martin-Luther-Ring", which the Roman Church considered not appropriate and after an attempt to rename the street failed to the opposition of the city administration.

It consists of the distinctive glass hall (a landmark when entering Leipzig from the north), five exhibition halls and a conference centre. In addition to numerous exhibitions and conferences that are only of interest to businesspeople and experts, there is a number of popular fairs geared to the general public, namely the Leipzig book fair (March; cf. #Festivals), House–Garden–Leisure (February), Model–Hobby–Games (late-September/early-October), and Tourism & Caravaning (November).

Leipzig Riverside Forest (Leipziger Auwald). With an area of 2500 hectares (6180 acres), it is one of the largest riparian forests in Central Europe and one of the largest urban forests in Germany. Having an extensive forest—not on the outskirts, but in the middle of the city—is a defining feature of Leipzig. It stretches along the rivers Pleiße, Weiße Elster, and their tributaries, for more than 30 km in length and 2 to 5 km in width. Some parts are designed as landscape gardens while others are left in a near-natural state and protected as conservation areas. This "green belt" may be discovered on a walk, by bicycle, on horseback or during a canoe ride. From the Cospudener See in the south through the Clara-Zetkin-Park, west of the city centre along the Elsterflutbecken, and to the northwest between Leutzsch and Möckern you'll find a landscape that sometimes makes you forget you are in a city.

Leipzig is not located on any major river; instead there are several smaller rivers, their tributaries, and canals from the industrial era, creating a network of waterways that is grandiloquently touted as a "little Venice". Currents are weak to non-existent and motorboat traffic is rare. Thus, Leipzig's rivers and canals are perfect for amateur canoe paddlers and rowers, even for complete rookies in this field. Urban districts like Plagwitz or Schleußig and even the western parts of the city centre as well as the extensive riverside forest and parks may be discovered from the waterside, providing a completely different perspective of the city.

Leipzig is surrounded by the Neuseenland, a huge lake district
Leipzig is surrounded by several lakes, resulting from former open-cast lignite mining and now developed into places for various outdoor activities. You can spend a day on the beach, ride a canoe, or go fishing or scuba diving 10 km from the city centre.

Leipziger Gose – traditional bottle and glass
A local beer specialty is Leipziger Gose, a top-fermented brew, containing salt and coriander, with a characteristic, slightly sour flavour, that originated from Goslar but was immensely popular in Leipzig during past centuries. It has however become rather rare and is only served in a few specialised breweries and pubs nowadays, namely Gosenschenke Ohne Bedenken and Bayerischer Bahnhof (see listings below). Gose can be flavoured with green (woodruff) or red (raspberry) syrup, or mixed with liquor.
Today, most Leipzigers prefer more mainstream Pils beers and if you just order "a beer" you will most probably get a Pils by default. Ur-Krostitzer, for example, is brewed just a few kilometers north of Leipzig and was purportedly favoured by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus during his stay in the region. Leipzig's Sternburg Export is one of the cheapest among German beer brands (c. 50 cents a bottle in most supermarkets) and is preferred by the young and poor who want to get lit for little money, while only a few enthusiasts actually appreciate its taste.
A local liquor specialty is Leipziger Allasch, a kümmel (caraway-flavoured liquor), and a variety of liquors of Horn's distillery.
You can find a lot of pubs, bars, cafés and restaurants and also some smaller dance clubs along the multicultural
Karl-Liebknecht-Straße ("Karli"). The street starts in the south of the inner city and leads you to Südvorstadt and Connewitz (student and alternative quarters). Many pubs, bars and cafés can also be found on  Barfußgässchen. , a narrow lane in the old town.

Leipzig's safety is on par with other major German cities. The basic precautions you would normally take when travelling in Germany will be enough to feel safe. The city center is safe at all times.
As in much of Saxony, there are a lot of far-right extremists in and around Leipzig. But unlike in rural Saxony, they are countered by a strong, active Antifa community, which seldom hesitates to use violence to stop far-right activities. Police reaction to scuffles from both sides can consequently be heavy handed, and they have been attacked by both right- and left-wing political activists.
