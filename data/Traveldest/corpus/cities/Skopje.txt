Skopje is a huge city with several district articles that contain information about specific sights, restaurants, and accommodation.
Skopje (Macedonian: Скопје, Albanian: Shkup, Turkish: Üsküp) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of North Macedonia. Skopje is city of many cultures and many centuries. The various groups that have controlled the city through its history have each left visible reminders of their reign: multiple Dardanian and Roman-era archaeological sites dot the city; Byzantine and Serbian Empire churches and monasteries can be found around the outskirts; a great wealth of Ottoman heritage fills the Stara Čaršija; commieblocks and other Soviet-style structures recall the Yugoslav era; and the current ruling party is erecting countless historicist neoclassical-style buildings in Centar. All of this comes together to form quite an interesting city.
Skopje's location on the Vardar and its nearby tributaries amongst towering mountains makes it a place of scenic beauty as well. Mount Vodno's highest peak at 1,070 m (3,500 ft), capped by the Millennium Cross, stands visible throughout the city and is a major recreational destination. The Treska River cuts through the mountains of southwest Skopje, forming the stunning landscape at Matka Canyon.
Centar The centre of life in North Macedonia's capital. Centar is home to many cultural attractions and to the Parliament and Government of North Macedonia. It underwent many visible and controversial changes in the 2010s.
Stara Čaršija Skopje's old town, a well-preserved reminder of Macedonia's five-century Ottoman era. Home to a fortress, countless mosques, Turkish baths, caravansaries (inns), markets, a clock tower, and some churches.
Karpoš Karpoš is an urban neighborhood adjacent to central Skopje and containing significant places of interest like Vodno Mountain and the Skopje Zoo.
Outer Skopje Skopje covers a large area both within its city limits and in the wider Skopje region; this area contains many spread out places of interest
Matka Canyon Matka Canyon is one of the country's most popular attractions, home to medieval churches among the rocky cliffs of the canyon

In the Povardarie region, Skopje is the financial and political center of North Macedonia and by far its biggest city. The city population is around 800,000, however unofficially during working-days it can almost reach more than 1 million, which is more than half of the population of the country. The most diverse in the country, Skopje houses many ethnicities; besides the majority Macedonians, many Albanians, Turks, Roma, Serbs, Bosniaks and others call Skopje home.
26 July 1963 is one of the worst dates in the history of Skopje. An earthquake struck the city at 05:17. 75% of the buildings in the city disappeared in just a few seconds. After that, the big rebuilding project began, trying to make Skopje the model city of the socialist world. The plan was drawn by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange, who also designed the new railway station. The plan was never fully carried out. Many reconstruction projects have started. Some towers of Kale Fortress and the old cathedral are being reconstructed, and the old theater is also under reconstruction. Skopje is an eclectic mix of Christian and Islamic culture, with both vying to make themselves visible. However, this cultural mix has also spawned a lively and varied society. You can see people playing chess in the morning in the numerous cafés and green spaces in the summer. In the evening, Skopje comes to life as the locals dine in the cafés before heading to the bars and live music clubs, most of which are open until 01:00 or later.
Apart from being the capital of North Macedonia, Skopje has always been a center of power long coveted by various empires, and occupied by a long list of them, evident by the several Byzantine churches and monasteries around the city, also by a few Roman sites, such as Scupi and Skopje's Aqueduct. The city founded by the Paeonians in the 3rd century BCE under the name ‘Skupi’ was prized for its strategic location, in a long valley between two hills, situated on the banks of the Vardar River, a vital trade route. Under the Romans, Skopje was made administrative center of the Dardanian Province. The city’s prestige grew when the Orthodox Church made it an episcopal seat during the early Byzantine Empire. The arrival of migrating Slavic tribes from the Carpathians in the 6th century CE changed the city’s name and the composition of its people were assimilated by the Slavic newcomers. Throughout the remaining Byzantine centuries, Skopje continued to be an important mercantile center, situated as it was at the crossroads of Balkan trade and communications routes. It was celebrated for its urban life and fortress, and renowned for having the most beautiful church in the region. In the 14th century, Skopje became the capital of the Empire of Serbia, which was one of the largest and strongest countries in Europe during that period. However, the group that left the greatest mark on Skopje were the Ottomans. At the very end of the 14th century, Skopje and all of Macedonia fell under the rule of the Ottoman Turks, who ruled Macedonia for over six hundred years and built a large number of mosques and other buildings. In the ensuing centuries, the look of the town changed with the construction of many mosques, Turkish baths, bridges, and other buildings attesting to the new Oriental influence. Today, the Ottoman legacy remains extremely visible in Skopje’s architecture and small Islamic minority. After North Macedonia was liberated from the Turks in the early 20th century, became a part of Kingdom of Serbia, then it became a republic of the Yugoslav Federation, with Skopje as the capital. At that time, the prosperous city boasted many ornate, Neoclassical buildings laid out harmoniously in a more or less Central European style. However, in 1963 a disastrous earthquake leveled much of the regal old city, and Skopje was reborn in the imaginative, futuristic style in vogue at the time. Today, Skopje is a modern city and North Macedonia’s major political, economical, educational, and cultural center.

Skopje International Airport (SKP IATA) (SE 20 km). Destinations: Ljubljana, Vienna, Sofia (seasonal), Zagreb, Prague, Zurich, Dubai, Belgrade, Athens, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Istanbul, Venice Treviso, and London Luton, Bratislava, Budapest.
Pristina (the Kosovo capital) may offer cheaper deals than flying directly into Skopje on some routes. There is public transport connecting it with the Pristina bus station for €3 and then you can take a €8 bus ride to Skopje on the top of the flight fare. International Airport of Pristina is 3 hours away by bus from Skopje.
By bus – TAV Airport Express goes by Capitol Mall, the Bus Terminal and the Holiday Inn. Timetable see website—rule of thumb is that the buses depart about 15-30 min after a landing, just outside of the exit gates. It takes 25 min to the city and costs 199 denars one-way. Tickets need to be bought from the office next to the exit gate. Credit cards and Macedonian denars are accepted. If you exchange money first, exchange as little as possible—€4 is enough for a single ticket—as the rate at the exchange offices in the airport are terrible.
Upon returning to the airport, buy your ticket from the dedicated TAV airport bus office inside the bus station, and catch the bus from the stop signed "Airport Bus" on the street underneath the viaduct of the train station (Kuzman Josifovski Pitu Кузман Јосифовски Питу), in front of the Zegin Pharmacy (Аптека Apteka). Buses are scheduled to arrive about an hour prior to a flight, so you'll have plenty of time for exchanging back your left-over denars, check-in, passport control, security check, and boarding in Skopje's quiet airport.
By taxi – Hailing a taxi would cost approximately €15-25 to centre, or arranging private hire beforehand for a lower price. According to a display board outside of the airport, the standard fare to Skopje is €25 (as of 2022). Standard taxi fares are established to other cities within North Macedonia as well.
By car – 20 km southeast. The airport is accessed by the main highway Belgrade-Skopje-Thessaloniki which connects it directly with the city.
Skopje Railway Station (Скопска железничка станица) (near the National Central Bank). The transport center includes the train and the bus station together. To get to the city centre from the bus/train station, if you don't have a map, walk west along the main road which passes under the station (Mt Vodno with its cross is south, i.e. on your left). When you get to the river go left and follow the river until you arrive at the old bridge and central square. About 15 minutes walk.
Check the Macedonian Rail website for train connection from and to Skopje, including Pristina, Kosovo (daily, 3 hr, €5). Though, the Kosovo train seems not to be running as of end of 2022. It is not possible to buy a train ticket with a credit card, but there is an exchange desk in the bus station in the same building.
The train Belgrade-Skopje-Thessaloniki has been cancelled indefinitely (Oct 2018). Check for instance Seat61 for up-to-date info.
Bus Station (Avtobuska stanica, Автобуска станица) (under the viaduct of the railway station, east of the central Macedonia Square), ☏ +389 2 2466011. It has a small store selling snacks and drinks, another with bureks on the offer, and a reliable exchange office (open 06:30-18:30). Tickets for all destinations and companies are bought from central ticket booths (signed БЛАГАЈНА), except for the Vardar Express buses to the airport (see above), and then shown to the attendant at the gate upon accessing the platforms (Перон Peron) outside; the destination of the bus on each platform is displayed on digital screens in Macedonian Cyrillic and its Roman transliteration. All the staff at the bus station seem to speak at least basic English. The codes from online tickets may not be accepted by bus drivers. Before boarding, go to the ticket counter to convert the code into a paper ticket. Outside, the taxis and their somewhat persistent touts will be waiting, but the central square is just 15-20 min walking away. Beware of people who approach you inside or around the bus station offering rides. These drivers may NOT be professional, not have good knowledge of desired destinations, not take the most efficient route, and not provide good value. (updated Jun 2023)
Local Bus Station (The city bus station is also under the viaduct of the railway station, south-west of the bus station.). City buses, for example Millennium Cross or Matka canyon (#60), can be caught there easily.
Buses to cities and towns in North Macedonia leave many times daily. There are also buses to other major European cities.
A company running between Skopje and Sofia from the main bus station is Kaleia Travel with two departure per day, 07:00 and 17:30 (both ways). The ticket is about €25 (50 лв), and they take 5½ hr. You can also check the Sofia bus terminal website for any update to available options.
Pristina can be reached a few times per day (10:00, 11:45, 12:30, 15:00, 16:30, 18:10), 550 denars (steep increase in fall 2022).
Tirana is at least twice per day, 09:00 and 21:00, 600 denars.
Skopje has a vast, frequent and efficient bus network. A ride with the public (red in colour, run by the Skopje Public Transportation Agency (Јавното сообраќајно претпријатие Скопје)dead link) and private buses (all the other colours) cost 35 denars if you pay with a Skopska card, or 40 denars if you pay by a mobile phone. There is also an option to ride in the buses with the application Skopska, where you can buy rides. The Skopska application (iOS, Android) has an English interface.
Also, there is a daily ticket which cost 120 denars for the city lines and 150 denars for all the lines.
Hotels will help with info, and the odd taxi fare can be saved!
As of April 2023, private buses are not running, but they are returning. All lines are operated by JSP.
Taking a taxi in Skopje should normally not cost more than 300 denars. An example journey is from City Centre to Biser (a shopping centre with many bars and cafes that is popular with young people) which should take about 5-10 mins and cost around 150 denars.
From the train station to the center of the city is 2 km and should cost 50 denars. Never let yourself be talked into going somewhere where you did not plan to go in the first place. Like many cities in Europe, if you seem unsure and foreign, the charge will probably be higher so appear confident about the price and if the taxi driver still insists on a ridiculous price, find another taxi—there are plenty.
Many taxis have and will use their meter, so there should be no discussion about the price.

Individual listings can be found in Skopje's district articles
The largest concentrations of sights in Skopje are found in Centar and the Stara Čaršija (Old Town). The former is the modern hub of the city and contains newer attractions, while the latter is home to many of the city's historical sights. Outer Skopje is home to larger sights that are more spread out.
The Skopje Fortress stands above central Skopje, on the right bank of the Vardar. Much of the exterior walls, including several towers, remain, while excavations continue on the interior. The Stara Čaršija sits below the fortress to the south. Countless Ottoman-era structures makeup the historic district. Minarets from mosques like the 15th-century Mustafa Pasha Mosque dominate the district's skyline. The oldest of these mosques dates from 1436. Of the remaining Turkish baths, two are in good condition and now serve as museums. The three caravansaries in the Old Bazaar feature lovely courtyards and are open to the public as cafes or museums. While Islamic buildings are prevalent in the Stara Čaršija, it is also home to central Skopje's most important church, St Saviour Church, known for its wood-carved iconostasis.
One of the main symbols of Skopje, the Stone Bridge connects the Old Town to Centar on the left bank of the Vardar. Centar is home to the main government offices of North Macedonia. It is also home to Macedonia Square, the city's central square. The face of the square has changed with new buildings constructed in older architectural styles, as well as the addition of massive monuments like that of Alexander the Great, the centerpiece. Another major piece of the changes to Centar is Porta Macedonia, a large triumphal arch. The city's best museums are found in Centar, such as the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, the Holocaust Museum, and the Mother Teresa Memorial House, dedicated to the Skopje native.
Some of Skopje's best sights are found outside the city centre. Matka Canyon is one of North Macedonia's gems, both culturally and naturally. It is home to numerous medieval churches and monasteries, often hidden in the scenic mountains. Mount Vodno is capped by the Millennium Cross, overlooking the city and reachable via a cable car. In addition, archaeological sites dot the area, like the 55-arch Skopje Aqueduct. The Skopje Zoo contains a few hundred animals.
This is a huge city article, so detailed listings go in the district articles. This article should only provide a brief overview.
Macedonian National Theatre, Iljo Vojvoda. Built in 1945. With its big white walls, and almost without windows and with an incline, it is known as "the bounce board." It was made by Stefan Kacin, Jurij Princes, Bogdan Splindler, and Marjan Urshic. The theatre has a large stage and seats for 850 spectators, and also a small stage for 200 spectators. The State Ballet is also stationed in this building. This theatre holds theatre, opera, and ballet performances all year round.
Open gallery “Beautiful city” in the Gradski Trgovski Centar.
City Park. A large green area in the center of Skopje. A part of it is a museum, with several monuments within. It is a nice place to go for recreation, as there are pathways around the small lakes, tennis courts, the children’s amusement park, cafes, restaurants, etc. The city zoo and stadium are also within the park. In the summer, Skopje's nightlife concentrates on the nightclubs in this park. (updated Feb 2019)

Football – The national soccer team play at Toše Proeski National Arena, which is also the home of FK Vardar and FK Rabotnički. Several other club teams play in the city, the most recent Macedonian Football league winner being FC Shkupi.
Explore Matka Canyon (50 minutes outside of central Skopje; bus line 60 starting at the central bus station). Features a lake and a hydroelectric dam set in a beautiful gorge. It gets very crowded at the weekends by the locals but otherwise only tourists are there. Kayaking/canoeing on the lake is a popular activity (but expensive), as are fishing, hunting, and swimming. There is also a wild water track under the dam but it's used for just several days per year and no equipment rental is available. Climbers may enjoy a variety of tours of varying difficulty there. There is a trail running along one bank of the lake as far as another dam; it offers very nice views but leads to 'nowhere' and no caves can be accessed from it (in contrary what the map at the entrance suggests). There are several expensive restaurants at the entry (e.g. "Bear's Cave" (in Macedonian: Mechkina dupka), built into a cave) and no free water source.
Vrelo Cave (on the right bank of the Treska River, at the Matka Canyon). This has many stalactites including a large "Pine Cone" named due to its shape. There are two lakes at the end of the cave. It can be only reached by boat departing at the entrance.
Monasteries in Matka Canyon Area. St. Andrea church is at the entry. There are trails to more churches located on the surroundings cliffs but the trails are not used and in bad shape. For eastward trails (St Nedela, St Spas, St Trojca), you have to go through a restaurant's backyard (may be locked). For westward trails (St Nikola, St Jovan Zlatoust, St Gjorgia), you must hire a boat to bring you across and back or cross the river on a bridge about 1 km north of the dam.
Kadina Reka Hunting Site, Zelenikovo (25 km from Skopje, On the mountain massif of Mountain Karadjica, part of Mountain Jakupica, Dautica and Aliagica). -hectare area. The relief of the mountain massifs in the hunting area is characterized with heterogeneousness and significant differences in altitude of 2240 m, which enables zonal distribution of the game.
Climb Vodno Mountain (Водно) (the largest mountain to the south of Skopje; bus Millenium Cross (without line no.)). 1066 m above sea level it towers over Skopje. It is a popular hiking destination with marked paths leading through the woods, with a couple of rest areas. Climbing this mountain will give the best views of the city and the valley which Skopje is in. You will be able to see the Millenium Cross close up and possibly also climb it, which is the largest Christian cross in the world, built to celebrate 2000 years of Christianity, at 66 m height being the tallest structure in North Macedonia. Furthermore, you can visit a monument dedicated to the Macedonian partisan fighters who defeated Axis forces stationed on Vodno, which allowed the liberation of Skopje to begin.
Vodno Mountain to Matka Canyon. If you start early, hiking even further west along the ridge of Vodno Mountain can be a full-day hike. The hike from Skopje to Matka via Vodno is about 18 km. There might not be a bus back to Skopje, but you could stay in the hotel at Matka, which has prices starting at €35 for a room. (updated Dec 2022)
Explore Skopska Crna Gora (Скопска Црна Гора). Meaning "Black Mountain of Skopje". Even though Vodno is the most popular hiking option in Skopje, a fun and educational day trip from Skopje is visiting the villages, churches and monasteries on Skopska Crna Gora Mountain. Easiest way to do it is with a car, but also one can take a bus to one of the villages like Banjani or Kuceviste, and hike to the surrounding points of interest. St.Nikita monastery in Banjani village was built in by Serbian king Milutin in 1307-08 on a site of an earlier church. It is a single domed church of a written cross architectonical solution. The frescoes are work of the famous Ohrid painters Mihailo and Eftihie. Unfortunately they lack the energy and the technique of Bogorodica Perivlepta church in Ohrid. It is quite probable that by now they had a big group of students around them and they just controlled the work. If one looks carefully one can see where them two picked up the brush and corrected the work. Most significant fresco is the Pursuit of the Merchants from the temple where one can see the human elements characteristic for their work.
Marko’s Monastery (outside Sushica village on Kitka mountain. There is a bus going to the village but just few times per day. From the village there is half hour walk to the monastery. Behind it there is a river and a small picnic area.). An active monastery. It was founded by king Volkashin in 1345 and finished by his son King Marko in 1366, who is also the donor of the frescoes painted between 1366 and 1371. It is unknown why the monastery is built in the vicinity of Skopje instead of Prilep the capital of their medieval kingdom. It is presumed that the grave of king Marko (who died in Romania fighting the Turks) is here but it was destroyed by the Turks. The architecture of the church is a cross in square with a central dome and a blind dome in the narthex. The elegant exonarthex (open porch) was added in 1830 by Hamzi Pasha, who was a generous donor of the monastery throughout the 19th century. It is quite surprising a Turkish aristocrat to be a donor of a Christian monument. The frescoes are work of more artists with different skills and are well preserved. Visible is the tendency for adding dramatization and narrative painting of the scenes. Most interesting is the unique scene The cry of Rahela (Mathew 2:18). On the southern façade the portraits of king Volkashin and king Marko are painted. While in the area also visit St.Bogorodica church (also referred as St.Nikola church) in Sushica village, built in the 13th century.
St.Bogorodica Church, Kucevishte village. The naos was built just before 1348. The narthex was built somewhere between 1355 and 1358 by local aristocrat Radoslav and his wife Vladislava. Above the nathex there is a grave chapel for Radoslav and Vladislava. The painter of the frescoes of the naos is quite good, educated, well acquainted with the work of Mihailo and Eftihie, quite probable their student. Still his work doesn't reach their energy, colors and elegance, but he is quite good in composition and placing figures in it. Like his teachers he did sign his name on the northern column by the iconscreen, his name is Grigorie. The frescoes of the narthex have been damaged by fire and the grave chapel was painted by a less skilled painter. Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel Monastery in Kucevishte village was built towards the end of the 14th or maybe the beginning of the 15th century. The church is threeconhos with a dome, and elaborate ceramic decorations on the façades. There are two inscriptions dating the frescoes from 1631 and 1701. The figures are presented small in size, poor in colors but with bold drawing with an attempt to present landscape. Most famous is the large presentation Tree of Jesse.
St. Nikola church, Ljuboten village. It was built in 1337 by Mrs. Danica, a local aristocrat whose sons had important positions (something like mayors or governors) of strategic positions on the entrance of the city. She built the church in honor of her passed husband. It is a single domed church of a written cross architectonical solution. Parts of the frescoes are in bad condition. Influenced by the works of Mihailo and Eftihie. The Serbian royal family is presented (king Dushan, queen Elena and prince Urosh), it is interesting that the painting treatment of them, especially the colors are different than those for the saints.
Tumba archaeological site. Ceramic models of houses formed in the shape of the female body are among its valuable finds from the Early Stone Age.
Cerje archaeological site. Its unique finds include the figurine known as Adam from Govrlevo, one of the earliest prehistoric male figurines, from the Early Stone Age.
Gradishte. A fortified settlement from the Early Byzantine period. It is believed to be Taoresion, the native town of Emperor Justinian.
Marko's Castle. An Early Byzantine fortress, heavily fortified with 40 towers. It was the site of the medieval town of Crnce.
Remains of Skupi. The ancient city of Skupi is almost not worth the effort to reach. There is almost nothing left except for part of a street, a bath, and a basilica. After the city was ruined by the earthquake of 518, all the building material was used in the building of Justinijana Prima (one can see almost all of the seats of the Roman theatre incorporated in Kale Fortress). It is interesting that even though the earthquake was very strong and completely ruined Skupi there were almost no casualties. The inhabitants fled the city just two days before fearing from Avar attacks and settled in the small fortresses they had built on Vodno and in Matka.
Skopje Summer Festival. The epithets such as the most abundant, the most various, the longest and, according to many authorized marks, one of the most qualitative cultural manifestation of international character which is held in North Macedonia, characterize Skopje Summer. This manifestation has even received an acknowledgement of its reputation outside the Macedonian borders which is verified by the membership of the International Festivals & Events Association (IFEA).

Old Bazaar (Старата турска чаршија). Even though some parts of the old bazaar have been destroyed to make streets and parking lots, it still is the largest one in the Balkans. It has developed and changed during the centuries but it still has its original use as a shopping place. The old bazaar was never used for living, it always was a shopping area and contact zone of the Christian and the Muslim populations as they lived in separate parts of the town. It is a structure of many streets lined with small shops. The crafts were divided between the Christians and the Muslims. All the shops used to be same size no matter if they belonged to a Christian or a Muslim. Each street hosted different craft, and all stores from that craft were on one street (for example gold street, shoes street, pots street, dress street). The stores were closed with wooden shutters which were lowered when the stores were opened and the goods were displayed on them. The old bazaar was surrounded with markets. Hygienic care was taken and different markets were placed on opposite sides of the bazaar (for example the food market was on the opposite side of the bazaar from the animal market; milk, milk products and honey market opposite from the wood market etc). Beside the stores there were other objects in the old bazaar too, like hamams (Turkish baths), hans (hotels), mosques, and some churches. The outside walls were usually surrounded with stores so no space would be wasted. (updated Feb 2019)
Bit Pazar (Бит-пазар). The biggest of the food markets in Skopje. It begins where the bazaar ends and has existed on the same spot for hundreds of years. A walk around can be fun, but you can also get cheap fresh fruits, vegetables, salads, cheese, teas, spices and flowers.

Skopje, just like the rest of Macedonia, is a relatively safe place. But, the usual rules about common sense apply here as they would anywhere. The places where crime occurs most often are in the places where tourists have little reason to be at. Night time in the old market may have roving bands of youth and areas just east of it. Exercise a higher level of caution in these areas or avoid this area at night.
Like many other parts of Eastern and Central Europe, there are people who will beg around the major tourist sites, they especially target tourist-looking people, and sometimes may engage in pickpocketing.

Tetovo — Just 1 hr away, Tetovo is the site of the unique and beautiful Painted Mosque, and offers an opportunity to brush up your rusty Albanian skills
Ohrid – With its highly scenic hillside location overlooking the lake, no trip to North Macedonia is complete without a visit to Ohrid, the city of a thousand churches, or the "Balkan Jerusalem"
Kokino – If you want more hill and less lake. A beautiful scenic drive past Kumanovo takes you to a stunning paleolithic solar observatory discovered in 2001 atop a small mountain.
Kosovo – If you decided that what you need is yet another stamp on your passport, the "newest state of Europe" would be happy to arrange one for you, with its border just half an hour away from Skopje. While the national capital, Pristina, offers little beyond a convenient hub to travel around the country, the historic city of Prizren in southern Kosovo, nearer to the Macedonian border, is well worth a visit. While both cities can be managed as a quick day-trip from Skopje, Pristina is quite accessible by bus while Prizren is more complicated.
Thessaloniki, Greece – Around 4½ hr by bus is the second-largest Greek city with a long history and a popular destination for Macedonians looking for beaches.
This city travel guide to Skopje is a usable article. It has information on how to get there and on restaurants and hotels. An adventurous person could use this article, but please feel free to improve it by editing the page.
