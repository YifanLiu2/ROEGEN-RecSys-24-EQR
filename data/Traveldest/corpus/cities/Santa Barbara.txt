Stearn's Wharf, Santa Barbara
Santa Barbara is a city and metropolitan area less than 100 miles (160 km) from Los Angeles but vastly different in pace from its huge neighbor to the south. With a temperate climate and lush natural environs, the "Riviera of the West" is a pleasant day or weekend trip from L.A. Its wide beaches, highly rated wineries, and a large variety of shopping and dining choices enable the town of just 90,000 residents to enjoy the sort of cultural and social amenities which are usually found only in much larger cities.
Although the common perception of Santa Barbara is as a playground for the rich and famous, the reality is that the average income within city limits is only slightly higher than California as a whole. Notable for its California Mission-style architecture (a long-standing local ordinance ensures that all commercial construction follows the Mission theme, which results in a plethora of red-tiled roofs and faux adobe supermarkets), local residents are intensely proud of their city's roots and traditions, and a number of hugely popular festivals throughout the year celebrate the many cultures found in the city.
In addition, the city's large Latino population, concentrated in the east side of the city around Milpas Street, means there are a great many tacquerias and Mexican restaurants to be found. Santa Barbara has also been influenced by Los Angeles' food-truck scene.
The city of Santa Barbara is part of what's known as the South Coast, so named because the coastline between Point Conception and the city of Ventura faces more south than west. The road that serves as the city's nexus is State Street, which runs northwest-southeast in and near downtown and east-west in the uptown area. It continues west as Hollister Avenue through Goleta. The area immediately to the east of lower State Street, between the waterfront and Highway 101, is known as the Funk Zone and has become one of the premier tourist areas of Santa Barbara, and is home to wineries, breweries, art galleries and restaurants, as well as a more youthful and trendier atmosphere. Just a few blocks above the Funk Zone, State Street becomes pedestrian only for eight blocks before opening up to traffic again. The eight blocks closed to cars, called the State Street Promenade are the core of Santa Barbara's downtown. The Latino part of town is on the east side of the city and has its own main street, Milpas Street, which is almost 1 mi ( km) away from, but parallel to, State Street in and near downtown. Upper State Street connects to Highway 154, a state highway that connects Santa Barbara with Los Olivos and wine country.
The orientation can be confusing to visitors, especially since locals often give directions as though the mountains were east, rather than north, and the ocean west, rather than south. "Go north on the 101" means literally "go west"; and if someone says "south of town" they don't mean in the ocean, but down the coast in the direction of Carpinteria and Ventura.
Santa Barbara's downtown neighborhoods are generally working, middle- and upper-middle-class areas, while Montecito to the east of the city and Hope Ranch to the west are two of the city's wealthy enclaves, known as part-time hideouts for Hollywood celebrities and rich retirees.
Santa Barbara Visitors Center, 1 Garden Street, downtown, ☏ +1 805-965-3021. 9AM (10AM on Su) - 5PM (4PM Nov-Jan). Has information about Santa Barbara, including maps, pricing and hours of attractions, restaurant guides, bus and waterfront shuttle schedules.
Santa Barbara has a slightly different climate from the rest of the area. It maintains idyllic temperatures for most of the year and it is rare to go a week during any season without at least one day reaching 70 °F (21 °C). There are occasional temperature extremes: heat waves are common in the late summer and early fall, and night time temperatures can reach down into the thirties during the winter. The best times to travel are not always what travelers expect. Spring and early summer are cool and cloudy through the mornings and often into the afternoons, with temperatures in the 60 °F (16 °C)s and low 70 °F (21 °C)s in what the locals call "May Gray" and "June Gloom". During August and early September temperatures get into the 80 °F (27 °C)s and cloudy days are rare. In mid to late September and October daytime temperatures stay mostly in the 70 °F (21 °C)s. The rainy season typically lasts from November through March, but even during the rainy season more days are sunny than not.

Santa Barbara Municipal Airport (SBA IATA) (near the neighboring town of Goleta). The local airport for the area, 7 mi (11 km) west of downtown. There is service from Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Oakland, Phoenix, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, Seattle. Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District's Route 11 bus links the airport with downtown Santa Barbara. (updated Apr 2020)
The airport can be pricey, and flight schedules limited; flying to Los Angeles (LAX) or Burbank (BUR) and driving or taking public transportation to Santa Barbara may come out ahead on price, time, or both. Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner (see below) stops at Burbank airport 5 times a day on its way to Santa Barbara. From LAX, take the Santa Barbara Airbus for a direct ride or the FlyAway to Union Station and Amtrak to Santa Barbara. Los Angeles is known for its wildly unpredictable traffic, and even the train sometimes experiences delays, so allow yourself extra time if you go this route.

There is only one major highway in and out of Santa Barbara: US 101, which is coterminous with Highway 1 for over 30 miles (48 km) both north and south (well, east, but down the coast) of the city. From the 101, coming from the south, downtown Santa Barbara can be accessed via the Garden St. exit, while the beaches can be found off the Cabrillo Blvd. off ramp. From the north, get off the 101 at either the Mission or Carrillo St. off ramps. Traffic patterns are the opposite from the famous Los Angeles grid lock, as the southbound 101 can come to a grinding halt on Sunday afternoons.
State Route 154 is a secondary road that leads over the mountains to the Santa Ynez Valley, and to towns like Los Olivos and Solvang; it is accurately designated a "Scenic Highway" by the California Department of Transportation. However, it's probably less of a way to get into town and more of a road to take on a day trip from Santa Barbara.

Bill's Bus specializes in transporting the student party crowd safely Downtown from Isla Vista and back again on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. $10 round trip, $7 one way.
Santa Barbara is fairly easy to drive around, and in most areas parking is rarely difficult to find, either in a municipal garage or on the street. One confusing wrinkle is the presence of 3 similarly named major streets, Carrillo St, Castillo St, and Cabrillo Blvd. Don't mix them up. As anywhere, you shouldn't drive under the influence of alcohol, but be aware that Santa Barbara police are particularly merciless about catching and prosecuting drunk drivers.
Budget and Hertz car rental outlets are present at the airport terminal, and several other rental agencies are located in Santa Barbara.
With a mild climate, walking is a great way to get around town, but might be inconvenient outside of downtown and the funk zone.
Taxis are plentiful but expensive, but given the relatively compact size of downtown Santa Barbara, they're viable if you don't need to go out too far into the suburbs.
Along the waterfront, many businesses offer bicycle or inline skate rentals for exploring the beach areas, and "rickshaw" taxis are also common.

Self-guided tours daily 9AM-4:30PM. Known as "The Queen of the Missions," Santa Barbara's "Old Mission" is a superb example of California's Franciscan Spanish architecture. The tenth California Mission to be constructed, it was consecrated in 1786 as the first of Father Lasuen's nine missions. Today, Mission Santa Barbara is both a scenic wonder and a fine anthropological study of original native culture in the surrounding area. Santa Barbara is the only California mission with twin bell towers, owing to its status as a cathedral in the early days of California statehood. It also has had a longer continuous association with the Franciscans than any other mission, and a longer continuous history of choral music than any other mission. The headquarters of the mission system in the 1830s and 40s, it is where many of the archives of the California missions are held. Note the adjacent pottery kiln and tanning vat ruins. The mission also features a small but well-regarded rose garden. The mission continues to be used as an active church, with regular masses on Wednesdays, Sundays, and holy days.

Wine Tasting in the Funk Zone. Santa Barbara has a number of wineries all within blocks of downtown and mostly within the area known as the Funk Zone for its earlier, funkier roots as the industrial part of town. Some smaller wineries have set up shop, many in converted industrial buildings, in the Funk Zone, which is in the blocks just east of State Street and between the waterfront and the Highway 101 overpass. This up-and-coming part of the city now features a large number of wineries, including Santa Barbara's Urban Wine Trail, restaurants, craft breweries and craft distillers, making it a popular destination for foodies and those wishing to escape the shopping scene on State Street. Most wineries have tasting rooms and are open to the public.
Wine Tasting in the Santa Ynez Valley. For those who want to escape the city limits and get out in to wine country, the Santa Ynez Valley is just a short drive north of Santa Barbara, accessible either via U.S. Highway 101, or by State Highway 154. Here in north Santa Barbara County are hundreds of wineries and vineyards, and the fall harvest period is an especially scenic time to make the trip. Most of the wineries are part of the Santa Barbara County Vintner's Association. Pinot noir, and to a lesser extent, chardonnay, are the signature varietals of Santa Barbara wine country. Just pop up to Solvang, Santa Ynez, Los Olivos or Buellton and enjoy. The region takes responsible consumption very seriously, and since the February 2008 launch of the CHP Designated Driver Program, DUI checkpoints have been frequent. Consider hiring a limo or signing on for a wine tour.

Red Tile Walking Tour. The Santa Barbara Visitors Center gives out a nice free guide to Santa Barbara that includes a suggested self-guided walk that's about  mi ( km) long in total. It features historic red-tiled adobe buildings in Downtown Santa Barbara but also helps visitors to get a sense of the lay of the land and see some of the stores and restaurants on State St. and a few paseos. Not to be viewed as a substitute for the easy walking tour listed above, as that is a longer walk and encompasses parts of the city not included in this one. (updated Jul 2015)

Alameda Park, 1400 Santa Barbara St. Upper East Side Park covering two city blocks. Includes a popular community designed playground, and picnic tables popular for family celebrations (no alcohol is allowed, though).

Alice Keck Park Memorial Garden, 1500 Santa Barbara St. Across the street from Alameda Park. Something of a cross between a park and a botanical garden, it features a large pond with ducks, koi and turtles, as well as numerous differently themed plantings, most with labels describing the different plant species. Local wags sometimes refer to it as "Alice Keck Park Park," but you'll often hear it just called "Alice Keck Park" since many people are unaware that "Park" was Alice's last name. (updated Feb 2018)
Shoreline Park. It offers a blufftop walk with stunning views overlooking the ocean. (updated Feb 2018)
Chase Palm Park, 323 E Cabrillo Blvd. This is a long, narrow park that stretches along East Beach. Features pedestrian and bike paths, as well as a skate park. (updated Feb 2018)
Skofield Park. Small rural park that contains the trailhead for Rattlesnake Canyon, one of the most popular local hikes. Its name comes from the sinuous nature of the trail, not any particular concentration of rattlesnakes, although like anywhere in the California backcountry, you should be alert for them. (updated Mar 2018)
East Beach & West Beach. Separated by Stearns Wharf, for all practical purposes these are one continuous beach, usually referred to just as East Beach. This is Santa Barbara's most popular beach, and most easily accessible from the tourist amenities on State St. Popular sand volleyball spot. (updated Feb 2018)
Leadbetter Beach. On the other side of the harbor from West Beach and near Santa Barbara City College, this beach tends to be less crowded than East Beach. It usually has a fairly mellow break that is suitable for beginner surfers. (updated Feb 2018)
Arroyo Burro Beach. Almost universally referred to by locals as "Henry's" or "Hendry's" beach, and more isolated than the downtown beaches. Dogs are permitted to be off-leash, and one end is a nude beach, where you'll often see nude dudes frolicking. (updated Feb 2018)
Butterfly Beach. Tucked away in Montecito by the fancy Biltmore Hotel, and something of a hidden gem. Depending on tides and fluctuations of the sand, some parts of the beach may not be easily accessible. Though you'll often see off-leash dogs here, unlike Arroyo Burro beach, this isn't officially sanctioned. (updated Feb 2018)
Hammonds. Tucked away between Miramar and Butterfly in Montecito, this is beach is a hidden gem. To get there park at Miramar beach parking and then walk along the path adjacent to edge cliff drive, cross over the creek. It is also accessible from butterfly during low tide.

SBIFF has gradually built a reputation for its growing program that features some of the industry's top distributors in attendance. Individual tickets are available for the tribute events.
Summer Solstice, Alameda Park. In 1974 friends of local artist Michael Gonzalez dressed up in costumes and ran down State Street, without a permit, to celebrate his birthday. Several decades later this has turned into a civic celebration of the first day of summer. There's a carnival-like parade on State Street, and a festival with live music in Alameda Park. Check the website for exact dates. (updated Feb 2018)
Old Spanish Days (Fiesta). In the 1920s, the Chamber of Commerce decided that there should be a reason to visit Santa Barbara in August, and so invented "Old Spanish Days." Nowadays it's universally referred to as "Fiesta" and is still held in early August. In modern times it's probably more popular among locals than among visitors, but worth a look-in. There's a parade, "El Desfile Historico," that features pretty impressive costumes and horsemanship.  De La Guerra Plaza downtown becomes "El Mercado," with live bands and stalls selling food. "El Mercado Del Norte" in  MacKenzie Park has a county fair ambience with carnival rides. "Las Noches de Ronda" is the collective name for numerous performances around town of traditional Spanish and Mexican performances such as flamenco dances and mariachi bands. There's also a horse show and rodeo at the  Earl Warren Showgrounds. (updated Feb 2018)
Paseo Nuevo, near State Street

Whatever you're looking for, you'll likely find it on State Street. There is plenty of parking downtown with the first 75 minutes free in most lots (except at the beach).

Santa Barbara does French-inspired California cuisine quite well. Locally sourced food is a point of pride for many chefs, who are able to draw from the bounty of fresh produce grown within a few hundred miles of the city, as well as the fresh seafood that's pulled in from the ocean daily. The town's elevated cultural status attracts high-powered chefs from all over the world, and the selection and sheer variety of local fare is quite astonishing for a community of 90,000.
In addition, Santa Barbara's Mexican food ranks with any other town in California and the food truck scene born in L.A. has emerged in the city as well. Here are just a few of Santa Barbara's culinary choices:
East Beach Tacos, 226 S Milpas St. 11:00-6:00. Innovative taco spot with great tacos, good prices and a weird location attached to batting cages. Don't let the location fool you, this place stands out in a city bursting with great tacos. While classic taco staples like carnitas and carne asada are on the menu, the real gems are the Asian inspired tacos, reminiscent of the LA food truck scene. The triple play, 3 tacos of your choice for 10 dollars, is the way to go and is what most people order. Be warned the parking lot is poorly designed and always crowded. $10-20. (updated Aug 2022)

Opal Restaurant, 1325 State St, ☏ +1 805 966-9676. A great example of typical mid-range Santa Barbara cuisine, with an innovative, California-French menu and lovely atmosphere. The salmon with Thai curry sauce is a good bet.

Although Santa Barbara is somewhat geographically isolated, with only one major route in or out of the city, the surrounding area is rife with fascinating side-trips.
Cachuma Lake Recreation Area - This rural county park in the hills, about 18 mi (29 km) up Route 154, makes for a pleasant day trip for kayaking or hiking, or you can arrange to camp there.
Channel Islands National Park - Channel Islands National Park is a series of islands that are home to incredible marine life, beautiful and remote scenery, and the wily Channel Islands fox. While most trips to the Channel Islands depart from Ventura, Truth Aquatics runs trips from Santa Barbara.
Goleta - Neighboring Santa Barbara to the west, Goleta offers similar beaches and resorts to its more famous neighbor. It is also home to a grove of trees that is an overwintering area for monarch butterflies, with the insects gathering in huge numbers each year from mid-November until mid-February.
Los Olivos - About 50 mi (80 km) north of Santa Barbara on Highway 154. This is a cute little one-horse town with about 20 local winery tasting rooms lined up on Grand St. A great place to go wine tasting without having to drive a zillion miles from winery to winery.
Montecito - This affluent town is located just east of Santa Barbara along the coast and is home to many rich and famous, including Oprah Winfrey. Montecito Village is home to some interesting shops and markets, while upscale resorts can be found on the coast.
Solvang - Located approximately 40 mi (64 km) north of Santa Barbara in the Santa Ynez Valley, Solvang is a gingerbread town. What must have started several decade back as a small "Little Denmark" tourist trap has grown into an entire town and surrounding community obsessed with its own overwhelming Danishness. Every sign, roof, light post and pothole is Danish-themed here, and reports of wandering bands of drunken men in plastic Viking helmets are firmly founded in reality. Take Highway 101 north/west to Buellton (the home of the original Pea Soup Anderson's), exit at the Highway 246 offramp and follow the destination signs to Solvang. If you're up for a twisty drive, take Highway 154 (also known as the San Marcos Pass) back to Santa Barbara at sunset and enjoy an unforgettable view.
Santa Ynez - 31 mi (50 km) northwest of Santa Barbara, Santa Ynez sits at the heart of the rural Santa Ynez valley, an area that attracts travelers to its many wineries. The valley was the setting for the 2004 film Sideways, and fans of the film are known to make pilgrimages to the inns and restaurants from the movie.
Wine Country. North on US 101 or Highway 154; pretty much all of the county north of the mountains.
Los Angeles is about 90 mi (140 km) down the coast, but whether you take the 101 or the Pacific Coast Highway (Route 1), be prepared for a major tie-up somewhere along the route in the best of times. With no traffic, the trip could take you 90 minutes, but actual driving time is often easily twice that and can be more. Both routes have their appeal, though, as after they diverge in Ventura, Route 1 goes past beautiful coastline and the Malibu Cliffs, whereas the 101 climbs over the Conejo Grade into Thousand Oaks and then the San Fernando Valley. Also accessible by Amtrak, Flixbus, or Greyhound. Contrary to popular belief, Los Angeles does have decent public transportation and a car-free weekend can be had at places like Hollywood or Santa Monica.
