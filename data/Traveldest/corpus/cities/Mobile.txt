There has been no passenger rail service to Mobile since 2005. While work is ongoing on providing a daily service from New Orleans, it won't resume until 2024 earliest. Nearest current station is in Hattiesburg, which is served by Amtrak and its Crescent route between New York City and New Orleans.
Wave Transit System is Mobile's public bus service. The frequency is not the best, generally one bus per hour M-Sa from about 6AM to 6PM, but the buses run on time and are reliable. There is later service to about 9PM on a few routes, but no late-night or Sunday service. They can carry a bicycle on a rack at the front of the bus, and there is no extra charge for bicycles. The fares are $ one way ($ for transfers), $3 for an all-day ticket, $10 for a 7-day pass, or $40 for a 31-day pass. Routes and timetables are available online or at the GM&O Transportation Centre (110 Beauregard Street, Suite 104). The Wave has some unusual but interesting quirks; the bus drivers will stop for you at any intersection along their route without a marked stop nearby as long as you're on their side of the road and signal to them with your hand. It is also one of the few transit systems that will give you change on a card redeemable for future rides if you do not have exact fare.
MODA is an electric trolley that serves downtown with 20 stops, available M-F 7AM-3PM. MODA fares are $ one-way, with no multi-trip passes available.
