Lubbock is the largest city in the Panhandle of Texas and serves as the area's agricultural and economic hub. Lubbock, commonly known as the Hub City, is in the center of the South Plains, an expansive cotton-growing region.
The city is home to approximately 259,000 residents and students (2019). Lubbock is the seat of Lubbock County, the site of state and national parks, two major medical systems, three universities, and is unique among other growing Texas cities in that its sustained economic development and growth are not supported by heavy industry. Lubbock has experienced steady growth for several decades and today occupies approximately 125 mi² (324 km²).
Charles Hardin Holley (1936-1959), better known by his stage name of Buddy Holly, was born in Lubbock. Together with Elvis Presley, he is considered to be one of the founding fathers of rock'n'roll (In fact, it was watching Presley in concert in Lubbock that led Holly, originally a country and folk singer, to turn towards rock music). Tragically, Holly's life was cut short at the age of 22 when he died in a plane crash in Iowa, together with Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson. Nevertheless, today Holly still lives on in his hometown by way of the Buddy Holly Center.
Lubbock County was founded in 1876 and named after Thomas S. Lubbock, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and subsequent Confederate officer. Mr. Lubbock didn't have any particular ties to the area; but the area bore his name because a state administrator penciled in names of counties on a crude map of the Panhandle - at random. The modern town of Lubbock was not established until 1890 when old-Lubbock and the smaller town of Monterey struck an unusual alliance and merged the two communities, a deal most likely initiated by rival town promoters hired by area ranchers and merchants to lobby Ft. Worth & Denver for a rail depot. The site of Monterey was chosen in lieu of the new township's name, Lubbock. Old-Lubbock's residents relocated to Monterey just south of the Yellowhouse Canyon, dragging the Nicollete Hotel with them on rollers. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891 and incorporated as a city in 1909.
In 1923 Texas Technological College, now known as Texas Tech University, was founded after a contentious bid war among several area cities including Amarillo and Plainview. The city of Lubbock was a mile away from the only campus building during its first session.
A category F-5 tornado cut an 8-mile (13 km) gash through the city on the evening of May 11, 1970, resulting in $125 million in property damage and the loss of 26 lives. The devastation received international news coverage and was among the first natural disaster recoveries to be documented on television. The coordinated effort served as a model for disaster recovery research and planning. The destruction of several thousand homes effectively ended segregation throughout the city.

Lubbock is the largest developed area atop the Llano Estacado plateau. The area, when first explored, was a featureless grassland, and, according to legend, Spanish conquistadors drove large, brightly-colored stakes into the ground to plot their position. The region was later named Llano Estacado, translated loosely as "staked plains" or more accurately as "palisaded plains". The first settlers encountered banditos or native Comanche who would often hold new arrivals for ransom. The portion of the Caprock Escarpment just east of Lubbock is known as Ransom Canyon.
Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport (LBB IATA) (5 mi ( km) north of downtown). Southwest Airlines, United Express, and American Eagle serve the small airport. Air travel to Lubbock will most likely require a connecting flight in one of the airports with direct service to Lubbock. American flies to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and United flies to Houston (Bush) and Denver. Southwest has nonstop flights to Las Vegas, Austin, and Dallas Love Field.
Cab fare to the Downtown area or Texas Tech is $13 to $18. Fare to the hotels along the south and southwest beltway range from $20 to $25. Royal Coach offers posted rates from the airport into the city. The fare is based on a zoned map ranging from $6 to $24, depending on your destination.
Lubbock is easily accessible by car. US 62/82, US 84, I-27, US 87 and TX 114 are well maintained roadways which allow for easy driving in and out of the city. A modern beltway, TX Loop 289, offers a quick shortcut around the city's notoriously absent congestion.
TNM&O is the local Greyhound affiliate and offers connecting lines to all major U.S. cities. Arrivals occur most often in daylight, while a majority of the departures occur at dawn or dusk. The TNM&O terminal also serve as its corporate offices. The closed Bus Stop Diner, on the 13th St. side of the terminal, is rumored to be haunted by the city's transients. TNM&O administrators blame the dust.
Lubbock is developed along a large scale grid. North-south streets are labeled A-Z Downtown and progress to city and state names moving west. East-west streets are numbered from 1 to 150 or so. Streets north of Downtown follow the names of colleges and universities, while those east of Downtown are flowers and trees. Block ranges, house numbering and street names are consistent throughout the city and most follow alphabetical order. All major roadways are 1 mi ( km) from each other in either direction and are uniformly straight.
The intrastate I-27, which connects Amarillo and Lubbock, terminates south of the TX SR 289 interchange.
The interchange of 66th St., US 84 and I-27 was once the site of a notorious intersection called The Circle. Avenues A, H, Q, Tahoka Rd. and Slaton Rd. converged in a three lane vaulted hub a half-mile in diameter. Avenues Q & A were not realigned after the I-27 project covered most of Avenue H. The remaining intersection is still very tricky at the northeast corner.
TX SR 289, often called The Loop or 289 by locals, can be congested along its southwest portion during business hours.
Construction of the Marsha Sharp Freeway will cause severe disruptions near Texas Tech University and Downtown.
