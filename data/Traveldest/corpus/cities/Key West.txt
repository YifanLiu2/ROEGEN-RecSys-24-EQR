Key West, in the Florida Keys, is a city and an island of the same name. It is the county seat of Monroe County and is considered the southernmost city in the continental United States.
In Pre-Columbian times Key West was inhabited by the Tequesta and Calusa peoples. The first European to visit was Juan Ponce de León in 1521. As Florida became a Spanish colony, a fishing and salvage village with a small garrison was established here.
The island was used by fishermen from Cuba and from the British Bahamas, who were later joined by others from the United States after the latter nation's independence. While claimed by Spain, no nation exercised de facto control over the community there for some time. The island was considered the "Gibraltar of the West" because of its strategic location on the 90-mile (140 km)–wide deep shipping lane, the Straits of Florida, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. On March 25, 1822, Matthew C. Perry sailed the schooner Shark to Key West and planted the U.S. flag, physically claiming the Keys as United States property.
Key West was relatively isolated until 1912, when it was connected to the Florida mainland via the Overseas Railway extension of Henry M. Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 destroyed much of the railroad and killed hundreds of residents. The FEC could not afford to restore the railroad. The U.S. government then rebuilt the rail route as an automobile highway, completed in 1938, which became an extension of United States Highway 1. The portion of U.S. 1 through the Keys is called the Overseas Highway.
Modern Key West and the Florida Keys has a Tourist Development Council which collects a surtax on hotel bills to promote more and more tourism in the Keys in an uncontrolled positive feedback loop. Spending a million dollars a month on international travel promotion schemes, the island chain is crowded and expensive. Traffic is slow but the pace is frenetic.

Key West claims to be the only city in the lower 48 states to have never had a frost or a snowfall. Because of the proximity of the Gulf Stream in the Straits of Florida, about 12 miles (19 km) south and southeast, and the tempering effects of the Gulf of Mexico to the west and north, Key West has a notably mild, tropical climate.
Precipitation is characterized by dry and wet seasons. The period of November through April receives abundant sunshine and slightly less than 25 percent of the annual rainfall. This rainfall usually occurs in advance of cold fronts in a few heavy or light showers. May through October is normally the wet season, receiving approximately 53 percent of the yearly total in numerous showers and thunderstorms. Rain falls on most days of the wet season. Early morning is the favored time for these showers, which is different from mainland Florida, where showers and thunderstorms usually occur in the afternoon. Easterly (tropical) waves during this season occasionally bring excessive rainfall, while infrequent hurricanes may be accompanied by unusually heavy amounts. At any rate, Key West is the driest city in Florida. Summer is generally a few degrees cooler than the interior due to the moderating effects of the water, and with tropical breezes is a welcome relief from the interior's scorching temperatures.

Call them to schedule pick-up for the return trip back to Miami or Ft Lauderdale (see "By bus" in the below).
Car rental, although unnecessary in small Key West, is available from Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, and Thrifty. Alamo, Enterprise, and National have offices off site, with a free shuttle from the Airport. Parking on Key West can be a challenge in terms of the number of available spaces, and the size of spaces, so smaller cars are popular selections.
Public buses: the Lower Keys Shuttle dead link operated by Key West Transit provides 9 daily trips between MM 0 in Key West and MM  (Sadowski & US Hwy 1) in Marathon Key.

Cruise Ships In 1969 the Port of Key West received its first regularly scheduled cruise ship.

A schedule indicating when a particular cruise ship will be calling on Key West is available at the Port Office and online. See the online docking calendar dead link or the respective website of a particular cruise line.
Since the re-establishment of US-Cuban relations at the end of 2014 and the easing of travel sanctions between the two countries there have not been any establishment of, or plans for regular ferry services between Key West and Cuba. Private mariners will still need a license from the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to be able to sail their own vessels to Cuba. Please check with U.S. Customs & Border Protection as to where to sail into from foreign ports and regarding the rules for travel by private vessel or aircraft between the Florida Keys and Cuba.
The Overseas Highway terminates in Key West, and links all the towns in the Keys with mainland Florida and links into the US Interstate network. Driving to Key West is straightforward (3 1/2 hours from Miami) and scenic with ocean vistas but driving around town is difficult and parking is expensive.

With many narrow and one-way streets, driving Key West is difficult and parking is expensive. Many visitors choose to rent motor scooters, bicycles, golf carts, explore on foot or use public transportation. 2 When renting a golf cart keep in mind that you have to find parking for this vehicle as well. Scooters and bikes can normally be parked on the sidewalk right outside your destination.

"Southernmost point" in continental United States
Southernmost Point (Corner of Whitehead and South Streets). A "buoy" (actually an old sewer junction painted to look like a buoy) placed at this point contains a claim that it is the southernmost point in the continental USA, but the claim is inaccurate. The true southernmost point of Florida is on Ballast Key, an island about 9 miles (14 km) from Key West which was off-limits to the public until 2019, when it was deeded to the US Fish and Wildlife Service and added to the Key West National Wildlife Refuge. (Today, it's open to boaters during daylight hours only for minimally invasive activities such as birdwatching and nature photography.) The marker is also not the southernmost point on Key West island—a private yard is immediately southeast of the buoy, and the island's true southernmost point is in the Truman Annex west of the buoy, which is U.S. Navy property and can be entered only by authorized Navy personnel. Even before Ballast Key was opened to public access, the buoy wasn't even the southernmost point that could be accessed by the public—that would be the beach area of Fort Zachary Taylor (see above). Nonetheless, it's one of the city's most visited and photographed spots. Expect large crowds on the weekends, and waiting for your turn to take a picture is the norm. Free.
Wildlife Rescue of the Florida Keys, Atlantic Boulevard and White Streets. This rescue operation has released more than 2,000 healed animals into the wild since 1993.

They come from all over, from the Seven Mile bridge to the Dry Tortugas. You can visit the patients any day from 9AM to 5PM, and the park is open sunup to sundown.

Key West is not the greatest place to bring a family. There are beaches and a few small parks during the day... for those that are awake. Enjoy an early night and prepare for the next day's adventure. However, if you are traveling with young ones, stay in a hotel off the main streets. For those who stay out all night you may not get to do these things but you should try.

Key West is not like Miami. There aren't many high end shops or big name brands. While there are a few, Key West is not the place for this type of shopping. Fly into or out of the Miami airport and spend a day in South Beach if this is what you are looking for. There are a lot of shops in Key West, especially along Duval Street, which goes from coast to coast. You can find something to wear at night which in Key West isn't much (price or material). Lose your sunglasses...they have them. Need suntan lotion..check. Want a tattoo? You could get probably get 20 or so if you went to every tattoo place in Key West.

There are a few more a little ways up the Keys that cater to RVs. The number of campsites are limited, so try not to be too shocked by the prices. Make your reservations well in advance six months to a year so you are sure to get your spot. You will notice the use of "MM" or "Mile Marker" in the addresses. This is how US 1 is marked. MM 0 is in Old town Key West and the beginning of US 1. The numbers go up, so you can tell just how far an address is from Key West.
