College Station and Bryan together make up the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area, the sixteenth largest Metropolitan area in Texas with around 273,000 people (2019). This area is also known as "Aggieland", as it is home to the main campus of Texas A&M University, one of the premier universities of Texas and the flagship institution of the Texas A&M University System. The city of College Station owes its name and existence to the university's location along the railroad. Howver, the Amtrak train station was decommissioned in 1995.
There is a Greyhound Bus Station in Bryan which is covered by the local bus route.
Traveling to Bryan-College Station is almost exclusively done by automobile. There are two highways that pass either through or near the town, State Highway 6 and State Highway 21. SH-6 travels nominally north and south. Going south will lead you to Navasota and eventually to Houston (after joining US-290 in Hempstead and turning more easterly. Going north on SH-6 will lead you to get to I-35 and Waco. SH-21 travels nominally east and west, with somewhat of a southeast/northwest slant. Going east will lead you to Interstate Highway 45, Madisonville, Crockett and Nacogdoches. West on SH-21 will take you to San Marcos, San Antonio and Austin.
Travelers headed to downtown Austin are best served taking State Highway 21 west to 290 near Paige, TX and continuing West on State Highway 290. Continuing on SH-21 will take you to the end of SH-21 in San Marcos and Interstate Highway 35, which can then be taken to San Antonio and points South.
Travelers to the Dallas area and points north are best served taking SH-6 north to IH-35 around Waco, and continuing north on IH-35, which will split into IH-35E into Dallas, and IH-35W into Fort Worth. IH-35E and W rejoin in Denton and continues as IH-35 out of Texas and through Oklahoma City.
