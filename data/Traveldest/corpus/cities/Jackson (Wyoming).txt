Jackson is the largest town (population 11,000 in 2020) in the Jackson Hole valley in Teton County, Northwest Wyoming, close to the south end of Grand Teton National Park. It is the gateway to two of the United States' best-known national parks, Grand Teton and nearby Yellowstone. Many famous people maintain vacation homes in and around this area. The combined elements of beautiful mountain scenery, Old West heritage, tourist traps and celebrity residents give this small town a unique atmosphere both cosmopolitan and frontier.
Thousands of antlers shaped into an arch are a popular icon of Jackson
The terms "Jackson" and "Jackson Hole" are often mistakenly interchanged. "Jackson" is the name of the town. "Jackson Hole" refers to either the greater valley area (including, for example, the towns of Wilson and Kelly) or the Jackson Hole ski resort.
Jackson transforms from a popular ski town during the winter into a mecca for travelers here to admire and participate in boundless summer beauty and activities. Meanwhile, in the spring and fall seasons, the town slows down as only the 6,000 or so year-round residents remain (and many of them may leave during this time as well) and many of the hotels and restaurants close for the season. Each of the seasons have their pluses and minuses depending on the visitor's expectations and desires, but it pays to know what time of year is best for what activity, especially in Jackson's unique high-altitude environment.

Generally speaking, hotel prices and availability in Jackson can fluctuate wildly by the season. During the summer months (and especially summer weekends) hotel rooms can be very difficult to obtain without a reservation or without a lot of money. During the wintertime, there are typically always rooms available, however prime rooms near the ski resorts may require advance planning and additional funds. On the other hand, during the off-season, many hotels in town close due to lack of demand.
