Hamilton is a port city in Ontario with a population around 520,000, at the westernmost end of Lake Ontario—the city wraps around the lake and continues towards the Niagara Escarpment, referred to by locals as "the mountain".
Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812, Hamilton has become the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe. The city limits of Hamilton used to be bounded by approximately Horning Road in the west and Centennial Parkway in the east, but a continuous urban or suburban area had grown around the city, in the towns of Dundas, Ancaster, Stoney Creek and the community of Greensville in the town of Flamborough. In 2001 the new City of Hamilton was formed through amalgamation of the former City with the constituent towns of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Municipality. Residents of the city are known as Hamiltonians. Since 1981, the metropolitan area has been listed as the ninth largest in Canada and the third largest in Ontario.
Traditionally, the local economy has been led by the steel and heavy manufacturing industries. Within the last decade, there has been a shift towards the service sector, particularly health sciences. The Hamilton Health Sciences corporation employs nearly 10,000 staff and serves approximately  million people in the region.

Hamilton is home to the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, the Bruce Trail, McMaster University and several colleges. The Canadian Football League's Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at Tim Hortons Field. The same venue is also home to Forge FC, the city's pro soccer team that started play in 2019 as a founding member of the Canadian Premier League. Partly because of its diverse locations, numerous TV and film productions have been filmed in Hamilton, regulated by the Hamilton Film and Television Office. There is a growing arts and culture sector including local art galleries, recording studios and independent film production.
Tourism Hamilton is the city's official tourism website, with a free "Experience Hamilton" Visitor’s Guide and current info on local events and attractions.
John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport (YHM IATA), ☏ +1 905-679-1999. Accommodates major air carriers and tour operators, offering frequent flights to Canadian, American, Caribbean and European destinations. Hamilton Airport is fast and efficient due to its relatively small size. The single terminal building can be navigated in two minutes and there is very little chance of confusion for passengers boarding or disembarking. A tactic employed by many Hamiltonians, Torontonians and other nearby Ontario residents is to use Hamilton Airport instead of Pearson in Toronto. Doing so can potentially save a busy traveller valuable time while parking, and promises far less of a headache during boarding procedures. A single baggage turnstile makes retrieving luggage painless.
Air Canada flights can be booked to YHM, with a bus connection from Toronto Pearson Airport.
There is a ground transportation page for Hamilton Airport. Here are some options:

Main thoroughfares into Hamilton include the Queen Elizabeth Way, Highway 403, and Highway 6. Hamilton is roughly 1 hour from Toronto and from Niagara Falls.
When approaching Hamilton Harbour from the east- Lake Ontario- remember that the lift bridge opens every half hour on the hour.
It is illegal for a pedestrian to enter any 400 series highway or the QEW. It is also very unsafe due to the high velocity and dense volume of traffic. If you should choose to do so anyway you can expect the police to pick you up and remove you within a short time.
A safe and legal alternative is to hitchhike on the on-ramp, providing there is sufficient space for a vehicle to pull over without endangering the driver or passing traffic.
Hitchhiking on other roads in Hamilton (and Ontario) is legal so long as you do not stand in the roadway.

Hamilton is divided into two main sections—"The Mountain" and downtown. The Mountain refers to anything on the escarpment—access to the mountain is limited to a few roads, which often arrive on a different street than when you started. If you're going up the mountain, take a second to learn which access you need to take. Driving on the mountain accesses in the winter can be treacherous, and even many locals avoid it if possible due to icy road conditions. During severe storms many and sometimes even all of the accesses can be closed by the city, making travel between the two major districts nearly impossible. The Sherman Access changes to one-way traffic during rush hour, to get traffic down the mountain in the morning and up the mountain in the afternoon. If you aren't aware of this, it can mean having to take a long detour if you've committed to taking the Sherman but can't. Even outside of rush hour the signage on this access can be confusing.
Hamilton has many one-way streets throughout its downtown core. Be aware of what intersection you're heading for, and what streets precede it, or you may overshoot.
Rush hour traffic can be problematic like in any other large city. Try to avoid driving down Upper James Street in the mornings or between 4-6PM unless you're content to watch pedestrians overtake you on the sidewalks. The nearby street of West 5th (next major street to the west of Upper James) generally has a far lower volume of traffic and can save you upwards of 10 minutes of driving time. It also sports a mountain access that can get you down to (lower) James Street in no time at all.
The Lincoln Alexander Expressway (known locally as the Linc or Link) is a city by-pass that runs across the mountain from Ancaster to Stoney Creek. If you're trying to get past the city be sure to avoid the major roads (Mohawk, Fennell, Stone Church or Rymal) at all costs and take the Linc, which will save you ample time and gas.
There are some duplicate street names between Hamilton and the surrounding areas it amalgamated with; for example, there is a King Street in Dundas, Hamilton, and Stoney Creek.
Hamilton Street Railway (HSR), ☏ +1 905-546-2489. The HSR operates public transit buses in the city and the surrounding suburbs. Service is more frequent downtown than in outlying areas. On Sundays and holidays, many routes have 30-60 minute frequencies. Fares Cash $ (ages 6 and up); Presto card: $ adults (ages 20 to 64 years old), $ youth (ages 13 to 19 years old) and seniors (ages 65+); children ages 6 to 12 can ride HSR buses fare-free, however unlike the other Greater Toronto Area transit agencies such as GO Transit or Burlington Transit that offer similar free-fare programs for children ages 6 to 12, on HSR buses, the policy only applies if they have their own valid "child" Presto card, for those that do not have a Presto card, they will need to pay the full cash fare. Children ages 0 to 5 are allowed to ride fare-free - with an accompanying fare-paying adult - and do not require a Presto card. Riders may also pay by tapping a credit or debit card on the Presto reader in which case the cash fare will be charged.. (updated Mar 2024)
A fare is valid for two hours of travel on HSR buses. If paying by cash, ask the driver for a "transfer" as a receipt to show the driver when changing buses. If paying by Presto, credit or debit card, the transfer info is electronically recorded on your card when you tap on.
Presto, credit and debit card customers can also transfer freely between HSR and Burlington Transit buses at any location within 2 hours of paying the initial fare.
Burlington Transit routes 1/1X serve the Royal Botanical Gardens from King & James streets (BT Stop #679) and King & Bay streets (BT Stop #827). Burlington Transit accepts HSR paper transfers only at these two stops in downtown Hamilton.
For Presto, credit and debit card holders: If transferring between GO Transit (GO) and HSR to complete a trip, your HSR fare will be free. Just tap your Presto, credit or debit card on the Presto fare device on both transit systems to get the free HSR fare. When transferring from HSR to GO, the HSR fare will be refunded to your Presto, credit or debit card after completing your trip.

The view from the escarpment. There are many beautiful views of the city to be found from the escarpment. Especially when looking west, it is difficult to see streets or the roofs of houses under the thick canopy of trees (although it is easier to see these in winter). If you are driving around Hamilton, Mountain Brow Boulevard is a good place to stop for a look down. The Bruce Trail offers many excellent views, such as that at Dundas Peak, and continues along the escarpment toward Grimsby or Burlington for a longer hike. (updated Jul 2016)
Waterfalls. The combination of many creeks and the Niagara Escarpment makes Hamilton, now sometimes referred to as "The City of Waterfalls", an excellent place for seeing waterfalls. Over 100 waterfalls and cascades are known (several were found in 2008 and there's likely some that haven't been discovered yet). The one drawback of Hamilton's waterfalls is that half of them do dry up in dry seasons. The good news is that most are on or near the Bruce Trail as it winds through the Niagara Escarpment (a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve) in Hamilton. Some of the more popular ones are:
Albion Falls, Mountain Brow Blvd (HSR bus 21). A scenic 19-m cascade waterfall, blasting for 12 months a year. It took over thousands of years of freezing, melting, growth, decay and tidal changes to create the Niagara Escarpment region. Named after the former village of Mount Albion in which it resides. (updated May 2020)

Felker's Falls (Felker's Falls Conservation Area), Ackland St, Stoney Creek (HSR bus 43). 22 m (72 ft) terraced waterfall. (updated Dec 2019)
Tew's Falls, Harvest Rd., Greensville (in Spencer Gorge/Webster's Falls Conservation Area along with Webster's Falls).

Tiffany Falls, Wilson St. E., Ancaster. Tiffany Falls is a 21-m ribbon waterfall. It is just off the former Highway 2.
Webster's Falls, Fallsview Rd., Greensville. Among the most beautiful waterfall in Hamilton, at 30 m wide it is the widest in the city. The surrounding area in Spencer Gorge/Webster's Falls Conservation Area is a popular picnic spot in the summer. The staircase down to the base of the falls is treacherous but the view from down there is beautiful. While you are there, check out the cobblestone arch bridge near the falls. You can walk to Tew's Fall. $5 per person, $10 per car.
Downtown Neighbourhoods. Like many cities, Hamilton is home to many traditional neighbourhoods, including Locke South, Concession St., James St. South, James S.

Hamilton has numerous shopping districts along attractive streets lined with small shops and eateries. While fewer brand-name retail items are available in Hamilton than in neighbouring Toronto, several districts host a successful spot for antiques, art and specialty boutiques.
King Street. The city's main urban destination for restaurants, cafes, and of course, shops. (updated Dec 2019)
James Street North. A redeveloped sector in the city's core, James Street North is widely-praised for its flourishing art galleries, various restaurants and cafes. The street hosts an Art Crawl on the second Friday of every month.
Locke Street South. Just west of downtown, Locke Street is home to a large number of antique shops. Prices tend to be lower than in Toronto.
Ottawa Street. Home to innumerable fabric, home decor and furnishings stores. The street had fallen on hard times earlier in the decade, but is undergoing a resurgence and has become one of the city's most popular destinations for antiques, fabric and home furnishings.
Old Ancaster. On Hamilton Mountain, at the west-most section of the city, Old Ancaster has several specialty boutiques and historical monuments. (updated Dec 2019)
Dundas. As west as Ancaster, but down the mountain, Dundas is a small heritage town with a European feel that offers most of the good shopping opportunities in Hamilton such a Picone Fine Food, a 100-year-old grocery store that sells fresh produce and high-end food items. Dundas has a great drive-in park that is popular amongst locals for summer picnics. Dundas is home to numerous festivals throughout the year. (updated Dec 2019)
Concession Street. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was an African-American neighbourhood. Many slaves escaping the U.S. via the Underground Railway settled in this urban neighbourhood at the edge of the escarpment. It boasts the best views of the lower city and features many parks, some with fantastic vistas overlooking the downtown and heavy industrial areas. The neighbourhood offers many shopping, dining and entertainment opportunities. The housing is an eclectic mix of million-dollar estates and 1920s cottages. Stairs to the lower city are available on Mountain Avenue, traversing the 91-m (300-foot) escarpment. Many buses travel along Concession, making it one of the most public transit accessible areas of the city. Once considered run-down, it may be one of the most underrated areas of the city. A 1920s movie house has been renovated and is showing first-run and art films.
Westdale. Adjacent McMaster University keeps this neighbourhood healthy, with its many boutiques, groceries, eateries, pubs and bakeries and even a movie cinema specializing in foreign and art films. Westdale Village is accessible by bus and is walking distance to McMaster University and Hospital. It was Hamilton's first master-planned community in the 1920s.
Upper James Street (From downtown, take the Claremont Access from Victoria Ave S. Alternately, take the off-ramp from the Lincoln Alexander Parkway.). Upper James is a lengthy street that was at one time known locally as "Oilcan Alley" due to a prevalence of autobody shops and car dealerships. Most of the major dealerships in Hamilton are still located on Upper James around the Ryckmans Corners area between Stone Church and 20 Road. A huge number of stores and family restaurants exist to service the needs of most shoppers, including a Walmart Supercentre at Fennell Avenue. Beware of traffic during rush-hour periods.

House being an example).

Cruise nights often held here in the summer. On the beach trail, so you can walk off your Sportsmanburger.

Located roughly between King and Main Street, on Hess Street. Typically pub-type bars and night clubs, but it runs the gamut. Hess Village is where the patio action is in Hamilton on warm summer nights. Dance clubs have opened in neighbourhood, adding to the entertainment mix. This is the summer place to be in Hamilton.

Augusta's Winking Judge, 25 Augusta St (Augusta Street right behind the GO Transit station), ☏ +1 905-524-5626. This is the best place in Hamilton to get a tasty pint.

This was original location of the Winking Judge, which later moved to Hess Village. (updated Nov 2018)
The Coach and Lantern, 384 Wilson St E, Ancaster. Dating from 1823, the former "Union Hotel" has survived various incarnations and even a 1878 fire in its stables. During the War of 1812, it was purportedly the site of the Bloody Assize, and the spot where four traitors were condemned to hang outside Dundurn Castle. It's rumoured to be haunted, and not just by the Ancaster set. Has a good selection of draft beers and single malt scotches, typical pub grub, and nightly entertainment of the karaoke/trivia/open mic sort. Atmosphere is as you'd expect: exposed stone walls, beams, dark, cluttered and windowless, but it has a cobbled courtyard the claustrophobic may enjoy in the summer.

Hamilton resides on a highly polluted area of Lake Ontario. High levels of E. Coli bacteria usually prevent the beach from being open for swimming season. In addition, the city suffers from high air pollution including fine particulate matter, consistent with most of Southern Ontario from Windsor through Oshawa.
Like most cities, there are unsafe areas which should be avoided. Some of the areas that may be problematic after dark due to black market activities (i.e. sex trade and illegal narcotics) are Barton Street from around Lottridge to James Street and Cannon and Wilson Streets between Wentworth and Victoria, along with the general downtown area including Gore Park and Jackson Square, but again, only at night. Additionally, Ferguson Avenue between Cannon and Barton is home to a large transient population, as is the rest of the Beasley neighbourhood.
Hess Village can and does experience the usual amount of drunken bar fights (typically outside of the bars), but this is no different from any other large city. Several uniformed police officers typically patrol the small area on busier nights.
Use common sense and avoid walking around alone at night. Police presence is usually infrequent in less-busy neighbouroods, so it can be best to avoid them unless you have business.
The rate of violent crime is moderate compared to other similarly-sized Canadian cities.
The beautiful trails along the Niagara Escarpment can sometimes run quite close to unfenced, unmarked cliff edges. Stay on the trail and use caution and you'll be fine.
Police, fire, ambulance: 911
Hamilton Police Services, ☏ +1 905-546-4935 (Non-emergency switchboard).
