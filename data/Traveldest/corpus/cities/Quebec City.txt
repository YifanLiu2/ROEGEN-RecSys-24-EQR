Quebec City (French: Ville de Québec, or just Québec) is the capital of the Canadian province of Quebec. It sits at a commanding position on cliffs overlooking the St. Lawrence Seaway. Quebec City's Old Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of only three cities in North America (the others being Campeche, Mexico and San Juan, Puerto Rico) with its original city walls. Quebec is a city of about 700,000 residents.
Quebec City is referred to as the "national capital in the province". Much of the business here is of the administrative and bureaucratic nature, which would normally make a city quite dull. Fortunately, the city has a remarkable history, as the fortress capital of New France since the 16th century. Although the town's day-to-day life leaves things a little yawny at times, the vibrant historical centre makes for an incredible visit.
Quebec was first settled by Europeans in 1608 in an "Habitation" led by Samuel de Champlain, and celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2008. The generally accepted dates of Champlain's arrival in the city, July 3rd and 4th, were marked with major celebrations. The area was also inhabited by Native peoples for many centuries before the arrival of the Europeans, and their ongoing presence has been notable since then.
When it was founded by the French to make a claim in the New World, the name Quebec referred to just the city. It is an Aboriginal word for "where the river narrows" as the St. Lawrence River dramatically closes in just east of the city. It rests on 65-m-high (200-foot) cliffs with stunning views of the surrounding Laurentian Mountains and the St. Lawrence River. Under French rule from 1608 to 1759, the major industries were the fur and lumber trades. The French lost the city and the whole colony of New France to the British in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759. Much of the French nobility returned to France, and the British assumed rule over the remaining French population. The rulers of the colony allowed the French to retain their language and religion, leaving much of the culture intact. In the 1840s, there was an influx of Irish immigrants during the Potato Famine. Due to cholera and typhus outbreaks, ships were quarantined at Grosse Isle to the east of the city past l'Île d'Orléans. The bodies of those who perished on the journey and while in quarantine are buried there. The city remained under British rule until 1867 when Canada West (Quebec) and Canada East (Ontario) joined New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to form the Dominion of Canada.
French is the official language of the province of Quebec, though in the tourist areas of Quebec City, English is widely spoken as a second language by almost all of the staff. It is also not unusual to find Spanish, German and Japanese spoken in many establishments in Vieux-Quebec. Outside of the tourist areas, some knowledge of French is advisable and perhaps necessary, depending on how rural the area is. While older locals struggle when attempting to sustain a discussion in English, most people under 35 should be able to speak conversational English. Less than a third of the overall population is bilingual French/English.
In French, both the city and the province are referred to as Québec. Context determines the difference. By convention, the province is referred to with masculine articles (le Québec, du Québec, or au Québec), and the city takes no article at all (de Québec, à Québec). Provincial road signs and other official signage refer to Quebec City as simply Québec.
Quebec City was named the 5th best city destination in North America and 10th in the world in 2010 by Condé Nast Traveler, and best Canadian city for culture, 4th best Canadian destination, and 7th most romantic city in the world in 2010 by TripAdvisor.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Quebec has a humid continental climate, meaning there's considerable temperature variation over the year. Winters are cold with temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F) certainly not unheard of (for a comparison to European destinations, the winter temperature range is comparable to Rovaniemi at the Arctic Circle while Quebec is at the same latitude as Central France!), with strong winds amplifying the cold temperature, and often also much snow.
Summer daytime temperatures are often just above 20 °C (68 °F), though it can get considerably hotter. Spring and fall tend to be rather short transition periods, and periods of warm weather far into the fall are common.
Orienting yourself in Quebec is fairly easy. Many sights of interest are in the Old Town (Vieux-Québec), which constitutes the walled city on top of the hill. Many surrounding neighbourhoods, either in Haute-Ville ("Upper Town") or in Basse-Ville ("Lower Town"), are of great interest: Saint-Roch, Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Montcalm, Vieux-Port and Limoilou. Haute-Ville and Basse-Ville are connected by many staircases, all of which are unique, such as the aptly-named Escalier Casse-Cou ("Breakneck Stairs") and the more easily climbable "Funiculaire".
The city spreads westward from the St. Lawrence River, for the most part extending from the old city. The true downtown core of Quebec City is just west of the old city. Across the river from Quebec City is the town of Lévis. Frequent ferry service connects the two sides of the river.

Quebec City is 2½-3 hours by car from Montreal on either Highway 40 or Highway 20 (north and south side of the St. Lawrence, respectively). Both routes are rather monotonous drives through endless forests dotted with farms. Autoroute 20 is part of the Trans-Canada Highway between Longueuil and Rivière-du-Loup.
For a slower but more picturesque tour of Quebec's heartland, drive along the Chemin du Roy (Highway 138), which follows the north bank of the river instead.
A seasonal cruise operates during the summer months between Montreal and Quebec City. The one-way trip takes approximately 7 hours and is slow-going, but the views make it worthwhile.
The Funiculaire, Quebec City's diagonal, counterweight railway
Walking is a great way to get around the Old Town, as the compact layout makes distances short. You will see beautiful old buildings and little vistas around every corner. You will get exercise. Do be careful of uneven cobblestones and narrow streets, though.
Côte de la Montagne is a steep, winding street that connects Upper Town and Lower Town. If you get tired, use the Funiculaire to go between the upper and lower parts of the Old Town. $5 per person (Apr 2024) will get you from near the base of the Breakneck Stairs (l'Escalier Casse-Cou) back up to the front of the Chateau Frontenac. It is well worth it if you have small children or large packages.
Many intersections are set up with separate traffic signals and cycles for cars and for pedestrians. At one point in the cycle, all traffic lights turn red and all pedestrian signals turn white, meaning that you can cross the intersection in any direction. Yet when the traffic light is green and the pedestrian signal is red, you may find cars turning in front of you. Some intersections have a pedestrian button to activate the signals, and you will never get a pedestrian cycle unless you push that button.
The bicycle network of Quebec City has been growing slowly but steadily for the last decade. Although small compared to the extensive utilitarian network of Montreal, it now offers a few recreational bike paths called Corridors with complete bidirectional and segregated bike lanes beginning downtown and ending in the countryside, generally giving splendid views of the area on the way. Most of them are part of the Route Verte system of provincial bike paths.
Corridor des Cheminots is a peaceful trail that runs from the Old Port to Val-Bélair, which continues on to the Jacques-Cartier park area. It can be a challenge because of its long uphill slope, and is a breeze on the way back.
The eastern section of Corridor du Littoral leads to Chutes Montmorency. This one-hour route (2 hours both ways) runs along the St. Lawrence River, hidden by the Dufferin Expressway. By crossing under the expressway, you can make brief stops at the Baie de Beauport recreational park and the Battures de Beauport vista point for restrooms and views on the river. Keep some of your strength for the stairs up at Chutes Montmorency: the view is well worth it.
The western section of Corridor du Littoral leads to the Samuel-de-Champlain promenade. This time, no expressway stops you from having spectacular views on the river and you might even enjoy some nice contemporary architecture on the way. Restrooms and a cafe can be found at the end of the promenade. 1½ hour both ways.
The Parcours des Anses is in Lévis, across the river. Cross with the ferry for $ (an experience in itself) and bike west on the south shore until you reach the Quebec Bridge and cross back on the north shore to connect with the Samuel-de-Champlain promenade and Corridor du Littoral. Crossing the Quebec Bridge is not for the faint of heart though, as it is the longest cantilever bridge in the world and the path is narrow. That said, this route is the most rewarding of all and will take you a whole afternoon to complete. Part of the route on low-traffic streets still lacks a proper bike path.
The city offers maps of its bicycle paths online. They are open from April to October.
Driving in the Old Town can be tricky, since the cobblestone streets were designed for narrow 17th-century horse carts rather than 21st-century SUVs. One way streets abound throughout the Old Town, and parking is difficult to find. Be aware of parking signs and ask locals to ensure parking regulation is understood. Parking patrols are effective and unforgiving.
Outside of the Old Town, the use of a car is recommended. Right turns on red are allowed unless otherwise indicated.
During the months of November through April, snow will definitely affect driving conditions. Snow tires are required by provincial law between December 15 and March 15 for all vehicles plated in Quebec as some roads will lack snow removal, sand or salting. Vehicles plated in the US or in other provinces are not subject to this requirement.
If snowfall occurred recently, watch out for red flashing lights. It means snow removal is underway. Cars parked on the street will be fined and towed. Parking in an underground garage is advised.
Réseau de transport de la Capitale (RTC), ☏ +1 418-627-2511. Operates Quebec City's public transportation system. It is a system of buses and express shuttles that cover the whole city (updated Sep 2022) Tickets cost $ each, which will earn you the right to ride one direction with a transfer valid for two hours. You can get a pre-paid card loaded with up to 12 trips (in bunches of 2) from licensed stores. Daily passes (2 for 1 on weekends) and monthly passes are also sold at the same stores. Free for children below the age of 6. Drivers do not carry money and cannot change bills so do carry exact change - to buy your ticket you place the money in a cash drop box at the entry of the bus. Google Transit can be used to find the best itinerary. As of 2022, a tramway project has been proposed.
Four of the bus lines are frequent-service lines called Metrobus. They are served by recognizable green and grey articulated buses. 800 and 801 start in Ste-Foy, head toward the Old Town, and end in Beauport and Charlesbourg respectively. 802 starts at Beauport to Belvedere, through Limoilou and Saint-Sauveur. 803 runs along Lebourgneuf blvd and connects with the Galeries de la Capitale terminus. They can run as often as one every three minutes during rush hour.
STLévis, ☏ +1 418-837-2401. Lévis's public transit, operates within the south shore of Quebec. (updated Sep 2022) There is also a shuttle from St-Augustin to Quebec. These different transit companies all pass through Quebec City, which explains the different colours of buses around town.
Taxi Coop Québec, ☏ +1 418-525-5191. (updated Jul 2022)

La Société des traversiers du Québec, toll-free: +1-877-787-7483. Operates ferries within Quebec. (updated May 2022) Operates a ferry across the St. Lawrence River between Quebec City and Lévis. As of 2022, it costs $ one way for a car (including driver) and $ for pedestrians and cyclists. Crossing time is 12 minutes. The ferry operates throughout the year between 6 am and 2 am. The ferry departs typically once an hour to Quebec City and once an hour from Quebec City, but frequency of departures increases up to every 40 minutes to Quebec City during the weekday morning rush hour and up to every 40 minutes to Lévis during the weekday afternoon rush hour.
Quebec City's main sight is the Old Town, the upper part of which is surrounded by a stone wall built by both French and British armies. It is now a tourist district with many small boutiques and hundreds of historical and photographic points of interest. Some of the buildings are original structures, while others are built in the same style and architecture as former buildings.
Quebec is one of two cities in North America with a completely preserved fortification system. (The other is Campeche, Mexico.) The system of fortifications was built by the French and British between 1608 and 1871. It has a length of  km, four gates, a citadel and three Martello towers and almost entirely surrounds Haute-Ville.
The Citadel (La Citadelle). 10:00-17:30. This fortification at the juncture of the Old City wall and Grande Allée is still used as an active military base by the Royal 22e Régiment of the Canadian Army, which has long been known for the irony of being exclusively French-speaking despite having ceremonial uniforms that are clearly British in origin. Also serves as the official residence of King Charles III and the Governor-General of Canada when they visit Quebec City. $18 adult, $16 concession, $6 youth, children free. (updated Apr 2023)
Porte Saint Louis (Rue St. Louis at Côte de la Citadelle). The oldest of the gates to the city, standing at the western end of the street with the same name. It was first built in 1693, then left to ruin, but was restored and strengthened after the War of 1812. It got its current outlook in 1880. (updated Sep 2018)
Porte Saint-Jean, rue Dauphine. Leading to the west, also this gate to the city has been rebuilt several times, the current version is from 1939-40. (updated Sep 2018)
Porte Kent, rue Dauphine. Leads to the west of the city, and was constructed as the last of the city gates in 1878-79, but is the only one that has retained its original shape. (updated Sep 2018)
Porte Prescott, rue Dauphine. Connects the upper and lower town, and first built in 1797 and named after Robert Prescott who was the general governor of Canada then. It was dismantled in 1871 and rebuilt in 1984 but the current version looks rather different from the original version. At the gate there are stairs to the top of the wall. (updated Sep 2018)
Église Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. Next to Place Royal, this is considered the oldest stone church in North America. The first small church was built to celebrate a victory over the British in 1690, was finished in 1723 but was destroyed in a British attack on the city in 1759. Construction of the current church started soon after, and one of the builders was the master carpenter Jean Baillargé. It was declared a historical monument in 1929. (updated Aug 2015)
Palace of Justice (Palais de justice de Québec), 12, rue Saint-Louis. A neoclassical grand building next to Place d'Armes by Eugene-Etienne Tachet and finished in 1877. The current tenant in the building is the provincial ministry of finance. (updated Sep 2018)

Basilique-cathédrale Notre-Dame de Québec, 16 Rue De Buade. This cathedral and historical monument with its assymetrical towers is the seat of the Catholic archdiocese of Quebec, and adjacent to the Séminaire de Québec. The church has been rebuilt several times, and the current house of worship finished in the 1920s is built in a mix of neobaroque and neoclassical style. (updated Sep 2018)
Séminaire de Québec, 1 Côte de la Fabrique. A Catholic seminar and historical monument, founded in 1663 by Saint François de Montmorency-Laval to educate missionaries for spreading the Christian faith in the New World. It is at the edge if Quartier Latin, the historical university quarter of the city. (updated Sep 2018)
Chapel of the Ursuline convent (Monastère des Ursulines de Québec), 12 Rue Donnacona. May-Sep: Tu-Su 10:00-17:00; Oct-Apr: Tu-Su 13:00-17:00. The monastery comprises a whole block in the old town, though only the chapel and the museum are open to visitors. It was founded in 1639 by the French nun Marie de l'Incarnacion (later canonized) as the first female Catholic order in the Americas. The chapel dates from 1730 and is with its wooden altar considered a masterpiece of Franco-Canadian woodwork. In the museum you can learn about the activities of the Ursuline order in Quebec throughout history, and on display there are things related to its curriculum such as embroidery and musical instruments.

Quebec City's Old Town, especially Basse-Ville, is riddled with shops for tourists. When taking a closer look at souvenirs and crafts for sale in such shops, the fine print all too often reads "Made in China", even if they are marketed as "typically Quebecois". Watch for leather goods and various handmade crafts made by Canada's First Nations peoples.
Quebec is also known for local food products such as cheese, microbrewery beer, cider and maple products including syrup. Maple syrup is available in smaller glass bottles in tourist shops at a premium price, and in bigger plastic bottles in supermarkets — the stuff is as delicious but at a lower price.

The café culture is very much a part of Quebec City as in most of Europe. It should be very easy to find a quaint cafe around Marché Champlain, and around the Chateau Frontenac. Food is fairly expensive in Quebec, and even a simpler café or bar may be costly.
