Wrocław (pronounced VROHTS-wahf; also known as Breslau, its German name, and English name until 1945) is the largest city in Lower Silesia in Poland. It is home to 674,000 people within the city limits (2022) and the metropolitan area has a population of  million making it the largest city in Western Poland.
Wrocław is the historic capital of Silesia and it has changed hands repeatedly over the centuries. At different points throughout history, Wrocław has been in the Kingdom of Poland, Bohemia, the Austrian Empire, Prussia and Germany. In 1945 the city became a part of Poland again as the borders of Poland were moved westwards in the immediate aftermath of World War II. The city came to international fame as it hosted a number of football matches during the Euro 2012 Championships and was one of the 2016 European Capitals of Culture. The World Games took place in Wrocław in 2017.
The Grunwaldzki Bridge built in 1907
Like many cities in Central Europe, it is a city with a troubled past, having seen a lot of violence and devastation. Prior to the Second World War, Breslau was the capital of the German province of Prussian Lower Silesia. It became Polish territory when, after the War, the Soviets moved the German/Polish border westward to the Oder/Neisse Line and ethnically cleansed the area of its overwhelmingly German population through mass expulsion. Breslau was almost completely destroyed during the end of the War as the Red Army fought its way into Germany towards Berlin, being declared a "Fortress City" by Adolf Hitler. However, since the end of the Communist regime in 1989 it has been wonderfully restored and can now be counted among the highlights of Poland and of all Central Europe.
The official language is Polish. The city is becoming an increasingly popular tourist destination, and serves as Poland's secondary financial services centre (after Warsaw). Thus, you should be able to a find sufficient number of English speakers to get by. German is probably much more widely spoken and understood here than in other regions of Poland.
There are two tourist information points on the main market square (Rynek). There is a tourist information in the main railway station.

There are many different clubs and pubs in Wroclaw. Most of them are located in the centre of the old town, many good ones however, are situated a few crossings from the Town Square, not within its borders. The Town Square mostly contains some not very specific, quite expensive restaurants, although it is worth mentioning the Spiż Cellar, an interesting mini-brewery with a few tasty kinds of locally made beer and a unique interior design. There are also two discos that are popular among fans of house/techno music - Daytona and Związki. However, pub-wanderers, who want to meet interesting people and/or get involved in some discussions will probably enjoy places situated in some less obvious locations than right in the Town Square. Good examples of such places are:
Mleczarnia (pronounced 'Mletcharnya'), ul. Włodkowica 5. A bit further from the Town Square but still not too far, near the main courthouse in a quiet street - quite a large pub occupying the basement and ground level of an old fin-de-siecle building. It has unique dark, cozy, wooden interiors and a specific atmosphere. Music played is quite specific and varied - among the styles played are: Jewish music, jazz, progressive rock, film music and others. There are often some cultural events, like discussion clubs or film projections taking place in the basement. They also have a hostel in that same building.
Bezseność (Insomnia), ul. Ruska 51, upstairs. Concerts, film screenings. Popular place.
Setka, ul. Kazimierza Wielkiego 50A, on the corner. Supposedly Communist style, well - kitschy. But open 24/7 with cheap alcohol (4 zł for a glass of beer or shot of vodka) and good meals.
There are plenty of other clubs and pubs in Wroclaw. It's a great adventure to explore them because most have their own specific style and atmosphere.
