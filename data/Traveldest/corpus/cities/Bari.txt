Bari (Bari dialect: Bare) is the capital of the Apulia region of Italy, on the Adriatic Sea. With a population of 317,000 (in 2019), it's the second largest city in Southern Italy after Naples. It's also the core of a metropolitan area exceeding one million inhabitants and a bustling commercial centre and port.
View of the city at dusk
Bari is the largest and most important city of Apulia and stands on the Adriatic coast. It's mainly famous for being one of the exit doors of Italy, where travellers leave on ferries for neighbouring countries. The city authorities, however, have been trying to raise its tourism profile and awareness of Bari's old town, which has retained its ancient Medieval plan and contains many historic buildings and sites. The old town was the heart of pre-Roman and Roman Bari, and it is now possible to find several hip bars and restaurants open "from dusk till dawn" in this once dark and unsafe zone.
The city had strong Greek influences and, once it passed under Roman rule in the 3rd century BC, it acquired strategic significance as the junction between the coastal road and the Via Traiana and as a port for eastward trade; a branch road to Tarentum led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as in 181 BC, was probably the principal district in ancient times, as it still is, and was the centre of a fishery. The first historical bishop of Bari was Gervasius who was noted at the Council of Sardica in 347. The bishops were subordinates to the Patriarch of Constantinople until the 10th century.
The dialect of Bari belongs to the upper-southern Italo-Romance family and coexists with the Italian language, although they are generally used in different contexts.

It has the longest seafront promenade in Italy, as well as alleyways, historical buildings, marvellous architectures and more than 30 churches, among which some outstanding ones like the Basilica of Saint Nicholas which is considered to be one of the prototypes of the Apulian Romanesque architecture. It is highly suggested to take a walk along the waterfront, on the top of the old city walls, which passes by the Fortino of Saint Antony (an old fort that has been turned into a modern art gallery) and the former Monastery of Saint Scolastica (which belong to the local university). The vast majority of the churches in Bari Vecchia are closed to tourists. They are opened up on selected festivities, including Good Friday and All Saints Day).

It was later converted into a Christian Church and entrusted to the Confraternity of St. Anna. Finally, in 2009, the Church became a museum.Its history is rooted to ancient times, when there was a significant Jewish community in Apulia, mostly composed of traders and farmers. During the early Middle Ages, the Jewish culture experienced an intense growth and several Talmudic schools were established in Apulia. Rabbenu Tam considered them to be very prestigious institutions, declaring that: “For out of Bari goes forth the Law and the word of the Lord from Otranto".In the 11th century Apulia fell under the rule of the Normans and, after a couple of centuries, to the Swabians, with Frederick II, also known as "Stupor Mundi" (“Wonder of the World”), who protected the Jewish community and gave Jews rights by reason of their presence in politics and their personal history. The Angioinians, instead, ordered the forced conversion of most Jews to Catholicism and, when Naples and part of Southern Italy fell to the Spanish in 1510, the Jewish community was completely expelled.The church is located in the local Giudecca and is also close to the city harbour and the Cathedral.

Local cuisine is based on three typical agricultural products found within the Apulia region, namely wheat, olive oil and wine, beyond being even enriched by the wide variety of fruit and vegetables produced locally.
Local flour is used for homemade bread and pasta production including, most notably, the famous orecchiette (ear-shaped pasta), also known as recchietelle or strascinate, very famous accompanied by cime di rape, but also chiancarelle (orecchiette of different sizes) and cavatelli. Homemade dough is used for baked calzoni stuffed with onions, anchovies, capers and olives.
Fried panzerotti with mozzarella, the famous focaccia alla barese with tomatoes, little savoury taralli, friselle and sgagliozze, fried slices of polenta, all make up the rich Bari culinary repertoire.
Vegetable minestrone, chick peas, broad beans, chicory, celery and fennel are also often served as first courses or side dishes. Meat dishes and the local Barese ragù often include lamb and pork.
Pasta al forno, a baked pasta dish, is very popular in Bari and was historically a Sunday dish, or a dish used at the start of Lent when all the rich ingredients such as eggs and pork had to be used for religious reasons. The recipe commonly consists of penne or similar tubular pasta shapes, a tomato sauce, small beef and pork meatballs and halved hard-boiled eggs. The pasta is then topped with mozzarella or similar cheese and then baked in the oven to make the dish have its trademark crispy texture.
Other typical foods include patate riso and cozze and the popular panzerotti.
