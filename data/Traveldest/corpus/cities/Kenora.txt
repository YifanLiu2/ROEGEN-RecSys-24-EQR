Not to be confused with Canora, Saskatchewan.
Kenora is a small city in Northern Ontario. With a population of 15,000 (2021), Kenora is the westernmost major centre in Ontario. Surrounded by wilderness and thousands of lakes, and on the northern tip of Lake of the Woods, Kenora is in "cottage country" and is a vacation resort in Central Canada.
In 1905, the town of Rat Portage was amalgamated with the towns of Keewatin and Norman in 1905 to form the present-day City of Kenora. Kenora's name came from the three towns: Ke - Keewatin, No - Norman, Ra - Rat Portage.
In the summer months visitors flock to the area for swimming, biking, fishing, hiking, and boating. In the winter months, visitors come for ice fishing, snowboarding, skiing (downhill and cross country) and snowmachining.
Kenora is sometimes stereotyped as an archetypal "hoser" community, evidenced by the phrase "Kenora dinner jacket" as a nickname for a flannel shirt.
Kenora's future site was in the territory of the Ojibway when the first European, Jacques de Noyon, sighted Lake of the Woods in 1688. Pierre de La Vérendrye established a secure French trading post, Fort St. Charles, to the south of present-day Kenora near the current Canada/U.S. border in 1732, and France maintained the post until 1763 when it lost the territory to the British in the Seven Years' War — until then, it was the most northwesterly settlement of New France. In 1836 the Hudson's Bay Company established a post on Old Fort Island, and in 1861, the company opened a post on the mainland at Kenora's current location.
Gold and the railway were both important in the community's early history: gold was discovered in the area in 1850, and by 1893, 20 mines were operating within 24 km (15 mi) of Rat Portage. The first Canadian ocean-to-ocean train passed through in 1886 on the Canadian Pacific Railway.
Later, a highway was built through Kenora in 1932, now a part of the Trans-Canada Highway, placing the community on both of Canada's major transcontinental transportation routes.
During the Prohibition era in the United States, the Lake of the Woods served as a smuggler's route for the transport of alcohol.
The importance of the logging industry declined in the second part of the 20th century, and the last log boom was towed into Kenora in 1985. The tourist and recreation industries have become more important.
Kenora has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold, dry winters. Winters are cold with a January high of −11 °C ( °F) and a low of −21 °C (− °F). Temperatures below −20 °C (− °F) occur on 45 days. The average annual snowfall is 158 centimetres (62 in), which is lower than places to the east as it is influenced by the dry air of continental high pressure zones, resulting in relatively dry winters. Summers are warm with a July high of 24 °C ( °F) and a low of 15 °C ( °F) and temperatures above 30 °C ( °F) occur on  days. The average annual precipitation is 662 millimetres (26 in), with most of it being concentrated in the summer months with June being the wettest month and February the driest.
During the winter Kenora will get precipitation mostly in the form of snow, other forms of winter precipitation include ice, sleet, and freezing rain. Snow cover usually lasts from November till March, about 154 days or 42% of the year. The city frequently gets thunderstorms during the summer, averaging 24 days a year with thunderstorms.

Lake of the Woods: Kenora is on the northern tip of Lake of the Woods in "cottage country". It is the second largest inland lake in Ontario and a resort for outdoor enthusiasts. The lake has over 14,000 islands and the vast majority of the waterfront is undeveloped wilderness. Renting a boat, canoe, or kayak or taking a guided tour is a great way to see the lake.
Kenora Heritage Townscape Murals: A range of 21 murals on the sides of buildings in Kenora and nearby Keewatin depict events and scenes relative to local history. A self-guided tour pamphlet enumerating all the murals is available at the Tourist Information Centre.
Lake of the Woods Museum, at 300 Main Street South, is one of the finest small museums in Canada. The Museum was established in 1964 and seeks to promote understanding of and respect for the cultures and heritage of the Lake of the Woods area, and to engage a diverse community in discovery and learning. Today, this well-established museum is home to a varied and intriguing collection of artifacts and thematic displays and special events.
Keewatin Potholes, 1 block south of Highway 17 at 6th St. in Keewatin. These round, cylindrical holes in the outcrop appear to be man-made but they were formed by the action of running water during glaciation. These holes are thought to have formed from water-spun rock fragments that have slowly eroded holes in the bedrock. The Keewatin rockholes provide evidence for glaciation in the Lake of the Woods area and demonstrate that sediment-laden, high-velocity water can perform major and unusual feats of erosion.
Husky the Muskie: In 1967, the year of the Canadian Centennial, Kenora erected this sculpture which has become the town's mascot and one of its most recognizable features.
M.S. Kenora, a great way to experience the splendour of Lake of the Woods. Built as a freight ship on Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, it was rechristened as the M.S. Kenora in 1984.

Bald eagles and wildlife can also be sighted. There is a fully licensed restaurant onboard. A daily dinner cruise is offered and a Sunday brunch cruise. Air-conditioned cabin and outdoor decks.
The Lake of the Woods is home to variety of fish species.
For the seasoned professional, the majority of lodges are in the heart of fishing supremacy; some lakes in the area have even been designated as trophy waters. Accommodations offer a variety in bait and lures, as well as boat rentals complete with live wells, fish finders and navigational aids.
For those interested in guide services, the area has several.
There are some very challenging trails close to town. For the sensation of exposed rugged bedrock and a wonderful view of the town and the lake saddle up and ride to the top of the Little Amik Trail. The trail takes a small loop and is moderately challenging if only approximately one kilometre long. A good warm up.
From the parking lot you can choose to go a little more hardcore to the North or take a scenic ride to the beaches to the south and west. Taking a turn to the left and past the Paper Mill will bring you to Scramble Ave. Go to the end of the street and you will find an advanced level trail which leads to Garrow Park on Rabbit Lake. Be cautious. Many riders have been injured on the rocks, roots and rivulets.
Make your way to the east end of Rabbit Lake and you’ll find a trailhead which leads to the pipeline and hydroline (beside the school board storage building). From here turning left, to the West, will bring you back toward town but you will have to conquer a few hills and swampy sections. Turning right, to the east, is the beginning of the ‘epic’ ride. Big hills, big swamps and some endurance oriented excursion grinding will give you hours of sweat and enjoyment. Don’t worry about getting lost - you are never very far from a road or highway to head home on. If you know you're going to go hard, fill your water bottles and tell someone where you plan to go. Ask at a local bike shop for more information.
Just west of Casey’s Bar & Grill you’ll find scenic Sandy Nook and even further west (just past Keewatin) on Hwy 17, look for the Mackenzie Portage Road which leads to the moderately challenging Vernon Trails.
A 40-min drive north on Hwy 596 will lead you to the Minaki Yurt Adventures race trail. It is a well developed and maintained 25-km course featuring some moderate to advanced level riding. They offer bike rentals, lessons, great local hospitality and unique accommodation options.
For those with a pioneering spirit and explorers enthusiasm there is great potential for discovering old logging roads and all terrain vehicle trails in the forest areas. Adventure tourists can take pleasure in the wilderness, wildlife, landforms and the unique history of the Kenora area as one of the most rugged destinations they may ever ride a bike through.
