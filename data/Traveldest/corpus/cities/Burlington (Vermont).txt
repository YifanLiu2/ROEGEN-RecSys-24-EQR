Burlington is the largest city in the American state of Vermont. Situated on Lake Champlain, it is the heart of a small urban area that acts as Vermont's vibrant and cosmopolitan center. Known for its ultra-liberal environment (for an American town at least) and free-thinking spirit, Burlington is a college town and an important commercial city, but maintains an intimate atmosphere.
Burlington, a city of 45,000 people (2020), is known outside of Vermont mostly as the place where Ben & Jerry's ice cream began, and as the city where democratic socialist Bernie Sanders launched his political career, winning the 1980 mayoral election and serving in that role for eight years before moving on to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the 2016/2020 presidential races. However, contrary to what you may think, this lovely town has a lot more to offer than left-wing politics and ice cream.
It is relatively well connected to Montreal to the north and Plattsburgh, New York to the west.
Burlington International Airport (BTV IATA), Airport Drive, ☏ +1 802-863-1889. Served by a number of airlines with non-stop service to destinations as far as Chicago and Orlando.
Interstate 89 lies just to the east of town. The town center is accessible via exit 14W, while the south end of town can be accessed via Interstate 189 at exit 13. Interstate 89 continues north to the Canadian border at Highgate, and south and east to the New Hampshire city of Concord. U.S. Route 7 can also be useful for accessing Burlington from the south, as it travels north from western Connecticut and Massachusetts and the southwestern Vermont town of Bennington.
It is a 6-hour drive from New York City, a 3½-hour drive from Boston and a 1½- to 2-hour drive from Montreal.
Greyhound, ☏ +1-800-552-8737. The Greyhound bus terminal is at the airport, but there is stop at the downtown transit center (listed as "Burlingt Transit Ctr" on the website search page - you must type "burlingt" without the "-on" to find it in the search). The price for the two stops differs by about $7.

Downtown Burlington is one of the most walkable and beautiful small cities in New England, and you'd do well to get out of your car (parking in city and most private garages is free for the first 2 hours, and all day on Sundays) and soak it in.
There are car rental offices at Burlington International Airport, including Hertz, Avis and Thrifty. Traffic is generally bad during the normal crunch half-hours (7:45-8:15AM and 4:45-5:15PM). Williston Road to the east and Shelburne Road to the south are congested during those hours, and, unfortunately, unavoidable for the most part.
Burlington and the surrounding communities of Winooski, South Burlington, Shelburne, Colchester and Essex Junction are served by Green Mountain Transit (GMT) which operates public buses. Buses are generally clean, uncrowded and relatively cheap. The main terminal is in downtown Burlington at the intersection of Church St. and Cherry St.
Burlington is a bike-friendly city. There are various bike lanes around the downtown area, and thanks to slow traffic and often courteous drivers, getting around the greater Burlington area on bike is a breeze. In the summer extra bicycle parking is made available, and low bike-related crime helps encourage everyone to get on their bikes. Bikes can be rented at Local Motion on the waterfront or at some of the other bicycle shops around town.
Downtown Burlington is home to an eclectic mix of shops and restaurants, and is well known for its pedestrian Church Street Marketplace. Church Street is home to a multitude of performers ranging from violists to folk singers to hip-hop dancers, and you don't have to pay a penny, although it doesn't hurt to leave a few dollars. Burlington is ideal for observing all sorts of individuals: flower-child hippies, students, funky artists, tattooed hipsters, and preps mingle on the streets and can provide unparalleled entertainment.

Williams' Fire Escape, Williams Hall, University Pl. One of Burlington's hidden treasures is a few flights up the fire escape of one of UVM's buildings. Williams Hall, across from the University Green, is an architectural masterpiece in its own right. However, the sunset sights seen from an outside stairwell are some of the best views one will experience. If there are not too many people/students visiting the spot, it is a romantic and breathtaking place to visit. At the uppermost flight of the fire escape, all of downtown Burlington, spanning to Lake Champlain, is visible. At sunset, the sun hits the water and the buildings in a lovely way.

Outdoor activities include a -mile (-km) bike pathdead link that runs along the lake and now connects to the Colchester bike path. Mount Philo is a leisurely hike for beginners, especially with younger kids. Camel's Hump and Mount Mansfield offer more challenging terrain, but reward hikers with beautiful summit views of the Champlain Valley. All three mountains are within 1-hour driving distance of Burlington.
