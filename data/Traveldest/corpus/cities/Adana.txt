Adana is a city on the Cilician Plains of central Turkey, on the Seyhan River about 50 km from the Mediterranean coast. It's industrial and mostly modern but with several places of interest in its historic centre. In 2021 the metropolis had a population of 2,263,373.
Adana has been inhabited for over 8000 years. The name may drive from a proto-European word danu, "on the river", making it an unlikely cousin of the Danube, Dnieper and Doncaster. People known to settle here include the Luwians, Hittites, Sea People, Assyrians, Cilicians, Persians, Selucids, Armenians and Romans - these built the stone bridge (Taşköprü) over the river. Adana changed hands many times after the break-up of the Roman-Byzantine Empire but came under Ottoman control from 1517. In early modern times it developed a cotton industry and had a polyglot population of Muslims, Armenians, Greeks, Syrians and Arabs. But inter-ethnic tensions played into resentment of industrial labour conditions, and the Armenians suffered a massacre in 1908 then genocide in 1915.
The cotton trade has slumped but the economy of Adana remains based on agriculture, plus mixed industries including automobiles, and banking. It nowadays has four districts: Seyhan is the historic core, with the sites of traveller interest. Çukurova, often called "New Adana", is a residential area north along the lake shore. Yüreğir east of the river is industrial and low-rent residential. Sarıçam lies northeast and has the university. A fifth, nominally part of Sarıçam, is İncirlik, where the NATO air base is springboard for operations deeper into Asia. This effort has brought an influx of westerners into Adana, and the town has business hotels and other western-style amenities out of proportion to its size.
Adana lost about 450 of its citizens in a dozen collapsed buildings (mostly high-rise residentials) during a series of powerful earthquakes in early 2023. The local damage was incomparably lighter than that suffered by its eastern neighbours closer to the epicentre.
Adana Şakirpaşa Airport (ADA IATA), Barış Blv, ☏ +90 322 435 0380. There are few international flights, but frequent flights from Istanbul (both IST and SAW), Ankara and Izmir. Other Turkish cities with a daily flight are Antalya, Trabzon and Van. There's car hire in the terminal from a couple of companies. (updated Jan 2023)
The airport is only 4 km west of town, with taxis and dolmuşes to the centre. Bus 135 runs every 30 min to the old centre (15 min), railway station and northwest suburbs. Bus 125 runs hourly past old centre (get off at Sefa Ölzer Cd) to the hospital campus. Buy tickets on board for both. The direct bus to Tarsus and Mersin is axed.
Buses from Istanbul run every couple of hours and take 13 hours via Ankara and Niğde, for a fare in 2023 of 350 TL.
Three buses a day take 5 hours from Konya. Two per day wind over the mountains from Antalya via Alanya, Taşucu (for Cyprus summer ferry), Silifke, Mersin and Tarsus.
One bus a day runs all the way from Van near the border with Iran, via Tatvan, Bitlis, Batman, Diyarbakır, Sanliurfa, Gaziantep and Osmaniye.
Bus operators on these routes are Metro Turizm and Flixbus.
Adana Otogarı the bus terminal is 4 km west of town on D-400; it's average-tatty. Taxis and minibuses will take you downtown.
Note: Regional trains between Adana and Mersin are suspended until 2026 due to construction of a tunnel in Tarsus. Use intercity buses as an alternative instead.
You can reach Adana same day from Istanbul or Ankara by taking the YHT high-speed train to Konya. Change there for the daily Toros Ekspresi, taking six hours via Karaman to reach Adana for 22:00. The return train leaves Adana before 08:00 and likewise connects at Konya with YHT trains to Istanbul and Ankara. The Karaman-Adana line is being upgraded for high-speed trains so disruptions may occur until this is complete (maybe by 2025) but in 2023 it's running normally.
There's also slower mainline trains such as Erciyes Ekspresi that runs daily from Kayseri, taking six hours via Niğde, and Fırat Ekspresi which runs daily from Elazığ, taking 13 hours via Malatya and Osmaniye. Finally there's an hourly regional train from Mersin (for ferries from Northern Cyprus) taking 90 min via Tarsus. Three trains per day continue to Iskenderun, taking 3 hours via Osmaniye.
Other routes are a tale of woe. The Cukurova Express sleeper from Ankara and trains from Gaziantep has been suspended for years or due to construction works. Former international routes from Syria and Iraq are closed indefinitely.
Adana railway station (Adana garı), Atatürk Cd (1 km north of city centre). Built in 1912 as a hub along the Berlin-Baghdad railway, an Ottoman-German collaboration which in its heyday carried Agatha Christie, Graham Greene, and the sort of louche characters that were forever getting murdered on the Orient Express. The station is quite nice but services are limited. (updated Jul 2023)
From Ankara it's 500 km, say 5 hours, following O-21 motorway south then O-51 east. In 2022 the tolls totalled 163 TL.
O-52 runs east to Osmaniye, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Mardin by the Syrian border. West is a good highway past Mersin but then a narrow twisty road over the coastal mountains to reach the Med resort strip at Alanya.
Walk: the city sprawls but the area of interest in the old town is compact.
City buses — Extensive bus network including city buses and dolmuş.
