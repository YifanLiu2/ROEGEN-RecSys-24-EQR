Pretoria, the administrative capital of South Africa, is in Gauteng. Its wide avenues are lined with purple-flowered jacaranda trees and stately architecture. The city has many museums and art galleries, and a large student population that gives its centre a boisterous atmosphere.
Pretoria is part of City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality.
The area known today as Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality, with Pretoria (City) at its centre, is believed to have been occupied by the Sotho people for many centuries. During the 15th century the Ndebele people also migrated into the area and settled along the banks of the Apies River. Tshwane tsʰwane is the Setswana name of the Apies River. Around 1820 the Matabele under the leadership of Mzilikaza also entered the region, leading to local conflicts between the Matabele newcomers and the already established Sotho and Ndebele tribes as well as the European "Voortrekkers" who were steadily moving northward through the country. These conflicts came to an end when the Matabele were defeated by the "Voortrekkers" in 1837 at Mosega.
By 1855 there was no known tribe in what is known as the Pretoria area today. Only nomadic groups passed through this area, with one of the Setswana people (so it is alleged) led them. Pretoria was founded in 1855. The first capital of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic) was Ohrigstad, but the capital was moved to Pretoria. After the Second Boer War, the ZAR become Transvaal province, and Pretoria its capital. The city was named after Andries Pretorius, the Boer leader at the Battle of Blood River where the Voortrekkers defeated the Zulus under King Dingaan. In 1856 the area today known as Arcadia was acquired in exchange for a pony and added to the town.
In 1899, during the Second Boer War, Winston Churchill was captured and held as a POW in Pretoria until his eventual escape to Mozambique. British forces captured Pretoria in 1900 and held control over the city until the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging in 1902.
When the Union of South Africa was established in 1910, Pretoria was elected the capital and is still the administrative capital of the Republic of South Africa today.
Pretoria is located in a summer rainfall area with hot days regularly followed by short and intense afternoon thunderstorms. The thunderstorms are often accompanied by lightning and occasionally result in hail. Summer temperatures range between 16°C at night to 30°C during the day, with occasionally higher temperatures (up to about 36°C). Winters are mild and dry with temperatures averaging between a minimum of 5°C and a maximum of 20°C. Winter nights and (occasionally winter days) can be surprisingly cold and buildings are generally not well insulated. Bring warm clothes if you're visiting during the winter months.

Although crime in South Africa is higher than in many other parts of the world, common sense precautions should prevent incidents. Be especially aware of your surroundings after dark and don't travel alone. Main shopping centres are reasonably safe.
Either use a metered taxi, rent a car or use the municipal bus service. There is also a very extensive network of informal, cheap minibus taxis, mostly used by local commuters. These taxis used to have a reputation for being unsafe, but this has greatly improved and most taxis are now relatively luxurious and not overcrowded, except during peak times. Accidents are rare. Ask locals waiting at taxi stops about routes and rates.
Walking is a good option during the day, but may be unsafe after dusk in certain areas, such as central Pretoria.

There are now 13 trunks, and the colossal tree covers an area with a diameter of 55 metres.

It was never used. It was blown up, probably on the instruction of Prime Minister Jan Smuts, in the early days of the Second World War, lest it be used by anti-government dissidents as a springboard for an attack on the state.

Pretoria is considered to be a relatively safe city by South African standards and violent crime against tourists is somewhat rare. That said, basic common sense should still be used. Ask locals before you do things. Life after sunset stops a bit and moves to the big shopping centers outside the city. Avoid walking around after dark, even in a group or at Union Buildings. The city centre becomes deserted after nightfall, so it would not be wise to hang around at these times. The shop owners will close their security blinds to protect their property so there is little to see. Hatfield Plaza and all other major shopping centers are busy with shoppers, students, tourists, police and car minders until approximately 22:00 there is very little chance of any real trouble happening, but it can be annoying and daunting for tourists as the beggars are quite insistent but occurs less in guarded shopping centers. That said, the Hatfield area is usually perfectly safe. Consider that you still have to move from the safe area to your hotel through an unsafe area. In case of trouble, here are important telephone numbers. Be especially vigilant at night by traffic lights and stop signs. Car-jacking and smash and grab thefts do occur.
