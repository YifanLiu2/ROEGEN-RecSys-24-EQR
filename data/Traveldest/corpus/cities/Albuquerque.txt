Albuquerque is a vibrant, sprawling city near the center of New Mexico. Cradled in the Rio Grande Valley beneath the Sandia Mountains, it is by far the largest city in the state, acting as the media, educational, and economic center of New Mexico, as well as the home of the state's only major airport, making it a common entry point into New Mexico. Despite this, Albuquerque is often overshadowed as a tourist destination by Santa Fe, 60 miles (97 km) to the north.
But any visit to New Mexico would be incomplete without taking in what Albuquerque has to offer, as New Mexico's only major city has pleasant scenery, colorful history, and a wealth of great attractions in its own right. Here, in a setting that has been made familiar to many by the television series Breaking Bad, you'll find many excellent museums, colorful neon signs along old Route 66, the naturalistic beauty of the Rio Grande and the Sandia Mountains, and a spectacular hot-air balloon festival in the fall.
Albuquerque was founded in 1706 as a small Spanish settlement on the banks of the Rio Grande and was named for the Duke of Alburquerque (hence Albuquerque's nickname, "The Duke City"). In the 1880s the railroad came to town, and almost overnight a new city grew up around the train tracks a couple of miles away from the original settlement. This "New Town" became the hub of commerce for the state, and the city grew exponentially (eventually the "New Town", which today is Downtown, and the original "Old Town" settlement were joined to become part of the same city).
In the 1920s the federal government designated a series of highways that ran from Chicago to Los Angeles as Route 66, and Albuquerque was one of the towns "The Mother Road" passed through. Starting in the 1950s, Albuquerque grew exponentially given federal investment in the local military bases and a massive influx of visitors and new residents, and for the most part it hasn't slowed down. Today, Albuquerque is still the hub of commerce and transportation in the state. While Santa Fe is the state capital and the principal tourist destination of New Mexico, Albuquerque is the state's only truly urban area, with a city population of over 500,000 and a metropolitan population of nearly a million people. This is where you'll find the headquarters of the state's businesses, the University of New Mexico, and the Albuquerque International Sunport, the only major airport in the state.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Albuquerque is in the high semi-desert N −W (Elev. 4989 ft/1521 m) and has a generally warm, dry climate with four distinct seasons. Spring is sunny and windy, although temperatures at night can be unexpectedly cool. Summers are hot (highs average 90–95°F/34°C, and temperatures near 100°F/38°C are not rare) and still mainly dry, but monsoonal conditions develop in July or August and produce furious if short-lived thunderstorms. Have rainwear available in the summer, although you won't use it most days. Fall is delightful, with comfortable temperatures and a return to generally dry conditions. Winter can be blustery, with overnight lows below freezing, but subzero temperatures are rare. One winter-weather issue for the traveler: snow, while infrequent and short-lived, does occur, and its relative rarity means that local drivers don't deal with it well. If you happen to be in town for a snowstorm, expect road chaos far out of proportion to the amount of snow that falls.
Albuquerque's demographics are reflective of New Mexico as a whole. While Albuquerque does have a large non-native population, the city's makeup is predominantly white and/or Hispanic, with a significant population of Native Americans. These groups are spread throughout the city, but the largest concentrations of Hispanics are found in the South Valley (along the river on the south side of town) and in the Southeast Heights near Kirtland Air Force Base. The Southeast Heights is where you'll also find a large foreign-born population, with significant groups of Vietnamese, Taiwanese, Central American, African, and Middle Eastern descent.
Albuquerque is a casual town: expect shorts, a T-shirt, and sandals to be entirely acceptable almost everywhere. It's also a very humble city, with something of a self-deprecating vibe; you may hear a local remark on how backwards and small it is compared to larger Western cities, though this frequently gets rebuked with a passion from locals who adore their home. Either way, people here tend to be extremely friendly and exhibit very little pretension.

"The Big I", the busiest intersection in the state
Two interstate highways pass through: I-40 goes east–west and I-25 goes north–south. Where they meet is a large intersection called "The Big I". Albuquerque's Central Ave. is part of old Route 66. A minor note of caution: I-25 south of the city is a "safety corridor" in which state law mandates higher fines for traffic violations. Enforcement is spotty, but take the speed limits seriously anyway.
Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ IATA). The major air hub for all of New Mexico. Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, JetBlue, and United serve the Sunport with limited service from their respective major hubs, but it's Southwest Airlines that operates most traffic into ABQ, with direct service from most western cities and from some of Southwest's hubs in the Midwest and eastern United States.
One tip: If you're prone to airsickness, try to get flights into this airport that arrive either before noon or after sundown, particularly during late spring and early summer. The high elevation, hot sun, and spring winds combine to produce thermals that can make afternoon arrivals an extremely bumpy proposition. There are no major safety issues (the airport's runways are long, owing to the adjacent Air Force base, with no nearby obstacles to run into), but try telling your stomach that! The rough ride is less of a problem with outbound flights.
Incidentally, this airport has a number of attractive displays of New Mexican arts and crafts, and is a more pleasant place than most airports to kill time while waiting for a flight. The Sunport also has charging stations for electronics and free wireless internet access. The major car rental companies are nearby, with a shuttle from the airport to the large rental center. The airport is served by a number of shuttle services and by local bus #50 on the lower level at the west end of the shuttle island.
Albuquerque is a layover stop along Amtrak's Southwest Chief daily train route. The station is at the  Alvarado Transportation Center, in downtown at 320 First St SW (in the same building as the Greyhound depot). The westbound train to Los Angeles is scheduled to arrive at 3:55PM and departs at 4:45PM. The eastbound train to Chicago arrives at 11:42AM and departs at 12:10PM. The station has a small cafeteria.
A commuter rail line, the New Mexico Rail Runner Express, connects Albuquerque to Santa Fe and to the smaller communities north and south along the Rio Grande, including Belen, Los Lunas, and Bernalillo to Belen as its southern terminus. The main station is at the Alvarado Transportation Center in Downtown, which has regular bus connections along Central Avenue and to the airport. The Rail Runner runs daily, although service can be limited outside the weekday rush hour periods. Fares are based on how far you ride; a day pass will usually be in the range of $4–10. Tickets can be purchased online or from ticket agents on the train.
Albuquerque has a fine bus depot at the  Alvarado Transportation Center in downtown, 320 First St SW, which is served by Greyhound ☏ +1 505 243-4435, and Autobuses Americanos which provides bus service to many points in Mexico. The depot has a small cafeteria.
Albuquerque is a heavily planned city. In much of the city, the major roads are lined primarily with businesses with residential mazes on the insides. The city is divided into four quadrants, with street addresses taking the form "12345 Main St. (NE/NW/SE/SW)" in which the NE/NW/SE/SW suffix denotes the quadrant of the city containing the address. The railroad tracks, which run parallel to I-25, are the east–west dividing line, and Central Ave. is the north–south dividing line. Thus, the street address 3600 Menaul NE would be north of Central and east of the railroad tracks. This nomenclature, while useful in helping you with maps and directions, has the drawback that you can't tell whether a street runs north–south or east–west simply by looking at the address.
By and large it's difficult to get truly lost in Albuquerque, thanks in large part to the looming presence of the Sandia Mountains to the east. If you can also remember that I-25 runs north–south, I-40 runs east–west, and the Rio Grande runs along the bottom of the valley in the western part of the city, you should be able to make your way around the city without too many problems. Here are some basic terms that will come in handy when asking for directions or looking at a map:
Central Avenue is a principal east–west artery, running roughly parallel to I-40 and through Downtown just west of I-25 and past the University of New Mexico (UNM for short) just east of I-25.
The Heights are the eastern part of town closest to the Sandia Mountains. You may also hear reference to the Foothills, which are the most extreme eastern part of the city, right at the base of the mountains.
Uptown is a business and shopping district in the Heights at I-40 and Louisiana Blvd.
The North Valley and Los Ranchos de Albuquerque (which is a separate municipality from Albuquerque) encompass the area north of I-40 between I-25 and the river.
The South Valley is the area south of Central Avenue west of I-25.
The Westside is all the suburban neighborhoods on the western side of the river. Rio Rancho, a separate community from Albuquerque, is the metro area's largest suburb and can be considered a northern extension of the Westside. Sandwiched between Albuquerque and Rio Rancho is the village of Corrales, which sits adjacent to the river and has a more rural feel, with a single narrow roadway through town lined with picturesque adobe buildings, many of them containing locally owned shops.
If you're driving, be prepared for frequent road construction. The city government web site gives information on major construction projects, but there are always minor ones going on. Several radio stations try to give traffic reports during morning and afternoon rush hours, but the service tends to come and go, and it's best to inquire locally as to which stations are offering it. KKOB-AM, 770 on the dial, seems to be fairly reliable for these reports. The interchange of I-40 and I-25 is commonly called "The Big I", and you will hear it referred to as such in traffic reports. Traffic congestion, while not nearly as horrible as some of the other cities in the Western U.S., can still get bad during the rush hour and on Saturdays. The two interstates and the river crossings usually have the worst congestion.
Many Albuquerqueans seem to consider I-40 and 25, which run through the city, to be their own personal expressways. The lack of turn signal usage is a running joke for most Albuquerque drivers, so watch for cars changing lanes without warning. However, Interstate traffic usually flows around the pace of the speed limit.
Driving while talking on your cell phone is illegal in Albuquerque unless you use a hands-free system.
ABQ Ride, ☏ +1 505 243-RIDE (7433), is Albuquerque's public transit system. Despite some strides in the development of its public transit system, Albuquerque is still primarily a driving city, so with the exception of Central Avenue public transit is still for the most part very underdeveloped. Most of ABQ Ride's routes spur out of the Alvarado Transportation Center in Downtown at Central Avenue & First Street, which also serves as Albuquerque's Amtrak station and Greyhound depot as well as a Rail Runner station. Bus service is reduced during the weekend.
The ART (formerly Rapid Ride) is an express bus service operated by ABQ Ride which runs frequently, utilizing bright red articulated buses. There are three routes: the #766 (Red Line) and #777 (Green Line) each run very frequently and almost entirely on Central Avenue, serving attractions such as the BioPark, Old Town, Downtown, UNM, Nob Hill, the fairgrounds, and Uptown; the #766 runs between Uptown and Unser/Central on the Westside, while the #777 runs between Downtown and Tramway/Central on the eastern edge of the city. Additionally, the #790 (Blue Line) connects UNM to the Cottonwood Mall area on the Westside, but runs less frequently than the Central Avenue lines and is geared more towards commuters. Local routes that are useful for visitors include the #50, which runs Monday–Saturday between the airport and Downtown; and #40 (the "D-Ride"), a free shuttle which circulates around Downtown on the weekdays.
For visitor access to the Sun Van paratransit service, call ☏ +1 505-243-7433 or pdmadrid@cabq.gov at least two business days in advance.
All travel on ABQ Ride is free.
Albuquerque is fairly bikeable, but it's a sprawling Western city and things are spread out. It's hillier than it looks; Old Town and Downtown attractions are several hundred feet lower than things in the heights on the eastern side of the city; plan accordingly. Getting around by bike can be a mixed bag in Albuquerque: street cycling can be risky as drivers may not always be aware and most major streets lack bicycle lanes (and even those that do have lanes may require uncomfortably close proximity to fast traffic). On the other hand, Albuquerque has a very proactive cycling community and a splendid paved trail network which is undergoing an expansion phase.
The crown jewel in this network is the Paseo del Bosque Trail, which runs along the east side of the Rio Grande and offers lovely riverside scenery. Another backbone to the trail network is the North Diversion Channel Trail which runs from UNM north to Balloon Fiesta Park, and while not nearly as scenic as the Bosque trail (it runs along a concrete drainage channel and past some industry) it offers the occasional grand vista of the city. Another fun ride is the paved trail along Tramway Boulevard on the eastern edge of the city, which offers excellent views of the city and access to the foothills of the Sandia Mountains. You can find a complete bike map of all the trails, lanes, and recommended routes on the city's bicycling website.
A principal corridor for equestrian use is the Paseo del Bosque Trail. Trailhead parking lots are large and one, at the Los Ranchos open space in the North Valley, has a feed store,  Miller's Feed.

Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, 2401 12th St NW (just north of I-40), ☏ +1 505 843-7270. 9AM–5PM daily, closed on major holidays. A tourist complex operated by the 19 Indian Pueblos of New Mexico. Though there is a museum about pueblo history and culture on-site, it's rather small and tucked away, with most of the complex given over to more lucrative ventures like an art gallery, a restaurant, and a large gift shop (a better museum experience can be found at the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture up in Santa Fe). Besides the gift shop, the best reason to visit this place is the regularly scheduled Indian dances which take place in the courtyard. $, $ seniors/military, $ students/children, under age 5 free.

Even for those who are skeptical of the merits of nuclear arms and power, a visit to this museum makes for an interesting experience; a particularly illuminating exhibit is a guestbook where visitors are invited to share their thoughts regarding the use of atomic bombs on Japan, and as one might expect, such a controversial matter invites a wide variety of strong opinions. Outside the museum is a collection of nuclear-capable aircraft standing alongside rockets, missiles, and even a cannon designed to fire nuclear bombs. $12, $10 seniors/youth, $8 veterans, $7 active military, age 5 and under free.

The San Felipe de Neri Church, Old Town
The Old Town is east of Rio Grande Boulevard in between Central Ave. and Mountain Rd. (west of downtown).
A nice sightseeing area, Old Town is where the city was founded in 1706 and is a place where centuries of history and modern life merge; 18th century architecture with narrow brick paths is blended with adobe architecture, and there are lots of little nooks and crannies, small restaurants, and specialty shops.

A narrow-gauge train links Tingley Beach to the Albuquerque Aquarium/Botanical Gardens and the Rio Grande Zoo (listed above under See). Free (separate fee required for train rides).

The Sandia Mountains, with the Rio Grande in the foreground
The Sandia Mountains offer outdoors opportunities ranging from straight hiking (the La Luz trail is popular, perhaps too much so) on to serious, multi-day rock climbing. Mountain biking is also really popular, and there are great trails in the foothills as well as at a ski area on the other side of the mountains during the summer. If less athletically inclined, ride the Sandia Peak Tramway (see "See" section above) to the top. At the base of the mountains, near the tramway, you can find magnificent views of the city and mountains and access trails into the mountains, especially around the  Elena Gallegos Picnic Area. For a map of Sandia Mountain trails, see the Cibola National Forest website. During the winter, the Sandia Peak Ski Area serves skiers and snowboarders; see Cedar Crest for details. The ski area can be reached either by taking a 45 min. drive around the mountain to the base lodge or by taking the tramway up to the top of the mountain—presuming there's enough snow at the top (skiers get a discount on tramway tickets, but you have to bring your own equipment).
Albuquerque Isotopes, at the corner of Avenida Cesar Chavez and University Blvd (south of UNM), ☏ +1 505 924-2255. Season runs from April–September. The Isotopes, Triple-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies, play baseball in a beautiful stadium. Seats in the park are both good and cheap—$16 can get you a seat behind home plate. All the concessions and restrooms are along a big concourse behind the seats which is open to the field, so you don't miss any of the action. For $9 a ticket, you can bring a picnic blanket and find a spot in the grassy "Berm" behind right field that's perfect for kids—they can enjoy the grass and play on the playground on top of the Berm. Beware of foul balls—the park is a notorious "launching pad" for hitters that drives pitchers nuts. The park also hosts the new men's soccer team New Mexico United (below). $9–36. (updated May 2021)

New Mexico Lobos (UNM sports), Avenida Cesar Chavez / University Blvd (south of UNM), ☏ +1 505 925-5626. The Lobos are big. For a deafening experience in college sports, try to catch a basketball game at "The Pit" (formally named Dreamstyle Arena), the university's semi-underground fieldhouse that has been a house of pain for visiting basketball teams for over 50 years. The women's teams have often been better than the men's in this century, and attract crowds every bit as raucous—when the teams are doing really well, games will sell out. Right across the street is Dreamstyle Stadium, home of the immensely popular Lobos football team. Football tickets $20–40, $15–20 children. Basketball tickets $8–42, $4–19 children (women's game tickets are cheaper than men's). UNM students are free, guests of students can sometimes get a discount. (updated Jun 2017)

The Fiesta is the world's largest ballooning event and one of the most photographed events in the world. A cultural landmark for Albuquerque (and indeed, all of New Mexico), this festival gives you a first-hand look at the world of ballooning. For nine days in October, you can walk out onto a large field where balloonists from around the world set up, inflate, launch, and possibly land their balloons. Mass ascensions of balloons with hundreds of different colors and shapes create an often stunning and magnificent sight. It's one of the most heavily attended festivals in the entire U.S.
Balloons fly best in cooler conditions, so many of the events take place early in the morning. Traffic is pretty bad around the festival; expect a long, long line of cars (you may want to seriously consider taking park-and-ride to beat the traffic). Get your hotel reservations far in advance, because everyone fills up around this time of year.
If the event is rained or snowed out, there are no refunds on prices. Most years the weather works in favor of the balloonists, so this shouldn't be a problem, though.
A sky full of balloons during a mass ascension
The event begins on the first Saturday of October and ends with a farewell mass ascension on the Sunday of the following weekend, with numerous events in-between, such as concerts and balloon races. Here are a few of the highlights of the fiesta:
Dawn Patrol. Every day there's a Dawn Patrol at around 6AM, where a few balloons take off before the sun rises. These balloons test the conditions before other balloons take off.
Mass Ascension. On weekend days at about 7AM the Mass Ascension occurs, which is the lift off of all the balloons participating in the fiesta, usually in two waves. Not to be missed.
Balloon Glow. On weekend evenings (except for the final day of the event) a Balloon Glow takes place, when the balloons don't lift off the ground, but are illuminated by the light of their propane burners going off.
Morning Glow. The same as the balloon glow but early in the morning (may not always occur).
Special Shapes Rodeo. Happens at 7AM on the Thursday and Friday of the event, which is a Mass Ascension for all the "special shape" balloons. There are also Balloon Glows called Glowdeos (a portmanteau of "glow" and "rodeo") for the special shape balloons. The special shapes are the balloons in forms other than the standard balloon shape, and are very popular with kids; expect to see animals, cartoon characters, clowns, and many other colorful creations. Returning favorites include a milk cow, a wagon coach, and a trio of bees.
And if you want to do more than watch the balloons, there are several local companies which provide balloon rides year-round:
Rainbow Ryders, ☏ +1 505 823-1111. The only one which operates directly from Balloon Fiesta Park during the Balloon Fiesta.
The tree-lined Main Street of the Expo New Mexico fairgrounds during the State Fair
Besides the Balloon Fiesta, there are numerous festivals and celebrations on a yearly basis. Here are some of the major ones:
New Mexico State Fair: September, held at the Expo New Mexico fairgrounds (on Louisiana between Central and Lomas, east of UNM and south of Uptown), ☏ +1 505 265-EXPO (3976). Takes place annually for two weeks in September. Second only to the Balloon Fiesta, the state fair is a massive event in the Albuquerque calendar. Like any state fair, there's lots of agricultural competitions, farm animals, rodeos, carnival rides, art, music, and fried food. Unique to the New Mexico State Fair are lots of exhibits that show off the pride and character of New Mexico, such as art galleries, a performing arts center, an Indian Village (where you can watch Native American music and dance) and the Villa Hispana, where you can see regular demonstrations of local art and culture. $10 adults, $7 seniors/children, children 5 and under free.
Gathering of Nations Pow-Wow: April. A massive pow-wow — the largest in North America, in fact — which brings Native Americans and First Nations people from across the continent together for a huge celebration. There are many events, including the powwow, native music, arts, crafts, and food, and the Miss Indian World pageant. The event takes place in late April at the Expo New Mexico fairgrounds. (date needs updating)
Festival Flamenco Internacional de Alburquerque: mid-July. One of the most exciting Flamenco gatherings in the country, with artists from around the world. Held annually during the summer, usually in early June, at a number of venues. (date needs fixing)
Around Christmas time, thousands of luminarias (a paper bag half-filled with sand with a lit candle placed inside) line the streets of Old Town. If you come to the city during this time of year you are also likely to see electric luminarias (a string of lights designed to resemble authentic luminarias) lining the roofs of many buildings in the city. You may also see luminaria displays in some of the city's residential neighborhoods, on the UNM campus, and on many an individual's front yard, but Old Town provides the most accessible and dramatic display.
Upon first glance, it might seem like your only place to shop are the miles and miles of strip malls that line the major arterials. While that's not entirely the case, everything is really spread out, with the exception of the concentrated Old Town-Downtown-Nob Hill area along Central Ave. So while you can find just about anything you're looking for, you will probably have to drive a ways to get it.
Here are some good places around town to shop:
Shops along an Old Town alleyway
Old Town, at Central & Rio Grande. If you're looking for all the "New Mexican" shops, this is probably the next best thing to Santa Fe.

You can also find plenty of antiques, art galleries, jewelry, pottery, weavings, clothing stores, and other specialty shops.

This page uses the following price ranges for a typical meal for one, including soft drink:
Dining out in Albuquerque tends to be relatively inexpensive and very casual. Many places offer outdoor seating. Iced tea is the beverage of choice.
New Mexican cuisine is unique. Be ready for the question "Red or green?" or in Spanish "¿Rojo o verde?" which refers to the chile-based sauce included in or used to smother various menu items. There are constant arguments as to which is hotter, the ripe and often dried red chile, or the immature green chile; however, spiciness depends much more on the strain of pepper and how the chile is prepared rather than the color, and varies greatly by restaurant, so inquire and experiment. Many meals will include sopaipillas, the characteristic New Mexican fry bread, as a side. The characteristic desserts are flan, a type of custard, or Natillas, closer in texture to pudding.

This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:
If you want a nicer—and pricier—hotel, then head east on I-40 to "uptown" (in the northeast side of the city, which is at higher elevation than "downtown" close to the river) or north on I-25. If you don't mind less free stuff, Central Ave. (old Route 66) is cheaper. However, there are some real dives along Central Avenue, many with unsavory reputations and occasional police raids. Hotels around the airport are generally vanilla-flavored, business-traveler places, but at least are somewhat less expensive than airport hotels in many cities. There are a few nice highrise hotels in the Downtown/Old Town area. Lodging Per Diem is $75.
Albuquerque is experiencing a massive wave of hotel building, mainly in the "Mid-range" class. This apparently is driven in part by the infamous lodging shortages during the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta in October. The result is that during other parts of the year, affordable hotels shouldn't be too hard to find. Even with the growth in the hotel market, lodging can be tight for the Fiesta, so if you're coming then, reserve well in advance—months rather than days.
For some free lodgings try looking for cafes where bands are playing (normally on the weekends) and ask among the punk kids and see if they'll help. Even they, however, may not have much space during the Balloon Fiesta.

Although rare, snow is not unheard of in Albuquerque
Albuquerque has an average crime rate compared to some other American cities, but most of it is property crime of more concern to residents than to visitors.
Central Avenue is home to some of Albuquerque's main attractions, but portions of it can be somewhat dangerous after dark. The section from the train tracks (eastern edge of downtown) to University Blvd. can be a little scary in the evening. Even in Downtown, while Central Avenue is passable, smaller nearby streets such as Copper Street can be scary after dark. The Nob Hill/UNM district (between University and Carlisle) is perfectly safe at night, but Central gets progressively seedier east of Carlisle, and can get quite scary around the Fairgrounds. Consider the bus or a cab through these areas after the sun goes down.
Due to its size and mild climate, the streets of Albuquerque are considered home to many people. While not typically a danger, do expect to meet up with beggars and vagrants, particularly around UNM.
If you're going to be engaging in outdoor recreation (even as laid-back as watching an Isotopes day game), slather on the sun screen. The elevation of the city is 5,000 ft (1,500 m) or higher, and there is usually not much cloud cover, so one can get a bad sunburn in surprisingly short order.
Also, New Mexico is very arid. That, and its high altitude results in very low humidity in both summer and winter, which can lead to dehydration. Drink plenty of water. A common complaint among visitors from lower altitudes is a persistent headache, which is often mistaken for altitude sickness, but is really a common symptom of dehydration. Consider carrying a water bottle and drinking frequently throughout the day if you don't already.
Be forewarned about New Mexican cuisine; if you're not used to green chile, go easy at first. Many first-timers have tried to eat the hottest chile they could find, only to discover six hours later that it was much hotter than they remembered. Be prepared.
The area code for the city is 505.
Every branch of the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System provides free wifi; they also have computers available but these require that you purchase an internet access card for $3. The  Main Library is Downtown at 501 Copper NW, +1 505 768-5141. There are also a number of free wi-fi hot spots provided by the city, mainly around Civic Plaza in Downtown, the Sunport, and the Old Town Plaza. Also, it is free to connect to the guest wifi on the UNM campus. Generally, there aren't very many wireless cafes in the city, but there is a good concentration around the UNM/Nob Hill area. The local Flying Star Cafe and Satellite Coffee locations offer free wireless internet to customers.
The Albuquerque Journal ($ daily, $ Sundays) is the state's largest newspaper and talks about issues in the metro area, the state, and the world.
The Alibi (free Wednesday mornings) is a free weekly that discusses issues in the metro area and runs some columns, but is more focused on the arts scene and has some great movie and restaurant reviews. They also run a number of "best of..." lists, notably the yearly "Best of Burque" awards. Great event listings.
The Daily Lobo (free daily) is a daily news service (Monday through Fridays in the school year) produced by UNM students. The online version is updated daily, but the printed version is only distributed on Mondays and Thursdays.
Albuquerque The Magazine is the city's largest magazine, and talks about current events within the city.
New Mexico True Television (free online) is a travel show produced in and set around New Mexico, Albuquerque is featured in several episodes.
New Mexico has a statewide ban on smoking in places of business. This includes bars and restaurants; the only exceptions are casinos and cigar bars. In addition, Albuquerque has banned smoking on all public property except the golf courses.

Abo Ruins, Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument
Santa Fe, one of the world's great travel destinations, is about 60 miles (97 km) to the north. The direct route is via I-25, but if you have time and the weather forecast is good, consider taking instead the "Turquoise Trail" (NM SR 14) on the east side of the Sandia Mountains. If you'd rather not drive, you can also take the Rail Runner commuter train straight into the heart of the city.
If taking the Turquoise Trail, stop at Madrid, an artist community along the way. There's a small selection of galleries, a glass blower and decent tavern for lunch. Another attraction on the route is the Tinkertown Museum near Cedar Crest, which contains a large collection of wood carvings and Americana.
Bernalillo is 15 miles (24 km) north on I-25 and is connected via the Rail Runner commuter train. The Coronado State Monument is a notable attraction, as well as the Santa Ana Pueblo's casino and golf course, which are right next to Bernalillo.
There are several Native American pueblos between Albuquerque and Santa Fe just off I-25. Some of them offers attractions and a chance to explore the area. If you have a few hours to kill, consider a detour to Cochiti Pueblo and the Kasha–Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument. This little known monument, open for day use ($5/vehicle), contains some gorgeous natural scenery and geologic formations, such as a narrow slot canyon you can hike through. To get there, get off at the Santo Domingo Pueblo exit (Exit 259) and follow the signs up SR 22 and onto a gravel road to the monument.
The pretty Jemez Mountains offer pleasant hiking and fishing in the summer and can be good for skiing and snowshoeing in the winter, although snowpack varies greatly from year to year and may be insufficient for winter sports. Take I-25 north to Bernalillo, then US 550 to San Ysidro, where NM 4 (502 on some maps) takes off through the astonishing red rock of San Diego Canyon and into the Jemez.
Los Alamos and Bandelier National Monument are also to the north, and about as distant from Albuquerque via the Jemez route as via the Santa Fe route.
Beyond Santa Fe lies the beauty and cultural color of north central New Mexico—Taos, Sangre de Cristo Mountains, etc.
Isleta Pueblo, off of I-25 just south of the city, is a small Native American village with the St. Augustine Church, a large white mission and one of the oldest in the nation. Take the Isleta Pueblo exit (NM 314) and drive south until you reach the village.
Belen is about 30 miles (48 km) south and makes a good day trip.
Mountainair, about a 90-min. drive southeast, is the home of the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, a superb collection of pueblo and Spanish mission ruins.
If traveling south during the winter, be sure to stop at the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, south of Socorro and covered in that community's article... and while you are down there, consider visiting the Very Large Array, one of the worlds biggest radio telescope arrays.
