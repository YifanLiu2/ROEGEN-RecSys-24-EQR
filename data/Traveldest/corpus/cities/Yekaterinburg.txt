The city was founded in 1723 by the order of Peter the Great as a metallurgical factory. It was named after the wife of Peter the Great, Yekaterina. In 1918, the last czar family was imprisoned, and later executed, a house in Yekaterinburg which was later demolished; the Church on the Blood now occupies the former site of the house. During World War II, the city grew rapidly as industries and people were relocated east to escape the war. Between 1924 and 1991, the city was known as Sverdlovsk (Свердловск), named after Communist Party leader Yakov Sverdlov and signs with this name still abound, particularly at the train station.
The city retains its metallurgical roots and the metal industry is the largest contributor to the economy.
The city is next to the Ural Mountains, which divide Europe from Asia. This border is marked by several symbolic monuments.
