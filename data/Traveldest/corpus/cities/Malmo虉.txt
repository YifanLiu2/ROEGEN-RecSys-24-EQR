Malmö is Sweden's third largest city with a population of about 352,000 (2021), and the capital of the province of Scania (Skåne) on the southern tip of the country. Malmö is a port city on the Öresund strait, facing Copenhagen on its other bank, with which it is connected by the Öresund bridge. Together, the two cities form a duopolis and a core of a larger Oresund region spanning parts of Denmark and Sweden.
Malmö used to be an industrial city, with a port and a shipyard, but the shipyard was dismantled in the late 20th century. The city has managed to recover and reinvent itself as a modern metropolis, a poster example of sustainable development and a thriving multicultural centre, even though it lacks the recognition as a major tourist destination like Copenhagen or Stockholm.
Founded in 1272 as a fortified port a day's walk from Lund, Malmö was for centuries the second-largest city of Denmark. It served as a Hanseatic port and a very lucrative trade area. Malmö dominated Skåne as the largest market hub, until Copenhagen grew larger during the 16th century. In 1658, as a result of the Great Northern War, Denmark ceded the Scanian lands, including the city of Malmö, to Sweden in the Second Treaty of Roskilde. As Copenhagen experienced a series of devastating fires and bombardments, in particular through the 1700s, Malmö is surprisingly the best place in the world to see Danish Renaissance architecture.
After an industrial revolution, Malmö grew rapidly and served as one of the earliest and most industrialized cities of Scandinavia. Until the turn of the millennium it was regarded more as a dull worker's city in the backdrop of Lund (a university and cathedral town) and Copenhagen. The opening of the Öresund Bridge-tunnel in 2000 reignited the soul of a bustling Hanseatic port that had lain dormant for so many centuries. Since 2011, this new landmark is featured in the acclaimed Swedish-Danish Nordic noir crime series The Bridge.
Today about a third of the Malmö population are from various other countries, making the city the most cosmopolitan in Sweden. This has contributed to a rich cultural life and many exotic and fine food opportunities. The ship building Kockums company used to be the city's biggest employer, but today the industrial city of old has been replaced by vast areas of middle-class suburban housing and modern eco-friendly neighbourhoods.
Sturup's terminal in characteristically yellow
Malmö Airport is mostly served by low-fare, charter and regional carriers. There are three connections from Stockholm – with SAS (Arlanda), Norwegian (Arlanda) and BRA (Bromma) – and regional airlines fly from other destinations within Sweden. International flights are covered by many charter and scheduled flights from vacation destinations in Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
The only carrier operating scheduled international flights to Malmö Airport is WizzAir, connecting Malmö to the largest cities in central, eastern and southeastern Europe.
Malmö Airport (MMX IATA, until 2007 known as Sturup Airport) (30 km by road from central Malmö). (updated Nov 2017)
From Malmö Airport you can take the Flygbussarna coachdead link to Malmö centre (40 min). On Saturdays, however, there are only a limited number of buses, so please check the bus-schedule at Flygbussarna's webpage. Another option is taking a taxi, but this is far more expensive.
Copenhagen Airport in Kastrup is one of the major aviation hubs in Europe and offers a multitude of European and intercontinental connections by most European flag carriers, as well as other major international airlines.
Kastrup is right at the other end of the Öresund bridge from Malmö. There are frequent Øresundståg trains departing from a station inside the airport terminal that stop in stations in Malmö (Centralstation, Triangeln and Hyllie). The journey from the airport across the bridge to Malmö takes about 20 minutes. You can also take a bus across the Oresund, which is often cheaper than the trains. You can also take a taxi across the bridge. Signs in the arrivals hall of Kastrup Terminal 3 direct you outside to two separate queues of Danish and Swedish taxis. Taxi fare to Malmö city centre should be about 650–750 kr. As always with Swedish taxis, check the window sticker on the taxi to check the fare before boarding to avoid inadvertently selecting an overly expensive option (there is no limitation of taxi fares in Sweden and all taxis can charge anything they want as long as it is clearly indicated), or better yet, discuss the fare to Malmö with the driver before deciding – you can expect them to speak good English.
Malmö is well served by trains, including frequent regional and commuter services within Scania as well as long-distance trains from Gothenburg and Stockholm. There are trains running across the Öresund bridge from Copenhagen at least every 30 minutes. In Copenhagen, there are further connections from most Danish cities as well as from Hamburg.
Malmö Central station is located at a canal right across from the old town
Regional Øresundståg leave all day from Helsingør, traversing the east coast of Sjælland, before crossing through Copenhagen and then across the Öresund bridge to Malmö, also connecting Kastrup airport to the city. In the opposite direction trains run from Gothenburg (with connections from Oslo) via Varberg, Halmstad, Helsingborg and Lund. Trains from Copenhagen's central station to Malmö Central take approximately 40 minutes (including border checks at Hyllie), costing 123 kr when purchased from Skånetrafiken or 91 DKK if using a Danish Rejsekort (as of October 2022). However, using the Skånetrafiken app to purchase tickets will provide passengers a 24-hour ticket option for unlimited use in Copenhagen and Malmö’s public transport systems (including Oresundstag stations covered in the zone which the ticket is valid) from 246 kr (the cost of two one-way tickets between Copenhagen H and Malmö Central). Additionally, frequent and regular commuter trains, called Pågatåg and operated by Skånetrafiken, run from destinations throughout the province of Scania such as Lund, Helsingborg, Höör and Ystad.
From Stockholm, there are hourly high-speed trains taking 4½ hours, operated by SJ. A low cost alternative on the same route is the twice or thrice daily Snälltåget, taking around five hours (depending on number of stops).
Limited night train services are available too. During summer, Snälltåget runs a train from Berlin thrice a week. In winter season, the same company runs a service to and from the ski resort Åre.
The main stations on the line running through Malmö are:
Triangeln. One of two glass-covered entrances to the underground station.
Malmö Centralstation (Malmö Central Station), Skeppsbron 1. Malmö's main train station, with a refurbished historic terminal building housing a small shopping centre, gastronomic options and other facilities. It is directly to the north of the Old Town and to the east of the Västra Hamnen and the Turning Torso. There are bus connections to every part of the city, but to most points of interest you can easily walk – or rent a bike right in front of the station. (updated Jul 2018)
Triangeln. Triangeln is an entirely underground station in the middle of the City Tunnel, in the southern part of Malmö's centre. It is also a very convenient option to those visiting Malmö, especially those who would like to explore the shopping options and the gastronomic variety of Möllevångstorget.
Hyllie. Hyllie Station is in the middle of the namesake new part of Malmö, developed from scratch over the southern end of City Tunnel. This part of Malmö is quite removed from the city centre, but includes many important destinations, such as the Malmö Arena, the Malmömässan fairgrounds and the Emporia shopping centre, all right next to the train station. All Swedish-bound trains from Denmark will stop here as border police need to conduct passport checks (no such checks happen on the opposite direction). (updated Dec 2018)
The above three stations are served by regional trains to and from Copenhagen, direct trains from Stockholm and Gothenburg, as well as regional trains. Other train stations in Malmö include Persborg, Svågertorp, Oxie, and Burlöv, which are only served by a limited number of regional trains and are of little interest to tourists, as they are in residential locations far from major points of interest.
The central station also includes a small supermarket, food stalls, coffees, ATMs as well as lockers, toilets and showers.
The Öresund Bridge, connecting Sweden with the rest of Europe. This 8-km-long bridge was inaugurated in the year 2000, built for car and rail traffic.
Another way of crossing the Øresund Bridgedead link (both bridge and tunnel) is to drive for yourself. It is a toll bridge, with tolls charged in both directions (entering and leaving Sweden). Since the road is a motorway (one-way passage only), it is not possible to change direction after passing the last exit in Denmark. The prices for an ordinary car shorter than 6 m begin at €48 per single tripdead link. With a BroPas subscription it is possible to reduce the cost substantially. easyGo customers qualifies for a 5% discount on cash payments. Credit cards are also accepted.
The view is much less obstructed if you choose to go by car as compared to train. Keep in mind, though, that the road over the Øresund Bridge is a motorway, hence it is prohibited to stop for other reasons than if your car should break down. There is no public access to Peberholm Island, where the tunnel and the bridge connect.
Gråhundbusdead link, FlixBus and NettBuss have routes from Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm and other places. From Copenhagen the buses take longer (about an hour) but are cheaper than the train, from 60 kr (as of 2017).
Autoprevoz, ☏ +387 51 317 333, has buses from Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 25 hr, twice weekly, ~ €150. Whereas Toptouristdead link, ☏ +45 48 25 38 37, offers connection from Sarajevo via Salzburg, twice weekly, €140 return, tickets can be paid on the bus, but advance booking and payment is recommended.
Finnlines runs a ferry line between Travemünde in northern Germany and Malmö. The ferry line is mostly directed towards trucks and car drivers, but it is possible to book tickets for pedestrians. Departures that do not need a compulsory cabin booking are Tu–F at 10:00, Sa at 11:00 from Travemünde. The trip takes nine hours, the fares for a one-way trip for an adult begin at €30. The fare for a car shorter than 6 m (20 ft) begins at €49 in the low season, €67 in the high season. Motorcycles can be taken on board for free during the low season, bicycles can be taken on board for free all year round. A booked return trip will grant a 20% discount on the return part of the trip.
Finnlines ferry terminal, Lappögatan 1A (in the northern part of Malmö Harbour, 10 km (6 mi) from the city centre). There is a bus from the ferry terminal to Malmö Centralstation. Tickets can be purchased on the bus with a contactless (NFC) card. (updated Nov 2017)
As an alternative, Trelleborg and Ystad offer ferry connections from other ports in Germany and Poland. The travel time of these ferries are usually between five and ten hours, and Malmö Central Station can be reached from Trelleborg by regional bus #146 in about 50 min, or by Pågatåg train line 9 in 32 minutes.
Malmö is best experienced by bicycle, the city is interlaced with lots of bicycle roads. Malmö is known as a very bike-friendly city (and indeed, biking is the preferred method of transportation here). The official bike map can be found on bike rentals and the tourist office. There are guided bike tours in Malmö during the summer.
Skånetrafiken is responsible for public transport in Malmö and all of Scania. The green buses (stadsbuss) all have routes within Malmö city, and the yellow buses are regional buses to other cities in Scania.
VISA, VISA Electron, MasterCard and Maestro payment cards can be used as payment for tickets in both yellow and green buses. It is not possible to use cash as payment in buses and trains. Tickets or cards can also be purchased in advance, either in vending machines, at Skånetrafiken customer centres (kundcenter), at service partners (serviceombud or ombud) or via a smartphone app. The smartphone app also supports an English language version. The old JoJo-card system has been replaced by a "Reskort" which can only be purchased at Skånetrafiken customer centres and service partners, and can not be topped up with a cash balance, only loaded with tickets at a customer centre, service partner, or ticket machine. Generally speaking, prices with Reskort and the app are the same, so Reskort can only be recommended for those unable to use the app.
Both the physical ticket (from vending machines) and the electronic ticket (Reskort and smartphone app) is valid for one hour as single fare (enkelbiljett), which begins immediately when the ticket is printed, scanned or activated. Transfer between rides is unlimited within this one hour. Public transport fares in Malmö also include train rides between the three stations: Malmö Central, Triangeln and Hyllie Station. The violet-coloured Pågatågen and the silver-coloured Øresundstågen normally stop at all three stations. Additional train stations can be included if specified when purchasing a ticket.
Note that if you have arrived from Denmark, within Malmö a Danish Rejsekort can only be used for travel between Malmö Central, Triangeln and Hyllie Station. Journeys between these stations cost 19 DKK for one hour of unlimited travel, but you must have a sufficient balance to cover all expected travel (as well as the required prepayment – 25 DKK for registered Rejsekort or 70 DKK for anonymous Rejsekort) before arriving as there are no Rejsekort top-up machines in Malmö. As in Denmark, you must check in and out at the Rejsekort check-in/out machines located at the entrances to each station.
Taxi is also an option, fixed rates begin at 49/59/79 kr for trips within Malmö city.
The taxi market is unregulated, and some independent drivers charge high prices. Check the price tag in the window, prefer well known companies such as 171717, 232323, Taxi Skåne, Taxi Kurir etc, and always ask for the price of your trip before getting in.
Cabonline. Offers TaxiKurir, Taxi 020, Sverigetaxi and TOPCAB taxis. Fixed price on all trips. (updated Aug 2020)

The historic central parts of Malmö is called Gamla Staden ("Old Town"), and this area has three squares; Gustav Adolfs torg (Gustav Adolf's Square), Stortorget (Great Square) and Lilla torg (Little Square). Stortorget and Lilla Torg are directly connected at one corner, and a pedestrian-only shopping street connects them with Gustav Adolfs torg.
Stortorget (The Great Square)
Typical street in the historic centre (Isak Slaktaregatan)
Davidshallstorg. A square with design shops, clothes stores and restaurants. The atmosphere here is posh, so the vibe is very different from Möllevångstorget's. There are similar shops on the nearby parts of Davidshallsgatan.
Gamla Väster. Between Lilla Torget and Malmöhus. It is a quiet and sophisticated neighbourhood with lots of galleries, design shops and restaurants.
Gustav Adolfs torg. Surrounded on three sides by buildings containing shops and a McDonald's. At the centre of the square is a bus platform. A cemetery lies at the south side of the square, through which one can reach Slottsparken, a beautiful park that surrounds Malmöhus.
Lilla torg. The place for socializing and dining, with various restaurants having outdoor tables around the edge of the square.
Möllevångstorget. South of the city centre, has a bustling open-air market on weekends.

The place to go to for inexpensive to moderate prices of beer. (updated Jun 2023)
Stortorget. The central plaza of Malmö. At the centre of Stortorget ("The Great Square") is a statue of King Karl X Gustav of Sweden, who took the city from Danish dominion. The ornate Malmö City Hall (built in 1546) is on the east side, and in the north-west corner is Kockska Huset, the house of Jörgen Kock, a German immigrant who became mayor of the city and achieved wealth simply and directly: by taking control of the city mint. In the winter, the square used to be used as a skating rink, but this has rarely happened in the early 2020s. (updated Jun 2023)

Turning Torso. Completed in 2005, it is at 190 m the tallest building in Scandinavia.

This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:
While prices in Malmö may seem high, especially in the summer, and there is little variance in prices across properties, staying in the city may be your best option in the region, as hotels are generally expensive in Sweden (and even more so across the bridge in Copenhagen), while Malmö boasts a wide selection of properties unusual for other Swedish cities.
As in the rest of Sweden, breakfast is generally included in room price, as is Wi-Fi. Do make sure to double-check the rates at different dates, as they may vary greatly depending on local events and time of year. The highest season is around the end of May and in June, when the days are the longest and the weather the best.
