Grand Cayman, shaped like a giant claw "pinching" the North Sound, is the largest of the three islands in the Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory. George Town, at the southwest "knuckle" of Grand Cayman, is the capital of the Cayman Islands and its largest city. Grand Cayman's Seven Mile beach, on the west coast north of George Town, is one of the finest beaches in the world.
Grand Cayman Districts, towns, villages, and attractions
Seven Mile Beach, located on the west coast of Grand Cayman, straddles West Bay and George Town.
There are five districts on Grand Cayman; from west to east:
The main town is George Town, which also contains the main seaport and airport. The main tourist stretch is Seven Mile Beach, which straddles West Bay and George Town. The eastern part is much less dense.
George Town on Grand Cayman is a popular cruise ship destination, so on days when there are many ships visiting, the town and tourist attractions get very busy. You can see official Ship Schedules and plan around cruise ships.
Owen Roberts International Airport (GCM IATA) (Located  km ( mi) east of George Town.), ☏ +1 345-949-5252 (Airport information), +1 345 949-7811 (Airport information), +1 345-949-7811 (Flight information). The airport has one runway and one terminal. Taxis are easily available with fixed rates to all island areas. There is a taxi rank as soon as you exit the terminal. Queue at this stand and they will direct you to a specific taxi and advise of the cost. Hotels are not allowed courtesy shuttles. Note that it can take an hour to get through security and immigration even though the part of the queue you see from outside looks short. To save money take the taxis to the George Town bus depot and then take Bus 1 or 2 (they will guide you to the correct bus) for $ per person. They are the same Toyota vans.
Cruise ships anchor offshore and tender passengers to the harbour dock by downtown George Town. George Town is a very popular port of call and is included by many cruise lines in "Western Caribbean" itineraries. There are no berthing facilities at this location, but ships can anchor at one of four points.
There is a small walkable area of shops around the George Town Harbour. Seven Mile beach is not within walking distance of the harbour cruise docks (unless you like long walks).
Taxis are available at the cruise ship docks in central George Town, and at all resorts.

Hell, West Bay. This is a common tour stop, often shrugged at by those who go there. However, if you take a tour bus there, to get a laugh you can always tell people that you took the bus to Hell.

You can get postcards postmarked there, and there are a couple of gift shops selling all the Hell-themed souvenirs imaginable. (updated Nov 2017)
Cemetery Beach, Seven Mile Beach. This is the northern end of Seven Mile Beach, a beautiful spot with snorkelling off shore. Access is off the road through a small path. Next to a small island cemetery, hence the name. (updated Nov 2017)
The island's most famous excursion is to Stingray City, where boatloads of tourists disembark at nearby Stingray Sandbar and squeal nervously while adjusting to the presence of large rays, which they can feed and "pet" while snorkelling in waist-deep water. Once fed, the rays will placidly let you do just about anything to them, including being lifted up to pose for photos while jetting water out of their mouths; for the sake of the fish this is not recommended. Research by two US universities has raised concerns about the detrimental impact of such activity on the rays.
