Qingdao (青岛; Qīngdǎo; also known as Tsingtao), is regarded by some Chinese as one of the most beautiful and cleanest cities in China. With a population of around  million, it is one of the largest cities in Shandong Province. The name Qingdao means The Blue/Green Island. In 2011, the China Institute of City Competitiveness named Qingdao China's most livable city.
Qingdao City lies on the east shore of Jiaozhou Bay (胶州湾 Jiāo​zhōu​wān​) and comprises three districts from south to north:
Shinan District (市南区 Shì​nán​qū​) — the downtown core that runs along the sea with most of the city's major hotels, attractions and beaches.
Shibei District (市北区 Shì​běi​qū​) — sits directly north of Shinan District and contains many new major commercial and residential developments as well as the oldest parts of Qingdao in the west.
Licang District (李沧区 Lǐ​cāng​qū​) — north of Shibei and home to Peach Blossom Tourism Spot and to more industry.
Four suburban districts comprise primarily coastal areas close to the city proper:
Laoshan District (崂山区 Láoshānqū) — southeast of downtown and home to Laoshan Mountain and some of the best beaches in the city.
Chengyang District (城阳区 Chéngyángqū) — north of Licang on the north shore of Jiaozhou Bay and mostly new industrial areas, but also contains a large Korean expat community, and hence many authentic Korean restaurants. The Qingdao Liuting airport is located here.
Huangdao District (黄岛区 Huángdǎoqū) — on the southwest shore of Jiaozhou Bay and home to huge wharfs, the port area and other industry. There are also some nice beaches here.
Jimo District (即墨区 Jímòqū) — north of downtown including the coast north of Laoshan District.
Three rural areas administratively part of Qingdao:
Jiaozhou City (胶州市 Jiāozhōushì) — west of downtown.
Pingdu City (平度市 Píngdùshì) — far northwest.
Laixi City (莱西市 Láixīshì) — far northeast.
Qingdao is a city steeped in China's 20th century history. It was taken as part of the Imperial German Concession of Jiaozhou Bay. Despite ongoing discussions with Chinese authorities about giving the Germans a territory, on 7 November 1897, they landed troops. Their pretext was the murder of two missionaries on 1 November of that year. A concession treaty was signed in 1898, for a 99-year lease. At the time, it was a relatively unimportant town of about 1,000 inhabitants. Yet by 1902, it had grown to 668 Caucasians and 15,000 Chinese.
During the colonial period, the Germans left a distinct mark on Qingdao's architecture that can still be seen in its historic center and train station. The train station has undergone an overhaul that has tried to strike a balance between maintaining its colonial heritage while modernizing to be the terminus of the high speed rail line to Beijing. Many German-period buildings have been preserved as heritage monuments. It is a kind of Bavaria-on-the-East-China-Sea, where they even sell bratwurst on the street. In 1903, China's most well-known beer maker, Tsingtao Brewery, was established by the new occupants homesick for Germany.
Japan occupied Qingdao on 7 November 1914, as part of World War I, and remained until 1922. They took the city because they were allied with the British against the Germans during World War I. After the war, the Japanese wanted to continue to hold the city for the remainder of the German lease, which the Western Allies agreed to despite having promised to return it to China. With the Chinese government powerless to do anything, this led to protests by students in Beijing during the May 4th Movement of 1919, eventually forcing the Japanese to return the city to Chinese sovereignty. In 1938, the Japanese again took Qingdao and remained until the end of World War II in 1945. Between 1945 and 1949 the American 7th Fleet was based in Qingdao as it assisted the Kuomintang in fighting the Communist Party; the Communists took the city in 1949.
While Qingdao has a long history, the eastern half of the city has been built since 1993, and there is no sign of it slowing down. In 2008, it hosted the sailing events of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
Qingdao's early summer is quite an enjoyable season, although it can be humid near the sea shore. Late summer can become hot, while other places of Northern China start to feel cooler. The climate in late fall and winter can be harsh but snow patches can generally last no longer than a few days. Qingdao is an ideal destination if you want to combine sea-side fun with your trip to China.
If you are looking for the typical congested Chinese scenario with swarming markets, unpredictable traffic and intense street commerce, Qingdao has little to offer. For instance, bicycling is actually forbidden. The city is relatively clean and orderly and might give the impression of an upcoming wanna-be Singapore.
Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport (TAO IATA). The main hub for Shandong Airlines and a focus city of China Eastern Airlines. Flights to Shanghai and Beijing are frequent. If you arrive in Beijing or Shanghai in the morning or in the afternoon, you don't even have to book your ticket to Qingdao ahead of time. Depending on the season, last minute tickets may be sold at discount. But in the busy summer months, buying in advance is advised. International destinations include Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Seoul (Incheon), Busan and Frankfurt (via Shenyang). Qingdao also has flights to Hong Kong and Taipei. (updated Mar 2024)
The airport is 32 km (20 mi) from the city proper, about half an hour taxi ride. Prices for a taxi ride from the airport to the Hong Kong Middle Road area should be between ¥120-140 depending on the route taken (National Highway 308 is slower but cheaper, the toll expressway is faster and more expensive) and time of day (more expensive at night).
There is an Airport Shuttle Bus. Unfortunately, you need to make it clear where should you get on.
Qingdao Railway Station (青岛站 Qīngdǎo Zhàn), 2 Tai'an Road (泰安路2号), ☏ +86-532-6011111. At the west end of Shinan District and near Zhanqiao pier and the ocean, this historic German colonial style train station remains and has be upgraded for modern high-speed trains.
Qingdao North Railway Station (青岛北站 Qīngdǎo Běizhàn). This station is at the northern end of Metro Line 3. Most trains leaving Qingdao main station for Jinan also stop here.
Trains from major cities not too far away include:
Beijing — The high-speed train has 10 trains per day and takes 4h20m–5h26m, a second class seat for ¥252–303. The high-speed line runs down from Beijing South station, not the Beijing station.
Shanghai — There are four direct high-speed trains between Shanghai and Qingdao, takes 6h25m–6h57m, a second class seat for ¥550.
Tianjin — For normal trains, four per day, 10 hours, ¥103 for a seat or ¥179–286 for a sleeper; For high-speed trains, seven per day, Tianjin South Station is very far away from the urban area, better choose train D345 or D347 which departs from Tianjin West Station, 4–5 hours, starting from ¥220.
Jinan — 21 direct high speed trains (2hr 30min, ¥122–146), and there are twenty-one slower and cheaper trains taking 4–5 hours (¥49-162).

Qingdao has international sea connections.
From Incheon, South Korea there are ferries three times a week by Weidong Ferriesdead link.
There are also twice-weekly connections from Shimonoseki, Japan on Orient Ferries dead link. The trip takes over 24 hours and 2nd class one-way costs ¥12,000. The voyage is one night from Shimonoseki to Qingdao, but two nights from Qingdao to Shimonoseki. The ferry also serves as a cargo vessel and after boarding in Qingdao, it will often take several hours to finish being loaded with cargo before it departs.
The restaurant food and drinks, snacks and souvenirs from the shop are all priced in Japanese yen, so make sure to get some/have some left over before boarding. The cost of most food and drink is reasonable considering you're stuck on the boat with nowhere else to buy things, but the pennywise traveler will definitely bring their own alcohol, cigarettes, and snacks. (Mind that there might be duties when crossing into Japan or China).
There are electrical outlets in the lounge area, but if those are taken, there are also some up in the gym/fitness area, where no one goes. After boarding from China, the ship operates under Japanese time, so change your watches and pay attention to announcements for when dinner will be served, as food is only served at certain times of the day. There are Japanese-style shower/bath rooms on the upper level where the first class rooms are.
If you are travelling from within Shandong Province, going by bus is probably the easiest way. Especially now with the new excellent and fast expressways linking Qingdao with other cities in the province. There are several buses per day from Jinan, Taian, Qufu, as well as Yantai and Rizhao on the coast. They leave from and arrive to the bus station just outside the train station, but also from the new bus station north of town, which can be reached by local trolleybus number 5 in 20 minutes.
As of November 2017, the meter rate for normal taxis starts at ¥10 while the larger cabs start at ¥12. The meter is based on both distance traveled and time taken. If you take a taxi to or from the airport, and use the Qingyin expressway there will be a ¥10 rate added to whatever the meter price is.
During the summer months that are the peak tourist season, taxis may be hard to flag down. If ever you get one of the larger taxis, the drivers will usually be delighted to give you their business card, so that in the case of planned travel to somewhere like the airport or train station, you can avoid the hassle of trying to flag down a cab.
If you have a SIM card and internet on your phone, you can order taxis using an app (for example Didi), and the rates might even be lower.
Qingdao's metro system opened in 2015. As of 2018, there are two lines (M2 and M3) with more under construction. M3 runs approximately north–south, connecting the main train station (火车站 huǒchē zhàn) to the north rail station (青岛北站). Along the way it passes May 5 Square. M2 runs east–west near Qingdao's south shore, then turns north.
The bus and trolleybus network is quite well put together and useful once you figure out the routes. Buses 11, 26, 228, and 501 run from the railway station (Shinan District) along the coast via Donghai Xi Lu to all the beaches in the modern eastern part of town (Middle Hong Kong Road), where pubs and cafes are located. Many major routes have dedicated bus lanes, that can make taking the bus faster than taking a car during rush hour. Buses 316 and 231 will bring you to the center of the town from the newly renovated station. Regular buses cost ¥1 and the air conditioned ones are ¥2. If you get on a bus that goes really far (out to the suburbs) you need to tell the ticket person on the bus where you are going and it will cost up to ¥6.
Very few locals in Qingdao cycle because it is illegal on streets and sidewalks. When renting a bike make sure that it is legal to ride your planned route. There are more than 40 km of waterfront trails. If you really want a workout, try hiking Fushan or the TV Tower hills as there are some decent mountain bike trails.

Beach No 1 on a sunny autumn day
Beach No. 2 with CBD skyscrapers in the background
Qingdao has some wonderful beaches worthy of visiting. Unfortunately, litter is a problem at all of them, ranging from the occasional cigarette butt to having to wade through a flotsam of trash just to get into the ocean itself. Your experience will vary depending on the tides and the time of year you visit. During summer weekends, Qingdao city beaches are very crowded (sometimes upwards of 100,000 people), and slightly less crowded on summer weekdays. Again, these can be packed full of people during the weekends. Bring sunscreen, while you can buy beach toys, food, drinks, and knick-knacks at any of Qingdao's beaches, surprisingly no-one sells sunscreen at the beach. You can find bathing beaches all along the seaside from the Zhanqiao Pier to the Shilaoren Beach in the eastern suburbs.

Qingdao International Beer Festival, held at the end of August every year, is a celebration of Qingdao's brewing heritage. During the daytime, there are official ceremonies that celebrate Qingdao's heritage as well as carnival type rides, food and games. In the evening, the event really picks up as crowds flock to huge tents set up by each beer company with a presence in China.
You can sit down and order beer or snacks. The price of food at night during the festival may be beyond budgets of some. You can also watch (or participate in) various performances such as karaoke, concerts, auctions, or comedy. The entertainment, however, is tame and bland.
The International Beer Festival, unfortunately, no longer seems to have much of an international presence save the beer. Much of what you see now can be found at any Chinese carnival, park or civic celebration.
Old military tunnels in Fushan mountain
Huangdao District (黄岛) — Providing there isn't persistent fog as is often in the area, one can take a ferry from Qingdao port to the neighbouring district of Huangdao.

That said, there are plenty of Japanese hostess bars, and a few Western drinking holes too, if you get tired of Qingdao's fare. The ferry prices generally range from ¥15-30 one way, but if the ferries aren't running the taxi fare is more than ¥200 back to Qingdao.

Taidong Pedestrian Street (Taidong Buxingjie). The best area for buying stuff. Very "renao" (bustling), especially at night when the peddlers come out and you can buy all manner of trinkets, clothing, household wares, etc. While in Taidong be careful of the pickpockets.

Being Qingdao, you can expect to find, well, copious amounts of fresh Tsingtao. The brewery was founded by Germans during colonial times. Every August there is a beer festival (check the listing in the "Do" section). Many European breweries participate. One of the neatest things about Qingdao is the ability to purchase fresh from the factory draft beer almost anywhere. You will often see kegs sitting outside most restaurants and snack stores. The beer is sold by weight (asking for "yi jin" gives you 500 g, or half a litre), this will be served to you in a plastic bag! There are also numerous beer gardens where you can sit and drink from glasses, one glass of fresh beer ("san pi") only costs about ¥10. The Tsingtao "san pi" is some of the best Chinese beer you can get. Don't worry, it's served cold.

Generally, Qingdao is a very safe city although the general travel advisories such as keeping your bag close, not flashing large amounts of money and using common sense are always advised. Violent crime or serious thievery is not a common problem.
Also, be wary about buying Xinjiang nut loaves from vendors along the boardwalk near the Zhan Bridge unless you don't mind paying ¥200 for 2 kg of the loaves when all you wanted was a small piece to try. If you must buy them, make sure you agree on the price for each liang (the unit of measurement) of the loaf before you get the vendor to slice it. Also, tell him exactly how many liangs you want, although some tourists have commented that the vendors will still cut a much bigger slice than what you asked for. Sinkiang nut loaves are notorious for their ridiculous price throughout China.
Qingdao officials have been known to sweep bars. To avoid troubles, you should keep your passport and visa with you at all times. It is advisable to keep copies of your passport information page and visa in a safe place at your hotel or hostel.
There is a small tourist information kiosk located close to the main rail station. Whilst exiting, turn right and walk through the plaza, crossing the street, then turn left to the corner where you will see a small kiosk. It's near KFC. There is a tourist complaint hotline, which is 8591–2000.

Located a 30-min bus ride east of downtown, Laoshan (Mount Lao) boasts a 2100-year-old Dao temple and is a must see for the Qingdao area. Often credited with being one of the temples that gave birth to the Dao way of thought, the Laoshan temple is tucked just between the mountains and beach. You can wander the temples or take one of the many paths winding up and around the mountains to enjoy the view, see waterfalls or listen to the tales of the ancient snake and other phenomena that haunt the Laoshan area. The mountain offers both regular hiking from the main entrance, as well as a stone-paved trail to Chao Yin waterfall and tea house from the north entrance
Bus 304 can be used when travel to Laoshan from Qingdao. The bus can be boarded at the train station close to the west side of beach no. 6.
Bus 304 will not take you all the way to Laoshan's main entrance. The bus trip from the train station to the terminal bus stop will cost about ¥10. A taxi from the terminal bus stop to Laoshan costs about ¥20. Unfortunately it's not easy to find an available taxi at the terminal bus stop. A good piece of advice is to start walking towards Laoshan and grab an empty taxi on the way. The actual distance from the end stop to Laoshan is too far to walk. The entrance fee for Laoshan is ¥70. It's also a good idea to book a taxi before hand for the return journey.
