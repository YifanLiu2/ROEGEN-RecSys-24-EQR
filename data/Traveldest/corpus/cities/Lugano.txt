Lugano is a lakeside city in Ticino, the Italian-speaking part of southern Switzerland, and is the largest Italian-speaking city in Switzerland, or for that matter, outside Italy. Part of a temperate micro-climate, Lugano offers palm trees, picturesque boulevards, stunning views of the lake and the Alps, and plenty of opportunity for outdoor and indoor activities. Lugano also makes a good base for visiting other cities and sites in the area. The city is a pleasant place to relax in the summertime and is only half an hour away from Lake Como.
Lugano Airport. A small international airport with flights arriving from Zurich and Geneva. Swiss International Air Lines and Etihad Regional offer discount web special prices to Lugano from many parts of Europe. (updated Jan 2021)
Milan Malpensa airport is 1 hour away by shuttle (see the "By bus" section below) or 1 hr 40 min by train (see the "By train" section below) and is an EasyJet hub.
Lugano station is on the Gotthard railway, which crosses the Alps connecting the cantons of Schwyz and Uri to Cantone Ticino. It primarily serves:
FFS (SBB in German, CFF in French, the national railway operator) and EC. Long distance trains to International destinations and other parts of Switzerland.
TILO (Joint operation between FFS and Italy's Trenord) which provides regional services, primarily to Lombardy. Direct service to Milano-Malpensa airport ~1 hr 40 min.
FLP (metre-gauge) local services
FFS/EC Trains leave for Zürich (3 hr), Basel (3 hr 34 min) and Milan (40 min-1 hr) as well as Geneva (via Zürich or Locarno-Domodossola: 5 hr 30 min with one or two transfers, 6 hr 30 min via Milan with one transfer). Getting to Geneva or points west it is faster to go via Zürich or Locarno as the trains are more frequent and faster.
Stazione di Lugano (Lugano railway station), ☏ +41 900 300 300. (updated Aug 2015)
There is a direct airport service from Lugano to Milano-Malpensa provided by TILO. It is slower (1 hr 40 min) than the bus shuttles (just over an hour) but provides more regular service. Approx Fr. 23 (Swiss francs) as of 2019. Tickets are referred to as "Transfrontaliero" on Trenord machines and "Internazionale" on SBB machines.
There are three shuttle services between Lugano and Milan Malpensa Airport. Each takes about 1 hr 10 min to get in from Malpensa:
Lugano Services(approx every 2 hr, 04:00–23:30; 1 hr 10 min; €25 one way; advance reservations on line or tickets directly on the bus)
JetBus (approx every 1-2 hr; 06:00–23:10; €27 or Fr. 35 one way; can be booked at airport)

There is also a daily bus service during summer to Tirano, Italy with train connection (Bernina Expressdead link) to St. Moritz (Switzerland).
Due to physical geography, Lugano has good North-South oriented links and non-existent East-West ones.
Lugano is on the A2 motorway (just "2" on a red background on Swiss road signs) which spans the width of the country from Basel on the French/German borders to Chiasso on the Italian. This is part of the European Route E35 from Amsterdam, Netherlands to Rome, Italy.
Like most Swiss roads, the condition is usually very good and speeds are good, nevertheless distance makes journey times relatively long, particularly when travelling from the north of the country. Lugano is about 3 hr from Berne or Zürich, in optimal conditions. This route passes through the San Gottardo tunnel, which is a bit of a bottleneck on Sundays (northbound) and Friday (southbound), so budget some time for traffic jams. Jams can be up to 3 hours long during peak travel times such as Easter.
Coming from the south, you have more choices on the flat Po plain but the main route is the A9 motorway from near Milano to Chiasso (where it becomes the Swiss A2). This motorway is fast and relatively uncongested, and the Italians have a somewhat more carefree driving style than the Swiss. Speed limits change when crossing into Switzerland. Lugano is about 1 hr 30 min from Milano and 1 hr 10 min from Malpensa airport, in optimal conditions. Travelling on the A9 does incur one toll near Como, around € as of 2016.
Crossing customs is usually a pain-free exercise. Switzerland is part of Schengen, so they're not interested in your passport (if you're obviously European) but they are not part of the EU and may be interested if you're carrying anything you need to declare; make sure you know the duty-free limits.
Lugano is small enough to get around on foot, and many of the streets are pedestrian-only, but the hills above the lakefront are very steep so the bus or the funicular from the centre of town might be a better option on the way up to the train station if you have a lot of bags. Taxis can be found on the main roads. Ferries and funiculars (Brè and San Salvatore) are great options for seeing the views.
TPL (Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi). For bus services in the city. A short-journey ticket (30 min) costs Fr. , 1-day travelcard for 1 zone — Fr. , short-journey multi-journey travelcard (6 trips) — Fr. , the later can be used by multiple people. (updated Aug 2015)
