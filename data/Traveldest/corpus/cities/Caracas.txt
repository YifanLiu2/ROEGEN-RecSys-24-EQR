Caracas is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, in northern Venezuela, near the Caribbean. Venezuela’s urban spirit can be discovered mainly from understanding Caracas, its capital city, a busy metropolis famous for its food, cultural diversity, and perfect climate, thanks to the unique combination of a high elevation and proximity to the Caribbean Sea.

La Candelaria, the center of Caracas
Caracas is a cosmopolitan city, congested and noisy. The restaurants in Caracas are still excellent and have a lot to offer. Wear light clothing, comfortable shoes and clothing or jewelry of little value. Also tourists who do not know the language, it is recommended to take a dictionary with Spanish translation to make it easier for them to stay in the country. The people of Caracas are usually quite hospitable and friendly. Caracas is a city of contrasts. El Rosal and Las Mercedes are the most exclusive districts of the city. The boulevard of Sabana Grande is the main commercial corridor of the city and is visited by more than 500,000 people every day. Plaza Bolívar, Plaza El Venezolano and Plaza Diego Ibarra are the most emblematic of the historic center. Plaza Altamira is the icon of the east of the city and has been the center of opposition protests for almost two decades. Caracas is not one of the top touristic destinations of Venezuela, and travelers often bypass the capital city in order to see the country’s amazing natural attractions. However, the Venezuelan capital can be a fascinating city to explore, replete with excellent art, food and a bustling nightlife.
Caracas is a modern, dynamic and diverse city where multiple realities converge at the same time. The architectural, cultural and socioeconomic identity of Caracas has been fragmentation and is the key to understanding Venezuela.
Until the beginning of the 20th century, Caracas was a small city that reached La Candelaria. The city grew slowly until the 1940s. Later, the towns of Sabana Grande, Chacao, Las Mercedes and Petare would grow rapidly and be urbanized. Most of the architectural heritage of Caracas was built in the twentieth century. The Towers of Parque Central Complex, even though they no longer hold the title of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, remain the tallest twin towers in the region. Sabana Grande was the favorite place of Juan Domingo Perón during his golden exile in Venezuela, when he lived in the El Rosal and El Bosque neighborhoods. Caracas stands in a beautiful valley, overlooked by Mount Avila, an impressive mountain that separates the city from the Caribbean Sea and shapes most of the city’s landscape. It is a popular weekend destination for the city’s residents (known as Caraqueños) and is easily reached by taking a very modern cable car that goes all the way from the mountain base to the newly nationalized Waraira Repano park, at the top of the mountain.
In Caracas, the staggering inequalities of wealth that characterize Venezuela’s economic situation are on display. They range from very poor neighborhoods in the hills of the city, called “barrios”, to the modern business district of El Rosal, Las Mercedes, Sabana Grande and La Castellana or even the huge mansions of the rich neighborhoods. Petare, located in East Caracas, is the biggest favela (barrio) of Caracas. The middle class is mainly concentrated in the east of the city (El Recreo de Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre and El Hatillo), but San Bernardino, La Candelaria, San Pedro and El Paraiso are also important centers of the middle class. The historic center of the city is Plaza Bolívar, the grid has been modified though. The most luxurious urbanization, Caracas Country Club, has occurred between Parroquia El Recreo of the Libertador Municipality and the Chacao Municipality of the Miranda State. The geographical center of the Metropolitan District of Caracas has been set at Sabana Grande, considered the Eastern Gate of Caracas. The district of Sabana Grande is the one with the best coverage by the Caracas Metro, but the center of Caracas, Chacao, El Rosal, El Bosque and Altamira are also easily accessible. Most of the embassies are located in the Chacao and Baruta municipalities. However, some have a limited presence in El Recreo. The most important business center nowadays is El Rosal.
The city’s streets and highways are always crowded with vehicles, as Venezuela has the cheapest gasoline in the world (at about US$/litre in 2023). Subsidized gasoline and inadequate infrastructure have helped spur pollution and big traffic lines in almost all of the inner city motorways. Caracas’ subway system, once one of the best in all Latin America, is still quick but is often crowded and prone to delays. Caracas remains one of the most violent cities in the world, with large parts of the city effectively "no go" areas to outsiders. Murder tallies of as many as 20 are not uncommon on weekends, so exercising caution and common sense - especially at night - is essential to a safe visit.
Caracas is a cosmopolitan city and is admired for its gastronomy. It has restaurants and bars inspired by the cuisine of many different countries and cultures due to great waves of immigration from Europe and the Middle East after the Second World War. Since the arrival of the Spaniards, Venezuela has been a country of contrasts. Venezuelan gastronomy from the beginning was influenced by multiple cultures. For example, the Venezuelan pan andino has its origin in the first settlers of America, of Sephardic Jewish origin.
The city is filled with “centros comerciales” and department stores, and the popular restaurants and clubs in the towering malls due to security concerns. In the San Ignacio Mall you’ll find the city’s young, rich and beautiful drinking whiskey and “Las Mercedes”, "El Rosal" and “La Castellana” districts are also popular late night hot spots. "Sabana Grande", "Chacao" and "El Hatillo" are important late night hot spots as well, but "El Rosal" and "Las Mercedes" are the fanciest. Sabana Grande is the bohemian district of the city.
People often party until 04:00 or 05:00, so take a cab when heading out.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Caracas has a tropical climate with very little variation between summer and winter temperatures. Set in a valley some 900 meters above sea level, its climate is often described as its best feature: never cold, seldom too hot. Average daily temperature in summer ranges from a minimum of 18˚C (64˚F) to a maximum of 28˚C (82˚F). Winter temperatures are only two to three degrees cooler. Most rainfall occurs during the period from May to November and can be accompanied by electrical storms.
Maiquetía's  Simón Bolívar Airport or Aeropuerto Maiquetia (CCS IATA) (28 km (17 mi) from the areas surrounding Plaza Simon Bolivar (downtown) along Autopista Caracas-La Guaira.). Venezuela's main international airport with connections from the Americas, Europe and from within Venezuela. It stands along the northern coast in Maiquetia, separated from Caracas by a series of mountains. The trip to Caracas should take around 40 minutes in open traffic, and up to 60-70 minutes in heavier traffic, along Autopista Caracas-La Guaira.
Due to political and economic instability and the amounts of unpaid or withheld fares owing to the foreign airlines many had ceased services to Caracas from their respective countries throughout 2016 and 2019. Other airlines may suspend service with or without notice. Therefore, see their respective sites (or ask them) as to when they plan to suspend service (if any) and what alternatives for onward transportation or compensation would they offer should they suspend service without notice before departure to Venezuela or for the unused portions of the ticket while in Venezuela. As of March 2019 The following carriers still offer flights to Caracas:
Terminal Internacional Flights from Europe and Middle East: Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas (Spain), Estelar Latinoamerica, LASER and Turkish. Flights from Cuba, Trinidad and the Caribbean: Cubana de Aviacion and Caribbean Airlines. From Central and South America: Copa Airlines and Wingo.
Terminal Nacional (Domestic Terminal) The following are Venezuelan flag carriers offering domestic flights: Albatrosdead link, Aeropostal, Rutaca, Avior, Conviasadead link, Estelar Latinoamerica, LASER; Línea Turística Aereotuy (only to Roques) and Venezolana. Some of the Venezuelan flag carriers also offer international flights from the Caribbean, Panama, other neighboring South American countries and/or Europe to the international terminal.
With everything in a state of flux any one of the above carriers may cease service to Venezuela from their respective countries or cease or reduce service altogether (as with the domestic carriers).
Taxi fares are continuously increasing due to the rampant inflation. As of Sept 2017 the taxi rate with TaxiToCaracas.com is US$40. There are many unlicensed taxis offering their services and travelers should exercise caution as taxi robberies do happen with this option. In particular, it is advised to agree on a price before getting into the taxi, not sharing with anyone other than the driver, with a preference given to the airport's official black Ford Explorer cabs. Check with your hotel to see if they arrange airport pickup - it may need to be booked in advance. There is also a new taxi service that you can book online at TaxiToCaracas.
If transiting through the area such as arriving from Europe on a late arrival and leaving for another Venezuelan city in the morning (or even the afternoon of the next day) it is advisable to stay in Catia La Mar, a city/town northwest of the airport grounds with many hotels. Some are able to provide shuttle transportation between the airport and their respective properties. Due to the ongoing turmoil in Caracas it would best to book onward travel by plane to another Venezuelan city than risk going into town to the bus station.
In and around the airport there are ATMs, currency exchange houses (charging the official rate) and unofficial brokers willing to provide bolívares at a more advantageous rate (but not the best rate that you can find on internet sites).
Nice and pretty highways connect Caracas with La Guaira and the airport to the north; Maracay, Valencia and Maracaibo in the west; Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz in the east.
While driving in Caracas can be a hectic experience, renting a car to experience the outlying areas is a wonderful way to leave behind the well-traveled routes.
Car rental is available in the following locations:
Hertz Car Rental, Maiquetia International Airport, ☏ +58 212 355-1197. M-F 05:00-23:30, Sa Su 18:00-23:30. Hertz Car Rental is available at the international and the domestic terminals, and at several locations in the city.
Budget Car Rental, Budget Rent-A-Car Building, Avenida Nueva Granada, ☏ +58 212 603-1360. M-F 08:00-12:00 and 13:30-18:00.
Buses from the airport to Caracas give passengers the option of alighting either at Gato Negro metro station (somewhat unsafe at street level) or under a bridge at the Parque Central bus terminal, from where you'll need to get a taxi to your final destination or walk about 1 km along a busy road to the Bellas Artes metro station.
There is also a government-run bus service to the Alba Hotel in Bellas Artes. Passengers do not need to be guests at Alba. Further information is available from the two tourist board offices in the international terminal of Maiquetía airport.
The La Bandera bus terminal connects Caracas with towns and cities to the west of the capital such as La Victoria (1 hour), Maracay (1½ hours), Valencia (2½ hours) and Mérida (~12 hours). The 800-m walk from La Bandera metro station to the bus terminal is unsafe after dark and travelers should exercise caution at all times. For the eastern part of the country there's the Terminal del Oriente. Beware of the small "independent" bus services which are announced by "voceros" on both terminals. Although they have more flexible departure times, the buses can be small and uncomfortable, with speakers that blast loud music even at night.
There are also private carriers that offer more comfort. They also cost a little more. The most well known are Expresos Alianza and Expresos del Oriente, which operate from their own private terminals, something to consider if you plan on transferring for a destination they don’t cover.

Taxis can be easily hailed in the street and are generally (but not always) safe. They have no meters so prices should be agreed on before getting in. Some reports indicate that the situation has improved and there are fixed rates posted. Caracas traffic is notoriously bad and the metro is a better option if your destination is near a station. Licensed taxis have yellow plates and while some private cars with white plates are taxis too, it’s generally safer to take a licensed cab.
Venezuelan taxi cab drivers may quote you about double the actual price when you ask how much a ride will be. Bargaining is totally acceptable in this case. Simply respond with a more reasonable price that you are willing to pay, and it’s more than likely you can meet in the middle. If the taxi driver continues to quote an outrageous price, simply walk away and try another.
The Caracas metro is clean, modern, safe and extremely cheap. Tickets are available for a single journey, ida y vuelta (round trip), or a 10-journey multi abono. The metro is frequently overcrowded, particularly during peak hours.
The metro system is backed up by a network of metrobuses that depart from certain metro stations and take fixed routes to areas of the city not reached by the underground. Like the metro, metrobuses are cheap and clean, but passengers complain of bus shortages. Most services run only about every 20 minutes. The buses have fixed stops and will not pick up passengers elsewhere.
The ubiquitous minibuses, or por puestos, run along many main roads in Caracas, often ending up in obscure residential neighborhoods that are not accessible by metro. They can be flagged down anywhere and you can generally ask the driver to let you jump off whenever he stops, such as traffic lights. Although sometimes useful (for reaching the Sabas Nieves entrance to El Avila from the Altamira metro station) the buses are more expensive than the metro, slower, less safe, and are invariably in a very bad condition.

Caracas has many hotels, but lacks youth hostels found in other South American countries. Backpackers will find that Caracas is not a cheap destination and there are not rooms available in the US$20-30 typical hostel range. While the whole of the city is considered to be dangerous at night, it’s preferable to stay near Sabana Grande or farther east.
Many hotels in the Sabana Grande area will offer rooms on an hourly basis (euphemistically known as love hotels) which are primarily for unmarried Venezuelan couples.
Most hotels are in Sabana Grande, which is the geographic center of the city or midtown. The true downtown or historic city center, is known as "el centro", which is not a good place to stay. While Sabana Grande has affordable hotel rates (from US$100–400 for a five-star), you need to be wary of occasional street crime in the form of purse-snatching and pick-pocketing. Anyway, the Sabana Grande Boulevard sports high-shining lamp posts and police officers along the way. However, crooked cops are also known to sometimes harass hippie-looking travelers during the day, searching for drugs. Sabana Grande is a pleasantly walkable promenade, fantastic for people-watching and casual shopping. As for the large shopping malls around Sabana Grande, they are absolutely safe, especially one known as El Recreo. All this makes Sabana Grande one of the best place to stay for many. Las Mercedes and El Rosal are the fanciest districts of the city, but fewer people walk these streets. You should rent a car or arrange a taxi in Las Mercedes district.

Casa John Boulton Caracas, 2017
Violent crime in Caracas is a major problem, and it has been getting steadily worse: Caracas is now by some counts the world's most dangerous city. If you are robbed, hand over what is asked of you. For this reason it is advisable to carry a “decoy” wallet with small bills (around US$50). Most thieves carry guns and they will use them regardless of the consequences (there is a sense of immunity due to poor policing).
Stick to the tourist areas and dress like the average Venezuelans (jeans and short-sleeved shirt) and do not wear any expensive-looking jewelry. The barrios (poor neighborhoods/shantytowns) are to be avoided. They are mostly built into the hills around the west side of Caracas, similar to the favelas in Brazil. These neighborhoods are extremely dangerous, but they are far from the main tourist areas.
Kidnapping is a major problem for upper-class Venezuelans, but is unlikely to be a concern for travelers. As with many other developing nations, petty theft is a problem. Ask hotel management to store your valuables when you leave your room and use a money belt for your passport/extra cash when traveling.
The police tend to be corrupt, including at the international airport. According to the Lonely Planet guide: "Avoid the blue uniformed police. The only 'safe' police are the Chacao police with tan yellow uniforms". However, Venezuelans in general are friendly and helpful.
There are many "Centros de Conexiones" in which you can easily make domestic and international calls. There is also a growing number of internet cafes.
Chili's, Torre La Castellana.
Pizzeria Va Bene, Boulevard of Sabana Grande.
Tony Roma's, Las Mercedes.
Caracas has been the staging ground of violent political conflict in the last few years, as well as suffering from a high incidence of crime. While taking appropriate precautions (dressing down, keeping valuables out of sight and avoiding dangerous areas) will probably keep you out of harm's way, paranoia abounds. Traveling with a partner or in groups is advisable.

El Litoral, or the narrow band of coast between El Avila and the Caribbean Sea, is also known at the State of Vargas and the location of the best airport hotels. These beaches are not well known with visitors, but are popular with Caraqueños on weekends. The area has been slow to recover from the disastrous mudslides of December 1999 which made the beaches better. Still they are of lesser quality than the beaches of Choroni, Morrocoy, Mochima or Margarita.
La Guaira - historic port district
Macuto - long history as the favored among the urbanite Caraqueños and most crowded on weekends
Caraballeda - upscale district with yacht marina
Naiguatá - surf and cultural festival zone
Catia La Mar - west of the airport with cheaper hotels that do airport pickup. Marginal neighborhood and beaches
El Hatillo - nice restaurants and pretty colonial architecture.
