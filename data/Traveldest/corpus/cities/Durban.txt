Durban (Zulu: eThekwini; itheku means "city") is a city on the east coast of South Africa in the province of KwaZulu-Natal and in the municipality of eThekwini. It is the third largest city in South Africa and the busiest port in Africa. As of 2011, the population of the eThekwini municipality was around  million. In 2020, it was named the greenest city in the world by Husqvarna Urban Green Space Index because of its many parks.
Durban has a large bay that was protected from the seas by a land spit now known as The Point. This bay formed a natural harbour.
Durban was originally called Port Natal by the Portuguese mariner Vasco da Gama who sighted the bay on Christmas Day, 1497. The city was founded as Port Natal by British settlers in the 1820's and became part of the British Empire in 1842. It was renamed Durban in honour of Sir Benjamin D'Urban, Governor of the Cape Colony.
In the years immediately preceding the European settlement of the area, Shaka, king of a small African clan known as the Zulu, built up his strength, making the Zulu people the dominant African tribe in the area.
The hot and humid climate was ideal for growing sugar and after the first railway was built in 1860, sugar became the principal export from the area. Indian workers were brought in on contract to work the sugar cane plantations. When their contracts finished, they were offered return trips to India or land to the value of the return trip. Many chose to stay making this one of the largest population centres of Indians in the world.
After the discovery of coal in North Natal and gold in the Witwatersrand, Durban expanded rapidly and, excluding the Mediterranean, became one of the largest port in Africa.
Its warm climate and ample beaches have made it one of South Africa's premier holiday areas. Zulu and English are the most common languages in Durban.

Registered taxis are common, generally safe and relatively inexpensive. Taxis do not rove and hence need to be called so that one can be fetched from your pick up point. A lot of these will conduct point to point transfers, airport shuttles, and corporate transfers. The ones that can be recommended for the Durban and surrounds are:
Umhlanga Rocks Taxis (Ucabs), ☏ +27 31 561-1846. (updated Mar 2020)

There are also group taxis, referred to as "combi taxis" (or "minibus taxis"), that are impossible to miss as (in Durban) they're brightly decorated and always have music pumping. There is always someone hanging out of a window making the hand gestures that indicate whether there are seats available and where the combi is going. Minibus taxis are very common and less expensive than metered taxis. Strictly speaking, they are minibuses that take people to and from work, they stick to set routes and they are generally not suitable for tourists unfamiliar with the area they are going to; when in doubt stick to metered taxis or buses. There are minibus taxis plying same routes as Mynah buses, they are more frequent and faster than buses.
Metrorail KZN runs a network of commuter trains in and around Durban. The schedule is mainly aimed at commuters and safety has been an issue.
Rickshaw rides are offered to tourists along the beach front, for amusement rather than getting around. Watch out for the many ups and downs in the ride; the tipping back of the rickshaw cause the contents of your pockets to fall out, into the coffers of the drivers!

The beach strip is frequently patrolled by policemen, there are CCTV cameras and many lights at night. As everywhere else, there are several basic safety rules to follow. Avoid dark, deserted areas, and do not go out alone in the early hours of the morning. The promenade along the beach is safe to walk, but do not venture to the side and back roads of the hotels.
Avoid the Point Road (aka Mahatma Gandhi Road) area at all times.
At night, it is still a good idea to stick to the main streets and not go out at night unless you are very familiar with a particular area. Avoid the usually busy central business district, which is empty after dark. Above all, use common sense.
Remember, you're a tourist, not a celebrity. Dress down to blend in with the people in the CBD (keep the fancy stuff to a minimum).
The harbour area is quite safe, as are the shopping malls and higher residential areas.
The Point, the area between downtown and the port, is known for prostitution and cheap hotels has higher crime rate (although parts are undergoing a massive redevelopment). Avoid walking here alone or at night and take cars or metered taxis if you need to go to this area.
Street children can be a problem, and its best to keep clear of them. Many sniff glue, carry knives, and act quite unpredictably.
