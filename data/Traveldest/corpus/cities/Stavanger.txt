Stavanger is Norway's fourth largest city, at almost 150,000 residents (2023). It is the largest city in, and the administrative centre of, Rogaland county in West Norway. Stavanger is the centre of the Norwegian oil industry and has the only petroleum museum in Norway. It also has a preserved old town on the west side of a charming waterfront. Stavanger cathedral is largely unchanged since early 12th century and the best preserved cathedral in Norway.
In the early 20th century, Stavanger's industry was mainly related to fisheries and shipping
Stavanger sits on the northern part of the Jæren flatland just south of the wide Boknafjord. Stavanger has a mild, humid Atlantic climate. There is less rain (1180 millimeter annually) but more wind than in Bergen. All months are on average above 0°C, January and February around °C on average. Snowfall occurs, but snow rarely stays for a long time. There is rarely deep frost.
North Sea offshore oil and gas dominate Stavanger's economy.
Stavanger is the fourth largest city in Norway, and third largest metropolitan area when nearby Sandnes, Randaberg and Sola are included with a total of some 240,000 people. Stavanger is Norway's most densely populated city. Until around 1950 Stavanger was a typical industrial city with ship yards and Norway's canning capital. During the 1960s Stavanger became an economic backwater and one of the poorest cities in Norway. When the large Ekofisk offshore oil field was discovered in 1969 south-west of Stavanger a new era for the city and for the country began. Ekofisk was at that time the world's largest offshore oilfield. The influx of oil workers, engineering firms and the establishment of headquarters for Norway's oil industry changed the city into Norway's richest.
Development of offshore oil production in the North Sea involved many engineering achievements in Stavanger, notably the huge condeep platforms (concrete deep water structure). These condeep platforms are the biggest objects moved by humans. The Troll A platform is almost 500 m, notably bigger than the Empire State building in New York and taller than the Eiffel tower.
Stavanger is one of Norway's oldest cities and Stavanger or nearby area was a centre of power during the Viking ages. Stavanger became a catholic diocese around 1120 (when the southern part of Western Norway split from Bergen diocese) and the cathedral was founded. The first bishop was probably Reinald, a monk from England.
The very centre of Stavanger: The harbour (Vågen) and Breiavatnet lake from air.
Stavanger Airport, Sola (SVG IATA) (a 20 minute drive from Stavanger). Stavanger airport is the third largest in Norway and located at Sola some 15 km from central Stavanger. There are frequent domestic services from other major cities in Norway, as well as some services from minor cities and towns. Discounted domestic plane tickets are usually available at reasonable prices if booked well in advance, even during the summer vacation (although frequencies may be reduced). SAS and KLM serve Stavanger multiple times daily from their hubs at Copenhagen and Amsterdam respectively. AirBaltic flies from their hub at Riga twice a week. SAS operates flights to Stavanger from London-Heathrow six days a week while Norwegian Air Shuttle has two daily flights from London-Gatwick. SAS and Norwegian Air Shuttle also operate less frequent flights from a number of other European destinations, including Berlin, Warsaw and leisure destinations in Southern Europe, popular among Norwegians, such as Alicante and Malaga.
Airport Shuttle Buses (online 120 kr one way, 180 kr return, 90 kr child/student/senior/military personnel, 23 minutes) 1dead link run to downtown Stavanger every 20 minutes (30 minutes during the Easter, Summer, and Christmas holidays). Bus line number 42 with one transfer to 7 at Sande terrasse or 2 at Jåsund (35 kr, 40 minutes to 1 hour) runs every 30 minutes (60 minutes during the Easter, Summer, and Christmas holidays) weekdays daytime and is cheaper, but slower. Only ONE piece of luggage allowed. Make sure to board the bus in the right direction. Search the schedule for the ones that do 2.
Haugesund Airport, Karmøydead link (HAU IATA) 3dead link (occasionally referred to as Helganes instead of Karmøy) is served by some charter flights and seasonal Norwegian flights from a couple of international destinations.
Public transport to Stavanger is available through Nor-Way Kystbussen (see section "By bus") which corresponds with the airport coach that departs Haugesund Airport after every Ryanair arrival. Through ticket 180 kr. Travelling from Haugesund Airport to Stavanger should take around two hours (private car)/three hours (airport coach + Kystbussen). There is a ferry crossing on the way, charging 95 kr if you bring a private vehicle up to 6 m.
In addition to providing a scenic route, train travel may be a cheap alternative to flying with prices starting from 249 kr one way for discounted tickets booked well in advance. Tickets are made available for sale three months before departure.
About 8 hours with NSB's train from Oslo via Kristiansand. Reservation is not obligatory on long distance routes.
Stavanger Main station (next to the bus terminal). Long distance tickets can be bought at the counter or over the internet, while tickets for local trains can be bought at the main station in Stavanger, at vending machines, or from the conductor. There is a 40 kr surcharge when buying ticket from the conductor if you board the train from a station with a vending machine. The trains are modern and spacious. The trains to Oslo follow the coast. Sleeping compartments with two beds are available on the night train for a fee of 930 kr.
Long distance bus services depart from the downtown bus station. Unless you qualify for discounts (student, senior, military, etc.) or travel at times when discounted air or train tickets are hard to come by, bus travel is relatively expensive compared to travel by plane or train. It is however often the best alternative for getting "off the beaten track" without renting a car.
Lavprisekspressen and FlixBus have a route along the coastal highway to Oslo(8 hours), calling at Kristiansand, Arendal, Sandefjord and others along the road. Booking in advance is mandatory for Lavprisekspressen and FlixBus. Nor-Way Bussekspress operates two routes to Stavanger: Kystbussen runs from Bergen and stops in Haugesund. Departures many times a day. Sør-Vestekspressen runs from Kristiansand. It is possible to catch a connecting bus onward to Oslo
Road 13 connects Stavanger to Ryfylke through the Ryfylketunnelen, at 14 kim this is the world's longest subsea tunnel.
European route E39 from Kristiansand or Bergen.
Road 13 from Voss and Hardanger via Ryfylke. This is the slower but more scenic route.
A daily ferry service run by Fjordline between Bergen and Hirtshals in Jutland calls in Stavanger, on its way from Jutland to Bergen in the mornings, and on its way back in the evenings. The ferry docks at Risavika Port, which is some 30 minutes away from the city centre of Stavanger, and a bus service is provided for foot passengers (i.e. not arriving with a vehicle on the ferry). The journey between Risavika and Bergen, where the ferry lands at Hurtigrutenterminal in the centre, takes 5h30min and the fare is surprisingly affordable, at only about 250 kr per person. A reserved seat on the top deck and the Risavika-Stavanger bus cost 100 kr each,
Since overland travel by bus or car between Bergen and Stavanger is not any faster, and domestic airfares in Norway are not particularly low, the ferry may be a good option for those who want to visit both cities and experience the fjords on their way. In Bergen, it is also possible to connect to the Hurtigruten, which starts there, and continue further north towards Trøndelag and Northern Norway. Hirtshals can be a good option for those who want to take their car from Denmark to Norway and stop in Stavanger before exploring Western Norway further afield.
Cruise ships dock at the Port of Stavanger, which has four berths, piers 1 (Strandkaien) and 2 (Skagenkaien) in the inner harbor and piers 3 and 4 in the outer harbor. The harbor area is right in town, only a five- to ten-minute walk to most downtown attractions. Some smaller places in the inner fjords in Rogaland also have regular boat service from the inner port.
The most scenic and interesting part of Stavanger for visitors is the waterfront area of town surrounding the inner harbor like a big "U", all of which is quite walkable. On the west side of the inner harbor is the old town with two museums. Also the Tourist Information Office in Stavanger is located at Strandkaien, next to the harbor between the cruise pier and the historic Old Stavanger. The TI office, open 08:00 - 18:00 in the summer, is a good source of free advice, brochures, maps, and wifi. On the east side is also lots of shops and restaurants, as well as the Petroleum Museum. At the bottom of the "U" is the market plaza and the Stavanger Cathedral. South of the Cathedral is the man-made Lake Breiavatnet, which separates the harbour area from the train and bus stations and more museums. To go much farther afield, some form of transportation might be useful.
The local bus system in Stavanger is part of a Rogaland county bus system and works smoothly. The web page of the company that manages the bus system (Kolumbus) has a very helpful journey planner. Buses in the city center can be caught at the main bus terminal and at bus stops around the city lake, Breiavatnet dead link. Buses are modern and most have areas for wheelchairs and baby carriages.
Rogaland county is divided into five zones (Nord-Jæren, Jæren, Dalane, Ryfylke, and Haugalandet), and Stavanger is in the Nord-Jæren zone. A single ticket will cost 33-73 kr depending on how many zones you traverse, although it can be used again within your last zone within a certain time limit. A better option might be to buy a day-pass for 85 kr (90 kr with necessary card), which can be used unlimited until midnight. In addition, you can buy the 3-day pass which costs 145 kr. One- and two-week passes are also available. The airport shuttle bus is very expensive (120 kr one-way, 180 kr return) and if you are heading to a location outside the centre it may be more worthwhile to take a taxi. However, on workdays, bus no. 9, which travels half-hourly between the airport and the city centre, is a much cheaper option than the airport shuttle bus (33 kr one-way) if you have only one piece of luggage.
Local trains connect the city center to the southern parts of the city and to the towns and villages further south. There are departures to Sandnes (49 kr, 16 minutes) every 15 minutes during daytime.
Stavanger has different taxi companies, all charging high rates. A typical daytime rate is 35 kr flagfall, 7 kr/started 500 m and 8 kr/started minute, minimum 110 kr total payable. Expect a surcharge of about 25 % in evening/night/Saturday and a surcharge of about 45 % for Sunday. You can use credit cards to pay through the taxi meters.
During weekends there can be long lines for taxis in downtown area. Try walking out of the city centre and hailing a vacant cab on its way back to downtown.
