In 1913–1914 a special commission of the City Council studied the underpasses found during the construction of the city sewage system. The teodolite survey and photographs of the underground cavities were made. The Commission studied all the underpasses,the existence of which was known then: both those just found and those which had already been used for a long time by enterprising merchants for storing various goods: textiles,wines and food. They explored underground galleries, rooms, passes and made up a preliminary description of what they saw. The NKVD-KGB secret police carefully recorded and placed on the secret list all the documents on the underpasses, especially after 1956 when a secret order on the underground caves, passes, shelters, etc. was issued, as the Soviet Union started to prepare bomb shelters in case of the nuclear war.
