Shreveport is the largest city in Northern Louisiana, part of the twin city metro of Shreveport-Bossier City, and is considered the principal city in the three-state region known as the "Ark-La-Tex." It has about 188,000 residents (2019), and is in the area of the state designated as the Sportsman's Paradise. Many lakes and rivers are in the area and offer recreational activities. The surrounding area is also a contrast from points in southern Louisiana, in that the landscape is marked by rolling hills and pine forests, being an extension of the Texas region known as the Piney Woods.
Shreveport is also known regionally as a gambling center, due to the number of casinos and racetracks that operate in the area. Despite the fact that Shreveport has a reputation for gaming, there are multiple opportunities for arts, culture, and learning in the city, with a collection of museums, art galleries, symphonies, colleges and universities, in addition to several fine dining opportunities that bring a mix of regional and international cuisine to Louisiana's third-largest city.
One thing that often goes unnoticed is that Shreveport was the capital of Louisiana during the Civil War from 1863-1865.

The bus stop is directly outside the doors to the baggage claim. Routes 7 & 13 connect to the Downtown Transfer Station, and from there, take Route 20 to connect to hotels, casinos, and points downtown.
For those staying at nearby hotels around the airport and west of the Inner Loop (I-220/LA-3132), most have free airport shuttle service. However, in many cases, it is necessary to contact those hotels directly to arrange for the shuttle to pick up, as flights at Shreveport are more infrequent than at airports in larger cities.
Taxis are available from the airport and there are usually between 2 and 4 vehicles waiting outside the terminal. The pros are that a taxi can get you to more points in the Shreveport-Bossier City area than public transportation, but the cons are the considerably higher price. A taxi from the airport to downtown Shreveport or Bossier City is anywhere from $15 to $25. Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft also have a presence in Shreveport, and drivers can usually be at the airport in less than 5 minutes if none are close by. When exiting the terminal, it is necessary to walk right and go to the edge of the building, as the Shreveport Regional Airport has specifically designated areas for Uber and Lyft services. Wait near the Uber/Lyft signs on the curb for a driver after requesting a ride.

Shreveport, like many other mid-sized cities in the Southern states, does not have a well developed public transit system. Most city residents prefer to get around by their own personal cars or motorcycles. That said, the city public transit network will get visitors to most major destinations and attractions in the city.
Shreveport's public transit system serves the majority of Shreveport, as well as a variety of areas in Bossier City. Most hotels in town will have a bus stop somewhere nearby. All routes in Shreveport connect at one of two transfer points: the  SporTran Intermodal Terminal (Downtown Transfer Hub), at the corner of Texas Avenue and Murphy Street, and the  Southwest Transfer Hub, located at the corner of W. 68th Street and St. Vincent Avenue. If travelling between downtown Shreveport and the southern half of the city, you will likely use both transfer stations. Tickets are relatively inexpensive, with a single ride ticket being $.
