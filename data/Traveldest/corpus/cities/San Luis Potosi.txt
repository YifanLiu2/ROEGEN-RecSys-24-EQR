San Luis Potosí is state capital of the San Luis Potosí state in the Bajío in Mexico. Its position along the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, one of the "royal" roads that led all the way up to Santa Fe, New Mexico, has given the city UNESCO World Heritage status. The city has colonial architecture, churches, government buildings, modern museums and attractions to explore.
San Luis Potosi's name is derived from the combination of its patron saint, Louis IX of France, and Potosi, in reference to the silver city of Bolivia, because of San Luis Potosi's own silver lode in nearby Cerro de San Pedro. It was founded in 1592 by Miguel Caldera and the conquistador Juan Onate, after the Spanish crown gave the indigenous peoples like the Otomi and Chichimeca the boot (after about 100 years).
SLP briefly served as capital of the country under Benito Juarez during the French invasion in 1863. Then it also featured as the place where Mexico's revolution against its dictator Porfirio Diaz began in 1910, after Diaz's opponent Francisco Madero fled imprisonment and called on Mexican statesmen to take up arms.
SLP sits on a high plain at around 1864 m, so be prepared for a little nip in the air on winter evenings. It isn't even unheard-of for some snow to fall. But the city has colonial architecture, churches and government buildings among others, plus museums and modern day attractions to explore.
For questions ask the official tourist information on their Facebook page. They answer quite quickly.
A conversational understanding of Spanish will aid you greatly during your visit, as few SLP citizens will fluently speak English. Indeed, it is a very chic city for learning the Spanish language without being distracted by the English of tourists.
San Luis Potosí has a small airport with a handful of routes. If you can't find a direct flight, consider flying to a nearby city and taking an intercity bus to San Luis Potosi. Nearby cities within several hours by bus include Querétaro, León, Aguascalientes, and possibly even Mexico City.

The price is M$10 (March 2022).
