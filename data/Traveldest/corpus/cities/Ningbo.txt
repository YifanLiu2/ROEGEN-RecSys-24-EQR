Ningbo dead link (宁波 Níngbō) is a port city in Zhejiang province, a thriving prosperous city and a popular tourist destination.
Ningbo lies on the south edge of the populous Yangtze Delta region and faces the East China Sea to the east. It has two main mountains within the prefecture boundaries, Siming Mountain and Tiantai Mountain. The Yuyao, Fenghua and Yongjiang rivers flow through the city area.
Nearby Mount Putuo is an island with a major Buddhist temple on it that has been declared a national park and attracts both pilgrims and tourists.
The people of Ningbo have throughout their history had a deep affinity for the ocean. Two thousand years ago, Xu Fu, a necromancer of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BCE), led a fleet from here, thus becoming the first to commence China's exchanges with other countries. In the early 20th century "Hong-band" tailors from Ningbo traveled extensively throughout China making their living.
Portuguese sailors reached the Ningbo area in the first half of the 16th century. For a while, the city was the easternmost point of Asia known to Europeans. Portuguese attempts to establish a trading colony in the area failed, after which they turned their attention to Macau.
After the Opium Wars in the 19th century, China was forced to open five Treaty Ports for foreign trade, including Ningbo. The others were Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou and Shanghai. As in all the other Treaty Ports, this brought a boom in Ningbo.
The Hangzhou Bay Bridge, completed in 2007 to link the municipalities of Ningpo and Shanghai, has increased foreign investment and economic integration between Ningbo and Shanghai.
Ningbo is not only a very important port city but also the engine of the economy on the east coast of China. Ningbo started foreign trade in the 7th century and has since become a major exporter of electrical products, textiles, food, and industrial tools in China today.
Ningbo enjoys a subtropical monsoon climate featuring high relative humidity and distinct seasons. Summers are hot and humid, so plan outdoor activities for early morning or evening. July is the hottest month (average daily temperature 29 °C) and January the coldest (4 °C). The annual precipitation averages 1,300–1,400 mm.
Outer districts include Cixi 慈溪, Yuyao 余姚, Zhenhai 镇海区, Beilun 北仑区, Fenghua 奉化区, Ninghai 宁海县 and Xiangshan 象山.
From Hangzhou there are frequent high-speed "D" and "G" trains from Hangzhou East Station (杭州东站) to Ningbo Railway Station, taking 1-1½ hours. Perhaps another dozen "K", "T", and "Z" trains travel to Ningo from Hangzhou or Hangzhou East Station daily, taking as long as 3½ hours. The high-speed line from Hangzhou through Ningbo continues through Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and Xiamen to Shenzhen, and there are several high-speed ("D") sleeper trains each evening from Shanghai via Ningbo to Shenzhen and Guangzhou (although most do not stop at Ningbo on the return journey).

You will need a Metro card to purchase, but obtaining one is free and easy. If you are not prepared to sign up for one or are in a hurry - other shoppers will often lend you their card.
