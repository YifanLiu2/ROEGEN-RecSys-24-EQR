Tbilisi (Georgian: თბილისი, Russian: Тифлис Tiflis), is the capital city of the country of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Mtkvari River. The metropolitan area covers 726 km² (280 mi²) and has a population of approximately  million (2022).
Tbilisi (archaic spelling 'Tiflis') lies in the centre of eastern Georgia, in the foothills of the Trialeti mountain range. According to Georgian legends, it was founded in the 5th century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali who, while hunting, shot a pheasant which fell into a warm spring and was either boiled or healed. Either way, the king was inspired to found a city on the site, and the name of the city derives from the Georgian word tbili meaning "warm". Although the city has been destroyed and rebuilt 29 times, the layout of the Old Town is largely intact with narrow alleys and big crooked houses built around courtyards.
Tbilisi experiences relatively cold winters and hot summers. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild micro-climate compared to other cities that possess a similar continental climate along the same latitudes. The average annual temperature in Tbilisi is  °C ( °F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of  °C ( °F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of  °C ( °F). The absolute minimum recorded temperature is −24 °C (−11 °F) and the absolute maximum is 40 °C (104 °F). Average annual precipitation is 568 mm ( in). May and June are the wettest months (averaging 84 mm ( in) of precipitation each) while January is the driest (averaging 20 mm ( in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15–25 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.

See this section for the very limited domestic flights to the city.
International flights go to Tbilisi regularly from Aktau, Almaty, Amsterdam, Antalya, Athens, Baku, Doha, Donetsk, Dnipro, Dubai, Istanbul IST & SAW, Kazan, Kharkiv, Kyiv KBP, London LGW, Minsk, Moscow DME & ZIA, Munich, Novosibirsk, Odesa, Paris CDG, Prague, Riga, Rome, Rostov-on-Don, Sochi, St Petersburg, Tallinn, Tel Aviv, Vienna, Vilnius, Warsaw, Yekaterinburg and Yerevan. There are summer seasonal flights to the Med and Red Sea resorts.
You may also want to consider arriving in the Kutaisi Airport. Flight prices from Asia and Europe can be as low as €20-30. The low fare routes are (as of May 2021) from Vienna, Larnaca, Prague, Tallin, Berlin, Dortmund, Memmingen, Athens, Thessaloniki, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Riga, Vilnius, Gdansk, Katowice, Kraków, Poznan, Warsaw, Wroclaw and Abu Dhabi. From Kutaisi to Tbilisi you go 4 hours in a marshrutka for 20 lari. Or you can take the train.
The rail connection from the airport to Tbilisi's main railway station is not operating as of 2023. The shuttered station is just across the street from the arrivals terminal and is difficult to not notice with its yellow, reflective glass panes.
By bus – Bus 337 leaves from the right corner of the arrival area. From 06:59 to 22:59 every 20-30 min. The night bus between 23:00–06:30 is not running (as of June 2022). Via Avlabari, Freedom Square, Rustaveli, Republic Square and Tamar Bridge to the main train station; allow 50 min. The fare is 1 lari with Metromoney Card, or  lari with credit card (contactless payment required). You will need either, coins are not accepted anymore. Also see: Tbilisi Transport Companydead link
Don't count on the last or last two airport buses to run to the airport. Nothing is overly reliable in Georgia, especially when taxi drivers can earn an extra lari. In May 2023, the last airport bus departed Tbilisi's main railroad station at 23:50.
By taxi – Between the airport and the city it costs 20–30 lari. Standard rates are listed on a board by the taxi rank as you exit the airport, on the right hand side. As of early 2019, the tourist information in the airport quotes 30–50 lari, but Yandex.Taxi, Cabify and Bolt can already be had for 20 lari. Taxi drivers (even of the "official" taxis) outside might insist that the official rate is 80 lari. They are lying.
Beware: Scammer taxi drivers have proliferated at Tbilisi Airport in the past several years and will charge several times the rate. They are aggressive and will immediately accost you upon leaving the baggage claim with greetings like: "Hello, my friend." Be particularly wary of one tall and thin scammer, who will try to be very friendly yet can be menacing if you refuse. Try also to avoid withdrawing money from the ATMs at the airport as many of the scammer drivers that accost passengers try to look over your shoulder to see how much you are withdrawing.
By thumb – Getting around in Georgia by thumb is easy, also from the airport. Try along the road to the highway or at the highway north from the airport, especially in case you want to explore Kakheti in the east.
Tbilisi Central Station (თბილისი ცენტრალი; Tbilisi Tsentrali), Station Square (Sadguris Moedani) (Metro stop: Station Square).

Trains run twice daily between Tbilisi and Batumi, departing each city around 07:30 and 17:30 and taking 5 hr. These trains also connect to Yerevan (Armenia).
Trains also run from Gori, Borjomi, Kutaisi I + II, Marneuli, Poti and Zugdidi.
Yerevan – There is a train servicing Tbilisi to Yerevan. All of the information which follows this sentence may be outdated.
An overnight train runs between Tbilisi and Yerevan in Armenia. From Oct to mid-June this departs from Tbilisi (as Train 371) at 20:20 on odd dates of the month, reaching the border at 22:00 and Yerevan 06:55 next morning. It departs from Yerevan (as Train 372) at 21:30 on even dates, reaching the border at 04:20 and Tbilisi at 07:50. The 31st/1st of the month may be skipped to maintain the alternation. Border procedures either side take 90 min. In summer these trains may be booked out for days ahead, so buy your ticket as soon as possible - you can do so online. The coaches are standard ex-Soviet behemoths, but with fairly comfortable sleeping compartments. No catering, so bring your own food, water, vodka etc.
The one way fare is / lari (upper/lower bed) in 3rd class, and about 90 lari in a 2nd class sleeper berth. 3rd class can be sticky and uncomfortable if it is fully booked—check ahead.

Batumi is close to the Sarpi/Hopa border crossing between Georgia and Turkey, which is the main overland route into this region.
Baku – Trains have not run between the Azerbaijani capital and Tbilisi since COVID-19. There are now no trains that cross the border between these two states.
Ankara – Passenger rail service between Baku and Turkey's capital city via Tbilisi has not yet started operating, and there seems to be no set timeline on when it is due to begin.
Prices, marshrutka drivers and travel hours
Since marshrutkas are privately owned vehicles, some drivers try to charge tourists several lari more than locals. If you do not want to get ripped off, ask a local about the price and give money straight to the driver, or just pay at a ticket office (სალარო) if such exists–most larger cities have them, but not all destinations.Also, start early, because marshrutkas mostly start in the morning and become sparse in the afternoon. After 16:00 it can be hard to catch a marshrutka to/from Tbilisi, or any other city in Georgia for that matter.
There are three main bus stations in Tbilisi, and several smaller ones. In Georgian, bus station is ავტოსადგური or ავტოვაგზალი. Most often than not, large bus stations are located adjacent to big train stations (called sadguri სადგური or vagzali ვაგზალი). To transfer between Didube and Ortachala, use marshrutka 150 or metro.

Getting into Tbilisi through hitch-hiking is mostly not a problem, because most people go into the centre. And even a little further away, you can always catch a cheap (yellow) bus the last metres.
Getting out though can be challenging, as you need to find a place where the traffic goes to where you want. It is best to take a marshrutka or regular bus a few kilometres out of the city and start from there. Also, check the Hitchwiki for detailed instructions.
The primary transport inside and outside the Tbilisi city are metro, buses and marshrutkaa (converted transport vans aka minibuses aka microbuses). Check the Tbilisi Transport Company websitedead link for live overview and more information on buses. Otherwise, to find the correct bus route, GoogleMaps has comprehensive bus network information with numbers and routes. If you click on one of the numerous bus stops around the city or next to you, you will get displayed the bus lines, their routes and frequency.
There is the Metromoney (IC) card, which must be used for most of Tbilisi's public transport options and tapped when entering any vehicle or station. Visa is also possible on some buses, but 50% extra.
The Metromoney card gives discounts when transferring between metro, buses and minibuses, specifically the first ride is 1 lari (for either metro, buses or marshrutka) and all subsequent rides are free within the next 1½ hr. Several people can use one card together, however, only the first person can profit from the free transfer.
You can buy the card at any metro station, with an one-time "non-refundable" deposit of 2 lari. (It can be refunded though if you have the original receipt and register the card onto your name.) The card can be topped up with any amount in metro stations or at Bank of Georgia pay-booths around the city.
Buses and metro station turnstiles will also accept contactless cards, though your bank may charge you for this service.
Tbilisi has a two-line metro system, which operates from 06:00–24:00. However, sometimes the last metros leave at around 23:00 from either end.
All signs inside the metro are in Georgian and English, but station name signs are not always visible from the train. Station names are also announced in two languages. There are rarely system maps on the train cars themselves. You will be lucky to find English speakers riding the Metro. You will however have better luck with Russian, which older people will speak. Take a bilingual map with you if you are not proficient with the local alphabet/pronunciation.
Some rebuilt metro cars have USB charging ports near the doors, so that passengers can charge their phone. Cell coverage exists in most stations.
City buses are green and blue, and come in various sizes. The bus number and a description of the route are usually listed on signs in the bus windows, but only in Georgian. The city has installed electronic arrival boards, with reasonably accurate estimated arrival times, at bus stops on major roads. The signs alternate between English and Georgian and display the bus number, minutes to arrival and destination.
Board through any door you like, usually the double doors in the middle are easiest.
Minibuses (aka marshrutkas) in downtown Tbilisi
Marshrutkas are vans which service the side streets of the city. They are independently owned. Like buses, the route is posted in the front window (often only in Georgian), but marshrutkas use a different route numbering system, and the route descriptions may be more general than the buses, e.g. "Vake" rather than a specific street in the Vake area.
Shout "Stop" or "Gaacheret" when you want to get off, and hand the driver your fare on the way out.
Depending on where you are, certain parts of the city are conveniently walkable, but others cater mostly to motorists. Pedestrians have to contend with significant neglect of the pavements. As far as motorists are concerned pedestrians are allowed to use zebra crossings, but when doing so they do not have priority over vehicular traffic. However, pedestrians do have the advantage of being able to cross the pedestrian only peace bridge and travel on the cable car and funiculars.
Taxis in Tbilisi are also cheap, especially through Bolt or Yandex.Taxi. They are typically privately owned vehicles, and are not metered. If you're going anywhere other than the nearest metro station, major hotels, or tourist destinations, or if you don't speak Georgian or Russian, it's likely that your driver will stop multiple times and ask pedestrians for directions. Even then, he may not know how to get to your destination. If the driver has difficulty finding your destination, he will charge you for his trouble. Always negotiate a price beforehand, unless it is a metered taxi. Prices start at 2 lari for very short trips. A trip in the center of town should rarely cost more than 3–5 lari, and anywhere in the city should never cost more than 15 lari. The taxi drivers can be persistent when trying to get customers.
Consider making an account with Bolt, MAXIM or Yandex.Taxi. They are quite cheap and especially going with several people more convenient. They can also help when the metro is closed and you are stuck—mostly less than 1 lari per km. If you are 3-4 people taxi is an inexpensive alternative to even marshrutkas.
End on parking is widespread, but the ubiquitous informal parking attendants will help you reverse out into the traffic. It is all part of the service they offer in return for the usual tip.
Cycling was rare in the past, but is becoming more widespread, with dedicated bike-paths in some parts of town, including Vake and Saburtalo. In Vake, during rush hour cycling likely is the fastest mode of transport. Cycling on pavements is tolerated, especially by children, as long as done with respect to pedestrians. Experienced cyclists recommend getting thoroughly familiar with traffic and routes before venturing out. (There have been some accidents and fatalities.) The local mobility rental Qaridead link offers rental bikes, requires a local app and pre-payment. A community sourced Safe Cycling map shows some routes that cyclists consider reasonably safe.
A number of international scooter services operate, including Bolt, Qari, and Bird (financial issues as of Sept 2023).

Mamadaviti (მამადავითის ეკლესია), Mtatsminda Pantheon (on Mtatsminda hill). Constructed in 1859–1871, domed in 1879.

Sameba Cathedral (Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi, Georgian: თბილისის წმინდა სამების საკათედრო ტაძარი Thbilisis cminda samebis sakathedro tadzari), Samreklo Street (on Elia Hill. 1 km north from Avlabari metro station). Constructed between 1995 and 2004, it is the third-tallest Eastern Orthodox cathedral in the world. Sameba is a synthesis of traditional styles dominating the Georgian church architecture at various stages in history and has some Byzantine undertones. The Sameba Cathedral was erected on the Elia Hill, which rises above the left bank of the Kura River (Mtkvari) in the historic neighborhood of Avlabari in Old Tbilisi on the grounds of what was once a park, and before that the largest Armenian cemetery in Tbilisi, a tiny portion of that cemetery now forms the Armenian Pantheon. Designed in a traditional Georgian style but with an exaggerated vertical emphasis, and regarded as an eyesore by many and venerated by as many others, the Sameba Cathedral has a cruciform plan with a dome over a crossing which rests on eight columns. At the same time, the parameters of the dome are independent from the apses, imparting a more monumental look to the dome and the church in general. The dome is surmounted by a -m-tall cross covered with gold.

Anchiskhati ("Basilica of St. Mary") (Georgian: ანჩისხატი), Ioane Shavteli St, 18 (Metro Freedom Square). Constructed began at the time of king Dachi Ujarmeli in the 6th century. This is the oldest church in town. Anchiskhati Basilica is a three-span basilica, divided by two abutments forming horseshoe shaped conches, which indicates the antiquity of its construction. Originally constructed of blocks of yellow tuff stone, the 1958–1964 restoration made extensive use of brick. The structure has entrances on three sides, but today only the western entrance is in use. Aside from the altarpiece, which was painted in 1683 by order of Catholicos Nikoloz Amilakhvari, all of the remaining paintings in the church date from the 19th century.

A copy of 11th-century Samtavisi church. The Kashveti church was constructed between 1904 and 1910 by the architect L. Bilfeldt, who based his design on the medieval Samtavisi Cathedral. The construction was sponsored by the Georgian nobility and bourgeoisie. Kashveti was built on the site of a damaged church built of brick at the request of the Amilakhvari family in 1753. Significant contributions to the current church’s ornate design were made by N. Agladze. Kashveti’s frescoes were painted by the influential Georgian painter, Lado Gudiashvili, in 1947. The name "Kashveti" is derived from Georgian words kva for a "stone" and shva "to give birth." Legend has it the prominent 6th-century monk David of Gareja of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers was accused by a woman of making her a pregnant in Tbilisi. David prophesied his denial would be proved when she gave birth to a stone. She did, and the place received the name of "kashveti."

Old Tbilisi (Area between Liberty Sq, slopes of the hill of Narikala Fortress and the river.). Perhaps one of the most distinctive pleasures of walking through the Old City, with its old-style balconies, ancient churches, winding streets, and charming shops. Be prepared to see a number of eclectic sights, from the abandoned streetcar near Erekle Street to the art galleries of Chardini Street to the stunning modern art lining Sioni Street. Sub-neighborhoods include Sololaki, with its elegant restaurants and art nouveau architecture, Old Tbilisi proper — with sites ranging from churches to mosques to sulfur baths, Betlemi — housing two of the city's oldest churches and the stunning vistas of the Narikala Fortress — and Mtsasminda, just up the mountain from Rustaveli Avenues, a more sedate, "livable" district filled with charming old houses and a number of families. A large section has been refurbished turning parts into a sterile, tourist-trade and therefore purely overly consumption attuned quarter. Bars and restaurants largely overpriced. Even Segway rental is available — given the state of Tbilisi pavements, a ridiculous proposition.
Vake Park Area, around Chavchavadze and Abashidze avenues (from MetroDelisi to south  km). This is one of Tbilisi's posher districts, home to many immigrants and nouveaux riches. While not quite as atmospheric as Old Tbilisi, Vake is home to some lovely parks, pleasant nineteenth-century architecture, and some of the city's most high-end shopping, including luxury furniture store Missioni. There are also plenty of elegant, if understated, bars and restaurants in this area. In Vake there are two buildings of Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi state university. The university is founded by Ivane Javakhishvili in 1918 and is one of the historical buildings in Tbilisi.

Sulphur Baths (Abanotubani), Bath Street (აბანოს ქუჩა) (from Metro Avlabari 1 km SW, south side of the Metekhi bridge). The main bath district is easy to spot with its small domes on ground level. There are several small baths offering different levels of comfort. The baths are relatively small, and you may have to wait for a pool to become available. English service is not guaranteed. Massages are available; however, they are more like a washing, but well worth it for the experience. You should bring your own towel and beach sandals but also they are available for a small fee, but pricey compared to the 3 lari if you use the public bath. Some travellers have suggested the Royal Baths is a much better alternative to Sulphur Baths (they are next to each other). Sulphur baths tend to double the price at the end of the massage and bath in spite of your original agreed price. Private pool: 50–200 lari/hr; massage/scrub 5–20 lari.
Bath No. 5 (Public bath). This is the only public bath in this area right at the beginning, follow the neon light. It is definitely worth the experience, so do not miss it. The men's section has a central shower area, a hot pool and a sauna. The women's public section only provides showers and massage, and are probably not worth it. 5 lari/hr, bring thongs and towel or it's extra. (updated Oct 2019)
Bagni Sulfurei Zolfo (#4 Kiev Street, close to the metro station Marjanishvili, around the corner of hostel Green Stairs). An old, and characteristic bath.

Turtle Lake (Kus T'ba) (take a taxi or walk up from Saburtalo). This lake is in the hilly outskirts of Tbilisi. A popular weekend getaway for families, the lake offers pedal-boat rentals as well as swimming (deckchairs optional) for reasonable prices (swimming entry, without deckchair, is about 3 lari). Alright for a hot summer day, and offering views of the mountains and of the city below. Snackbars, restaurants and fruit cocktail shakers are available overlooking the lake. It's about an hour's pleasant walk from the Saburtalo district along country roads, passing the Ethnographical Museum, or a 10-15 minute (5–10 lari) cab ride from the center. There is also a funicular (cable car), going up from the corner of Vale Park at 74 Ilia Chavchavadze Avenue (running daily 08:00–20:00). While the lake itself isn't particularly nice, the views from the hike up to the lake makes it a worthwhile excursion.
Lake Lisi (Lisis T'ba), Reservoir Road ( km SW-W). Much further out than Turtle Lake (a cab will set you back about 10–15 lari each way), Lake Lisi is much larger and more remote, with long, winding mountain walks surrounding the lake. Unlike Turtle Lake, the entire Lake Lisi is opened up for swimmers. Be warned — there aren't always taxis waiting to take you back.
Climb up to the Narikala Fortress (Metro Avalabari). The crumbling ruins of this once-great fortress, standing alongside the Upper Betelmi Churches and the stunning Botanical gardens, offer panoramic views of the city below. It's quite a steep climb, though you could take the cable car instead. Also while the lack of bureaucracy and guard-rails can be liberating for some, you may want to watch your step.
Botanical garden, Botanikuri str. N1 (access via Botanikuri St., or from above through the fortress. Nearest Metro Avalabari.

Prego, Three locations (Saburtalo, intersection of Vazha-Pshavela and Pekini St.; Vake, on Paliashvili, just below the round (UN) garden and the third in the old town, Erekle II st.). Prices are said to be reasonable and service is usually good. Look out for the daily specials - usually a bit pricier, but worth it. (updated Aug 2022)
Piano, Tabidze Street (right next to People's). This new Italian eatery feels more like a swank New York restaurant than a Georgian-style trattoria, with black-and-white Botticelli-inspired wallpaper and uber-trendy minimalist light fixtures. The food is reasonably priced for the — admittedly expensive — area, but it's good (especially the super-fresh tomato-based sauces) and air-conditioned to boot. Beware of the bread; it's so delicious, you'll be full before your appetizers arrive. (updated Aug 2022)
Some outlets of sterile international hamburger "restaurants" exist, also some "freed chicken" imitators in the city, offering the same kind of material Americans consider "food" at prices which are high by local standards.
Prospero's Bookstore and Caliban's Coffehouse, 34 Rustaveli Ave (in a courtyard by the entrance to the overpass near the opera, past the Sony store in the direction of the Rustaveli metro stop).

Good selection of English books, but the real gem is the atmosphere - a perfect escape for when Tbilisi's more chaotic pleasures start to become overwhelming. Effectively bilingual waitstaff, try to strike up conversations with other foreigners. (updated Aug 2022)

One is never far from a corner store opening late selling the bare essentials of life late into the night, which always include booze and bread. Georgia is known as the cradle of wine having produced wine since the neolithic period; and locals are very proud of this. Georgian wine was and still is the best in post-Soviet culture and there are many wine tasting shops in the upmarket areas of the city where wine culture is greatly respected. Try one of the famous wines from Kakheti or the other popular regions.
It is possible to have a great night you may or may not remember for only 10 or 15 lari if you follow students to the cheaper bars where tourists are welcome, but you might be shortchanged a few lari. Nightlife tends to congregate north and northwest of the city centre; do your best to avoid the overpriced drinks in the old town.
Also of note (especially for non-drinkers) is the famous Georgian "Laghidze Waters", sweet drinks based on soda and natural fruit and herb syrups, listed as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia. There is a Laghidze Waters restaurant in Tbilisi selling the genuine article, but Natakhtari is quite similar and sold in corner shops all over.

Tbilisi is the one city in Georgia where coffee vending machines  lari may be found, though with a huge load of sugar.
Unless you would like to forget you are in Tbilisi and drink in fancy expensive places where only tourists and immigrants may be found, Chardini and its connecting streets should be avoided as the most blatant tourist trap in the country. The best pubs and cafes in Tbilisi are tucked in unlikely looking side streets of the Old City, often underground or sometimes without even a sign to mark their presence. Keep your eyes and ears open.
Althaus Tea. Nice and cosy café with interesting sublevel. Good during colder times. (updated Jul 2020)
Laghidze Waters, 53 Davit Aghmashenebeli Avenue (Just at the Marjanishvili end of the 'tourist' section of Aghmashenebeli Avenue where the fairy lights start). 12:00–00:00 daily (ostensibly). Small cafe selling the (reasonably) famous Laghidze Waters and a range of Georgian pastry snacks quite cheap (3–7 lari for a pastry). The other Laghidze Waters cafe near Sameba Cathedral seems to be closed as of 3/19 so this is the only one in Tbilisi.
Minimalist, 21 Revaz Tabukashvili, minimalist.tbilisi@gmail.com. Tu–Th 12:00–20:00, F–M 10:00–20:00.

Tbilisi is very safe after the Rose Revolution. You will be welcomed with the cheerful hospitality that is a hallmark of Georgian culture. The police system was reformed completely and the public's trust in police rose dramatically. The police are usually quick to respond, though usually only Georgian and Russian are spoken.
While walking is generally fine, even for solo women, it makes sense to take a bus or taxi home at night. Use common sense and big-city awareness. Night time at the clubs and bars are generally safe but fights between locals can escalate quickly. The taxi service is safe as long as it's a company taxi like "009" or others. The public bus is also a good, safe option for 1 lari.
Extreme caution should be exercised when frequenting any establishment in the "Shardeni" area, between Kote Apkhazi street and the river, on streets "Chardin", "Bambis Rigi", and "Rkinis Rigi". These bars, clubs, and restaurants are well known for operating expensive scams, charging upwards of US$1,000 for a few drinks and forcing tourists to pay. Although a few establishments in this area have a reasonable reputation, such as "KGB", it is safer and cheaper to completely avoid this area. This is the only area of the city where such caution should be taken.
As always, taxi drivers will try to cheat tourists; especially coming from the airport, rigging the meter, misrepresenting the value of the lari or quoting a price in lari then demanding payment in US dollars. Stand your ground and walk away if necessary.
Beggars have become more aggressive in the tourist areas, and especially children may cling to the legs of wealthy-looking tourists or several adults may cling to a tourist whilst pickpocketing them; yell for help and fight back. Unfortunately, the police appears to be in on this and will often turn a blind eye; or encourage you to let the perpetrators go.
Medi Club Georgia, 22a, Tashkenti St (Metro: "Medical University" 300 m walk to Taskent lane corner opp- of its), ☏ +995 32 2251991, +995 599 581991 (Emergency), fax: +995 32 2250911, mcg@mediclubgeorgia.ge. One of designated medical clinic for foreigners—meaning overpriced. Apparently, official bills from here are accepted more commonly by international health insurances, but this really depends on your insurance.
SIM cards can be bought almost anywhere tourists abound (you'll see the signs or will be offered costly at airport), but the most reliable method to obtain the highest quality service is to hike over to the  Magti store on Rustaveli Avenue and purchase a SIM card there. As of October 2022, data prices are quite reasonable: 7 lari gets you one week of unlimited data, while 28 lari gets you four weeks unlimited. Magti's provides 4G coverage to all but the most remote areas of Georgia. Be prepared to wait a while at the Magti store, however; bring something to read. And don't forget to bring your passport.
Wifis are available in some newer establishments, but you can not count on availability and good expereince not even everywhere in the center.
The Government postal service is notorious for being over-priced and unreliable with many thefts, and lost or damaged packages. Use a private postal company for anything important.
