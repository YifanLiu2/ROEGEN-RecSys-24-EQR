John Wayne Airport (SNA IATA) is the closest airport to Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm in Anaheim and one of five commercial airports in the greater Los Angeles area. It's located  mi ( km or 18 minutes in light traffic) southeast of Disneyland and  mi ( km) from Knott's Berry Farm. The airport is southeast of the junction between SR-55 & I-405 (Exit #8 from I-405 or Exit #6/6B from SR-55) and  mi ( km) from I-5 (Exit #103) along SR-55. Nonstop air service is available from all regions of the United States including intrastate flights from all major airports in the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento in northern California; from Mexico and from Canada. Nonstop flights are available with:
Terminal A: American, Air Canada, Breeze Airways, Delta/Delta Connection and Westjet
Terminal B: United/United Express, Alaska/Horizon
Terminal C: Allegiant, Frontier, Spirit, Southwest, all international arrivals (except from cities with US immigration & customs pre-clearance)
JSX have their own private terminal at 19301 Campus Dr Suite #152, further south of the main terminal.
Instead of three separate terminal buildings, the terminal is a single long building spanning north to south and is divided into three segments with "Terminal A" at the north end and "Terminal C" in the south end of the building.
Taxis from the airport to Disneyland are estimated at $49 one-way; $26 to the historic district in downtown Santa Ana or $23 to the Tustin Metrolink Station (nearest Metrolink Station). There are numerous shuttle and private bus companies that offer regularly scheduled transportation to the Disneyland Resorts or anywhere on request, some of which may offer a group discount. Orange County Transport Authority (OCTA) only go west towards Huntington Beach through Fountain Valley on Rt #76 and southeast towards San Juan Capistrano on Rt #212 on limited schedules. Check schedules before using this option. The i Irvine Shuttle Rt 'A'/ 400A connects the airport to the Tustin Metrolink (nearest Metrolink Station) along Von Karmen Ave for connections to additional OCTA buses and Metrolink trains. Unless you plan to spend your entire stay in a single location (Disneyland/Disney Resorts, OC Convention Center, etc) it is recommended to rent a car, rather than to rely on public transportation to get around in Orange County and the greater Los Angeles area.
The next nearest airports are Los Angeles International Airport (LAX IATA) (49 mi/78 km) and Long Beach (LGB IATA)(20mi/32km), both of which are off of the I-405 corridor from Santa Ana. The other is in Ontario (ONT IATA) which is 50 mi/80 km northeast towards the Inland Empire. If you are transiting through the area, between the airports, it is recommended to pay the extra money for a taxi, Uber or Lyft, rather than try to use public transportation and risk missing your flight. Shared ride vans may make multiple stops along the way to pick up and drop off people, which can take longer, too.
