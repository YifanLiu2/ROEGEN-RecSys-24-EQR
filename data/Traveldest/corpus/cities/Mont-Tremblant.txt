Mont-Tremblant is a small village in Quebec, Canada, known for the famous Mont-Tremblant Ski Resort. Located in the Laurentian mountain range, Mont-Tremblant ("Trembling mountain" in French) is surrounded by lush boreal forest and breathtaking views, standing at 875 meters (2871 feet).
Despite being a ski resort, Mont-Tremblant has become a popular getaway for tourist and locals alike, whether in winter or in summer.
The bright colors of the lower village after heavy snowfall
Mont-Tremblant is divided into two parts. The original village of Mont-Tremblant now goes by the name of The Village, but these days it's The Resort (aka the Pedestrian Village), some 13 km away directly at the foot of the mountain, where the action is. Built by Intrawest (the company behind Whistler) starting in 1992, the resort is a somewhat Disneyland-y concoction of pretty pastel houses, but it looks improbably idyllic in winter with a light (or, not uncommonly, heavy) dusting of snow, maple logs on the fire and lights twinkling in the windows. Vehicles are strictly prohibited — hence the name — and many hotels can be reached directly on ski. A free gondola connects the lower hotels to the ski lifts.
Surrounding the inhabited areas is Mont-Tremblant National Park (Parc national du Mont-Tremblant), the biggest park in the SEPAQ network and the first national park to have been created in Québec.
There are also other areas besides the Village of Mont Tremblant that visitors and locals can live in. Domaine de la Forêt offers direct access to the ski trails and is nestled along the mountainside. Domaine Nansen area is a private, peaceful area that consists of a small cluster of homes hidden in forested south side. Le Domaine du Géant area features luxurious condos in a peaceful setting not too far from the village. The Domaine du Diable area includes luxurious homes featured next to the golf course. Versant Soleil is the newest addition to homeowners settling in Quebec's Laurentian Mountains.
La Macaza – Mont Tremblant International (Mont Tremblant International Airport YTM IATA), 150 Roger Hébert, La Macaza, ☏ +1 819-275-9099. Mont Tremblant International Airport has direct flights from Toronto. Express shuttle bus to the resort costs $40. Taxi ride to the resort will cost you about $125.
The nearest major airports are in Montreal and Ottawa.
Mont-Tremblant is on Route 117. Route 117 is part of a lesser travelled branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, that starts from its interchange with Autoroute 40 (Trans-Canada Highway's main route) in Montreal, which becomes Highway 66 in Ontario. Highway 66 ends as part of the Trans-Canada Highway about 14 km west of Kirkland Lake, where Highway 66 intersects with Highway 11, which is another branch of the Trans-Canada Highway.
From Montreal, it is faster to reach Mont-Tremblant by starting on Autoroute 40, a freeway, which travels most of the way before it merges into Highway 117 at Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts for the last 30 km of the trip (still four-laned highway). Take exit 119 (Montée Ryan) to Chemin Duplessis and follow indications for Tremblant Resort. Using Autoroute 40, the trip is 90 minutes.
From the west (Ottawa and Toronto), it's possible to use smaller roads to shave a few kilometers off the journey, but the roads are very small at times and may be snowed in during the winter. Detouring via Montreal is thus, in all likelihood, the faster option.
If you are driving in the winter, snow tires are required by law in Quebec for vehicles registered in Quebec, and advisable for all vehicles.
Car rental really is essential if you're looking to maintain your independence in and out of the resort, but prices vary dramatically between operators, so do your homework on price comparisons.

Aside from mildly iconic clocktower in the lower village, there are no historic sights in Mont Tremblant. But the surrounding natural beauty makes up for the village's synthetic feel and what it lacks in history. Mountains, lakes and forests provide an idyllic setting - especially in the more rustic northern side.
