Newark is New Jersey's largest city and second largest in Metro New York. Although one of the great historic cities of the Northeast and the most culture-rich city in the state, Newark is often overlooked in favor of Goliath-like Manhattan and towns along the Hudson River, such as Jersey City and Hoboken. While no longer the industrial powerhouse it once was, Newark remains one of America's major shipping, rail, and air hubs. Public transportation is abundant, making it easy to get to, from, and around the city.
Newark has been economically disadvantaged for some time, and suffers from a bad reputation, often informed by negative stereotyping. Thanks in large part to a nationally high-profile mayor (Cory Booker, now a U.S. Senator), committed populace, and changing attitudes towards once decaying urban areas, the often proclaimed, but stunted renaissance of Newark is steadily and substantially taking hold.
English is the main language, but the Ironbound area is home to a significant Brazilian and Portuguese population.
Newark, NJ, is pronounced "Noo-wirk", as opposed to Newark, Delaware, which is pronounced "Noo-ark". Locals will often pronounce it "Nork" or "Nerk".
The city was founded in the year 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony. Three centuries later, the population grew rapidly. Industry also grew constantly. The city even had its own Chinatown. However, in the 20th century, many raids took place, and much of the Chinese population went away to other areas, causing Newark's Chinatown to fade away. Things only got worse as more racial tension and riots occurred in the city. In the 1990s, the city went through tons of revitalization efforts. Today, the city has grown back into an important industrial hub, however some things such as the old Chinatown and the city's good reputation were forever lost. Despite this, the city still shines with culture and history, and also has the oldest county park in the United States, Branch Brook Park. There is also a huge Portuguese and Brazilian population in Ironbound. Although the city is usually overlooked by Manhattan and it is not the glimmering gem it used to be, the city is still worth a visit.
The city is divided into five wards, each with its own character.
Downtown has retained much of early 20th century architecture and has an iconic skyline. Nearly 100,000 people commute to the central business district on workdays, making for a lively urban landscape. Since the millennium it has become more residential as former office buildings and warehouses are converted to housing. A new performing arts complex and sports/concert venue and restaurants have encouraged visitors to linger longer into the night, particularly along Halsey Street and Edison Street.
The North Ward is home to Branch Brook Park, site of the nation's largest collection of cherry blossom trees, and the neo-Gothic Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Surrounding neighborhoods include architecturally interesting suburban enclaves on the east and bustling urban districts on the west.
The East Ward, or the Ironbound, is home to a large Portuguese/Brazilian community, with a "restaurant row" offering a cornucopia of eating establishments for every budget.
The South Ward, once the heart of the Jewish community and home to the Weequahic Park and architectural gems, has fallen on hard times, and is where much of the city's crime is concentrated.
The West Ward, including Vailsburg, is a working and middle class neighborhood.
Port Newark (foreground), Jersey City (middleground), and Manhattan (background) from Newark Airport. Newark is a very active port and industrial city, but that's not all it is.
Newark has great transportation, and is very easy to get into and out of.
Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR IATA) is about 5 mi (8 km) south of downtown. It is a major hub for United Airlines, and is served by numerous other domestic and international carriers. JFK International Airport (JFK IATA) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA IATA) are in Queens, New York, and are served by additional carriers who do not fly to EWR directly. Airport information can be obtained by calling +1-888-EWR-INFO or +1 973-961-6000.
AirTrain Newark shuttles between the airport's parking facilities, three terminals, and train station, where frequent New Jersey Transit (NJT) service is a ten minute ride to downtown. NJT bus #62 and the limited stop GoBus 28 also both travel to downtown, the latter with continuing service to North Newark.
Taxi service is based on a flat-fee determined by destination and paid before the trip begins.

Ever since the infamous Newark riots in the 1960s, the city has been plagued by a somewhat undeserved reputation for high crime and murders. However, crime has dropped significantly in Newark; in fact the city’s overall crime rate is stooping down to record lows not seen in decades. Still, Newark has its share of persisting problems like any other big city. Car theft and car jackings are the biggest crimes in Newark, followed by home invasions. Downtown Newark is crowded and safe during the day. It empties out at night and may seem creepy, but as long as you stay in well lit open areas you should be fine. The Ironbound district has most of the great restaurants and is busy on nights and weekends and is probably the safest part of the city, behind Downtown and residential Forest Hill. If you were to go to an event at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the New Jersey Symphony Hall, or the Prudential Center, you should be fine. They are well lit areas with a police presence and are the safest part of the city.
The North, Central, and especially South Wards have heavier crime rates and it pays to be more guarded in those areas.
Although bustling during peak travel hours and almost completely safe in daylight, Newark Broad Street station (NJ Transit) can be very dangerous after hours and through the night when fewer people wait for trains (usually from 10PM-5AM). Armed robberies are common and can occur even when you are not the only one waiting for a late train. If you do find yourself at the station after hours, wait in the lobby beneath the platform, or failing that, one of the lit waiting booths on the platform. Do NOT display cell phones or iPods.

Manhattan is easily accessible. The cheapest way is via the PATH train, from Newark Penn Station to World Trade Center or with a transfer at Journal Square (Jersey City) to the line which goes to Christopher St. and along 6th Avenue to 9th, 14th, 23rd and 33rd Streets. NJ Transit from Broad Street Station and Newark Penn Station takes you directly to the New York Penn Station in about 17 min.
The nearby city of Elizabeth, which offers plenty of shopping options including the Jersey Gardens shopping mall and IKEA, is only a short car ride away.
The Jersey Shore, with funky Asbury Park, Victorian Ocean Grove, and fishing town Manasquan is served by the North Jersey Coast Line, and is an easy day trip.
The Statue of Liberty National Monument includes Ellis Island, once America's busiest immigration station, and Liberty Island, home to the statue itself. Ferries depart from Liberty State Park in Jersey City, reached by taking PATH to Exchange Place and switching to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail.
Field Station: Dinosaurs theme park exhibition is within walking distance of Secaucus Junction, one stop from Newark Penn on NJ Transit trains.
Thomas Edison National Historical Park, which preserves Thomas Edison's laboratory and residence, is 6 miles (10 km) west of downtown Newark in West Orange.
St. John's Church, a Gothic Revival Roman Catholic church which houses outstanding 19th-century artworks and an historic pipe organ is located in the nearby City of Orange.
Believe it or not, it is possible to hitchhike out of the New York Metro area. If you are trying to go long distances, your best bet is to take NJ Transit or Metro North far enough to put you well into the suburbs, preferably to a stop that puts you near (within walking distance of) a major highway such as an Interstate. From there, get to an on-ramp and put out your thumb. New Jersey Statutes 39:4-59 on hitchhiking is notoriously prohibitive, and you will be hassled by local police, so use common sense and discretion. If you're trying to go west into Pennsylvania, your best bet is to take NJ transit to Mt. Olive, which is only a 5-min walk from I-80, which generally carries a good amount of long-distance traffic going west.
