Graz is the capital of Styria (Steiermark) and the second largest city of Austria. Graz maintains a balance between its illustrious past and modern present and features spectacular architecture from all periods, while the warm and sunny climate influenced by the closeness to the Mediterranean makes it a very nice city to visit. The City of Graz, Historic Centre and Schloss Eggenberg, is a world heritage site.
The landmark of Graz: The clock tower
Graz has a population of just over 300,000 (2024). It has been a vital urban centre for both Styria, Austria and Slovenia, and has produced a number of talents in many fields, ranging from the inventor Nikola Tesla to the former California Governator and bodybuilding legend Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Some 40,000 of the city's population is made up of students, as Graz is home to six universities (four "standard" universities and two dedicated solely to applied sciences), and is associated with names as illustrious as Johannes Kepler, Erwin Schrödinger and Nikola Tesla. The first university was founded in 1585 (Karl-Franzens-Universität).
Graz is also known for the Magna Steyr (formerly called Steyr-Daimler-Puch) automobile and truck manufacturing plant located there.
The roots of Graz can be traced back to Roman times, when a small fort was built where the city centre is today; Slovenians later built a larger fortress in the same place. The name "Graz" is derived from the Slovenian word gradec, which means small castle. Graz was first mentioned with its German name in 1128 when the dukes of Babenberg turned the place into a commercial centre. During 15th century Graz became the capital of Inner Austria (referring to Styria, Carinthia and Carniola) under the Habsburgs.
Due to its importance as a strategic position, Graz was often assaulted by Ottoman Turks in the 16th century. The fortress on the Schlossberg (the picture to the right shows the clock tower, which is on top of the hill) never fell to the Turks (the only place in this region).
During World War II, Graz was part of Nazi Germany (along with the rest of Austria). At the end of the war, Graz was surrendered to Soviet troops largely intact; the historic old town was not seriously hit during Allied bombing raids on the city. In 2003 Graz was the Cultural Capital of Europe.
The single-runway Graz Airport is immediately south of the city
Graz Airport (GRZ IATA, Flughafen Graz). It is a relatively minor regional airport around 9 km south of the city centre. Scheduled flights operate to Graz from Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Vienna and Zurich, connecting to intercontinental hubs of Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines, while in the summer there are charters to many holiday destinations around the Mediterranean.
From the airport you have several possibilities to reach the centre:
by taxi: approximate fare to the center is between €35-39.
by bus: the bus station is directly in front of the arrival zone. Bus lines 630 and 631 are going to Jakominiplatz (the central point of public transportation) from approx. 05:20 to 23:45, travel time is 20 minutes. Fare is €3 for a single ticket (2023).
by train: to reach the train station you have to walk ~5 minutes (easy to find, just head straight out the airport and continue to the east). Line S5 connects to Graz Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) from 04:47 (Saturdays and Sundays 05:17) to 22:47 (Sundays: 21:47). Travel time is 15 minutes.
Other nearby airports are in Maribor, Klagenfurt, and a little farther away in Linz, Ljubljana, Zagreb and Vienna International Airport. Railjet express trains and FlixBusses connect Vienna Intl. Airport with Graz. Some run direct, others require a transfer at Wien Hbf station. Travel time around 3 hr.
The spectacular main hall of the Graz Central Station
Graz main station (Hauptbahnhof) is on the western edge of the city centre, at the end of the Annenstrasse. Graz has frequent connections to Vienna with direct trains every hour. Connections to Salzburg and most other Austrian Cities and Munich are also reasonably frequent. Night trains serve destinations as far as Zurich, and there are two direct day services each day to Zagreb.1 There are also less frequent services to Slovenia and Hungary. To reach the old town, take tram line 1, 4, 6 or 7, or simply walk down Annenstraße for about 20 minutes and cross the bridge. You can obtain a map from the Tourist Information in the Hauptbahnhof.
It is worth noting that the direct services from Vienna to Graz pass through the Semmering Railway, a rail line listed in the UNESCO World Heritage due to its unique construction involving 14 tunnels and 16 viaducts. Keep your eyes open! From Vienna to Graz, sit on the left; from Graz to Vienna, sit on the right.
The A9, runs north-south through Graz, mostly via the 6 mi Plabutsch tunnel. The A2, just south of the city, runs east-west. Vienna (Wien) is 127 mi up the A2 to the east. A just as fast but much more scenic alternative route to Vienna is via Bruck/Mur taking the S6. (Beware that there are lots of tunnels on the S6.) Some might also find the 5 mi (single carriageway) Gleinalm (Toll) tunnel on the A9, 15 miles to the north of Graz, unnerving. Toll charge: Gleinalm Tunnel: cars and motorhomes up to  t: € | with caravans/trailers: € | Motorhomes over  t: €. It is possible to avoid the tunnel by travelling on the rather longer route via Bruck an der Mur.
Graz does not have a dedicated bus terminal. Private and public operators all operate from separate terminals:
Eurolinesdead link operates from Hauptbahnhof dead link. They offer reasonable cheap tickets to many destinations throughout Europe.
Linie G1 - Dr. Richard formerly dead link offers busses from Vienna to Graz.
Regional Buses run frequent services from terminals at Andreas-Hofer-Platz dead link (City Bus 40, 67 or three minutes walk from Hauptplatz), Hauptbahnhof dead link (Tram 3, 6 as well as 1, 7 evenings and Sundays, City Buses 50, 52, 53, 58, 63, 85) and some others, with many destinations throughout Styria. Many Busses also pass Jakominiplatz.
For travels to Austrian or Slovenian destinations check out 2, they will find you routes with public buses, trains, and trams to your desired destination. (Although in Carinthia and Tyrol it is limited to trains.)
The old town of Graz is easily explored on foot and is reachable with a 20 min walk from the main train station. Stop at the Tourist Information at the train station, or any hotel lobby that you come across to pick up a brochure on attractions in Graz. This brochure also contains a map with most of the sights marked, as well as recommended self-guided walking routes through the town.
For other needs, public transportation options exist:
All tram tickets can be bought inside the tram. Graz has an excellent tram service running through the Jakominiplatz where the different routes meet and you can change trams. You can also buy tickets at the tobacco kiosk (Tabak) in the centre of the square. If you buy tickets from the kiosk, make sure you punch your ticket inside the tram (If you get caught without a valid/punched ticket you will have to pay a fine of €60; if you buy it inside the tram, it is already validated).
Ticket prices: You can buy hourly (€3), 24 hours (€), weekly (€), monthly, or 10-trip (€) tickets. Coins, credit cards, debit cards all work at the vending machine in the tram. They are valid on all modes of public transport throughout Zone 101 (Graz plus immediate surroundings including the airport!) Children (6 to 14) get 50% discount.
Trams running through the old city (Altstadt) are free, usually one stop in all directions from Hauptplatz (Main Square) and Jakominiplatz.
Graz also has an excellent city bus network taking in the parts of Graz not serviced by trams. Many buses go through Jakominiplatz, Hauptbahnhof and Geidorfplatz. The tickets are the same as for the tram. Be sure to get yourself a map (at Jakominiplatz) of the network if you plan to use it frequently. Also check out 3.
Keep in mind that bus tickets have to be bought in advance (via a vending machine, kiosk or the ticket app GrazMobil (iOS, Android)) and punched when entering to validate them. The tickets for trams and buses are the same, so you can start your journey with one means of transport and switch to another one as much as you like during your ticket's validity.
Bus and tram services operate from 05:00 to midnight during the week. Trams usually stop around 23:30 from Jakominiplatz in all directions. Nightbuses operate only on Fridays and Saturdays and before public holidays. They leave from Jakominiplatz in all directions at 00:30, 01:30 and 02:30.
Graz is a city of cyclists, featuring an excellent network of cyclepaths. Due to this using a bike to get around (at least the central areas of Graz) is one of the best choices. It also helps that it does not rain a lot in Graz. Bikes may be rented, although if you are staying a bit longer buying a used one (and maybe reselling it) from one of the many bike stores may be cheaper (get one of the great restored vintage bicycles from Rebikel, Keplerstraße 55). Bike theft is a common problem in Graz, so take care that your bike is properly locked (if possible against a bar) when you are not using it. Also, if you are inexperienced bicycling around trams, take extra caution (especially noting that getting your wheel stuck in a tram rail could knock you down, with trams potentially coming right behind and beside you!). Counter-flow cycling (cycling in the "wrong" direction of a one-way street) is allowed almost everywhere in Graz - watch out for "one-way street"-signs with a small additional "ausgenommen Radfahrer" ("except cyclists") sign.
An online map of Graz for cyclists is available here: 4. You can get a big map for cyclists from the Tourist info office (Herrengasse 16), at "Mobil Zentral" (Jakoministraße 1) or at the "Radstation" (Cycling station) next to the central railway station.
Rental bicycles are available for example at the "Radstation" (German only) next to the central railway station (leave the station through the main exit, turn right, walk approx. 200 m) or from one of the shops of "Bicycle" (German only).
Taxis are available 24 hr a day. You can hail one on the street, go to a taxi rank or order one by phone. The taxi ranks with the best chances of getting a taxi day or night are "Hauptplatz" (Right side of City Hall) or "Hauptbahnhof". There is a base rate of € for all rides (2023). Avoid taxis in the early morning and early evening when traffic congestion can make a taxi ride very expensive. A ten-minute taxi ride usually costs about €12. Taxis can be booked at the same price as on the street by calling 0316-878, 0316-889, 0316-222, 0316-2801.

If you can avoid it, just avoid it. Graz has areas with an inscrutable one-way system which makes it easy to get lost. Parking space in central areas are rare and subject to a fee from Monday to Friday (09:00 to 20:00, in front of Hauptbahnhof to 20:00) and on Saturday from 09:00 to 13:00. Tickets can be bought from ticket machines placed in every street. A ticket for half an hour costs €1 ("blue zones", "green zones" are a bit cheaper). The maximum parking duration in blue zones is three hours and in green zones one day. There are a lot of 'ticket-police' around so don't even try to park without a valid ticket (fine €25). There are a number of underground car parks in the city centre for example under the Karmeliterplatz which is called Pfauengarten Parkgarage which is open 24 hr a day. A ticket for one hour costs €2, a 24-hr ticket costs €12, other are as much as €4 per hour.
The historic old town. It has been designated a World Heritage site.
The Schlossberg (Schloßberg). the castle perched upon a hill in the middle of the city around which Graz sprang up. The funicular (Schloßbergbahn) (10-day and tourist tram/bus ticket covers the ride), and elevator (Schloßberglift) (€2) will take the effort out of the walk to the top, although to use them would be to miss the wooded paths and some spectacular views. Alternatively, you can climb the 260 steps from Schloßbergplatz to the Graz clock tower. (updated May 2023)
Clock Tower (Uhrturm). On the top of the Schloßberg, the symbol of Graz.
Glockenspiel, Glockenspielplatz. It comes to life with song and rotating dance figures every day at precisely 11:00, 15:00 and 18:00.
Eggenberg Palace (Schloss Eggenberg) (Tram 1 direction Eggenberg/UKH), ☏ +43 316 583264-0. 10:00-17:00. Guided Tours: Tu-Su and public holidays at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 14:00, 15:00 and 16:00. Early Baroque architecture with lavish state rooms. There is a €2 fee for entering the park surrounding the castle, which they likely will not charge if you say you intend to take the castle tour. The castle guided tour is highly recommended though, as it contains dramatic wall and ceiling paintings, elaborate ceramic stoves, and inlaid wood floors. Eggenberg Castle is closed from 1 January till 23 March. €13, free entry to the museum with Steiermark-Card or GenussCard. (updated Feb 2018)
Don't miss the double spiral staircase in the Burg, a castle complex built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III which is today inhabited by the government of Styria.
The mannerist-Baroque Mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II., with impressive interior decor by famous Styrian artist Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. Its elliptical dome is the oldest of its kind outside Italy. Next to the Mausoleum is the Cathedral of Graz with an exceptional exterior fresco, the so-called Gottesplagenbild (picture of plagues), which is the oldest remained painting depicting Graz.
There are some more remarkable churches in Graz: The oldest one is the Romanesque Leechkirche with its tympanon Madonna. The highest building of Graz with  m is the Herz-Jesu-Kirche, designed down into the last detail by architect Georg Hauberrisser in Gothic Revival style. Except the altar area, which had to be re-modeled after the liturgical renewals of the Second Vatican Council, everything still retains the original conception. On the other side of Mur t there are some beautiful Baroque churches like Mariahilf or Welsche Kirche. In St. Andrä, Baroque and modern elements combine, whereas St. Lukas, situated at one of the largest traffic routes of Graz, is a great example of contemporary sacred art.
Kunsthaus (Tram 1,4,6,7 direction Hauptbahnhof). Graz's newest exhibition place. It's worth a visit, even if you only look at its design from the outside. It's right across the river from Hauptplatz at the Suedtirolerplatz. (You will definitely notice the blue bubble.) €3 with euro<26 card.
Murinsel. It was built as a temporary project during 2003 for the Cultural Capital of Europe (Graz 2003) celebrations. People liked it enough so it stayed.

Contains an amazing collection of arms and armor, from large two-handed swords and maces to the more modern pistols. Originally the local armory was built to readily equip the people in the event of an attack, and so the weapons you'll see here were made for use, not show. English tours are available; inquire early in the day to see what time one will be offered. If you are incredibly enthusiastic about weapons and ask nicely, your guide might treat you to further description of the use and care of the weapons after your tour is completed. Pictures are not allowed, but postcards with pictures of the main pieces can be bought in the gift shop. Be warned, this building gets extremely warm in the summer (especially on the upper floors). Weapons enthusiasts may wish to go early in the day, or you may find your interest waning rapidly as the puddles form around your feet. Note without a guide it is just row upon row of armour with no information at all on any items in any language. Adults €8, groups €, students €3.
Walk around the centre of the town and explore the many courtyards and narrow streets discovering many interesting shops, restaurants and cafés as well as the impressive architecture.
Walk or climb up the Schloßberg and have a meal in the open-air at the top whilst admiring the views. The easiest way is to walk up the Sporgasse from the Hauptplatz to the "Karmeliterplatz" where you walk under an archway on the left where a road meanders up the gentler eastern side of the Schloßberg. From the west and north you have a choice of zig-zag paths or to climb the steps from "Schlossbergplatz". There is also a lift going up inside the mountain at Schlossbergplatz. You also might see some of the tame red squirrels (Eichkätzchen) at the top. Use the Schloßbergbahn, a cable car which you'll find at the Kaiser-Franz-Josef-Kai, to go up or down if you don't feel like walking.
Take the number 1 tram to the terminus at the bottom of the Plabutsch, a hill on the western edge of Graz, and hike up it. It's quite strenuous, and you really need walking boots and perhaps a map.
Take bus number 40 to the terminus and walk up (very steep) to the ruins of Gösting castle and enjoy the view over the city.
Swim. Normally after May, the water in the outdoor swimming pools very quickly warms-up enough to enjoy swimming:

Bad Strassgang, Martinhofstraße 3.
Stukitzbad, Andritzer Reichsstraße 25a.
Boat or skate on the Hilmteich or Thalersee (just outside Graz), depending on the season.
A nice trip for a lovely day leads to the Austrian Sculpturepark. Remarkable pieces of art from numerous national and international artists in a pretty park. You can entrer for free, but you better bring something to drink and a Snack. Reachable by a free shuttlebus in summer to Schwarzlsee or with regionalbus 630 from Jakominiplatz. You can also go by bike, it's a nice ride passing by the Airport.
Football: SK Sturm Graz play soccer in Austrian Bundesliga, the top tier. Their home ground Liebenauer or Merkur Arena (capacity 16,000) is two km south of city centre.

On the Kaiser-Josef-Platz, right opposite the Opernhaus, is a fruit and vegetable open-air market where small farmers from the countryside around Graz bring their produce for sale (or rather their wives do). Morning only.
The other main farmers market in Graz is located on the "Lendplatz". Morning only.
Be sure to buy a bottle of "Kernöl" (pumpkin seed oil) in g.g.A. quality. This oil is typical for Styria and has a very unique and wonderful taste. Ideally buy it at a (farmer) market (like Kaiser-Josef-Platz, Lendplatz,...). But you can also buy good quality oil at the normal supermarkets.
There are many possibilities to go shopping in Graz. Good places to shop are:

Bigger shopping complexes found outside the city centre are:
Shopping City Seiersberg - A huge build shopping complex just outside the city limits. Take tram 5 to Puntigam and from there take bus 78. Although the centre lies outside of Graz it's still Zone 101, meaning that you will not have to buy an additional public transport ticket.

Murpark - Only mayor shopping centre in the east of Graz. Only shopping centre in Graz to have direct access by tram. Take tram 4 to end of line in Liebenau.
Restaurants have cheap lunch deals ("Mittagsmenü") (12:00-15:00) or a dish of the day ("Tagesempfehlung") that are usually very good, fresh and have the best value.
The SPAR supermarket in the Hauptbahnhof is the only major one open on Sunday. There are various Turkish markets around town, but their selection is limited.

Due to its importance as a university city, Graz has a vibrant night life.
Bars are concentrated around the old town as well as the Karl-Franzens-University to the west of the old town. The old town has a mixed audience while the bars around university are mostly attended by students.
In the old town you'll also find a few Irish pubs. Whereas the most Irish of them is O'Carolan's right next to the main square (Hauptplatz) others include Flann O'Briens and Molly Malone's. The Office is a very laidback and unique new addition to the Irish/British pub scene in Graz. The Office features regular live music and jam sessions, as well as the odd bit of Karaoke, and darts (steel - you know, the real ones from England) every Sunday.
