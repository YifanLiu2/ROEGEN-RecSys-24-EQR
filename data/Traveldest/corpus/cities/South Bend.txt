South Bend is in Northern Indiana. The city's name is drawn from the fact that it's situated on the southernmost bend in the St. Joseph River. Together with neighboring Mishawaka they form a continuous urban area of about 325,000 (2020). South Bend is the home of the University of Notre Dame, but is also the former home of many large companies such as Studebaker, Oliver Chilled Plow, and Singer.
The area is now home to Crowe-Chizek, AM General (which makes military vehicles.), Bosch, Honeywell, and Woodwind & Brasswind. The city hopes to grow with the undertaking of a new nano-technology campus near the city, which has already brought new contracts for factories and businesses around the city of Southbend.
With a population just over 100,000 (2020), South Bend is often thought of as a "small town", perhaps increasingly so since former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg (known as "Mayor Pete" due to his difficult to spell last name) likes to tout his experience of being a "Small Town Mayor in a Red State" during the Presidential Primaries in the 2020 campaign cycle which ultimately propelled him to national fame and the post of secretary of transportation of the USA.

Driving around yourself is the best way to navigate the city. St. Joseph County's road naming system makes it easy to find your way around. If you get lost or lose your bearings, remember that the main county roads running east-west are named after presidents and other famous figures (but mostly presidents) and begin, alphabetically, with Adams Rd. in the north near Michigan and end with Taylor in the south, near Marshall County. North-south roads are named for trees, beginning with Ash (called West County Line Rd. on the Elkhart County side of the road) in Eastern St. Joseph County and ending with Redwood in the West. There are exceptions to this rule, however, such as Washington St. downtown, and Mishawaka has numbered streets. Also, Lincoln Way is renamed LaSalle Ave. in downtown South Bend between Ironwood Dr. and Lafayette Blvd.
There are no bike shops that rent bicycles in South Bend, but the city is now home to a fleet of LimeBikes which can be rented by downloading the app. Riders can rent an available bike at a low price, (usually $1 per ride + $ per minute), and don’t need to return it to a designated bike rack like other bike-share programs.

Founded in 1921, St. Julian is the oldest and largest operating winery in Michigan. Its founder, Mariano Meconi, named the winery for the patron saint of his birthplace, Faleria, Italy. The winery was moved from Detroit to Paw Paw in 1936 to be closer to the vineyards.

Like many post-industrial cities, South Bend has some trouble spots. To be safe, lock your vehicle when you plan to leave it unattended anywhere downtown, but especially in a parking garage or low lit area after dark. Places to be careful during the day and not walk through after dark include areas on and around Lincoln Way West between William St. and the airport, SR 23 and Madison St. on the East Side of downtown and the river, Western Avenue between William St. and Mayflower, and US 31 between Monroe and Donmoyer Ave. to the north and south and Miami St. and Olive/Locust Rd. to the east and west. Essentially, the south and west sides of downtown and a small portion of the east side can be dangerous, but the majority of neighborhoods are safe. Portage Road and going north towards Cleveland is also known for crime. Take care as you would in any major city after dark.
One natural threat to be aware of are tornadoes: if you hear a siren or there is a tornado warning issued, take it seriously. Because South Bend/Michiana is so far North of the tornado belt, there are very few twisters in the area, even during tornado season. However, the tornadoes that do occur are usually F0s which, though comparatively weak, are often low to the ground and very difficult to spot with doppler radar, making advanced warning more difficult. Though much smaller events, their winds speeds can reach as high as 90 miles per hour and they can cause very localized damage in a short period.
Drinking water is as safe in South Bend as anywhere else in the country. Do not swim in the St. Joseph River or accidentally ingest river water as the Western half of the St. Joe is still quite polluted. A 5-phase project to reroute old stormwater pipelines out of the river is nearly halfway finished, and is the primary remaining obstacle toward relative purity.
Northern Indiana has several recreation areas that highlight the interesting topography and natural features of the area.
Chain O' Lakes State Park Located in Northeast Indiana, Chain-O-Lakes is a series of glacially-formed interconnected lakes and tributaries surrounded by thick, relatively hilly forest. The area has a vast array of wildlife and canoeing is available.
Dr. T. K. Lawless County Parkdead link Located in Cass County, Michigan (approximately 40 minutes from downtown South Bend), this park features over seven miles of biking/cross-country skiing trails with peaks that overlook two small lakes and feature views of the surrounding county. The park also houses a soccer field, baseball diamond, two picnic houses, horseshoe pits, a disc golf course, children's play equipment, fishing in park-managed lakes and streams, a one-mile paved total access trail, modern restroom facilities, and inner-tubing in the winter (tubes provided). A modernization effort has been established to update facilities and add a dog park.
Indiana Dunes National Park The first national park in Indiana, Indiana Dunes is a popular attraction in which visitors may see swales, bogs, and other prehistoric natural features of Northern Indiana as well as massive sand dunes and a clean lakeshore. Chicago's skyline can be seen on clear days. Camping is available. The South Shore Line takes you right to the park for less than $7 each way
Pokagon State Park Located in Indiana's lake country (extreme Northeast Indiana), Pokagon State Park features rare, ancient glacially-formed bogs, marshes and lakes. The park also boasts a luxurious and historic inn/lodge (book ahead as it's usually full!), hiking trails, dense forests, ample wildlife, great fishing, a nature center, bicycle, boat and ski rental, and a nationally popular refrigerated toboggan-run that plunges riders down a moderate hill at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour.
Lake Michigan Just under 40 miles from South Bend lie the cities of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, MI, popular locales for beach-goers. New Buffalo, MI is the closest waterfront at 35 miles away and is home to Redemak's famous burgers. Michigan City is due west about 40 miles and features shopping, dining, and Indiana Dunes National Park. New Buffalo and St. Joe/Benton Harbor are excellent sunset viewing locations.
