Novosibirsk (Russian: Новосиби́рск nuh-vuh-see-BEERSK) is a city of  million people (2018) in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia. Its main interest for visitors is as a stop-off on the Trans-Siberian Railway, two days from Moscow.
The course of the Trans-Siberian Railway was dictated by where it was possible to span the great rivers of Siberia, and this altered as engineering techniques advanced. To cross the mighty River Ob, they eventually chose the village of Krivoshchekovskaya, founded in 1696. A new town grew up, at first called Novonikolayevsk (Новониколаевск), in honour both of Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. At the time of the bridge's opening in 1897, Novonikolayevsk's population was 7800; by 1907, when the population exceeded 47,000, it was granted town status with full rights for self-government.
In the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a centre for scientific research be built in what was now Novosibirsk, and in 1957, the multi-facility scientific research complex of Akademgorodok was constructed about 30 km south of the city centre. The city expanded rapidly, reaching a population of one million in 1962.

Novosibirsk is a typical Soviet-era city, laid out on a grid pattern with medium-rise slabby blocks. It's far from beautiful but there's plenty to see to occupy a day or two here. People seldom speak English, but as the Trans-Siberian tourist industry has built up they've become used to foreigners and are generally helpful.
The climate is Siberian. Summers in Novosibirsk are typically warm, but sometimes cool and rainy. Winters are cruel, with temperatures routinely dropping to -20° C and sometimes down to -40° - your life is at risk if you're not properly prepared for such conditions.

As in every Russian city, there are multiple monuments to heroes of the Great Patriotic War (World War II), including an eternal flame guarded at special ceremonies by youths with replica Kalashnikovs.
In front of the Opera & Ballet House, Lenin's Square is adorned by a big grey statue of Lenin. His cloak billows out behind like Marilyn Monroe's skirt, as if to show where the Metro passes beneath.
The exact geographical centre of the former Soviet Union just south of Lenin Square is marked by the Chapel of Saint Nicholas. It was built in 1915 to commemorate 300 years of Romanov rule, destroyed in 1930 and rebuilt in 1993. The Chapel is tiny, sitting on a traffic island like a clock-tower, yet regular services are held within.
A little further S, past the Art Museum, is the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral at 1A Krasnyi Prospekt. Big as it is, you won't see it until you're upon it, as it's somewhat set back from the street.
1 km north of Lenin Sq is Ascension Cathedral, at the corner of Sovietskaya & Gogolya.
A visit to Akademgorodok, built in the 1950s as an area for academics but suffering from neglect in the post-Soviet years, is still pleasant as a day trip. This formerly elite institution is about 30 km south of the city and features several museums and nice, tree-lined streets.
While you're in the area, you might also visit one of several nice beaches on the Ob Sea, the large body of water created by a dam on the Ob River.
Also south of the city, about 2 km north of Akademgorodok, is the open-air West Siberian Rail Museum. There are about 90 historical trains and rail carriages.
Monument to the laboratory mouse (Памятник лабораторной мыши). Bronze statue by local artist Andrey Kharkevich in the park in front of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, erected on 1 July 2013, coinciding with the 120th anniversary of the founding of the city. It commemorates the sacrifices of mice in genetic research to understand biological and physiological mechanisms for the development of new drugs and curing of diseases. The sculpture depicts a laboratory mouse wearing a pince-nez on the tip of its nose, sitting on a granite pedestal. The mouse holds knitting needles in its paws, as if it is knitting a DNA double helix. Viewers will immediately notice that the helix is wound left, whereas DNA is taught in schools to wind right. This is done intentionally to indicate the DNA helix knitted by the mouse is the still poorly understood Z-DNA, as opposed to the wider known B-DNA taught in biology classes. (updated Jun 2018)
West Siberian Rail Museum (south of the city, about 2 km north of Akademgorodok, is the open-air West Siberian Rail Museum.). 250 руб. (updated Sep 2019)

Opera House (Novosibirsk State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater) (In the city centre), ☏ +7 383 222-60-40, office@novat.nsk.ru. Many of the performances are famous works and it is interesting to see the Siberian interpretations. Recommended to purchase tickets in advance.
Since there is plenty of snow in Siberia during the winter, going skiing or ice skating could be a lot of fun in Novosibirsk. There are a lot of ice arenas in the city. Some of them are free of charge, but those don't usually rent skates. The ones that rent skates may be not free of charge. One of the centrally located stadiums is "Spartak".
There are a lot of malls, shops, boutiques and stores in Novosibirsk. They offer a lot of goods from all round the world and you can have a great time while shopping. However, be careful when buying anything there: always check what you buy, before you pay. Sometimes the goods you buy may be produced not by a brand company but by another that has a licence for producing products under the same name. Sometimes the quality of these goods doesn't correspond to the quality of the original brand. This may be especially applied to the European brands. For example, the same scents may have a different aroma in Novosibirsk and somewhere in Europe. It doesn't mean that the goods are of bad quality and you shouldn't shop. But be careful if you want to purchase anything.
You could have a lot of fun if you go to markets like Central Market ("Центральный рынок") or "Baraholka". There you'll see people from around the world selling stuff that is not a known brand but it may have a good quality. Be careful there as well, as you may run into pocket pickers. You may even find some local food there and try some specials. There are a lot of different markets in the city but the most famous are Central Market and Baroholka. You may buy nothing there but what you see, you'll see nowhere in the world. It resembles an Asian market with only difference it's in the Russian way.
