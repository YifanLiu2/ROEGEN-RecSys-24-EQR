Springfield is a city in the center of the state of Illinois. It is the state's capital — not Chicago — and the county seat of Sangamon County. Springfield is best known for its most famous resident, Abraham Lincoln, and there are several historic sites that are dedicated to him.
The city was founded as "Calhoun", after John C. Calhoun. In 1832, the city was renamed to Springfield, derived from Spring Creek, a tributary of the Sangamon River.
In the early 1830s, Abraham Lincoln moved to Springfield and lived here for a long time until he became president in 1861. He and his associates (commonly known as the "Long Nine") were largely responsible for making the city the capital of the state.
Springfield has grown from a small city to one of the largest cities in Illinois, with a population of almost 115,000 people (2020).
As the capital of Illinois, the state of Illinois is one of the city's major employers. Springfield also has a significant regional presence in healthcare and education, as the location of Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Memorial Hospital Springfield, HSHS St. John's Hospital, Springfield Clinic, and the University of Illinois Springfield.

Virtually everyone in Springfield works for the State of Illinois (the local government), the city's largest and most dominant employer.
Springfield is an ideal place for those wishing to get a government job. The prospect of serving a state and making a difference with your work excites many. Government jobs entitle you to several benefits and privileges, much more than what many other companies can offer.
The local government doesn't provide employment visa sponsorships (e.g. H-1B visa status). If you are neither a US citizen or a permanent resident, your chances of finding a job with the local government are next-to impossible.
A valuable resource to check out is this: Careers at State of Illinois.
