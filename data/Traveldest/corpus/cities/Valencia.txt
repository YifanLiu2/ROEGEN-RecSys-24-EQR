Valencia (València in Catalan/Valencian) is a charming old city and the capital of the Valencian Community. With just over 830,000 inhabitants in 2023, it is Spain’s third-largest city and, after Barcelona, the most significant cultural centre along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. It is the capital of the autonomous Valencian Community, and is known for tourism and cuisine. In March visitors flock to the city for the annual UNESCO-listed Falles celebration, but the city is worth visiting at other times of year for its paella, ultramodern architecture, and good beaches.

The Spanish name Valencia is pronounced baˈlenθja (bahl-EHN-thyah), while the Valencian pronunciation of València is vaˈlensia (vahl-EHN-see-ah).
Valentia Edetanorum was established as a Roman colony in the second century BCE. In the early 8th century CE the Moors invaded, and Balansiyya became the capital of the Muslim Taifa of Valencia, thriving as a trading centre for paper, silk, ceramics, glass, and silver. With a brief interlude of Christian control in the 11th century under El Cid, the city remained in Muslim hands until the Christian Reconquista led by King Jaime I of Aragon in 1238, and was incorporated as a kingdom under the Crown of Aragon.
Valencia experienced its golden age in the 15th century, with a growing population and flowering of Valencian culture and the arts. Significant monuments from this period include the cathedral’s Micalet, the UNESCO-listed Llotja de la Seda, and the Torres de Serrano (Serrano Tower). During this period it became one of the most influential cities of the Mediterranean, and helped to fund Christopher Columbus's first voyages to the Americas.
In 1609 the Spanish government ordered the expulsion of all Jews and Moriscos from the kingdom to north Africa. Muslim descendants made up about a third of the population of Valencia and the surrounding region, and their forced removal brought about a major economic downturn, and in some nearby communities, economic collapse. It was more than a century before the city began to recover.
In the 20th century, Valencia was the capital of Republican Spain from 1936 to 1939, and during the Spanish Civil War sustained heavy bombardment by Franco’s forces, both by air and sea. Franco retaliated for Valencia’s Republican past with cultural and ideological repression, and forbade the use of the Valencian language. In 1957 the Túria River overflowed its banks leading to catastrophic flooding of the old city centre with more than 80 dead. The river was consequently diverted to the south of the city, but it was not until the return of democracy that the original abandoned riverbed was finally converted into a park – now one of the city’s most outstanding features.
In the 21st century Valencia has continued to evolve. In 2007 and 2010 the city hosted the America’s Cup, and from 2008 to 2012 hosted the Formula One European Grand Prix. Architecturally, too, the city has changed, most notably with the construction of the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències (City of Arts and Sciences) by internationally-renowned Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava. The 2015 election of a new leftist coalition city council, after decades of control by the conservative Partido Popular (PP), brought renewed focus on expanding and improving existing infrastructure, including adding three new metro lines and expanding the city’s already extensive bicycle path network. This ongoing transformation has turned a once little-considered medium city into a meatier and more interesting destination.

Valencia's official languages are Valencian, which is considered a dialect of Catalan by many linguists, and Spanish. Even though it is similar to the Catalan spoken in Catalonia, Valencians are very particular about their language being referred to as "Valencian", and often find it offensive when people refer to it as "Catalan". In the capital of Valencia, which is the third largest city in Spain, not many people speak Valencian, nor are they offended if addressed in Spanish. However, outside the capital, Valencian is often preferred. As in Barcelona with Catalan, it helps to be sensitive to this language dynamic. However, the linguistic issue is not as controversial as in Barcelona and most people in Valencia speak Spanish as their first and often their only language. Road directional signs are generally bilingual in Spanish and Valencian.
The English-speaking skills of the locals can be hit or miss. Most people under 50 speak some English and some quite a bit, but most would prefer being addressed at first in Spanish or Valencian. French is also spoken or understood by some.
Valencia Airport (VLC IATA) (is in the neighbouring town of Manises, 9 km from the city centre), ☏ +34 961 598 500.

Streets in Valencia have two names, Valencian and Spanish, but most street signs are in Valencian only. Maps may list street names in Valencian or Spanish and rarely both, while addresses may be given in either language, which could create some confusion. Addresses in this guide are generally listed in Valencian.
The city has begun changing some Franco-era street names to those commemorating other figures, especially women. By late 2017, about 50 streets had been renamed, with more planned; online mapping services are largely up-to-date but printed maps will likely not be.
Aside from going to the beach and the City of Arts and Sciences, exploring the hub of the city requires no public transportation. Much of this city can be done walking, stopping for a coffee or a beer, and then walking more, all very leisurely. It's not necessary to have the mindset of mastering a complex public transportation system. However, for longer trips, see below for some pointers.
Travellers visiting for a short period may want to consider purchasing a Valencia Tourist Card, a one-, two- or three-day pass which allows for unlimited travel on all metro and bus lines, including to/from the airport, over a period of 24 hours (€15), 48 hours (€20), or 72 hours (€25). The card also includes free admission to public museums and monuments, discounted admission for other tourist attractions, and additional discounts at some shops and restaurants. The card can be purchased at any tourist office, including at the airport, or purchased online for a discount and picked up on arrival at a tourist office.
For travellers not interested in the package, or staying longer than three days, the rechargeable SUMA 10 card provides a flexible means of getting around. It is valid for both metro and bus travel. This card allows for ten journeys, including transfers begun within 90 minutes of commencing your journey. The included transfers comprise unlimited transfers between metro (or tram) lines, and a single transfer to or from bus lines (i.e. between buses or to/from the metro). Cards are not personalized, and a single card can be used by multiple people (deducting multiple journeys, of course).
The SUMA 10 cards are sold in ticket offices in metro stations, and as of 2022 cost €8 for a single zone. There is an additional fee of €1 for a cardboard cart and €2 for a plastic card. The cards can be recharged at any metro ticket machine. Since 2022, this ticket replaces the previous Bono transbordo and Bonometro cards, so guides still referencing these are outdated.
The public transport network is divided into zones A, B, and C (see map, remodeled in 2022). There is a significant overlap between zones A and B. Most tourist destinations, including the beach, are located in zone A. Zone C consists solely of the airport.
The EMT (bus) website has a very helpful route-plannerdead link, useful for planning journeys not only by bus but also by metro, bicycle, and Valenbisi (see the bicycle section below).
The Metro Valenciadead link consists of nine lines (three of which are tramlines) and connects the suburbs with the city. This metro system is not extensive, but can get you to major points within the city. Maps and timetables can be downloaded here. As of 2018, the one-way fare for a single zone is €. The ticket costs an additional €1 and contains a rechargeable chip.
Make sure to always keep your ticket, as you must present it when getting off as well. If you want to enter the tram, you must buy a ticket from the machine (at each tram stop), and then validate it before you get on.
If you use the metro a lot, you should consider getting a 10-fare SUMA 10 card (see above).
Standard bicycles are permitted during the workweek only on portions of the network which operate above ground. On Saturday, Sunday and holidays they are permitted throughout, while folding bicycles may be transported at any time. No bicycles are permitted at all during Fallas and the night of San Juan. Pets in carriers and guide or personal assistance dogs are also permitted.
Public EMT bus and Valencia Bus Turistic
EMTdead link runs buses to virtually every part of the city, both day and night. A single ticket costs € (no transfers), payable to the bus driver on entry.
For frequent travellers, a the rechargeable Bonobús card is available in kiosks and tobacco shops. It will allow you ten rides for € (as of early 2018). However, the SUMA 10, which is also valid and metro and tram lines, usually is the cheaper and more convenient option (see above). Bonobús cards can be recharged at kiosksdead link or online.
For travellers with smartphones, there is a very helpful official EMT app (iPhone and Android), which has a route planner and a QRT reader.
Most bus stops now have digital displays listing the arrival times for the next bus. At those stops lacking the digital display it is still easy to find out the next arrival times, by using either a QRT reader (like the one built into the EMT app), or by sending a SMS with the unique number of the bus stop to a number displayed next to the posted route plan.

Valencia is essentially flat, and cycling has become a popular way for visitors to get around. The city has established a comprehensive network of dedicated bicycle paths and lanes, and the Turia river park very conveniently cuts across the city, making it possible to get from one end to the other with minimal time in traffic. Drivers are now accustomed to interacting with cyclists in traffic, although pedestrians still occasionally wander into bike paths. Riding on sidewalks without demarcated bicycle paths is not permitted, but this is generally not enforced. At night lights are required, and a helmet and reflective vest are recommended. A bicycle route map can be downloaded heredead link.
The city operates Valenbisi, a popular bicycle sharing program, with 275 stations distributed throughout the city. No reservation is necessary – once you have a Valenbisi card, go to the interactive station terminal, follow the instructions in Valencian, Spanish or English, and choose a bicycle. You can return the bicycle to the same or any other station with available docks.
A short-term subscription costs € and gives you access to unlimited use of the bikes for 7 days; the first half-hour of any journey is free, then € is charged for the first two additional half-hours, with € charged for every additional hour. However, if you park the bicycle in an available dock before the first half-hour is up, you can take out a new bicycle and reset the clock for no additional fees.
Weekly cards can be purchased at any station terminal with a credit card. For periods longer than one week, an annual subscription is necessary and costs €, with reduced tariffs for each additional half-hour. These cards must be purchased online and are sent by mail; however it is possible to bypass this hassle and attach your Valenbisi subscription to a valid Bonometro, Bonobús, or Bono transbordo card – see the website for details.
There are also many bicycle rental shops in town, with most charging around €10-15 a day, depending on season.

Valdés's version is an 18-m-high steel structure covered with 22,000 miniature replicas of the modern version, made of cobalt-blue ceramic by fellow Valencian artist Manuel Martin. (updated Jan 2018)
La Cremà (The Burning)
Go around and see the various fallas, but especially the Secció Especial.
Pay to enter one of the bigger fallas to get a closer look at the individual ninots.
See la mascletà and la nit de foc.
See one of the various parades, especially the ofrenda, and see the Virgen de los Desamparados.
Sample bunyols (Spanish: buñuelos), traditional Valencian ‘donuts’, at one of the many stands on the street. They are only available during the Falles season, and come in several varieties, including chocolate and carabassa (Spanish: calabaza, or pumpkin).
Dance all night long at one of the verbenas (temporary bars and nightclubs) set up on the street.
Most streets in the city centre are closed to everything except pedestrian traffic, and buses running through the centre will be diverted from their usual route.
Most restaurants are very crowded and some are not open. There are usually very long waits and slow service and you should plan for this in your schedule.
Hotels should be booked well in advance.
Many people throw firecrackers near pedestrians and it is possible to be burnt or injured.
Some of the principal fallas, like Nou Campanar, are well outside the city centre and are quite far by foot – it is much easier to take the metro or a bus.
One of Spain’s most spectacular fire festivals, Falles (Spanish: Fallas) can be best characterised as a fire-fireworks-gunpowder street party extravaganza. The festival draws up to two million visitors annually, and is listed as a UNESCO ‘intangible cultural heritage’.
Its origins date to the Middle Ages when the city’s carpenters burned piles of scraps in the streets and plazas near their workshops on 19 March, the eve of the day of San Josep (Spanish: San José, or St. Joseph). In the 18th century, it became customary to fashion these piles of junk with papier mache into human figures and sculptures, called ninots (Valencian for 'dolls'), which were assembled to form larger fallas. Eventually these fallas began to take on a satirical nature.
Around 1870, Falles and Carnival were banned. In response to this, a popular movement arose to revive and preserve these traditions, resulting in a competition in 1885 for the best and most artistic falla. This prompted the development of casal fallers, neighbourhood associations which work year-round raising money and designing their fallas. Today there are about 400 casal fallers which each design an adult falla (falla mayor), and a smaller children’s falla (falla infantil); more than 400 of these fallas are burned on public streets every year. Many fallas reach 25-30 m in height – the best of these are in a special category Secció Especial (Spanish: Sección Especiál) and compete for the top prize, awarded annually by the City Council.
A secondary feature of Falles are daily fireworks events, including gunpowder demonstrations (mascletàs) and large nightly fireworks displays (castillos del fuego). Along with these displays, people set off fireworks all day in the streets, beginning early in the morning and continuing throughout the day, making the city seem like a war zone and making it very difficult to catch any sleep.
Falla de Secció Especial, surrounded by ninots
La Despertà (the 'wake-up call'). Last Sunday of February. Beginning at 07:30, brass bands parade down Carrer de la Pau and Carrer de Sant Vicent Màrtir to the Plaça de l'Ajuntament, followed by falleros and falleras throwing firecrackers.

(updated Aug 2016)
Els Castells (fireworks displays), Passeig de l'Albereda. 15-18 March.

La Cremà (The Burning). 19 March, 22:00-01:00. At the end of a week displaying the 'fallas' are burnt. The fallas infantiles are burned at 22:00, the fallas mayores are burned anytime between midnight and 01:00, and the falla at the Plaça Ayuntamiento is burned last at 01:00. The most impressive to see are the fallas in the Secció Especial, because these are the largest and most dramatic when they burn. These tend to be very crowded and one should arrive early, preferably an hour in advance. A good strategy is to visit a selection of fallas beforehand, and then to choose one to watch burn.

Street procession during Semana Santa Marinera
La Moma i els Momos during Corpus Christi
Semana Santa Marinera (Setmana Santa Marinera / Marinera Holy Week) (Cabanyal). Week before Easter Sunday. As elsewhere in Spain, Valencia celebrates Holy Week with street processions of penitents, organised into fraternities. Although not as well known as the more elaborate processions in Andalusia and Castile and Leon, Valencia's own unique traditions date back to the 15th century and are centred in the neighbourhood of Cabanyal, formerly an independent fishing village. Especially noteworthy are the Good Friday morning processions: two separate fraternities carry a crucifixion effigy to the beach, say a prayer for those who have lost their lives at sea, and place a laurel wreath in the ocean. This practice is unique in Spain and has been designated a 'Fiesta of National Touristic Interest' by the government.The processions, routes, and times may vary from year to year. The Valencia edition of ABC (in Spanish) publishes detailed routes and schedules of each day's events. (updated Apr 2017)

Festa del Corpus Christi (Fiesta de Corpus Christi). 60 days after Easter, usually late May or early June. The city has been celebrating Corpus Christi since the late 13th century, and holding feast day processions since 1355. The main procession, known as the Cavalcada del Convit (Spanish: Cabalgata del Convite) begins at 12:00 and follows an itinerary established in the 18th century, which begins at Carrer de la Batlia, heads south along the western side of the cathedral to the Plaça de la Reina, and then up Carrer d'Avellanes and finally terminates at Plaça de l'Almoina. The parade features several medieval dances and rituals unique to Valencia, the most famous of which is La Moma i els Momos, in which a man in white dress and white-veiled face is surrounded by seven men clothed and veiled in black; the dance represents the fight of virtue against the seven deadly sins. Also noteworthy are the dances of the Nanos (dwarves) and Gegants (giants), in which dancers wear oversized heads and costumes respectively, and La Poalà, in which participants at the end of the route are doused with buckets of water.16:30 marks the start of a second procession, the Pas de les Roques (Spanish: Paso de las Rocas, or Parade of Carriages), the highlight of which are the antique horse-drawn carriages. This parade follows a more circuitous route along Carrer dels Cavallers, Carrer de la Bosseria, Plaça del Mercat, Carrer de Sant Vicent Màrtir, Plaça de la Reina, and Carrer de les Avellanes before finally returning to the cathedral at Plaça de l'Almoina. A third procession begins at 17:30, with the same dancers featured in the 12:00 parade, and following the route of the carriage parade. The final procession, the Solemne Processó (Spanish: Solemne Procesión) begins at 19:00, with participants from parishes and guilds followed by biblical characters and finally by the monstrance.

Els Focs de la Fira (Correfoc: literally 'fire-running'), last Friday before the Battala de Flors; parade begins at 23:00. This energetic festival began in medieval Catalonia and is celebrated throughout the Catalán/Valencian-speaking region. Participants dress as devils with pitchforks and dance through the streets to drums, setting off fireworks and interacting with spectators. The route varies from year to year, but generally is in the area near the North Train Station and the Porta de la Mar. The many flying sparks can burn holes in clothing, so it's a good idea to wear older clothes or not get too close to the action. (updated Jul 2017)
Batalla de Flors (Battala de las Flores / Battle of the Flowers), Passeig de l'Albereda (Paseo de la Alameda). Last Sunday of July: parade begins at 20:00, battle begins at 21:00. The highlight of the July festival, the 'Battle of the Flowers' was first held in 1891. This unusual event begins with a parade of horse-drawn floats, on which are perched falleras in traditional dress. The floats circle around a closed off section of the avenue four times, and prizes are awarded for the most beautiful float. Then the fun begins: mountains of softball-sized marigolds have been distributed around the ring, and seated audience members proceed to pelt the falleras with the flowers, who defend themselves with tennis rackets and hurl flowers back into the audience. After the parade, the general audience is allowed into the ring, and a general melee begins. €30 (ringside seats purchased in advance), free (general audience). (updated Jul 2017)
Interior of the Palau de la Generalitat, open to the public during Nou d’Octubre

During this same weekend nine governmental palaces which are ordinarily closed to the public are opened for general visitation (Sa and Su 10:00-20:00, free admission). Of these the 15th-century Gothic  Palau de la Generalitat (Palacio de la Generalidad / Palace of the General Assembly) is the most remarkable, and is well worth the long queue to see the well-preserved interior.Formal festivities commence at midnight on 8 October with a fireworks display from the Túria River park by the Pont de l'Exposició (by Alameda metro station). At noon on the following day a formal procession carries the Valencian flag from the Ayuntamiento (City Hall) to the  Jardí del Parterre (Parque del Parterre / Parterre Park), where a wreath is laid before the equestrian statue of King James.The highlight of the 9th itself is the parade of Moros i Cristians (Spanish: Moros y Cristianos), which commences at  Plaça d'Alfons el Magnànim and proceeds down Carrer de la Pau and Carrer de Sant Vicent, finally terminating at Plaça de l’Ajuntament. The parade starts at 18:30 but it is best to find a spot about a half-hour before the parade begins.The 9th of October is also the day of St. Dionysius, which for Valencians is similar to Valentine's Day. In a tradition dating to the 18th century, it is customary for men to give their sweethearts a mocadorà – a small bundle of marzipan treats shaped like fruits and wrapped in a handkerchief. Beginning a week before the 9th, these can be purchased at pastry shops and even some supermarkets. (updated Oct 2017)

There are two city beaches, and several major beaches outside of Valencia.
Platja del Les Arenes (Platja del Cabanyal / Playa de las Arenas), just north of the port, has a pleasant promenade with a number of traditional (and expensive) restaurants, bars, and ice cream shops. The more northern  Platja de Malvarrosa begins where the promenade ends, and is the setting for volleyball tournaments, kite festivals, and windsurfing. In the summer both beaches have lifeguards and first aid stations, toilets, and snack vendors, and are very crowded especially in the afternoons. To get there, take the metro or tram to Eugenia Vines or Arenas station, or take the metro to Maritim Serreria and continue with the tram to Neptu (all on one ticket).
To the north of and immediately adjoining Malvarossa is  Platja de la Patacona (Playa de la Patacona), which, although part of the municipality of Alboraya, is easily accessible from Valencia by public transport or foot. This beach is somewhat less crowded, and is also a good place to sample horchata, as Alboraya is a major producer of chufa, a key ingredient of the drink.
The beaches south of Valencia port are all part of Albufera Natural Park. They are generally well-maintained and far less crowded than the urban beaches, and easily reachable by public transport.
Recortes are a nonviolent alternative to bullfighting
Bullfighting (corrida de toros). Bullfights are staged in Valencia only during three short seasons, including Falles (mid-March), the Fira de Juliol (July Festival), and the Nou d’Octubre (Valencian National Day in October).If you are put off by bullfighting, consider attending a recortes competition, an ancient nonviolent alternative practiced only in the Valencian Community, Navarra, La Rioja, and northern Castile-La Mancha. Recortadores leap, perform backflips, and occasionally pole-vault over charging bulls. The bulls are unharmed and not killed afterward, but it is very dangerous for the athletes, who are often matadors-in-training. While these events are not as well-attended as bullfights, popularity is growing. Typically there is one recortes event during each bullfighting season. Bullfights €12-120, recortes €10.

To recognize 'real' local paella from tourist junk, avoid any places with large paella pictures on the door step. This is a sure sign for frozen/microwaved paella.
When possible, make reservations or arrive early (no later than 14:00), especially on Sunday, because these restaurants fill up quite quickly on the weekend.
Paella is typically eaten at mid-day (between 14:00-17:00), so many restaurants do not serve it at dinner. Be careful of those that do as this is not the custom here and the quality of the paella may be poor.
The paella pan is of a size that almost all restaurants require a minimum of two servings for an order. Restaurants that allow ordering one order are likely serving frozen paella.
Paella. There are several versions of this tasteful rice dish: paella valenciana, with meat (chicken and/or rabbit usually), paella de marisco, with fish or seafood, or even paella mixta, with meat and fish at the same time, the least popular among locals. It is very difficult to say which is the 'real' paella, as every person has his/her own version (though no paella that deserves this name contains sausage, ham or meat broth, for instance). If you want to eat an authentic paella, try it at the Malvarrosa beach area; you will find there are several good restaurants. The authentic Valencian paella is made only with fresh ingredients, in a special iron pan and using a fire made with wood (not gas or electricity). Vegetarian paella is called paella vegetal or paella de verduras. Authentic paella can be rather dry, it's not a soup and shouldn't look like gumbo. Don't be shy about scraping the caramelized rice from the bottom of the pan, it's delicious! (updated Jun 2017)
Arròs a banda (arroz a banda). A side dish of rice cooked in fish stock, usually served with alioli. (updated Jun 2017)
Arròs negre (arroz negro). Also cooked in fish stock, this rice dish is black because it contains squid ink, as well as squid or cuttlefish, peppers, and paprika. (updated Jun 2017)
Fideuà. This paella-like dish, with short noodles and fish, was invented in Gandía and can be usually found in paella restaurants. It deserves a try too. (updated Jun 2017)
All i pebre. A stew made of eel, a snake like fish typical from the Albufera, a lagoon near Valencia. You can drive to El Palmar and taste it there. Delicious, but a very special taste. You can find good paella, and other traditional dishes at the restaurants there too. (updated Jun 2017)
Llet merengada (leche merengada). A kind of milk-based soft ice cream with a cinnamon-lemon taste. (updated Jun 2017)
Bunyols (buñuelos). Fried doughnuts, sometimes round shaped, sometimes like rings. Widely available only during March during the Falles celebration. Dip them in hot chocolate. Sometimes they are too oily, so don't eat a lot of them or you will not be hungry again for several hours. If you can choose the carabasa (pumpkin) version, you should try it. They are generally tastier. (updated Jun 2017)

The Marina Beach Club – beach club by day, party central by night
L'Umbracle Terraza in the City of Arts and Sciences
Barrio del Carmen is a major nightlife destination in Valencia. There are numerous restaurants, bars, and dance joints, which tend to cater to a youngish crowd, in particular along Carrer dels Cavallers (Calle Caballeros).

Additionally there is typical Spanish night-life feeling on the plaza. Different kind of people enjoying the mild Mediterranean clime to sit outside talking, drinking and playing guitar often until the sunrise. Other centres of are night-life are  Plaça de Cánovas del Castillo (more upscale), along Carrer de Joan Llorenç (young also, less "alternative"), around the main campus of the University of Valencia (for students), and increasingly in the area near the beach and port.
If you feel like dancing there are four famous pubs where especially at the weekends a lot young people can be found.

Valencia is quite possibly among the safest cities in Spain and Europe. As with Madrid and Barcelona, streets are filled with people at all times, even deep into the night. Valencia also has a decent police presence.
The only neighborhoods that may warrant extra precaution are Ciutat Jardí, El Cabanyal, and Aiora, in the east of the city. They are mostly deserted at night, but muggings are not unheard of.
The city's railway stations and certain metro stations might attract beggars and drunkards, but simply saying no will be enough.
The Falles celebrations attract thousands of people every year. Watch out for pickpockets.

Rice is cultivated in the surrounding area of the lake. The Albufera also hosts many interesting varieties of migratory birds. The village of El Palmar is also a good place, if not the best, to try some paella or other local dishes.
Manises – 15 km northwest of Valencia, it is not only the site of Valencia's airport, but is also an important centre for pottery. The city can be easily reached by Valencia's metro lines 3 and 5.
Paterna – This bedroom community 5 km to the northwest is known for its cave dwellings, Moorish tower, and Moors and Christians Festival.
El Puig – 15 km north of Valencia, this village is best known for its impressive Gothic monastery, and is easily visited as a half-day trip from the city.

Rent a car and do a day trip to any number of picturesque villages or small cities in the region, including Chulilla, Sot de Chera, Xàtiva, and Sagunto, among others.
La Tomatina, hosted by nearby Buñol on the last Wednesday of August. A festival that involves thousands of participants throwing ripe tomatoes at each other. Make sure you wear clothes that you can throw out after wards, as it gets very messy.
Cullera, is the nearest beach resort from the city, apart from the more aimed at locals Pobla de Farnals, and worth a day visit from Valencia if you have time. It is settled down an isolated mountain (with a big white sign saying "Cullera" on it) beside a beautiful bay. It has crowded and quiet beaches. The most quiet ones are along the lighthouse road. There is also a naturist beach right North of Cullera, in Playa del Dossel, with a tricky road to access it. There is a castle on top of the mountain from which to enjoy stunning views.
Gandia, 65 km south of Valencia and easily accessible by regional train, is the historical capital of the ancient Dukedom of Gandia, origin of the infamous Borgia (Borja) family, whose Ducal Palace is worth the visit, and birthplace of fideuà.
Montanejos, with its scenic mountains, gorges, and hot springs.
