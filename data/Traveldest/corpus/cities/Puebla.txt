Puebla is a city in Mexico. It is in the Puebla Valley, surrounded by volcanoes and snow-capped mountains, slightly over 110 km (68 miles) south-east of Mexico City. It has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its architecture. Puebla is also considered to be the "cradle of Mexican Baroque" in architecture and in the decorative arts, and one of the five most important colonial cities in Mexico.

The city of Puebla is the fourth largest city in Mexico with  million inhabitants (2020), with  million in the metro area. It is the capital of the State of Puebla. It was founded on April 16, 1531 as "La Puebla de los Ángeles". It was the first city in central Mexico founded by the Spanish conquistadors that was not built upon the ruins of a conquered Amerindian settlement. Its strategic location, halfway between the port of Veracruz and Mexico City, made it the second most important city during the colonial period. During the 17th century, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz lived in the city until her confrontation with the Bishop of Puebla.
The historical and cultural value of Puebla's architecture is a major reason the city was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Various styles and techniques such as Baroque, Renaissance and Classic are represented here in over 5,000 buildings included in the catalogue. The historic center is filled with churches, monasteries, mansions and the like, mostly done in gray cantera stone, red brick and decorated with multicolored tiles.
The city’s main claim to fame, however, is Cinco de Mayo, a festival commemorating the May 5, 1862 defeat of a French expeditionary army by Mexican general Ignacio Zaragoza. It was after this battle that the name of the city was changed to "Heróica Puebla de Zaragoza". The forts where the battle took place are a major tourist attraction of the city and the site of an annual month-long carnival marking the anniversary of the battle. However, despite the quite extensive St. Patrick's Day style festivities for Cinco de Mayo in the US, outside the area around Puebla, Cinco de Mayo is a minor festive day in Mexico, surpassed by independence day. The city is also famous for its cuisine, being said it is this city where mole — a famous Mexican spicy thick sauce — was invented.
A ride between Mexico City and Puebla is around M$120 (Nov 2021) with Blablacar.
Traveling to Puebla from Mexico City is fairly straightforward and can be accomplished via bus. There are continual bus services between Mexico City and Puebla throughout the day and night both from the TAPO terminal (also known as Terminal Oriente, located beside the San Lázaro Metro station) and from Benito Juarez International Airport.
A one-way ticket on Estrella Roja (ER) or ADO from the TAPO usually runs about M$190 (Jan 2019) for regular non-stop service; a first class ticket ("Pullman Primera Clase" service) on Estrella Roja costs M$212 (Jan 2019). (The extra M$22 or so are worth it: the first class seat fewer people, thus less crowded, more space, more comfortable.) Buses leave for Puebla approximately every half hour from both locations. Travel time from TAPO to Puebla's CAPU is usually around 2 hours, but this time may vary by up to a full hour depending on Mexico City traffic conditions at that time of day.
There are two bus terminals in Puebla: the Centro de Autobuses Puebla (CAPU), which is the main bus terminal, and the neighboring CAP, a smaller secondary terminal.
Taking a city bus from CAPU to the historic center and further: Cross the bridge over the Blvrd Nte. In front of the Domino's depart  city buses to the center. After crossing the bridge there is a tasty taco stall: Two for M$16 (Nov 2021).
For going to the center, get a bus number 44. Exit the bus as soon as it hits Av. 10 Ote and walk the rest (5 blocks to Zocalo).

Puebla Airport (PBC IATA Hermanos Serdán International Airport). Due to the closeness of Benito Juarez Airport, the airport offers few international routes (all of them to the US) and a handful of domestic routes. That said, the airport is smaller and thus easier to navigate and you might net cheaper offers than at MEX.

For finding city bus connections, Moovit is somewhat better than Google Maps as of Nov 2021. Moovit shows you the number of the bus line. In the app you can filter for only showing you direct connections. The general fare is M$ (Nov 2021), paid in cash. There is no public transport card. (Safety note about buses: they are generally safe, but they tend to carry pickpockets, especially when crowded. Always have a hand over any bags or backpacks that you have.) The buses generally run from about 07:00 to 22:00.
Uber, Cabify and Didi are available.
Taxis are almost always safe. They tend to run between M$60-120 (Sept 2021) for a ride. Negotiating a fare before entering a taxi is normal as the taxis do not carry meters in Puebla. If the driver does not offer you a fare that you like, you can wave them off and wait for the next taxi.

Because of the altitude tours can be quite exhausting. This can cause problems for travelers. The mild climate may also lead you to underestimate the strength of the sun. Sunburn and sunstroke are a threat, so it is vital to wear sunscreen/sunblock and drink plenty of bottled water.
At mealtimes, exercise extreme caution with salads and fruit, or avoid them altogether. If you must eat fruit, peel the skin, as washing is not enough. Salads may be tempting, but enjoyment may be short-lived! For all cases of diarrhea take appropriate drugs and seek medical advice.
You will rarely see locals wearing shorts, doing so will identify you as a tourist. Jeans are generally acceptable, except perhaps in some of the nicer restaurants.
If you are staying in a hotel and you want to take a taxi, someone working the front desk will most likely be able to call and arrange for a cab to pick you up, or you can hail one off the street if you speak enough Spanish to be able to negotiate the price with the driver. In Puebla, there are a multitude of taxis but your best bet will be a radio taxi.
The radio taxis are the best cabs in appearance and since they are registered they are also the safest, but they tend to charge more: about 10 pesos more than if you hail one on the street. If you run into a friendly cab driver, it is a good idea to get his cell phone number, so you can call whenever you need safe transport.
