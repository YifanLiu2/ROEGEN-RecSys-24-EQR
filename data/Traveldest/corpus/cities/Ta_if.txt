Ta'if (pronounced "Taayef", also written as "Taif") is a city in the Mecca province of Saudi Arabia. With a population of 690,000 people (2020 estimate), it is the sixth most populous city in Saudi Arabia.
The city is at an elevation of 1,879 m (6,165 ft) and is therefore much cooler than any of the nearby larger cities: Mecca, Medina and Jeddah. Ta'if is a popular tourist destination both among Saudis and among the fairly large expatriate community in Jeddah. The nearby upmarket resort town of Al Hada is another popular destination.
Ta'if literally means 'circulated' or 'encircled' in Arabic. It is said that the name of the city comes from a wall that was built around the city in pre-Islamic times. Certainly the city existed in those times, before the 7th century CE.
There's no direct mention of Ta'if in the Qu'ran, but Sura 43:31 mentions two cities which scholars believe were Mecca and Ta'if. Ta'if does play a role in other Islamic writings. After Khadija, Muhammad's first wife. died in 619 CE, he made his way to Ta'if and tried to spread Islam in the city, but was rudely rejected by the city's chiefs, was pelted with rocks and stones, and was chased out of the city. Bloodied and seriously wounded, he was taken in by a gardener who nursed him back to health. After recovering, Muhammad realised he could no longer enter Mecca because his uncle, Abu Thalib, was no longer there to protect him.
In the years to follow, various battles left the city completely isolated and eventually, the inhabitants of the city were peacefully converted to Islam.
The Ottoman Empire dominated the city for several hundred years until World War I when the Hashemites (the family who traditionally ruled Mecca) led an Arab revolt against them.
In the 1920s, Ta'if was incorporated into Saudi Arabia by the ibn Saud family after a short battle. This was part of the process of founding modern-day Saudi Arabia. At the time Ta'if was a relatively small, unknown city. In the years to follow, the Saudi government has rapidly developed the city, and it is now a popular tourist destination among the Saudis.
In the 1930s, a treaty that established the boundary lines between Saudi Arabia and Yemen was signed here.

Note: Do not attempt travel to Ta'if via Mecca if you're a non-Muslim; under Saudi law non-Muslims are strictly forbidden to enter that city.
Given Ta'if's highly mountainous geography, almost no highways pass through the city. The only exception is Highway 15, which connects Ta'if to Mecca. Approaching Ta'if, the scenery along it is breathtaking.

Most people drive to Ta'if from Jeddah.
One route is Highway 40 to Mecca, then Highway 15. The journey should take you two hours or a bit more depending on traffic conditions; expect Highway 40 to be completely jammed and packed during the Hajj. Bear in mind that this path will take through Mecca and under Saudi law, non-Muslims are not permitted to enter Mecca.
The usual route from Jeddah for non-Muslims starts along highway 40. A few miles outside of Mecca, there is a cutoff referred to as the "Christian bypass", route 298. It is well marked and a police checkpoint to turn non-Muslims away from the holy city is visible a bit beyond it. Turn along this highway to connect to Highway 15 and reach Taif. Time on this route might be about three hours.
If you're not into long road trips, another convenient way to enter the city is by plane. If flying from Jeddah, you'll easily reach the city in less than 45 minutes. If coming from Riyadh, you'll reach the city in less than 90 minutes.
