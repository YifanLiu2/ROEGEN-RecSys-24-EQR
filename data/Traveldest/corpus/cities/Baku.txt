Baku (Azeri: Bakı) is the capital of Azerbaijan and is the largest city in the Caucasus. Baku's Old Town has UNESCO World Heritage status. Many cultures and architectural styles mix in Baku, in particular Turkish-Islamic elements meet strong Western European and Russian-Eastern European influences. With 92 ft below sea level, Baku is the lowest-lying capital city in the world.
Baku is on the coast of the Caspian Sea on the southern coast of the Absheron Peninsula. There are three major divisions in Baku: İçəri Şəhər (the Old Town), the Soviet-built city, and the newest part of the city. The population in 2020 was  million.
The city of Baku is on the semi-arid and dusty Absheron peninsula. The center of Baku is a patch of green in a largely brown area because of the many liters of water that is piped daily to the city. The city has a metro, a well-developed bus and minibus network, and a large area for walking, including the Inner Walled City, The Boluvar, and Fountain Square.
Reading the book Ali and Nino is a good way to get into the mood.
A curious fact about Baku is that its average year-round temperature (°C/°F) matches the average temperature of the entire landmass of the earth to within a tenth of degree. Summers are hot and humid, winters cool, wet and breezy. However, seasonal temperature variations are less than in many continental regions at this latitude (about 40 degrees north) owing to the presence of the Caspian Sea.
Heydar Aliyev International Airport (GYD IATA former Bina International Airport, Azerbaijani: Heydər Əliyev adına beynəlxalq hava limanı), Khazar, Absheron peninsula (Xəzər, Abşeron yarımadası) (25 km (15 mi) from Baku city center), ☏ +994 12 497 2727. It is served by major airlines including Aeroflot, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways, and many smaller airlines. The least expensive way to get to Baku from Europe is via Aeroflot, with inexpensive flights from Moscow daily. Air Baltic also offers flights with good prices from Riga. This is the hub for Azerbaijan Airlines & Silk Way Airlines.
By bus – T1 Airport Express runs between the airport and the railway station (the bus waits across the street from the station) with an intermediate stop at Koroglu metro station. The ride costs  manat, payable by BakiKart (the same one used in the metro). The bus runs every 30 minutes. Additionally, N16 runs between the airport and Samed Vurgun Park, in the heart of Baku. The trip costs 1 manat and takes approximately 40–60 min. Service runs every 30 minutes beginning from early in the morning until late night. The bus leaves outside the airport building, across the parking area. The service terminates at  Samed Vurgun's Park on 28 May Street.
By minibus – No. 135 runs between the airport traffic circle (15-min walk from the airport) and the 28 May Metro Station. The journey takes an hour and costs  manat.
By taxi – Getting a smooth ride from the airport to town can be a hassle. The lowest price you can get for a taxi to the center should be around 15 manat (old Lada, unmarked taxi). Only one taxi company is permitted to do business at the airport. This monopoly drives up the price to nearly 50 manat and many times it leaves you with no other options, especially when arriving at late hours. Police occasionally force out all cab drivers trying to do business on the fringes of the airport, leaving you stuck with a high fare. Taxis don't have meters so you must negotiate in advance. If you are not finding a reasonable price, go out of the airport, past the taxi stand, and ask the cabbies at the far end of the parking lot. Be cautious since the majority of Baku cabs are unmarked. Don't let the cab driver renegotiate the price with you. It is a common trick to ask for much more on arrival to your destination. You are not obligated to pay what they demand. For 5 manat you can take a cab from the airport to Metro Azizbeyov. From there it's 4–6 stations to the city center, but only 06:00–00:00.

Buying a train ticket happens the old-fashioned way with separate windows for buying a ticket and paying for it. But don't worry, most station staff understand English and are willing to help. (updated Mar 2017)

The port consists of the Main Cargo Terminal, Dubendy Oil Terminal, Ferry Terminal, and Passenger Terminal. Ferries operate between Baku and Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan (irregularly, approximately every 7–10 days), and Turkmenbashi, Turkmenistan (steerage bed, US$50, 2-day trip, bring food). Make sure you have appropriate visas before embarking, if necessary.
There are pedestrian alleys and streets around the Fountain Square, the seafront, and the old town. You can walk to other places, too, but you might have to cross busy streets since there aren't always pedestrian tunnels available. The zebra crossings work with an "I'm feeling lucky" principle and aren't usually exactly safe, especially at night. At night, use your phone screen (not your flashlight) to indicate to the approaching cars that you are crossing the street, and follow other people.
Baku is a great town to get around in by bicycle. Except for the up-town, the city, including old town (İçəri Şəhər) and down-town is fairly flat, and though there are some streets that are dangerous to ride, there is almost always a safe, fast route to your destination.
While there are no separate bike lanes on the streets, and cars and cyclists often share narrow streets of Baku, the city is very bike-friendly. While cycling on the street, be very careful watch out for other cyclists, always keep closer to foot-walk side of the street, and show other traffic where you are going (e.g., by holding out your hand) in order to avoid accidents and smoothen the traffic flow.
MyBike, Asef Zeynalli Street, Ichari Shahar. A bicycle rental shop. Make sure to get a good lock (or two), and to use it. If you want to know the best routes, you should get a copy of the beautifully designed Baku by Bike plan, which is available at all bike rental points of MyBike. A passport or identity card must be shown and a refundable deposit is required. While this service is quite convenient, be sure to bring ID or passport and contact information, including hotel phone number, to speed up the paperwork. 10-20 manat per day.
Buses and minibuses cost  manat per person and can take you to almost any place within Baku. Destinations are usually posted on the front and the right side of the bus.
Newer buses (the red ones) only accept electronic cash in the form of metro cards, available at any metro station. Some larger bus stations have machines to top-up cards, but not to buy new ones.
There are some buses which cost  manat, e.g. the one to Bibi Heybət Mosque in the south. This makes charging disposable electronic cards a challenge: if you buy the single use tickets, they might not be sufficient if you just load them with  manat, thinking of going forth and back once.
The metro goes many places throughout Baku and it costs only  manat. It is the least expensive way to get around Baku besides walking. Ask a cashier or attendant. You must obtain a Bakı Metropiliten Kart (2 manat refundable deposit) and load it like a normal metro pass. You can also buy a limited card ( manat) with 1, 2, 3, or 4 trips (the last one costing 1 manat). More than one person may use the same card. Alternatively, you can use a Azerbaycan Sosial Kartı like the ones on some Azerbaijani ATM cards. The metro workers will be more than happy to help if spoken to in either Azeri or Russian, and some may understand English.
You can buy a metro card at the metro station and some bus stops from a ticket machine. You can change the language of the machine to English.
It runs from 06:00 until 24:00 and gets very crowded in rush hours.
Be careful when transferring trains at the transfer stations (28 May and Jafar Jabbarli Cəfər Cabbarlı) as the signage is difficult to spot.
There have been reports of people being arrested while taking photographs of the metro station. There are clear signage on the stations which prohibits taking photos, on the outside it is ok.
The Avtovaghzal metro station is worth seeing from the outside as it is a giant glass pyramid.
The Baku electric train runs through several parts of Baku and the surrounding area including Sumqait. 1 manat.
The Baku funicular is a great way of getting to the Viewpoint and Flame Towers. It is not too expensive.
London taxi cabs have been introduced in Baku, and travel fees are  manat per km. Other vehicles however also are available. A taxi costs 4-10 manat for trips within the center of Baku. It's important to agree on the price of the fare before beginning the trip or you may be overcharged.
Most taxi drivers simply double the price for tourists. So, halving it while negotiating and doing the walk-away trick, should reveal the genuine price. Doubling a price is seemingly much easier than tripling it. Otherwise, just use Bolt (a taxi app for your mobile) as indicator or/and negotiator.
Going out of Baku with a taxi, rely on Google Maps and direct the driver. Many driver seem to know just one way in and out to sights outside of Baku, but not efficient ways between them.

The internal space available in the tower is said to be adequate to accommodate 200 people. A long, solid projection to the main tower faces east, which is oriented towards sunrise pointing to the equinoxes, which has led to the conclusion that it was built as an astronomical tower; while the buttress faces east, the door access to the tower faces southeast. Unfortunately, there is no good view from the top, because it is barred by a glass wall, keeping your distance from the edge. Foreigners 15 manat, locals 2 manat. (updated Oct 2019)

As Azal seems to be in a permanent state of flux as to where their offices are located, pop into a travel agent and ask about tickets very carefully before buying anything. In some cases, like Naxcevan or last-minute flights, you will absolutely have to go the ever-moving central office during a few random opening times in order to get your tickets processed. One travel agent who can guide you buy phone is reachable at +994 55 4201220 or +99412 5551320 or 5981619.
Baku is considered a safe city, nevertheless common sense is useful as in all other big cities. Homeless people do not harass or attack people and are safe to be around. The biggest problem in Baku is driving. Many drivers do not obey rules and speed.
The security is rather high, with regular security checks at some attractions and metro stations. The metro has police guarding both ends of the escalators.
Since the Karabakh conflict re-ignited in September 2020, security has been further tightened.
You must speak in Azeri, Turkish or Russian to communicate your needs. It would be a good idea to memorize key phrases before coming to Azerbaijan - see the Talk section for phrasebooks. The police are friendly and try to be helpful. Be nice and understanding and don't get frustrated if you don't understand each other immediately. Write down your phone's IMEI code in case it gets lost so it is easier for the police to find.
The roads can be treacherous at night due to unseen potholes and dimly lit cars. Most areas in and near the downtown are safe. There are some underpasses under particularly busy roads (some with escalators), and some zebra crossings and traffic lights. Watch out for traffic police if otherwise crossing a busy road, they may try to fine you 20 manat for a traffic offence (even though the locals do it constantly).

Nabran – Relax by the Caspian on the beach or in a resort. Azerbaijan's biggest tourist destination for international travellers and a coastal city close to Xachmaz.
Quba – Its urban suburb is home to the largest Azerbaijani Jewish community in the mountains and is considered one of the largest Jewish communities in the former Soviet Union.
Khinalug (Xinaliq) – A scenic, remote and ancient mountain village, and the mountain of the same name nearby. Once a centre of Zoroastrianism; today the few inhabitants are an ethnic isolate believed to be descendants of the Caucasus Albanians (unrelated to modern-day Albanians of Albania).
Sheki – A 7-hour bus ride to the northwest. A beautiful city in the Caucasus mountains with much to see and do. It has one of the largest densities of cultural resources and monuments that span 2,700 years of Azerbaijani history.
Lahich – A cozy and remote highland village, on the way to Sheki. Famous for its copper work.
Shamakhi – The former capital of the medieval state of Shirvan. Famous for its traditional dancers, Şamaxı dancers, and its impressive mosque. An ancient history and once one of the key cities along the Silk Road.
Naftalan – A well-known petroleum spa resort, the centre of medical tourism in Azerbaijan. Go and enjoy the oil baths.
Ganja – One of the oldest cities in the Caucasus.
Nakhchivan (region) – The Baku Airport is one of the few in the world offering flights to Nakhchivan and travelers heading that way should book a flight from here.
Georgia – There are direct buses and trains into Tbilisi from Baku.
Iran – Buses take international travellers onwards from Baku there.
Turkmenistan – A ferry departs daily from Baku across the Caspian Sea to Turkmenbashi. This ferry has become something of a sleeper hit with backpackers on the Silk Road, but is very uncomfortable and should only be taken by adventure-seekers.
Kazakhstan – A similar ferry (often the Merkury-1 or the Professor Gul) leaves from "Baku International Port" in Alat, 60 km south of Baku (the ferry previously left from Baku harbour proper until late 2018). The cabins are basic but clean and (fairly good) food is served on board, three square meals a day. It takes approximately 30 hours, and arrives at the port of Kuryk in Kazakhstan (be warned! The port is in the middle of nowhere and the cabbies there are hustlers. Best to try to hitchhike a truck out of the port, many of the drivers are friendly Ukrainians, to avoid US$30 or more for a taxi). US$70 4-person cabin, US$80 2-person. Cars, motorbikes and bicycles also taken.
