Puerto Vallarta, colloquially known as Vallarta, is a city on Mexico's Pacific Coast. While it is established as a modern resort town, the Old Town (the Zona Romantica district) south of the River Cuale is more of a traditional Mexican city.
Around the Bay, beautiful beaches, lush jungles, and sparkling waterfalls offer many opportunities for the adventurous, while five-star resorts, world-class shopping, and gourmet restaurants satisfy even the most sophisticated traveler. Stretching from the south end of Old Town to central downtown, a newly extended and refurbished boardwalk along the ocean, called the Malecon, passes by any number of shops, restaurants, and hotels, and often plays host to mimes, breakdancers, clowns and artists.
The residents are friendly and generally willing to help with directions and other requests. Puerto Vallarta also has gained a reputation as one of the few cities in Latin America that enthusiastically welcomes LGBT tourism. The area in and around the Zona Romantica is particularly known for having many hotels, bars, shops and restaurants that cater to gay tourists. There is also an annual Pride festival held in May.
English is widely spoken, and as a tourist destination, prices are higher than many other places in Mexico. Puerto Vallarta is very crowded at holidays, if you're planning a visit to Mexico that coincides with a major holiday, consider visiting Mexico City or Guadalajara instead. The cities empty out as Mexicans and tourists flood to the beaches.
To the north, the hills give way a little. Here you will find mile-long stretches of golden sand beaches, rich plantations of papaya and mango and, tucked back along tumbling rivers and streams, small villages where life seems to move at a different pace. There are many different ways to explore the Bay.
To the south, the hills cascade towards the sea creating a rich palette that mixes the vivid green foliage with the deep blues of the water. At their feet nestle secluded coves and small fishing villages, many of which are still accessible only by sea.
To the east, the jungle clad Sierra Madre Mountains, which quickly rise to over 8,000 ft (2,400 m), encircle and protect the town from the winds and regulate the semi-tropical and humid weather.
And, to the west, the Bay of Banderas is home to a wide variety of aquatic life. Humpback whales come here to mate every year from December to March, and sea turtles nest on the beaches from May to October. Schools of dolphins and giant manta rays also inhabit these waters. The Bay and the Marietas Islands offer an amazing kaleidoscope of tropical fish, attracting snorkelers, scuba divers and sport fishermen alike.

Upon exiting from customs, the next two rooms outside of customs are plagued by timeshare hucksters. They will offer to arrange a cab ride, arrange for a tour, offer free meals, cash etc for you in an effort to rope you into a high pressure timeshare sales presentation. Unless you are looking to buy timeshare or to burn hours of vacation time in timeshare sales presentations, do not engage in conversation with anyone in the next two rooms. Walk quickly through the next two rooms - the ones housing the hucksters - continue walking past the rope-line out to the main arrivals area.
The  Uber pickup is on the opposite side of the main road from the airport terminal under the pedestrian bridge.
Look for the official taxi kiosk or car rental desks out in the main airport arrivals hall. You can purchase your taxi trip here. All other offers of cab rides you will receive between customs and the kiosk will be from the timeshare hucksters. Ignore every one of them. The bad experience of those taken in can ruin one's first hours in PVR, and that would be a shame. Or hire private transportation.
From the airport, there are two types of taxis available to get you to where you are going. The white federal taxis are available immediately upon exiting the airport but are more expensive. Cross the pedestrian bridge over the highway for the cheaper yellow taxis that are more common in other parts of the city.
If you've packed lightly you can take the city buses into town. Go out the doors and turn left towards the main road next to the building. Turn left again at the corner of the building and go through a small taxi and shuttle parking lot towards the pedestrian bridge. Under the pedestrian overpass is the  bus stop to the center. Wait for a bus (5 minutes or so) marked "Centro" (but not marked Pitillal or Bobadilla), wave it down, pay your M$10 (Nov 2021), and enjoy the ride. The bus stops all throughout the town. It takes about 20 to 30 minutes for the bus to get to its farthest southerly stop. You need exact change for the bus, as you throw the coins into a box as of November 2021. By taking the city bus you've just saved US$20!
If going towards central bus station, Nueva Vallarta, Bucerias, Sayulita or anywhere north, go up to the pedestrian bridge and walk over to the other side of the road. The bus stop for buses going north is under the pedestrian bridge at the opposite side of the road and also where to get off if coming back to the airport from town.
For going to the bus station take the northbound bus going towards "Ixtapa" or "Juntas" and get off Las Palmas which is the Cerveza Corona building at Km 9 and walk back two blocks along La Palmas or take the "Victoria Guadalupe" bus which makes the turn towards the actual bus station in Colonia Victoria Guadalupe.
From the airport by private transportation
If you are visiting Puerto Vallarta, you should consider private pre-arranged transportation directly from your airport to your hotel. This transportation can be arranged by contacting a company by phone or booking online. This will save you time and money. There are several companies that can take you anywhere in Puerto Vallarta and surrounds.

Hotels may provide a price list for cabs. Hotels will also offer (expensive) transport from airport to hotel, but it is much better to take a taxi. If you've booked with a travel agency, they will most likely provide you with transportation to and from the airport.
Be prepared for fast speeds, as the cab drivers have schedules to adhere to. Many of the cabs do not have working seatbelts or speedometers as well. Taxi drivers tend to gather at the intersection close to the liquor outlet in the Centro District. They are friendly and you can negotiate trips outside of Puerto Vallarta at a very reasonable cost on slow days. They will wait for you while you dine or shop as well as photograph you and your mates. Tip only if the taxi driver did something above and beyond normal transportation (e.g., helped with bags, waited while running an errand).
To find a connection, Moovit and Google Maps cover the city. Bus trips cost M$10 (Nov 2021) that you pay to the bus driver when you get in. For that fare you can go through the whole city on one bus. In the city buses you don't get change. If paying for two persons with a M$20 bill, you can fold it and push it through the coin slot inside the bus. Make sure to keep the ticket you are provided by the driver in case an inspector gets on the bus, both for your sake and the driver's sake.
You can only enter and exit at a bus stop, which are shown for example in Google Maps; additionally you can have a look where other people wait for the bus on the sidewalk. You need to flag down a bus in order to stop. Buses run quite frequently. Look for your travel location on the bus windshield. Buses at peak hours tend to get crowded and can get hot, so be ready for that. Some buses have air-conditioning. If you are a man, be ready to give up your seat to women if the bus becomes crowded.
The buses are very reliable and quite handy to get to places like Pitillal (the rapidly growing suburb to the northeast) and Ixtapa (including the nearby U of Guadalajara campus with its gallery and crocodile farm). They are also useful for traveling from the hotel zone and marina area to the downtown or old town areas. Any bus marked "Centro" will pass through both. Buses marked Tunel will skip downtown and head directly to the old town/Zona Romantica via the tunnel bypass.
Be very careful if you choose to drive in Puerto Vallarta. The police seem to pull tourists over at the drop of a hat during spring break. When you pick up a rental, check that all the lights work. Also when you are pulled over for a light violation, do not be surprised if the police holds out an open palmed hand, while holding your driver’s license hostage in the other. Most police officers are underpaid and will for the most part demand a small bribe to let you off the hook.

Passing the Ameca river along the way to these spots, you find yourself in the next door northern state of Nayarit. Such trips can be coordinated with a local surfing instructor or done solo.
There are many surfing spots in the state of Nayarit: ranging from beginner waves, to perfect reef breaks for experienced surfers. The names of some of the more popular surf spots are: Veneros, Burros, la Lancha, Punta de Mita, San Pancho and Sayulita. The drive from downtown Vallarta to points inside the Bay takes roughly 45 minutes, and a bit over an hour to get to renowned Sayulita on the Pacific coast. Sayulita is a small village which is frequented by many tourists because it is easily accessible and a vast array of businesses cater to beginner surfers. You can find surfboard rentals, surf lessons and great beaches. Sayulita is known for producing some of the best surfers in Mexico like Tigre Cadena, Kalle Carranza, Diego Cadena and Adan Hernandez amongst others.

There are many ranches in town that offer horseback Riding into small villages and through the forests. They can last from a few hours to a few days.
Some tour companies offer educational programs combined with hands-on activities to help save Mexico’s turtles. After the female turtles lay their eggs in nests they create in the sand, volunteers dig up the eggs and re-bury them somewhere safe from predators. After about 45 to 60 days, the eggs hatch. Without help, only about 1 in every 1,000 baby turtles will survive to adulthood because most are caught by predators before they make it back to the safety of the ocean. However, turtle repatriation volunteers keep the babies safe until it is time to set them free to head for the ocean (at night when predators are less active). You can be part of these programs.

The rich cultural diversity of Puerto Vallarta is reflected in the cuisine that its many restaurants have to offer. From the most casual taco stands, to tropical beachfront palapas, to upscale rooftop restaurants with panoramic views, there are literally hundreds of restaurants serving exactly what you are hungry for.
However, care should be taken to avoid travellers' diarrhea. There are many beachside restaurants to tempt you with tropical drinks, but bottled beer is a much safer option.
When taxi drivers, water taxis or other guides seamlessly hand you off to their "amigos" at a beachside restaurant, do not be bashful about seeking other options, or just order a bottled beer to be opened in front of you. Do not trust that your guide has made a good decision, he will be gone with your tip (or that of the restaurant owner for bringing you) long before you show any symptoms. Any restaurants listed in reputable guidebooks and/or are popular with locals are a fairly safe bet.

Puerto Vallarta is a beautiful holiday destination, but this is not an excuse to leave your common sense at home. You should not treat the city as if it is a huge beach resort existing solely for your pleasure.
Exercise caution here as in any place that you are unfamiliar. Keep an eye on your possessions (purses, cameras, etc.) at all times.
Do not flaunt large amounts of cash and wear a concealed money belt to secure large bills and your passport. Make sure you always have small bills and coins on hand to pay for small items.
The beaches and hotels have security people who are familiar with the area and tend to ward off most undesirable characters. As in many "tourist destinations", there are local "tourist police", who concentrate on keeping the area safe for visitors. They, and the locals, understand the value of visitors and make life very difficult for those who may consider preying on visitors.
Avoid confrontations with the police. In the event you do have a disagreement with them, expect to be treated poorly and expect to pay many a peso to regain your freedom. Respect and co-operation goes a long way with them, disrespect usually will not be tolerated.
For digestive issues, use Immodium. It is sold over the counter and works for most issues.
Unfamiliar waters can be dangerous. Observe the warning flags on public beaches as there may be a strong undertow. And never dive into unfamiliar waters as there may be rocks hidden below the surface. Leaving your valuables (cameras, purses, passport) alone on any beach in Puerto Vallarta is an invitation for theft.
Few places take credit cards. Some larger hotel complexes, high end restaurants and shops do, but most do not. It is very much a cash only economy with ATMs available in convenient locations and a bank downtown where in-person withdrawals can be made.
For the budget traveler - time your visit outside of peak holiday periods (e.g. Santa Semana/ Easter week). Accommodation prices during peak times can double or triple and the beaches become insanely crowded.
If you are traveling around Mexico leave your souvenir shopping until Guadalajara as prices in Puerto Vallarta are higher, sometimes bordering on exorbitant.
