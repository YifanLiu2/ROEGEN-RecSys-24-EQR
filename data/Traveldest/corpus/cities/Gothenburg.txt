Gothenburg (Swedish: Göteborg) is Sweden's second largest city with 570,000 inhabitants, and about 1 million in the metropolitan area. The city lies on Sweden's west coast, at the outlet of the Göta river. Gothenburg is Sweden's largest industrial city with companies such as the Volvo Group and Volvo Cars, as well as Scandinavia's largest port. The city hosts numerous national and international sporting and music events such as Gothia Cup, Partille Cup and Way out West. Gothenburg also has the Sweden's largest amusement park, Liseberg.

Gothenburg is a fairly green city with parks and a large river bisecting the city. Built after being founded by royal decree in 1621 it was modeled after the Dutch city style, with plenty of canals. Gothenburg has many nicknames that allude to its canals such as "little London", "little Amsterdam", and "little Venice". Early on Gothenburg was famous for its port and trade and has prominently hosted the Swedish East-India Company. Due to its historically industrial character Gothenburg has had strong working class associations, being known for its friendly yet brusque "goa gubbar". This together with its large port has given rise to the moniker "Marseille of the North".
Today, with over 50,000 students in the city and two major universities it has a young side with plenty of bars and night-clubs. Gothenburg has a reputation for being a very friendly place, and more welcoming than Stockholm, the Swedish capital.

Gothenburg is at the mouth of the river Göta älv. Lödöse, some 40 km (25 mi) upstream from Gothenburg was one of the largest cities in Sweden during the Middle Ages, and is considered a precursor to Gothenburg. During the Middle Ages the mouth of Göta älv was controlled by Sweden, while Bohuslän immediately north of it was Norwegian and Halland to its immediate south was Danish. The area thus became a tripoint of the three kingdoms. In order to consolidate Swedish control of the area, Älvsborg's fortress was constructed near modern-day Gothenburg. Several failed attempts were also made to build a city in the area.
The modern city of Gothenburg was built in 1621 by the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf. During the 17th century Sweden conquered Bohuslän and Halland, thus making Gothenburg the center of an expanded western Sweden. During this era the older Danish Älvsborg fortress was demolished. It was replaced by a new castle, ingeniously called New Älvsborg fortress, on an island in the mouth of the river. Gothenburg eventually became a major gateway into Sweden, and one of the busiest ports in the Nordic countries. As the largest port in Sweden Gothenburg became the seat of the Swedish East India Company in the 18th century, and a hub for American emigration in the 19th century. During this era the city also became heavily industrialized, particularly as a center for the Swedish shipbuilding industry. Its large port, strong trade community and proximity to Marstrand meant the city had a large Jewish and international community, with the first Jewish association forming before that of Stockholm.
With rising competition from foreign ship yards in the 1900s, many of the dry docks closed down in the 1970s. Much of the inner harbor area has changed from industrial ship building to high technology and education, representative of the general change in the city. Today Gothenburg has international sporting events, concerts, and conventions. Being an industrial center, Gothenburg has been politically dominated by the left-wing Social Democrats for many years.

In the 1960s with Sweden investing heavily in affordable housing with Miljonprogrammet large parts of the working class town was demolished. Much like parts of Södermalm in Stockholm, Masthugget was an entire district comprised nearly exclusively of small red-painted wooden houses, some of which had stone-laid ground floors, so called Landhövdingehus. Today such houses can only be found at Gathenhielmska kulturreservatet by Stigbergstorget in Majorna, as well as on some of the islands in the Gothenburg archipelago. Gothenburg is famous for its Landshövdingehus of which more upscale housing remains in Haga, Gårda and Majorna.

The working-class history is easily visible, for example in the harbor area, especially on the northern riverfront of Hisingen and north of the city center on the southern riverfront in Gullbergsvass. Before the 1970s there were few fashion houses or posher cafeterias, but that has changed.
The Gothenburg dialect is associated with cheerfulness and witty, if pun-laden humour, with many humorists classically from Gothenburg, often of the "goa gubbar" (lit. "good guys") stereotype, working class and somewhat fat. The connection to Britain has been said to be behind the high frequency of the male given name Glenn.
Like Marseille in France there is some animosity towards the capital, with those who move there sometimes being called "traitors".
Like most of southern and coastal Sweden, the city is best visited during springtime as well as in the summer. The climate is temperate with mild winters and warm, but not hot summers. Because it is located on the west coast by the sea the climate is milder and rainier in the winter than Stockholm, but comparable to Copenhagen. Snow is not a given in winter, for real Scandinavian winter, visit Dalarna or Norrland.
In other words, May to September tend to have the most comfortable weather. From Midsummer to the end of July, many inhabitants leave the city, and some venues close for summer, making the city more dominated by tourists.

Landvetter is Sweden's second-busiest airport
Landvetter Airport (GOT IATA) (25 km (16 mi) east of the city). Gothenburg's main airport. It is served by about 30 airlines, including SAS, Norwegian Ryanair and Wizz Air, who offer the most connections.
The city's international airport, Landvetter, serves mainly flights from other European cities, the exception being a seasonal flight by SAS from New York-Newark. Otherwise, to fly in from other continents, you must connect at a larger airport offering intercontinental flights. Most carriers offer connecting intercontinental tickets.
There are two coffee shops, burger fast food service, and a newsagent land-side. Air-side you can find a few cafes, restaurants, bars, gift shops and duty-free shops. There is quite little shopping. Foreign exchange facilities are available on both sides of security. The airport provides free Wi-Fi, but charging stations and power sockets are not in abundance.
Most of the major car rental companies have facilities opposite the airport exit. There are two hotels: Scandic is located adjacent to the terminal building and Landvetter Airport Hotel is within walking distance beyond the car rental facilities.
There is a Flygbussarna bus service from Landvetter into the city. It runs every 15–20 minutes (during the pandemic it is adapted to the reduced flight schedules so check the website for the current timetable), costs 119 kr one way (238 kr return) if you pay online (otherwise it is 139 kr and 249 kr respectively). The journey takes approximately 20–35 minutes. It stops at several locations (first stop near Liseberg; final stop: the Nils Ericson Bus terminal which is next to the Central Train Station). The only method of payment for the ticket is by credit card. Free WiFi is available on the coach.
Taxis are expensive. To the city it takes about 25 minutes and costs between 520 kr and 560 kr. It is best to arrange fixed fare before getting in taxi.
Gothenburg City Airport (GSE) closed in 2014.
Dusk falls on the railway station
SJ high speed trains run hourly and MTR trains every two hours from Stockholm Central station, taking just over 3 hours via Södertälje, Katrineholm and Skövde. Since May 2021, Flixtrain also runs three trains a day from Stockholm, taking 3 hr 30 min. These have very low "teaser" fares but a likely off-peak real fare is €17 single. Look on the Flix website as these trains may not be shown on others, for instance Deutsche Bahn.
Trains from Oslo take 4 hours. Trains run from Copenhagen city and airport hourly, taking 4 hours via Öresund bridge-tunnel, Malmö, Lund, Helsingborg and Halmstad. Regional trains also run from Jönköping via Falköping, and from Stockholm via Örebro. Travel from northern Swedish cities involves changing in Stockholm.
Gothenburg Central railway station (Göteborgs Centralstation), Drottningtorget 5 (Tramway stop: Drottningtorget 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ). The city's main railway station is within a modern complex with Forex money exchange, ATMs, fast food outlets, car hire desks and First Hotel. Left luggage lockers are downstairs by the toilets. The mall north side leads into the bus station. Lots more facilities in the city block west across the street. (updated Jul 2023)
Coach lines to Gothenburg include Eurolines, Flixbus, GoByBus, Vy Bus4You and Swebus Expressdead link. The bus station is Nils Ericsson Terminalen on the north side of the central railway station. Västtrafik operates regional buses.
Stena Line operates ships to/from Denmark (Frederikshavn) and Germany (Kiel). The terminals are near the city centre. Tramway stops: Masthuggstorget 3 6 9 11 (Frederikshavn), Chapmans Torg 3 6 9 (Kiel).
DFDS is a cargo line with limited passenger capacity. They can take a small number of passengers (and their car) to Gothenburg from Belgium (Ghent).
There are also passenger boats cruising down the river, some all the way from Stockholm through Göta Kanal (by Rederi Göta Kanal)
European roads E6, E20 and E45 pass through Gothenburg. If you come by car from Stockholm, you should take E4 to Jönköping, and then national road 40.
Approximate distances and travelling time:
to Malmö (E6/E20 south): 300 km, 3 hours
to Oslo (E6 north): 320 km, 4 hours
to Stockholm (40 east, E4): 500 km, 4 hours and 40 minutes
to Copenhagen (E6/E20 south): 317 km, 3 hours and 30 minutes
Parking in Gothenburg can be difficult and expensive, as free parking is rarely found. Prices per hour vary between 7 zones and can be as high as 30 kr per hour. Free parking for tourists is however included in the Gothenburg City Card, if you happen to own one.
Gothenburg has implemented a congestion charge (trängselskatt) for the central area. However, for Swedish rental cars the cost is commonly already included in the daily fee.
Public transportation within Gothenburg (and the west of Sweden) is operated by Västtrafik and consists of trams, buses and ferries. You can find more information about tickets and a journey planner on their homepage.
Public transport in Gothenburg can be fairly slow: For example, to cross one side of the city to the other (20 km) can take up to an hour. It can be a good idea to look up alternative routes, with some of the express buses being considerably faster, and it sometimes being possible to save many minutes by walking a few hundred meters to a tram-stop located on a different line. Inside the central area, transport is fairly rapid, as the tram tracks generally are separated from normal car lanes.
The local transport company (Västtrafik) has removed maps from just about all the tram stops; be prepared and have a map ready before you get there. The phone app or web site is very handy when wanting to find routes, but will not ask you to walk any distance in order to save time — for this Google maps is better.
You cannot buy tickets from the driver on any buses in Gothenburg area, but they are available onboard countryside buses or regional trains and in machines on trams in the Västtrafik system.
Tourists and others planning to travel everyday are advised to buy a 1- or 3-day ticket. A blue card called the Västtrafik card is charged with ticket information. They are bought at Västtrafik's service centres or from Seven-Eleven or Pressbyrån or some other stores. They cost 115 kr (24 hours) or 230 kr (72 hours) inside Gothenburg's zone A which includes the archipelago (as of Aug 2023). A tourist card is available from the tourist office which is valid as a tram/bus ticket and for museum entrance fees, etc. Longer period tickets (30 or 365 days) can be loaded onto a västtrafik card.
If you only travel occasionally, you can either buy tickets at 7-Eleven, the Västtrafik "Tidpunkten" customer service centers, the Pressbyrån shops, from the blue ticket machines on the trams - which accepts coins or major credit cards, online via the Travel planner, or via a phone app if you have a Swedish credit card. During daytime the cost is 41 kr for an adult within the city zone (34 kr with app ticket).
If you will be travelling more often it might be a good idea to buy a prepaid västtrafik card that also gives a discount. This card can be charged with any amount at a time until the card contains a maximum of 1500 kr. In addition you must pay a 50 kr deposit which can be used in part to pay for your trip, but if any of the deposit money is used, another trip cannot be made until you recharge the card again. If you return the card to a Västtrafik service center the deposit will be refunded to you.
If you travel within one zone a fixed price is deducted from your card, which is 34 kr for an adult within the Gothenburg zone. If you travel across a zone border the journey will be more expensive. With the exception of the southern part of tram no. 2 or 4 (all stops from Krokslätts Torg to Mölndals Centrum) the entire tram system lies within the Gothenburg municipality.
The card is used by touching it to one of the card readers in the vehicle when you board. If you intend to travel in more than one zone you must press the + button on the card reader before touching in and also touch the card to the reader when exiting the vehicle (otherwise, you will be charged for a journey to the terminal destination of the bus/tram). For tourists it's recommended you always touch in and out with the + button as the system will then always deduct the correct amount and you will not have to bother about the zones.
The Västrafik card can be bought from Västtrafik's service centres or from most convenience stores.
You can change freely between buses, ferries and trams 90 minutes after you first used your ticket. If you traveled in more than one zone the 90 minutes time will count from the time you disembarked in the last zone. When travelling between zones, remember to always touch in and touch out on each separate vehicle - otherwise you will be charged for each as separate journeys.
It might seem easy to get on one of the buses or trams without a valid ticket, but if a biljettkontrollant (ticket controller) would find out, you will be charged with a fee of 1500 kr.
Västtrafik has an app called "Västtrafik To Go", in which single tickets, 1- or 3-day tickets, and period tickets can be bought. It is also a fully functional travel planner that can suggest when walking or cycling is a good or better alternative. It is available for both iOS and Android devices.
Gothenburg has a famous network of trams, covering most of the city. With over 150 km the Gothenburg tram is the largest light rail network in Scandinavia.
The network consists of 12 tram lines, 1 to 11 and 13, and every line except no 8 passes through the main tram stop Brunnsparken ('Well Park'). It is located one tram stop or a 2-minute walk from the train station, Centralstationen. The trams runs approximately every 8–10 minutes during daylight and twice every hour at night, at weekends the trams run every 15–30 minutes. Notice that not all lines runs nighttime.
This and the Paddan boats (operating from Kungsportsplatsen) is the best way to see the city as they run above ground at a comfortable yet quick pace.
Gothenburg tram and Stombuss network maps are available online.
Trams are the most efficient way to travel within the city centre, but if you're planning to go further you might need to go by bus. Bus lines heading in the same direction often departs from the same part of the city. There is no real equivalent to the large central tram and bus stop Brunnsparken—most others are divided into several "smaller" hubs, which you often reach by tram.
Two ferry services run across the river; Älvsnabben is the regular ferry service with traffic every 30 minutes, and Älvsnabbare that only run between Rosenlund and Lindholmspiren (free of charge) during work hours. Besides transport, this can be a good way to see the city from the river.
Ferries to the southern archipelago run from Saltholmen, with three different lines: Vrångö line, Brännö Rödsten line and the less trafficated Förö line. The service runs once an hour or less.
Styrsöbolaget run the ferry services under licence of Västtrafik - you can still use the city public transport ticket. On their homepage can you find time tables and more information about the islands.
Taxi rip-off alert: never step into a Swedish taxi without checking the yellow price sign on the rear window first! Taxi drivers are legally allowed to charge rip-off prices as long as they are stated clearly on the sign. The taxi to the left is twice as expensive as the one to the right, and there are cases where tourists have been charged around 30,000 kr for a trip to the airport! The price tag should say around 360 kr for a cab.
There are several taxi companies, for example Taxi Göteborg (031-650000), Taxi Kurir (031-272727) and Minitaxi (031-140140). Initial fare from 35 kr, and then from 10 to 14 kr/km. Every taxi must have comparing prices well visible according to law, and it's often placed in the side window. No 1 is daytime, no 2 is rush hour and no 3 is for night time service, and then you see the initial fare, price per hour, price per kilometre and comparing prices for a typical journey.
Prices between companies vary. For the above-mentioned larger companies the visible comparing price is about 350-380 kr (and 400 kr at max). Dubious taxi operators take about double the price, so make sure to compare before you enter.
For longer travels, negotiate a fixed price. To the airport it should be around 500 kr from the city centre.
Illegal taxis, called "svarttaxi", are operating, particularly during Friday and Saturday nights. They are generally cheaper, but using them is not advised, particularly for women or drunk passengers, since muggings and rapes have occurred involving illegal taxis.

Gothenburg has a nice network of bicycle paths, reaching all parts of the city. You can buy network maps at the tourist information centres, and you can find an online version
You can bring your bike on the ferries, on some trains but not on trams or buses. The service is free on Älvsnabben but costs 10 kr on the ferries in the southern archipelago.

In the most central parts there are an automated loan bike system Styr & Ställ, registration of 90 kr for 30 days and while reserving an amount on your credit card they are free to use as long as you use for only 60 minutes and then replaced in another place. You can then take a bike again 2 minutes later. A real-time map showing how many bikes and free parking slots are available at each station can be downloaded from allbikesnow.
With a compact city centre most sights are easily reached by foot, and it's a nice way to get around.

Gothenburg hosts most of the types of shopping that is available internationally. Swedish design goods and local specialties can be found at some places. The main shopping districts and malls are:
Arkaden (Tram/bus stop Brunnsparken). If you cannot find your favourite retail store at Nordstan, it is probably at the Arkaden.
Nordstan, Nordstadstorget (Tram and bus stops Nordstaden, Brunnsparken or Lilla Bommen). Opens every day at 10:00, closes 20:00 during the week or 18:00 on weekends, closes only for Midsummer, parking garage open 24/7. Gothenburg's largest shopping centre with 180 stores is just outside the Centralstation, to which it is linked by an underground tunnel. Walkways also link the centre to Lilla Bommen and the Opera. Inside you will find the usual mix of convenience stores (including a Systembolaget), global retail formats, including Espirit, H&M and Yves Rocher, as well as an outlet of the Swedish department store chain Åhléns City and some popular Swedish shopfronts such as Hemtex or Nilson Shoes. The centre also hosts a Tourist Information stand in its middle.
Avenyn (Kungsportsavenyn), Kungsportsavenyn. Ranging between Kungportsplatsen with Kopparmärra, the statue of king Karl IX, to Götaplatsen with the statue of Poseidon and the Gothenburg art museum: Avenyn and Kungsportsplatsen hosts a variety of shops that cater to most wants. Quite a few restaurants lie along the street as well, and it is the main tourist street, where in the summers few Gothenburgers will be found, apart from at the tram stations and by the Gothenburg city library at the Götaplatsen end. (updated Dec 2017)
Inom vallgraven, Fredsgatan, Kungsgatan, Vallgatan, Östra Hamngatan (Tram/bus stops Brunnsparken, Kungsportsplatsen, Domkyrkan). Gothenburg’s major retailers outside Nordstan and a number of out of city-center malls lie around these four streets in the area Inom Vallgraven. Some interesting shops lie off the beaten track, but for general shopping these are the main locations. (updated Dec 2017)

Most crimes against tourists are crimes of opportunity, such as pick-pocketing, bicycle theft, auto theft and auto vandalism. Pickpockets converge in Gothenburg during the summer months so beware. As always, do not leave valuable items in your car or in a cloakroom, and watch your bag in crowded places. Most shops and all major taxi companies accept credit and debit cards, so there is no need to carry a lot of cash.
Downtown Gothenburg is plagued by illegal taxis by night, and they are considered very unsafe, especially for women. Check the taxi rate, which should be on a yellow window sticker; the preferred price should be in the range of 300-350 kr. Generally speaking, crime rates in Gothenburg are quite low from an international perspective.

Near Gothenburg is the beautiful Gothenburg archipelago. Here you can enjoy nature, have great views over the islands, swim in the ocean, buy ice cream and maybe eat at the restaurants on Brännö, Styrsö or Vrångö. The ferry terminal in Saltholmen which connects to the islands is easily reachable by tram from Gothenburg city center. There's a resident population on most islands, so ferries run all year.
Älvsborgs fortress (Älvsborgs fästning) from the 17th century was built on an island to protect the city from being attacked from the sea. Tourist boats Stromma make the trip regularly during summer.
Vinga - the last outpost before the sea and the place where Evert Taube (a famous Swedish poet) grew up.

Tjolöholm Castle, in Kungsbacka municipality south of Gothenburg, is an anachronistic Tudor castle built in the years around 1900 for the Scottish-Swedish merchant and factory-owning family Dickson, one of Gothenburg's many generous donors (they founded Gothenburg's first public library and built decent homes for the families of their factory staff).
Suburban Gothenburg: Alingsås, Lerum, Härryda, Mölndal and Partille

Denmark: Frederikshavn on the northern tip of Denmark has daily ferry connections operated by Stenaline. Depending on the ferry, the ride takes between 2 and 3 hours. The ferry itself can also be attraction in its own right, as you get good views of the Gothenburg Archipelago, and you will see a lot of Scandinavians going crazy because of the duty-free alcohol sale on the boat. Copenhagen can also be easily reached by bus.
