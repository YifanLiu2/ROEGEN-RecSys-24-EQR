Marlborough is one of the top wine-growing areas in New Zealand and famous for its sauvignon blanc. The region has over 35 cellar doors offering tastings for visitors to compare wines ranging from boutique family producers to well-recognised names.
Most of the tastings are free and the service is very friendly. A biking wine tour in Blenheim is a fantastic way to spend an afternoon. You can bring home a bottle from each in your rented bike's haversack. Most Marlborough wineries focus on white wines, with many of the wineries providing only one red variety plus a blush variety.

Blenheim is a gateway to the Marlborough Sounds, sunken valleys offering yachting, fishing and dolphin watching.
The Wairau Bar won't be to everybody's taste, but there is beauty if you look. Located at the mouth of the Wairau river (hence the name), the site allows sweeping views of the Wairau Lagoons, Cloudy Bay and over to the North Island. Above the stony beach (not good for swimming) are collections of coastal plants, salty dunes and Māori pits. The Wairau Bar was the site of shipwrecks when it was a major transport hub in the 1920s. To enjoy the area you will have to ignore the vehicle access to seemingly everywhere. Access from Blenheim is taking State Highway 1 north, and turning right (east) into the township of Spring Creek. After passing the township and crossing the Wairau River, turn right onto Wairau Bar Rd. The Wairau Bar is at the end of the road.
The best sea swimming in the region can be found at White's Bay. The horseshoe shaped bay protects the sandy beach from the worst weather. The Surf Club and a Department of Conservation campground have basic facilities only. Bush walks run up behind the beach and take from 10 minutes to all day. The walk over the ridge from Rarangi takes approximately one hour. The historic telegraph office which linked the North and South Island provides interest although it is not open to the public. To drive to White's Bay drive north from Blenheim on State Highway 1 and turn right (east) at Tuamarina. Travel through the seaside settlement of Rarangi and continue to follow the Port Underwood Rd. Spectacular views over the lower Wairau from the ridgeline. The turn into White's Bay is just before the end of the tar-seal.
The Port Underwood Rd can be followed through to Picton. This, for the most part, gravel road twists around the coast passing Robin Hood Bay, the site of an early missionary settlement featuring a stud-and-mud cottage built in 1854 by the whaler Captain Jackson and the pits of a kumara (sweet potato) garden are evident just off the foreshore. The road takes 1 hr 15 min from Rarangi to Picton giving periodically spectacular views over Port Underwood and points south.
Nelson Lakes National Park and its gateway village St Arnaud, offering bush walking, fresh water fishing and beautiful mountain scenery, is about an hour away by car.
Ski Rainbow. 1 hr 15 min to the bottom of the access road, Rainbow Skifield is the northernmost skifield in the South Island, close to the village of St Arnaud.
Pelorus Bridge on the road towards Nelson is an excellent day picnic destination during summer. The area is very scenic and the river surreal. Plus the opportunity to have a swim during a hot summers day and stay overnight at the campground.
