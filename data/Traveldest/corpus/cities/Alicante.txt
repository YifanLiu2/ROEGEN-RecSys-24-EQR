Mount Benacantil in Alicante, view from the sea
Alicante (Valencian: Alacant) is a popular tourist city of 332,000 people (2018) in the Valencian Community of Spain. It is the capital of Alicante province and a historic Mediterranean port. The city has become a hub of tourism directed to the beaches of the Costa Blanca.
The city is believed to have been founded by the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who established the fortified settlement of Akra Leuka (Greek: Ἄκρα Λευκή, meaning 'White Mountain' or 'White Point'), where Alicante stands today. It was later conquered by the Romans who renamed it Lucentum. In mediaeval times, Alicante became a major Mediterranean trading station, exporting rice, wine, olive oil, oranges and wool.

Arroz con costra (rice topped with sausages and eggs), a regional specialty
Arroz alicantino, a local variant of Valencian paella
As with the rest of Spain, breakfast is usually light, usually some sort of bread (e.g. toast) or piece of bakery. Traditionally, a hearty meal in the early afternoon is followed by a siesta as the heat builds. Many restaurants are then closed between 16:00-21:00. A light meal is taken once the sun goes down, often in the local tapería if you are a visitor. Many restaurants don't open before 21:00 for dinner, so bear this in mind when planning your dinner schedule.
As elsewhere in the region, seafood and rice dominates, with paella in the frontline. In almost every restaurant, you will find a menú del día ('menu of the day') or a similar special for €10, a three- or four-course meal with or without a drink. This is an excellent way to economise if you want to splash out later.
In tourist areas, you'll have no problem finding UK fare served at earlier times, if you find yourself intimidated by the local cuisine. Restaurants of all price ranges are clustered around Carrer Castaños (near the theatre), Calle San Francisco and Calle Mayor (near the cathedral).

El botellón, literally, 'the large bottle', is a custom among young people in Spain, in which they buy 2-litre bottles of soft drinks and mix into them hard liquor, and then stand or sit around drinking in parking lots and other public places. This is to avoid the high cost of drinks in some bars and clubs. There are many organizations which organise and advertise the party scene of the Barrio, such as BarrioLife.
The Barrio (aka Casco Antiguo) is the centre of nightlife in Alicante, with bars like  John Mulligan's,  Carpe Diem,  La Antigua, and  ¡¡Ay, Carmela!!; there is never a dull night in this small Spanish city. Drinks are cheap, and shots are sometimes free.
Another focal point is the eastern rim of the marina, called Puerto, in and around the  Casino Mediterráneo, where things start and end later – a typical night can end at around 07:00 or 08:00. As this part of town has a bad reputation at night, most nightclubs here hire their own security who also act as bouncers. Especially at dawn party goers should take care, as theft is common.
