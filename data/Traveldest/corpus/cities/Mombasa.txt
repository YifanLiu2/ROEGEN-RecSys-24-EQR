Mombasadead link with a population of  million (2019), is the second-largest city in Kenya and its main port city. It is particularly known for its warm and sunny climate, white beaches and coral reef diving.
Mombasa is Kenya's main tourist destination. It is on the eastern coastline of Kenya, bordering the Indian Ocean which has made it a popular destination for its beaches. Mombasa offers a diverse marine life, world-class hotels and friendly atmosphere. There is a tropical climate all year and it is a great destination filled with activities for all ages.
Mombasa is one of the oldest cities in sub-Saharan Africa, and its precise date of founding remains unknown. The first accounts of Mombasa date back to the 12th century, when the Arab geographer Al Idrisi mentioned it as a prosperous trading post in his writings. Pre-colonial Mombasa was a prosperous city state in a region of East Africa known as the Swahili Coast, which also included other city states such as Zanzibar and Kilwa Kisiwani, and a main centre for trade between Africa and the Arab World, with trade routes even going as far as India and China. At different points in history, Mombasa would be ruled by the Portuguese, Arabs and British. The city's culture today still exhibits that of its pasts. Historical ruins like Fort Jesus and the Old Town are attractions that display the history in Mombasa.
The central part of the city, Mvita, is an island in a river delta, accessed by bridges and from the south by ferries operating around the clock. It is a very cosmopolitan city, and you can see a group of Muslims wearing niqab (here known as "bui bui") and Giryama people wearing almost nothing at the same time and place.
Together with Nairobi, it is the only place in the country that has a status as both city and county.
The city of Mombasa is divided into four administrative divisions. These are clearly geographically defined and are therefore useful for orientation.
As in many other metropolises, it is difficult to distinguish the newer areas from the original city (Mvita). By 2009, 90% of the urban area was built up. And as in all major Sub-Saharan African cities, there are several shantytowns in the suburbs. The largest is Kisauni-Kongowea in Kisauni, and others include Chaani-Magongo and Miritini in Changamwe as well as Mtongwe in Likoni.
Most hotels and activities are concentrated on the island of Mvita and along the northern coast in the Kisauni division.
Mvita The island where the city was founded. The old town is calmer than the rest of Mvita and ranges from the old port to Fort Jesus which was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2011. South of the fort there are administrative quarters and three of the city's four hospitals. To the west there is the port area. Central Mvita, including part of the Haile Selassie road is a permanent market with colorful shops, stalls, street food and public places.
Changamwe The gateway to the city if you're coming from Nairobi. Here are the international airport, part of the port and oil and chemical industry plants. Changamwe is connected to Mvita by Makupa Bridge.
Kisauni Kisauni is often called the "north coast". This is where the largest slums of Mombasa are located, but also the sand beaches of Nyali, Bamburi and Shanzu, all bordered by luxury hotels and vacation houses. It is connected to Mombasa Island by Nyali Bridge and to the neighboring village of Mtwapa by Mtwapa Bridge.
Likoni Often called the "south coast". Like Kisauni it has a large sand beach, Shelly Beach, but the accommodation here is mostly made up of apartments. It is connected to Mvita by ferry.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
The climate is tropical with a major rain season between mid-April and late May and a minor wet season in October and November. Being in the Southern Hemisphere, the summer, with temperatures above 32°C, occurs in January and March. At just 4° south of the Equator, the variation in temperature is relatively small.
The first urban area was founded near what today is known as Old Town around 900 AD by a man named Sheheh Mvita. Its strategic position along the maritime route to India caused the city to be coveted by many powers, and it was a notable port for the ivory and spice trades.
Several travellers and explorers passed through the region starting no later than the 1st century, but the first written record of the city was by the Moroccan Ibn Battuta in 1330. It said Mombasa was "a very rural island without territorial dependency on the continent with mosques and forests and the inhabitants nourishing themselves on bananas and fish". On 7 April 1498, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama arrived and stayed for six days, and this was the end of peace in this small town. Under orders of Francisco de Almeida, the Portuguese returned to pillage the village in 1505 and 1528 before capturing it in 1529. They constructed Fort Jesus in 1593, together with five smaller forts, and made Mombasa a Portuguese stronghold on the route to India. The years between 1600 and 1832 were marked by successive battles between the Portuguese and the Sultanate of Oman, who conquered it.
In 1856 the sultanate of Muscat and Oman split into two and Mombasa fell into the sphere of the sultanate of Zanzibar, of which it was part until it was conquered by Britain in 1895. Mombasa served as capital of the East Africa Protectorate from 1898-1905. During this time the city's new port and the railway to Uganda were constructed. The East Africa Protectorate was dissolved in 1920 and the area was thereafter known as the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya. Mombasa remained the capital of Kenya until the country attained independence in 1963, and has served as a provincial capital ever since.

Moi International Airport as seen from the runway
Mombasa is an important node for all forms of transportation. It is the end of the Trans-African Route 8 from Lagos and of the railway to Uganda. It has an international airport, Moi Airport, and one of Eastern Africa's most important ports, Kilindini, which is also the main port for goods to Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda.
The flight between Nairobi and Mombasa takes some 45 minutes, enough time for a cold drink and a view of the Tsavo East National Park. The flag carrier Kenya Airways, as well as the low-cost airlines Jambojet, and Fly540dead link (Five Forty Aviation) fly this route. There are direct flights from European cities such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Milan, Rome, Verona and also from Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam, Doha, Dubai, Entebbe, Kigali, Istanbul, Moroni, and Zanzibar.
Moi International Airport, Road C110, Barack Obama Rd, ☏ +254 716 694306. The airport in Mombasa has been renovated and has increased the frequency of flights in and out of Mombasa from European cities. Moi Airport is the second most important airport in Kenya, after Jomo Kenyatta in Nairobi. It is in Changamwe, 6 km from Mombasa Island to which is linked by the roads 110 (Barack Obama Road) and 109. A Transfer Taxi or ("Tuk-Tuk") is the most common way to get to the city centre from the airport. As of 2018, the fares for a regular taxi ride is between Ksh 1500-3000. Uber or Taxify are much cheaper, while a Tuk-Tuk ride will cost only Ksh 200. You need to walk 300m out from the airport car park to get a Tuk-Tuk .Some hotels offer shuttle services from the airport for a fee. There are also cars to rent. (updated Aug 2018)
Money exchange: At the exit from the airport to the right is an ATM, where you can withdraw Kenya Shilling with your card (ensure the card works in Kenya at your bank). This is much cheaper than cash exchange. A bank for exchange is also available at the airport.

In June 2017, a new, 530-km-long railway line from Nairobi reduced the journey to about five hours. State-of-the-art rapid-trains are in use. A ticket for economy class is about Ksh 1000 while a 1st class ticket is about Ksh 3000. The difference between economy and 1st class is that seats are more spacious in first class. Kenya Railways operates several trains per day on the route.
A commuter rail system linking Mombasa Terminus with the old railway terminal in central Mombasa is under construction and expected to open in 2024.
Mombasa Terminus (10 km west of the city). An impressive new station, located in the western suburbs. A connecting bus shuttle runs to and from the old railway station in central Mombasa. (updated Aug 2020)
Buses, while not a major mode of transportation within the city, are mostly used for travelling outside the city. The major player in transportation in Mombasa City is Matatu, which are mostly 14-seater minibuses, and are quite popular amongst the residents.
The one-way non air condition bus fare to Nairobi is from Ksh 1000 and the trip takes at least 12 hours by day or 10 hours by night. (Best to take a five hour air condition express train) .

Kenya drives on the left and it will likely take some time to adapt to the local traffic culture. Drive in daytime only and keep the car doors locked, especially in urban areas. In Kenya foreign drivers must have an international driver's licence. These can be obtained through automobile clubs, travel agencies, or from the Road Transport Office located in the Income Tax House in Nairobi.

Most international rental agencies are present at least at Nairobi airport. From Nairobi, the distance to Mombasa is 525 km and the drive takes 6-12 hours, depending on the presence of police controls along the road, congestion on the section between Mariakani and Mombasa and the breaks you take. Voi is a good place to stop for lunch (this is also where buses stop).
From central Nairobi, take route 104 (Huhuru Highway) to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Athi River. From there route 109 to Mombasa.
The traffic will likely appear chaotic to a westerner. Traffic laws are not respected, even when police are present.
There is no regular public transportation network in the city. The closest equivalent are the aforementioned matatus (minivans) of which there are about 3500 (licensed ones have stickers on the windshields) in the city. They're cheap — ask someone at the hotel what the going rate is and don't let them scam you. Don't expect to be comfortable; as the drivers want to take as many passengers as possible, you will often be crammed in like a sardine. A matatu ride starts from Ksh 20 just to go 500m (2018)but count on paying double if you want a vehicle which conforms to the traffic legislation. Certain lines connect Mombasa and Malandi, the ride taking about two hours at a price of Ksh 350. Alternatively, book a shuttle bus to collect you from your accommodation and drop you directly at your accommodation in Mombasa - this is more expensive costing around Ksh 1000, but is much quicker and far less hassle. The shuttles can be booked online and are run by Hakuna Mutatu Bus dead link.
For the more adventurous there are tuk-tuks (motorized trikes with a cabin for the passengers) and boda-bodas (bicycle taxis). The latter is a rather dangerous and scary mode of getting around. The price for a tuk-tuk ride is Ksh 50-100 and boda-boda around Ksh 50. You can get a Tuk-tuk to the new railway station for Ksh250 per person. or 300m from the airport for ksh200 per person.
Official and unofficial taxis are also available. Taxis don't have taxi signs on the roof, but license papers stuck to the windshields. The ride is in general paid beforehand after some negotiation and you can expect the driver to stop at a service station to fill up just the necessary amount to get you to your destination. A ride from the airport to central Mombasa costs Ksh 1000-3000 (2018).
A much cheaper alternative to regular taxis are the shuttle services Uber, Taxify, Little formerly dead link , Mondo Ridedead link, MaraMoja. You can get fares online and thereby avoid getting overcharged, as many taxi drivers like to do to tourists. A cheaper alternative is a shared taxi: Hakuna Mutatu Bus operates on the Kenya Coast and a ride from Mombasa costs roughly Ksh 1000 and takes 1hr 30min. The shared taxi is a door-to-door service, meaning you will be collected from your current accommodation in Mombasa, Kilifi or Watamu and dropped directly at your next accommodation in Diani.
It is also possible to rent a car with or without a driver. If you need to get around a lot but are scared of driving, you can usually negotiate fares for longer periods (e.g. one day) with taxi drivers. Do this only after a "test ride", as taxi drivers are not always knowledgeable of the city.
Kenya Red Cross, ☏ +254 41 2224161, +254 725 292000, fax: +254 41 2313236. The local Red Cross office tweets real time information about accidents, demonstrations and other things that may interrupt traffic.
The Santo Mathias bastion and the main entrance to Fort Jesus
Considering Mombasa's action-filled history, surprisingly there are only a handful of sights. The nature and a slew of different activities is what makes Mombasa interesting for visitors. In addition to these, there are a couple of sights within 20-30 km north, west and south of Mombasa. These are listed under #Go next.
Fort Jesus, Fort Jesus Rd, ☏ +254 720 650869. Daily 8:30AM-6:30PM. Fort Jesus is the most popular destination in Mombasa. Built between 1593 and 1596 by the Portuguese to protect the port against the Ottomans, this fort was in military use for over three centuries. It got its name from the Portuguese fleet sailing under the flag of the Order of Christ (Ordem de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo). The fort is an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011. Fort Jesus holds artifacts from when Mombasa was a transit port for the slave trade. There are torture rooms, cells, and many other displays from the 16th century. During the British period the fort functioned as a prison and today part of the cells are used as a museum. Many exhibits come from the Portuguese frigate Santo António de Tanna that sank in 1697, including African and Indian pottery, Chinese china, different objects used by the crew and two bronze cannons. Another part of the collection is dedicated to archeological finds from the Kenyan coast. Moreover there are Arabic military equipment, musical instruments and a series of cannons from the 18th and 19th centuries. In the small park next to the entrance there is a 105-mm cannon that belonged to the Imperial German Navy.The Butterfly House is right next to Fort Jesus, so very easy to incorporate into a trip round the Fort and Old Town, but also well worth a visit on its own. Although small, is packed with both beautiful and interesting creatures. You can view butterflies from their larval stage to grown ups. See also evidences of slave trade and an amphitheatre that's being restored. Have a nice view of the LA marina. There is also a small shop. Ksh 1500 (adults), Ksh 750 (kids) as of 2013.
Fort St Joseph. Close to the golf course near Mama Ngina Drive, this ruin is probably the oldest fortress on the island built by Arabs. It stood when Vasco Da Gama first came to Mombasa. It is not really impressive but it's a nice viewpoint too and worth a visit. (updated Oct 2017)
Old town, Districts of Makadara and Mzizima. Along Tudor Creek north of Fort Jesus, these districts make up the original city. It is an example of typical Swahili architecture with a much more peaceful ambience than the rest of the city. Much of it has been converted into souvenir shops and restaurants and here you can find artisanal stores selling silver jewellery and small furniture. If you are afraid of getting lost among the small streets or don't want to miss anything, there are guides at the esplanade of Fort Jesus that can show you around the old town for Ksh 1000. A nice place to explore on a Sunday when much of the city is closed down.
The tusks of Moi Avenue, Moi Ave (near Uhuru Garden). The tusks were built in 1956 to welcome Princess Margaret, who was visiting Mombasa town. Today they are some of the most characteristic landmarks of Mombasa. They are located at the entrance to the city and not made of ivory as is sometimes thought, but of steel. The tusks form an M (which stands for Mombasa).

Activities on Bamburi's beach: camel rides, diving boat and fishing boat

Elephants and safari vehicles in Tsavo East National Park
Most people who visit the coast of Kenya want to combine their stay with a safari. If you have not already booked the safari at home in the travel agency, you can also book it with local agents. There are a very large number of travel agencies that offer safaris both near the beach hotels and in the center of Mombasa. Tours are offered in every hotel and representatives try to find customers even on the beach. In addition to reputable companies, there are also private individuals who organize safaris - often illegally, in order to avoid taxes. For your own safety, you should give preference to reputable companies, even if they are a little more expensive.
For the nearby attractions without overnight stays, you can simply take a taxi. For nearby destination worth to visit see also Diani Beach and Mtwapa.
Like in all of Africa, haggling is common in small shops. Especially if you are an obvious foreigner, the initial price is usually higher than what is normally paid for the merchandise. Just make sure you don't ask for prices in English. Use the little Swahili you know so as not to overpay.
The best places for buying souvenirs are the districts of Kinyozi, Mwembe and Tayari which are surrounding Haile Selassie Road and also Biashara Street (Biashara means "commerce" in Swahili). Specialities include:
kitenge (vitenge in plural): fabrics decorated with colorful motifs for women to be worn around the waist or tied on the head
kanga: similar to kitenge but also decorated with a border running along the sides and a written Swahili proverb.
kikoi (vikoi in plural): the "kitenge" for men, sometimes made of wool and usually decorated with strips or tartan
batik: originating on Java, batik has been known on the Kenyan coast for centuries. The pieces are cloths are woven by hand but not hand painted. Should not be washed in a washing machine.
kiondo or chondo (vyondo in plural): handmade handbag with leather trim often beautifully decorated with beads or shells
ndala: hand-made sandals made from leather and old tires (for the soles), these stylish shoes are a great souvenir from Mombasa. Local craftsman use colorful beads and pieces of leather to create a vast variety of shapes and decorations. No two pairs are alike. Ksh 500.
In the old town you can find stores selling silver jewellery and small furniture handmade in typical Swahili style. Also here, haggling is the rule.

Several countries have issued warnings that the city centre is not safe during the night, that car-jacking is widespread and that robberies after sunset at the beaches can occur. Use common sense and a healthy dose of scepticism for your surroundings.
If you want to go out at night in pubs or restaurants always take a taxi, not on foot or motorbike taxi or tuktuk.
As elsewhere in Africa it's badly regarded — if not outright prohibited — to take photos or film airports, banks, military areas, police stations, troops or police officers without authorization. In general you should ask people if you may take photos of them. When walking, watch out for pickpockets and don't show off expensive electronics. When driving, keep the car doors locked both in daytime and nighttime.
The police is present on public places, especially in areas frequented by tourists like Mvita and the beaches. Public areas like the airport, post offices, banks, and malls. are guarded by security guards. Similarly, upper-class homes and apartment buildings are also guarded around the clock.
Following the intervention by the Kenyan military in Somalia, the terrorist organization Al Shabaab has committed several attacks in the country, some of them in Mombasa. In July 2014, two female tourists were murdered in separate incidents. A Russian tourist was killed in a hit and run attack in front of the Shia Sheri Mosque in the Old Town. Another female tourist was shot and killed in the Kibokoni area. The identity of the attackers are not known.
If you are sitting at an outside terrace, do not sit next to the road. You should also avoid riding matatus, immediately leave areas with ongoing demonstrations of any kind, and never visit the slums without a guide. Before exploring the city on your own, you should ask the hotel staff which areas are safe.
