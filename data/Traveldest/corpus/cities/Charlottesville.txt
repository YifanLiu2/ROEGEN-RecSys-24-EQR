Charlottesville, in central Virginia, is a lovely university town of about 40,000 with lots to offer. Charlottesville is a town steeped in history and culture. Charlottesville is a major cultural center for central Virginia, and features more fine dining, shopping, and entertainment than one might expect for a town of its size. Ensconced in beautiful Albemarle County, Charlottesville is also surrounded by vineyards and horse country.
Of the eight U.S. presidents who came from Virginia, two — Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe — were from Charlottesville, and two more came from neighboring counties. Central Virginia was a major battlefield during the Civil and Revolutionary Wars. Jefferson, whom locals affectionately call "Mr. Jefferson," or "TJ," continues to cast a long shadow, particularly over local architecture. Many of Charlottesville's public buildings are made of brick and built in a Jeffersonian style, and many private homes are colonial. His home at Monticello and the Jefferson-designed University of Virginia have set the tone for the communities' beautiful buildings. When visiting Charlottesville, be sure to stop by the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society to learn more about the area's rich history.
The culture of Charlottesville revolves around two points: the University of Virginia and the Historic Downtown Mall.
Charlottesville Albemarle Airport (CHO IATA). The closest airport to Charlottesville. It is a cute, small airport with flights from the major hubs of Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago O'Hare, Washington Dulles, New York City LaGuardia, and Philadelphia. This airport is 8 miles from downtown, and there is no public transport, so a rental car, taxi, or hotel courtesy shuttle are the main alternatives. Rental cars are available at CHO through Avis, Hertz, or National, and the drive to Charlottesville is straightforward. (updated Feb 2018)

Charlottesville station, 810 W Main St (about halfway between the Downtown Mall and the University (3/4 mile to each), but within walking distance of several restaurants.). To travel to and from the station, call for taxi service or take the CAT bus or trolley, if you are not walking.
Amtrak, ☏ +1 215-856-7924, toll-free: +1-800-872-7245. Operates trains throughout the United States of America. (updated Dec 2020) Routes stopping in Charlottesville:
Cardinal operating three trips weekly between Chicago and New York City with stops in Dyer, Rensselaer, Lafayette, Crawfordsville, Indianapolis, Connersville, Cincinnati, Ashland, Huntington, Charleston, Hinton, White Sulphur Springs, Staunton, Charlottesville, Culpeper, Manassas, Alexandria, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Wilmington, Philadelphia, Trenton, and Newark.
Crescent between New Orleans and New York City via Birmingham, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Washington, D.C.
Northeast Regional is Amtrak's busiest regional service, connecting Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and the many towns and cities in-between. Toward the east end of the route, some trips terminate at Springfield instead of Boston. Some services also continue south into Virginia towards Newport News, Roanoke and Norfolk on three separate branch routes from Alexandria. Charlottesville is on the branch to and from Roanoke.
The major highways leading into Charlottesville are US-29 and I-64. I-64 is a four-lane interstate leading to Charlottesville from east and west. There is rarely traffic on I-64 near Charlottesville, and the only major hill is crossing Afton Mountain, about 30 minutes west of town. US-29 is an extremely variable road. To the south, it is a four-lane road with frequent curves and at-grade crossings, but few traffic lights. To the north, the road alternates between being a four-lane commercial center with frequent traffic lights and businesses and being more similar to US-29 south of town. Traffic on US-29 north of town can be slow or dense at rush hour and around special events in Charlottesville, but speeds below 25 mph are rare.
Travel times from nearby cities are:
Staunton, about 45 minutes.
Richmond, a little over an hour.
Washington, D.C., between 2 and 2½ hours. The trip is approximately 110 miles.
Roanoke, about 2 hours.
Greyhound has a bus stop in Charlottesville. If you are traveling to or from Washington, DC, the train is generally faster, cleaner, and more comfortable than the bus.
Virginia Breeze (selling tickets via Megabus) and Flixbus have routes through Charlottesville as well, and these two services have student discounts.
Note that all three have bus stops in different places.
Getting around the University of Virginia, often called UVA (with each letter pronounced), is easy using the free University Transit System (UTS) buses. The Central Grounds area is very walkable, but some areas of campus (called "Grounds" by students) can be over a mile away. From the University to the downtown mall is a walk of 20-30 minutes and there is a free trolley bus that runs in a loop from the University to the Downtown Mall approximately every 20 minutes. It is not easy to find parking around the University area, including the Corner and between 14th Street and Rugby Road. There is a parking garage at the University Bookstore, on Emmet Street, that only fills up during certain university events (e.g., Days on the Lawn). There are also plenty of Veo rental e-scooters around Grounds.
The city is reasonably well connected by free city buses, the Charlottesville Area Transit (CAT). Don't use Google Maps for CAT bus routes; Google sometimes has the wrong bus data. Parking in nearly all areas of the city is free and easy to find. Parking at the Downtown Mall will often require paying a modest rate at a lot or parking garage.
One of the CAT routes is a free trolley bus that operates along East Main Street/Water Street between downtown and the University of Virginia. Stops include the Virginia Discovery Museum, the downtown mall, the Amtrak station/Greyhound stop, and the Rotunda and chapel of the University of Virginia. Like with UVA, the city has Veo rental e-scooters, but don't expect every area to have them or for every road to be scooter-friendly.
Transportation outside of the city is best accomplished by car, although taxi and certain buses may be available for some locations. Main roads are well signed and in good repair, but can be hilly and curvy. If traveling to an unusual location or taking a shortcut through smaller country roads, be prepared for unpaved roads, limited signs, and frequent curves.
With the possible exceptions of the airport and the Downtown Mall, you must call for taxi service in Charlottesville. There are several taxi companies in the city.

However, he was also a large-scale slave-owner, who owned over 600 slaves and had a sexual relationship with one of them, Sally Hemings, and Monticello was a slave plantation.
