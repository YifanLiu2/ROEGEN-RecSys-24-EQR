Dayton is a city of about 141,000 (2016) in the Miami - Scioto basins in Ohio. It is the center of the Dayton-Springfield-Sidney, Ohio metro area with a population of 1,075,000 (2016).
Dayton is known as the Gem City and it's no wonder. In addition to being the birthplace of aviation (the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, lived here and perfected their design for the first practical aircraft), it is also home to one of the few multi-site National Parks in the U.S.- the Dayton Aviation Heritage Park. There are several things to do and see in the city and its suburbs.
Dayton has a humid continental climate, which means, like the rest of Ohio, that it sees four very distinct seasons.

A surprising and very nice feature is free Wi-Fi, which can be accessed under the name of "public" in the airport. Before August 2013, there was no public bus service going to the airport, which made Dayton International Airport the second-busiest airport in the continental United States without a public transportation option. Today, the local busing authority, the RTA, offers service three times daily on Route 43. Cabs from the downtown area to the airport cost at least $30. (updated May 2018)
