Haugesund is a city in the county of Rogaland, in the West Norway region of Norway. The town offers a much wider range of goods and services than might be expected from a city of its size (approximately 37,000 inhabitants in 2020), due to its position as the definite centre of its relatively populous region. The historical village of Avaldsnes, sometimes known as Norway's birthplace, is  km south of Haugesund.

dead link Haugesund airport (HAU IATA) (on the island of Karmøy, about 20 mins by car south of Haugesund.). The domestic services are up to 9 daily flights from Oslo with SAS and Norwegian, and usually 5 daily flights to Bergen operated by Widerøe. Haugesund also has some international services. Norwegian has seasonal summer service from Malaga and Alicante, and the low cost carrier Wizzair has a route from Gdańsk (5 times weekly).

Stavanger, two hours south of Haugesund, and Bergen, three hours north of Haugesund, have larger airports with more domestic and international connections. The lengthy drive, both including a ferry journey, may be worth it if you can avoid a flight connection.

The boat service in Haugesund goes to the islands of Røvær and Feøy, while a passenger and car ferry operates to the island of Utsira.
Cruise ships to Haugesund dock at the Garpeskjærskaien Quay dead link, on the west side of Risøy island just southwest of the town center, which welcomed its first cruise ship in 2013. Free bus shuttle service from the pier to Our Savior's Church (Vår Frelsers Kirke) is provided, but the 800 m distance to the town center is also walkable.
The main road connection to eastern Norway is via the E134 road over Haukeli; another option is along route 7 across Hardangervidda. Both these roads run across mountainous stretches and are prone to disruptions during the winter. During the winter season, bring food and warm clothing in case you get stranded.
The main north-south road along Norway's west coast is the E39 road that runs past Haugesund to the east, but there are several spurs that lead into the town. Because of fjords, the E39 route features a number of long undersea tunnels, and travelling to Stavanger or to Bergen both require a ferry crossing. Fortunately, the ferries are large and have a reasonably good frequency.
There are many parking lots and houses in Haugesund. Most of the parking is metered.
Nor-Way Bussekspress operate two express bus routes to Haugesund.
Kystbussen runs between Bergen and Stavanger, and most buses go via Haugesund. The frequency varies between a bus every hour and a bus every two hours.
Haukeliekspressendead link runs between Haugesund in the west and several cities in eastern Norway, including Oslo, Kongsberg, Notodden, Tønsberg, Sandefjord, Larvik, Porsgrunn and Skien. The buses run three times a day Sunday-Friday, and once on Saturdays.
The city center of Haugesund is compact; the streets are on a grid and easy to navigate by foot. The main north-south street is Haraldsgata, which is for pedestrian only from Skjoldavegen (north) to Åsbygata (south). The parallel street Sørhauggata is one way south, while Strandgata is one-way north. The two blocks of Torggata between Sørhauggata and Strandgata is also pedestrianized.
If you want to travel further out, there is a local (county) bus system. The tourist information centre is the  Bytunet (Strandgata 171, 5525), one block west of the main pedestrian street Haraldsgata at the northern end. They have a wide variety of free tourist brochures and schedules and also sell passes for the local bus system.
The local buses are managed by Kolumbus, which manages the buses for the entire Rogaland county. The bus routes dead link for North Rogaland, which includes Haugesund, are available online. The main routes for the Haugesund region (lines 201, 202, and 210) run seven days a week, Mondays to Fridays between 06:00 and 00:00, Saturdays from 08:00 to 00:00, and Sundays from around 10:00-12:00 to 00:00. Other routes have more limited service.
The county of Rogaland is divided into five zones (Haugalandet, Ryfylke, Nord-Jæren, Jæren, Dalane), and tickets are based on how many zones you traverse. Haugesund and its surrounding municipalities are in the Haugalandet zone. Single-tickets within this zone cost kr 45 for adults, and kr 23 for children under 16 and seniors over 67, and allow a transfer of buses on the same ticket within a one-hour time limit. If several buses will be taken during the stay it may be cheaper to purchase a 24-hour ticket for kr 100, or a 7-day ticket for kr 310. In addition, there is a smaller local Haugesund zone, that covers Haugesund and only the mainland part of Karmøy. Within this local zone single tickets cost only kr 20 with transfer within an hour.
Tickets can be purchased with cash on the bus, but that carries a 20 kr surcharge per ticket. The option that is probably most useful to visitors is to download the app "Kolumbus Billett" onto a smartphone and link this with a debit or credit card. It can then be used to purchase a variety of different tickets. A final option is to purchase for 50 kr the "Kolumbus card", a credit card sized card that can be topped up with tickets or travel money. Both smartphone tickets from the app and Kolumbus card tickets may be scanned by ticket readers upon entering the bus. Ticket inspectors make random spot checks, and passengers without valid tickets are fined.
St Olav's Church in historic Avaldsnes
To get to the historical Avaldsnes, which is in the Haugalandet zone, take Bus no 209, 210 or X210 from Haugesund and ask the bus driver for Avaldsnes. The bus stops on the main road E134 heading south. When you get off the bus, take the underground walkway to cross under E134 and then follow the road to your left, Kong Augvaldsveg, heading east for about 10 minutes. Look for the landmark St. Olav's church at Avaldsnes.
Taxis are operated by Haugesund Taxi (phone: 52 80 80 80) and Haugaland Taxi (phone: 52 81 81 81). Taxi ranks can be found at the Flotmyr bus station and in front of the Vår Frelsers church in the city centre. Taxis are rather expensive in Norway and even a short journey may easily cost over kr 150.
The islands of Røvær, Feøy, and Vibrandsøy can only be accessed by boat. In Haugesund, this route docks just south of the catamaran terminal. The ticket price is kr 27 to Vibrandsøy, kr 36 to Feøy, and kr 45 to Røvær.
While it is possible to explore the city on foot, it may be beneficial to hire a car to see the surrounding area. Car hire is offered by Hertz, Avis and Europcar at the airport and at various locations in the city. It can be expensive to rent the car. Petrol (or bensin as it is called in Norwegian) is also expensive and road tolls must be paid on many roads. As a result, it may be worth renting a car for only part of your trip. For budget option, Rent-a-wreck also have a branch in Haugesund.

Archaeological excavations The ground and sound at the old royal farm at Avaldsnes still hold secrets that can give us new knowledge about Norwegian and international history. Excavations have led to the discovery of traces of old buildings close to St. Olav’s Church. These findings might even prove to be remains of Harald Fairhair’s court, which he set up here following the battle of Hafrsfjord. Projects are in place to excavate more of the area in order to find out more about these important and exciting findings.
Flagghaugen Flagghaugen is a burial mound dating back to the third century AD. It is situated just north of St. Olav's Church. It used to be 43 meters in diameter and 5 meters high. The remaining parts can be seen just outside of the stone fence surrounding the church. A prince was buried here, and in the grave the richest gold finds from any grave in Scandinavia from the Later Roman Iron Age was found. Among the findings was a massive necklace made of 590 grams of pure gold. The prince is presented at the Nordvegen History Centre close by.
Rehaugene At the top of Karmøy, six imposing earthen burial mounds, which dominate the landscape, were built during the Bronze Age (1800 – 500 BC). There used to be many more burial mounds here, however, only six remain, and they are called the pyramids of the north. They were built as the final resting place for the powerful chiefs that lived at Avaldsnes. These burial mounds show that 3000 years ago Norway traded with communities as far away as Russia, Ireland and the Mediterranean.
The Bear Pit. Near to Karmøy, this is the ancient hole dating back to 972 in which irritating Swedes were thrown to be mauled by bears. The practice eventually deterred Swedes from passing through, although some credit this to the nearby 'Bird Cage'.
