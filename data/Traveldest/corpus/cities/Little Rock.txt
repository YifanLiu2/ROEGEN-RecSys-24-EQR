Little Rock is the capital and the largest city of the state of Arkansas. Little Rock is a cultural, economic, government, and transportation center within Arkansas and the American South. There are several cultural institutions are in Little Rock, and hiking, boating, and other outdoor recreational opportunities. Little Rock's history is available through history museums, historic districts or neighborhoods.
Little Rock lies at the center of the state, more-or-less where the Ozark Mountains, the Ouachita Mountains, and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (the "Delta") come together. Traveling east from Little Rock, you traverse flat land nearly all the way to the Mississippi River; traveling west you quickly enter hilly country.
Little Rock is Arkansas's largest city, as well as the state capital and major economic center (although northwestern Arkansas, with Walmart, Tyson Foods, and major trucking firms, is rapidly gaining). Little Rock is home to the state's only medical school, and one of the two branches of the University of Arkansas law school. In 2019, it had a population of about 200,000 with a metro area of over 700,000.
Little Rock derives its name from a small rock formation on the south bank of the Arkansas River called La Petite Roche (the "little rock"). The "little rock" was used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river crossing. The original historic "little rock" was later dynamited and used as a foundation for a railroad bridge, but its location can be visited in downtown's Riverfront Park.
Little Rock is located at the first high that upstream travelers on the Arkansas River came to, and so was a logical place to found a settlement. When it became apparent that the original capital of Arkansas Territory, Arkansas Post, was too subject to flooding, the seat of government was moved to Little Rock in 1819.

Little Rock is located at the intersection of Interstates 40 and 30, about two hours west of Memphis, five hours east of Oklahoma City, and five hours northeast of Dallas. I-530 and U.S. Route 167 also lead into the city.
Interstates 430 and 440 nearly encircle the metropolitan area, and I-630 runs from downtown westward to end at I-430.

If you'd like to see more than Downtown, a car is your best bet.
While taxis aren't as common a sight in Little Rock as they are in Dallas or Atlanta, they are available. You'll definitely be able to find one at the airport, and probably you'll see one pass through downtown if you're patient. A better plan would be to call in advance. You can call Capitol Cab at ☏ +1 501 570-9999.
If you're renting a car: I-630 runs from east/west from downtown to the edge of west Little Rock; for most attractions you won't go too far north or too far south of 630.
Be aware while driving that east Little Rock is pretty much flat, whereas west Little rock can get extremely hilly.
Parking is generally not difficult in Little Rock. However, if you're parking where the Metro Streetcar (formerly River Rail) runs, you'll want to make sure that you're well clear of the tracks. Check this specifically on Markham, Second, and Third Streets near the River Market and the Clinton Library in downtown Little Rock, and around Main and Maple Streets in North Little Rock. It would probably be wise to walk or ride the trolleys to visit these areas.
Rock Region Metro (Central Arkansas Transit Authority). Unlike the River Rail streetcars, the city bus travels city-wide. One-way fare is $ for adults, or $36 for unlimited rides during a month. (updated Jun 2023)
Little Rock has a large population of cyclists. There is a large mixed use pedestrian and bike loop connecting both North Little Rock and Little Rock's downtown corridors.

Cantrell Rd. forms the boundary between the two neighborhoods, with The Heights to the north and Hillcrest to the south. Many of the city's most popular restaurants are located along Kavanaugh, along with art galleries and odd and interesting shops, both funky and upscale. Hillcrest is mix of mid-priced houses and apartments along with fine old houses. The Heights represents more of the old-money Little Rock Country Club crowd.
