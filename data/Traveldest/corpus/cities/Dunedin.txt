For other places with the same name, see Dunedin (disambiguation).
Dunedin (prounounced "duh-NEE-din") is the main city of the Otago region and the second-largest city on the South Island of New Zealand. The city was predominantly settled by Scots, and its name is an anglicised version of Dùn Èideann, the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh. It had a population of 130,400 in June 2022.
Dunedin is a university town, a cultural hub, and a city with a strong historic streak. It is a small city with a compact walkable city centre surrounded by hilly suburbs. It has easy access to beaches, wildlife attractions and areas of native forest.
Known as the Edinburgh of the South, it has a proud Scots heritage. It has as its heart a statue of the poet Robbie Burns and many of its streets carry the same name as streets in Edinburgh (but visitors from Edinburgh may be confused as they are in a different order). Due to the gold rush in central Otago, Dunedin was the biggest and most prosperous city in New Zealand from 1865 to 1900, and many of its old buildings and character stem from that period. Because of history and geography, Dunedin is usually considered New Zealand's fourth major centre behind Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, despite being seventh in the population ranks.
Baldwin Street, steepest grade 1 in , holds the record for the steepest street in the world.
Dunedin sits in a natural harbour, with the centre of the city on a relatively small area of flat land surrounded by suburbs on the steep hillsides. Some of its streets are very steep: Baldwin Street is claimed to be the steepest street in the world.

It does get cold: many of the streets are iced over in winter, and every two or three years the city gets a snowfall.
These days, Dunedin is best known for its University of Otago, the oldest and one of the best universities in New Zealand, and its 'scarfie' student culture. The university is the South Island's second largest employer and by far the biggest contributor to the Dunedin economy. Dunedin is a university town rather than just a town with a university since the student population of around 27,000 is nearly 23% of the 120,000 residents. A consequence of this is that the city is significantly quieter during the university summer holiday period (approx November to February), and that accommodation may be harder to find or more expensive during orientation week and university graduations, etc.
Dunedinites (the Dunedin people) are generally friendly, and pride themselves on being friendlier than those from the bigger cities of NZ.

Port Chalmers with cruise ship docked
Cruise ships are an increasingly popular way to visit Dunedin. There are 80-90 visits each October to March shipping season. The Dunedin City Council provides free Wi-Fi at the port and runs a web page for cruise visitorsdead link. The two major cruise companies Carnival (Holland America, P&O, Princess) and Royal Caribbean both serve Dunedin. Most cruise ships dock at the deep water harbour  Port Chalmers, 14 km northeast of Dunedin, 20-30 minutes drive from the city centre. You can travel direct by cruise ship shuttle bus for $10 one-way/$15 return. Alternatively, you can board the public Bus 13 Port Chalmers to City at the Port Chalmers turnaround, five minutes walk from ship side, for $ one-way (free for New Zealand Gold Card holders) and a 20-min ride to the Octagon. You may catch the return Bus 14 City to Port Chalmers at the Countdown stop on Cumberland near Lower Stuart. Taxis cost about $45 one-way.
Seasoned cruise ship travellers will be aware that tourism products marketed directly to cruise ship passengers are often more expensive, so arranging visits to Dunedin attractions and tours independently can save money.
Dunedin is surrounded by hills, so cycling from other places requires effort. Cyclists are banned from State Highway 1 as it approaches the city from both north and south. There are alternative routes for cyclists.
From the north: turn left at Waitati and take Mt Cargill Rd, or turn left or right at the following intersection and take Donalds Hill Rd/Mt Cargill Rd or Waitati Valley Rd/Leith Valley Rd (this includes crossing the no-bikes highway at the summit)
From the south: Exit State Highway 1 at the Mosgiel interchange and take Quarry, Gordon and Dukes Roads to the aptly-named Three Mile Hill Rd, or turn right and take Quarry, Morris, Main and Main South Roads.
The city layout is focused on the Octagon, an eight-sided 'plaza' with a central carriageway. It hosts a few significant buildings, and a couple of bars and cafes, but for all intents and purposes it is a large bus stop and a roundabout.
The main retail area lies further north up George Street toward Dunedin North, and this could arguably be considered the city centre. Here you will find a larger range of shopping, some malls, cafes, etc. To a lesser there is some retail south along Princes Street and east along Lower Stuart Street from the Octagon. At the end of Lower Stuart Street, 400 metres from the Octagon, lies Anzac Square (actually a triangular area of public gardens) and Dunedin Railway Station and Toitū Otago Settlers Museum. Beyond that is an industrial area and the Otago harbour.
The street blocks in Dunedin are quite long, and walking from the Octagon past the university to the Botanic Gardens can take the best part of an hour. Always remember that Dunedin has a flatter area by the water, and then climbs steeply. So, the shorter route may not be the easiest one if you are going over the hills. Check the contours before setting out.
Getting around Dunedin is super easy thanks to the extensive Orbus bus network organized by the Otago Regional Council connecting the city centre and the outlying suburbs and towns (such as Mosgiel and Palmerston). Various bus companies as GoBus and Ritchies are contracted by the Otago Regional Council to provide the Orbus service. Most drivers will tell you where to find the right bus if you ask nicely, or you can call the bus helpline on 0800 672 8736 (also free from cell phones), between M-F 8AM to 5:30PM, Sa Su 9AM to 5PM. All buses are wheelchair friendly.
All city buses operate from the Central City Bus Hub which is located on Great King Street between Moray Place and St Andrew St. Buses run regularly during the week, but services are greatly reduced (or non-existent) on weekends and holidays.
Bus drivers will accept cash, although it costs less to ride with an electronic GoCard bus service debit card.
By using a GoCard you pay less than a cash fare and get a discounted transfer within the same zone if you get on another bus within 30 minutes of getting off the first (i.e. your second trip will be discounted by 1 zone).
GoCards cost $5 to set up, with a minimum top up of $10, and can be used elsewhere in Otago including Queenstown. They can be obtained from:
Otago Regional Council, 70 Stafford St.
Dunedin City Council, Customer Service Centre in the Octagon.
University Bookshop, 378 Great King St.
To add money to the card you can ask your bus driver to load money onto your card or top-up at any of the places listed above below:
Otago Regional Council, 70 Stafford St.
Dunedin City Council Customer Service Centre in the Octagon.
University Bookshop, 378 Great King St.
To top up on a bus you will need to pay in cash. If you want to top up with EFTPOS you will need to go to one of the locations listed above.
Bus fares are (as of 2019): One zone Adult $ (GoCard) $ (cash); Two zones Adult $ (GoCard) $ (cash); Three zones Adult $ (GoCard) $ (cash); Four zones 4 Adult $ (GoCard) $ (cash); Five zones Adult $ (GoCard) $ (cash).
The main line service, Normanby-City-St Clair, (GoBus No 9) runs every 15 minutes and is handy to about a dozen of the city's attractions: St Clair beach, the University, Dunedin Botanic Garden and Baldwin St
Most other routes are every 30-40 min.
The Peninsula bus route from the Museum is a good way to see the Peninsula, unless you're terrified by oncoming traffic: in places the full sized buses are wider than the lanes they travel in. The traffic is generally used to this and travels very cautiously. The service however does not go to Lanach Castle nor as far as Taiaroa Head.
The Brockville (55) and Halfway Bush (44) bus routes take you to the city's near-alpine outskirts, especially fun when snow has fallen.
Bus services are reduced on Sundays and New Zealand public holidays; on Christmas Day, Good Friday and Easter Sunday there are no services but the local bus museum operates classic vehicles (not wheelchair friendly) on two main routes.

There is a recycling centre down by the north-east end of the docks (in Wickliffe Street) which generally has one or two reasonable-condition bicycles lying about for $10 apiece. Carefully add air (there's a service station due west back over the bridge) and oil and you're set to go. You will also need a skid-lid/stack-hat/helmet, which are generally unavailable second-hand for liability reasons, but can be had new for $20 from the KMart in Meridian, between George Street and Filleul Street. There is another recycling shop called "The Recover Store" at the Dunedin Landfill on Brighton Road, Green Island.
There is an excellent flat ride out along the western shore of the Otago Peninsula to Harington Point, although it's a narrow road shared by lots of tour buses. A cycle track runs along of the industrial eastern shore of the harbour, about half-way to Port Chalmers (busy highway the rest of the way).
If you like a bit of a hill-climb, ride out along North Road to the Organ Pipes, a collection of rapidly-cooled volcanic lava formed into vertical columnar basalt. The walk along a bush track up to the Pipes themselves is very scenic and well attended by small, harmless wildlife. The ride up along the ridge of the Peninsula to Lanarch Castle is also good high-energy exercise.
If you like pushing a bike up a hill because it's too steep, dive off North Road onto Norwood Street, or cross to the east side of the Peninsula, or head straight up the hill behind the Octagon past the Beverly-Begg Observatory to suburbs with a view like Roslyn.
The following attractions are free: Baldwin Street, Dunedin Railway Station, Otago Museum, Public Art Gallery, Toitū Otago Settlers Museum, and the churches.
Baldwin Street. Located in Dunedin's North East Valley suburb, it is recognised the world's steepest street according to Guinness World Records with a centreline gradient of %. Take the ten-minute walk to the top or drive up to enjoy the view looking down! There is a drinking fountain at the top. Some people have tried, and a few have succeeded, cycling all the way up Baldwin Street - try it if you're a keen cyclist. That said, you will need to be careful coming back down - chances are the cycle's brakes will do little to slow a descent at such an incline! (updated Dec 2020)
Dunedin Prison, 2 Castle St, ☏ +64 3 471-2268 (for tours), dunedingaolenquiries@gmail.com. Open over the summers on Saturday morning for a one-hour guided tour which start at 10:30AM.

The structure was designed by the Government Architect, John Campbell. The prison was constructed with superb detail and the contrasting red and pale exterior colours are an example of Edwardian neo-Baroque. The property was sold to the Dunedin Prison Charitable Trust with the intention of transforming it into a tourist attraction. Adult $15, school age child $5. Cash only. (updated Feb 2020)
Dunedin Railway Station. Described as "the outstanding monument of Edwardian architecture in New Zealand", this is the best-known building in Dunedin (apart, perhaps, from Forsyth Barr Stadium). Opened in 1906, it has an atmosphere and character unique to any public building in New Zealand. The main hall is particularly fine - look down on the mosaic floor from the balcony. The station is often quiet as regular passenger services ceased in 2002, but there are daily Train_excursions, although in the early 20th century there were 100 trains per day. (updated Feb 2020)

The entrance to the town hall is from Moray Place.
North Dunedin. Not your traditional attraction but a stroll through the student accommodation-filled streets around the university can give you a real insight into Dunedin student life. Many of the often run down flats have their own names, and on the right sunny day the area comes to life as couches are dragged out onto the streets so the students can enjoy the sun and a few beverages. Castle St and Hyde St are two of the most famous flatting streets. The area does often get a bit rowdier in the evenings.

The city is quite safe, but try to walk in a group on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. People can get excessively inebriated and occasionally look to cause trouble. Exercise the same caution and common sense that you would in any other western city. The police station is in Great King Street, next to Countdown, the supermarket.
Dunedin Public Library has free Internet terminals and Wi-Fi. The Octagon has free Wi-Fi, as well as telephone booths (next to the Town Hall). The booths serve as a tourism attraction as well, due to their rarity, and distinct style characteristic for New Zealand.
Otherwise, Internet access is available at various cafes for a fee.
