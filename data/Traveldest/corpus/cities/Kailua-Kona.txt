Kailua-Kona, often referred to as "Kona" by the locals, is nestled at the bottom of the Hualalai Volcano. It is the main town on the western side of the Big Island of Hawaii, but with a population of about 20,000 (plus a few thousand more in neighboring suburbs) it is hardly a metropolis. Kona has become known for sport fishing, snorkeling, sunsets and coffee, which is cultivated on the slopes of Mount Hualalai. Since 1981, it has been the starting and finishing point of the original Ironman Triathlon, now known as the Ironman World Championship.
In ancient times, the area was considered the premier place to live due to the excellent weather and good water. Many kings made their homes here. Later, missionaries built churches and residences, turning the tiny fishing village into a small seaport. It was the home of King Kamehameha I, who united the Hawaiian Islands.
Because the mountains block the northeasterly trade winds, Kona gets very little rain and enjoys more than 300 days of sunshine a year. Kona is also home to the Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament and the Ironman Triathlon World Championship.
Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keahole (also known as Keahole Airport KOA IATA). It is the main commercial airport for the Kona coast, serving the Kona area and the resort areas of Kohala to the north. Hawaiian Airlines and Go! Airlines offer non-stop interisland service from Honolulu and Kahului, as well as trans-Pacific service from selected cities on the West Coast of the United States. Besides Hawaiian, service from the U.S. mainland is also provided by Alaska, American, Delta, and United. Direct service from Vancouver, Canada is provided by Air Canada and Westjet.
Traffic is congested. Driving in tourist-oriented areas can be slow, but the town is generally not large enough to have serious problems. Walking is a manageable way to travel in town, but you should rent a car if you want to get to resorts, beaches and other cultural locations.
Kailua-Kona is a place for ocean and outdoor recreational activities. Surfing, fishing, diving, boating, snorkeling and swimming are all popular sports in Kailua-Kona, as are hiking, biking, caving, and four wheeling. There are also many important cultural sites in the town, including the first Christian church in the islands, the Queen's Palace, and petroglyphs that can be found at Kaloko-Honokahou National Park.

Paradise Copters. Flights over macadamia nut plantations to the lava flows at Kilauea. Because Kona is twice as far from the volcano as Hilo, tours that leave from Kona are generally 2 hours long and accordingly more expensive. You may choose to drive 2¼-hr to Hilo if money is a consideration. Morning helicopter flights tend to have the least cloud cover, but also book first. If taking photos, wear dark clothing to avoid reflections from windows. A special mention should be made about the "doors off" helicopter tour, which lets you smell the lava and feel its heat.
Scuba diving. Kona has some great diving opportunities during the daytime, but the real thing to do here is the Manta Rays Night Dive. All the dive operators in town do a night dive to see the giant mantas, and this is the best and most reliable place in the world to see them. The manta rays of Kona can be up to 16 feet (5m) wide and weigh almost 2000 lbs (900 kg)! On any given night there are 1-20 rays feeding at the dive site, and by bringing lights in the water, plankton (their food) is attracted to feed them. Divers sit in sand on the bottom about 30 feet deep (9 m) and watch these huge but harmless fishes swim inches from their faces. A must do! Though it's at night, there is so much light in the water and it's so shallow that this is an easy dive for novice divers, as well as a very rewarding dive for even the most seasoned divers. Snorkelers can also get a great up close view of the mantas at the same time. All you have to do is float on the water and hold a light, it's very easy. You must be PADI-certified to do the night dive, but if you aren't you can do a snorkel night tour (sometimes called "dive" as well), which offers comparable views and excitement. Well-reviewed popular companies that do Manta Ray Night dives include: Big Island Diversdead link, Jack's Diving Locker, Kona Diving Company, Fair Wind, Kona Honudead link, Pacific Rim Divers.
Jacks Diving Locker (Manta Ray Night Dive/Snorkeling), 75-5813 Ali'i Dr (Next to the old Kona surf hotel), toll-free: +1 800-345-4807. Great place to go night diving and see huge manta rays.
Recreational Saltwater Angling. All recreational saltwater fishing is conducted on the leeward (west) side of the island. There are no charter operators on the windward (east) side, the seas are generally too rough. Kona is the hub of charter activity on the Big Island, and Honokohau Marina slips the majority of the fishing fleet. The marina is a few miles north of Kailua-Kona just off State Route 19. Prices vary considerably. A shared charter, six people conceivably unknown to one another, may be $90–100 per person for half day, while an exclusive, eight-hour trip, for up to six anglers, could run $800 or higher. The higher figures are for the boat, not per person. Fishing aboard a charter boat requires no license. Do not be fooled by the island's long-standing public relations effort. It is hard, if not impossible, to plan a trip which would perfectly coincide with sure-fire. There are times when Kona fishing is not "drop a line, catch a marlin". The point here is set up a charter with your eyes wide open. Be prepared for possible disappointment. After all, as they say, they call it "fishing and not catching" for a reason.
