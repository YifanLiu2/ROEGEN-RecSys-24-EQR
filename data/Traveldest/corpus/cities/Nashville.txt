For other places with the same name, see Nashville (disambiguation).
Nashville is the capital of the American state of Tennessee. With 716,000 residents in 2022, it is the state's largest city. Nashville is sometimes called the "Country Music Capital of the World" or more often "Music City, USA"; however, Nashville has done much to escape its country music image and become a regional center of culture and commerce. In fact, Dell, Nissan, and Saturn have all moved some operations to or near the city. The music is various; major rap artists and rock bands (Young Buck, Haystak, Kings of Leon, Paramore, and Ben Folds) claim Nashville as their hometown, and the city is also the epicenter of the contemporary Christian music industry. Nashville has been the home of the world-famous Grand Ole Opry since 1925. Nashville also has a great bar scene. If you like to drink, you can go "Honky-tonking," also known as bar-hopping.
Nashville was founded in 1779 and it grew rapidly because of its excellent location on the Cumberland River. It was incorporated in 1806 and became the county seat of Davidson County. Nashville was named the capital of Tennessee in 1843.
Like many Southern cities, Nashville was not immune to the economic woes of the post-Civil War South but it quickly rebounded. It only took a few years for the city to reclaim its important shipping and trading position and to develop a solid manufacturing base. The post-Civil War years of the late 19th century brought a new-found prosperity to Nashville. These healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, which can still be seen around the downtown area.
Since the 1970s, the city has experienced tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of Mayor (former Tennessee Governor) Phil Bredesen, who made urban renewal a priority, and fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Nashville Public Library downtown, Bridgestone Arena, and Nissan Stadium.

Nashville sits in the middle of a geographic region known as the Nashville Basin. It is surrounded by the Cumberland Highlands and is bordered by the Cumberland Plateau to the east. The Nashville Basin is characterized by rich, fertile farm country and high natural wildlife diversity.
Nashville has cool, relatively short winters and hot, humid summers, with long spells of spring and autumn in between. Winter temperatures commonly hover slightly above freezing, and a fair amount of light snow generally falls throughout the months of December to February, though large storms of 6-plus inches in a day do occur every few years. Nashville can be prone to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes during the spring and fall months. Summers are hot, but no more than the rest of the southeastern U.S. with temperatures around 90°F (32°C) during the day.

If you are looking to park Downtown in a lot or garage, be sure to have a good idea of where to park. The Metro Owned Facilities managed by the Nashville Downtown Partnership (branded as ParkIt Downtowndead link) seem to be the best deal. For example, the Metro Courthouse/Public Square Garage is $3 after 5PM and on weekends. This is much cheaper than nearby private lots.
The center of Nashville is not too big for an able-bodied person to traverse on foot in decent weather, and walking downtown can be quite pleasant. Outside downtown, Nashville is sprawling and lacks sidewalks.
Nashville is a very historic town and as such, many of its attractions are restorations or museums. Most attractions of interest to tourists are in the Downtown, Midtown, and Music Valley neighborhoods.
AT&T Building. An instantly recognizable downtown Nashville landmark, the AT&T Building, built in 1994 at 333 Commerce Street, is the tallest building in the state of Tennessee and can be seen from quite some distance if the hills aren't in your way. Its two tall spires on the building have earned it the nickname, "The Batman Building."
Shelby Street Pedestrian Bridge. Built between 1907 and 1909, the bridge was used for automobile traffic between East Nashville and Downtown. The bridge has been converted to a pedestrian bridge, and offers a spectacular view of the riverfront and downtown skyline. It is a very popular and convenient route to the Titans' football stadium.

A Civil War-era fort partially reconstructed by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. Taken by Union forces early in the war, Nashville quickly became the second most fortified city in the U.S. during the Civil War because it was seen as crucial to supplying troops engaged on the war's western front. The 1864 Battle of Nashville — a failed attempt by the Confederate army to retake the city — raged throughout what are now the residential and commercial districts on the fringes of the city. Much of the work on the fort was done by slaves and freed blacks who were rounded up and forced to work on the structure. The fort was closed for years (allegedly because it reminded many Nashvillians of the Union occupation), but reopened in 2004 with new boardwalks and interpretive signs. Free. (updated Mar 2020)

A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 615 before these if no area code is indicated.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a United States National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and an International Biosphere Reserve that straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. The park is about a 3⅓-hour drive east of Nashville, so it would be more than you could do in a day, but certainly worth a weekend trip!
Lynchburg Located 1½ hour's drive to the southeast, this small town is home to the Jack Daniels Distillery.
Natchez Trace Parkway. The 444 mi (715 km) long parkway follows the same path used by travelers from Nashville to Natchez, Mississippi during the early 19th century. It begins in the southwest part of Nashville along Highway 100 about 10 miles outside of the city. 8 mi (13 km) south from the parkway entrance in Williamson County is the nation's first segmentally constructed concrete arch bridge. The parkway provides spectacular views of the rolling hills in Tennessee.
Tullahoma Located about an hour southeast of Nashville, this town is home to the George A. Dickel distillery and a thriving aerospace industry based around Arnold Air Force Base.
