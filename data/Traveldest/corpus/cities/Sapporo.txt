Sapporo (札幌) is the capital and largest city of the northern island of Hokkaido. One of Japan's newest and most orderly cities, it has little in the way of traditional architecture. But what it lacks in "Japanese-ness" it makes up for with its lovely open, tree-filled boulevards to enjoy in summer and excellent snow (and facilities to cope with said snow) in the long winter. Its name means “The great dry field” in Ainu language.
Sapporo's population has grown from seven in 1857 to nearly 2 million in 2021.
Welcome to SAPPORO is the city's official multilingual guide site.
Sapporo has four distinct seasons. Temperatures are generally cool and pleasant in a summer, making it a popular place to escape the heat that grips much of the rest of Japan. Summer days here start longer and earlier than the rest of Japan, with sunrise as early as 03:45, and sunset around 19:00. Winters are harsh by Japanese standards, though not as harsh as the likes of Harbin or Chicago. Sapporo is one of the snowiest cities in the world (about 6 meters snowfall each year, three times as much as in Montreal), and the city makes full use of this by hosting the world-renowned Sapporo Snow Festival in February every year. Sunrise in winter is at 07:00 and sunsets are as early as 16:00 in winter.

Sapporo is Hokkaido's main transport hub.
Sapporo (SPK IATA for all airports) is served by two airports. Most international and inter-island flights to go the larger but further away New Chitose Airport, while most intra-island flights go to the smaller but closer Okadama Airport.
New Chitose Airport (CTS IATA 新千歳空港), 千歳市美々１ (SE of the city in Chitose, best reached by train or shuttle bus.), ☏ +81 123 23-0111. Customer service 06:20-23:00. All international and inter-island flights land at New Chitose Airport to the south east of the city. The route from Tokyo, particularly Haneda, is the one of the most heavily traveled in the world, with several dozen Boeing 777s flying daily on a variety of carriers and flights as low as ¥10,000 one way if you book more than one month in advance. Direct international service to Sapporo is limited to Asian countries such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea; seasonal flights operate from cities in Australia, Canada and the United States. JAL and ANA provide nonstop service from Japan's other major airports with regular international flights, including Tokyo Narita, Tokyo Haneda, Osaka Kansai and Nagoya Centrair.
Japan Railways (JR) operates train services every 15 minutes or so from New Chitose to Sapporo Station (about 40 min by rapid train, ¥1150). JR operates an information desk at the airport from 08:30-19:00 daily where Japan Rail Pass vouchers can be exchanged.
Limousine Buses run frequently to several destinations in downtown Sapporo, with one-way fares starting at ¥1000.
Door-to-door shuttle van companies include Sky Express.
Okadama Airport (OKD IATA 丘珠空港), 東区丘珠町 (north of the city), ☏ +81 11 785-7871. The smaller and more centrally located Okadama airport is only served by one airline now: Hokkaido Air System. This regional airline flies propeller ATR 42 aircraft to six airports in Hokkaido, including Hakodate and Kushiro. (updated Feb 2023)
If traveling by plane, you may wish to consider one of the air passes for foreigners sold by Japan Airlines and ANA, including the Japan Explorer Pass and Experience Japan Fare, respectively.
Getting to Sapporo by train from most other cities in Japan is time-consuming and expensive. Bullet trains began running through the underwater Seikan Tunnel to Hakodate in 2016, but construction of the Hokkaido Shinkansen to Sapporo won't be completed until 2030 at the earliest. Until then, passengers coming in through the tunnel must change between the shinkansen and a Sapporo-bound Hokuto limited express at Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto station.
The entire trip from Tokyo takes 8 hours, but at a steep one-way cost of ¥27,760. Those not using a national rail pass may wish to consider the JR East-South Hokkaido Rail Pass for ¥26,900 which covers unlimited travel on the shinkansen from Tokyo to Hakodate, express trains from Hakodate to Sapporo, as well as other JR East lines in the Tohoku region and around Tokyo. This pass can be used on any 6 days within a 14-day period in standard class cars.
If eight hours is too much to spend on trains, you may wish to split up your journey; stop to visit another city along the way, or simply find a station where you can find cheap accommodation. The latter is beneficial to Rail Pass holders. Potential options for layovers include Hakodate and Aomori.
JR Sapporo Station (札幌駅), North 2 West 1 (On the Namboku Line.), ☏ +81 11 222-6130. This is the main train station for Sapporo.
Sapporo Station serves as the hub for long distance services to/from other parts of Hokkaido, with reserved seating available. These include:
Asahikawa on the Kamui, Lilac, Okhotsk or Soya (every 30 minutes morning and evening, every hour other times)
Abashiri on the Okhotsk (2 direct trips per day) or Taisetsu (2 daily trips; change in Asahikawa)
Wakkanai on the Soya (1 direct trip per day) or Sarobetsu (2 daily trips; change in Asahikawa)
Obihiro on the Super Tokachi or Super Ōzora (11 return trips per day)
Kushiro on the Super Ōzora (6 return trips per day)
Hakodate on the Hokuto or Super Hokuto (12 return trips per day)
Noboribetsu on the Hokuto, Super Hokuto or Suzuran (17 return trips per day)
Muroran on the Suzuran (5 return trips per day)
Rapid trains run to Otaru several times per hour with connecting trains operating to the ski resort town of Niseko. During peak periods, a daily round-trip service from Sapporo to Niseko operates.
Express buses connect to most points in Hokkaido. The main terminal is next to the Bus Center-Mae station of the subway Tōzai line.
Although Sapporo is inland, there are two major ferry ports nearby: Otaru and Tomakomai. Both have scheduled car and passenger ferry service to points outside Hokkaido.
Most unusually for a Japanese city, Sapporo is logically organized thanks to its strict grid system. The main thoroughfare, the leafy Ō-Dōri (大通り, literally "Big Street"), runs east-west across the city and divides the city into North and South, while Sōsei-Gawa (創成川, literally "Creation River") divides the city into West and East, running under the main street Eki-Mae-Dōri (駅前通, literally "In Front of the Train Station Road"). The address of every block in the center is thus of the type "North X West Y" (prominently signposted at all intersections), making navigation a snap. However, most businesses provide maps to their location, building names or landmarks, because the address "North X West Y" or the like simply means that the place you are trying to find will be somewhere in the block, and blocks in the center of the city can be quite large!
Two public transportation smart cards are sold in the Sapporo area; JR Hokkaido's Kitaca and the Sapporo City Transportation Bureau's SAPICA. While the Kitaca can be used on the buses, subway and streetcars, the SAPICA cannot be used on JR trains, making the Kitaca the better choice for most visitors. If you are coming from elsewhere in Japan, the major smart cards from other regions such as Kanto's Suica and PASMO, and Kansai's ICOCA are fully interchangeable with Kitaca, meaning that you do not need to purchase an extra smart card.
The JR above-ground trains are reasonably priced and a good option for traveling in Sapporo and surroundings. The trains arrive and depart at specific times. You'll most likely want to take a train to and from the airport.
Sapporo has three subway lines, all converging at Ōdōri Station at the center of the grid. The Namboku Line ("North-South") runs north-south, the Tōzai Line ("East-West") runs along Odori east-west. Only the Tōhō Line breaks the mold by running in a C-shaped curve from northeast to southeast. Single fares cost ¥200 and up, with a choice between subway-only tickets or transfer (subway, bus and streetcar) tickets. The simplest option is the With You stored value card (lowest denomination ¥1000). On weekends and public holidays, the Donichika-Kippu (ドニチカキップ) allows unlimited 1-day subway travel for ¥500. On weekdays, the One-Day Card allows the same, but costs ¥800. There is also a Bus and Subway Transfer One-Day Card, which allows unlimited 1-day travel on buses, subways, and streetcars (¥1000). Fares for children are about half those for adults.
A streetcar of relatively little utility to most visitors trundles around the southwestern side of Sapporo, connecting to the subway at Susukino. Its most important stops are probably the Chuo Library (Main Public Library in Sapporo) and the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway. It's most useful in winter, when walking the icy footpaths to get to the library or otherwise less-accessible south-western areas of the city becomes quite treacherous. Single-trip tickets are ¥170. They also sell a "Do-san-ko Pass" on weekends and holidays which allows you to ride all you want for a day for ¥300. Since this is less than the cost of 2 normal trips, it is usually advisable to buy this if you are going to make a round trip on an eligible day.
You could try to drive in the city, but parking is problematic. Generally speaking, using the subways and buses is recommended. There are countless pay parking lots in Sapporo. One of the largest ones is about 100 m south of the Susukino South Toyoko Inn, and it's a short walk from the subway.
Clock Tower (時計台 Tokeidai) (Close to Ōdōri Station.). This rather diminutive building has become a symbol of Sapporo, mostly by being the oldest building still standing. It was constructed in 1878 for the Sapporo Agricultural College (now the Hokkaido University) and would not look out of place in "Smalltown U.S.A." The inside has a small retrospective of its history. Visitor beware, as this is for some reason a mecca for Japanese tourists coming to Sapporo who feel that no trip to Sapporo would be complete without a photo in front of the Tokeidai, but has been rated as Japan's third "most disappointing" tourist attraction! ¥200.
Shiroi Koibito Park (白い恋人パーク). Formerly "Ishiya Chocolate Factory". The factory has an incredibly corny, but fun, tour building up to a view of the actual chocolate making floor, and ending with a random toy museum. Also there are two restaurants, a souvenir store, and an hourly robot show complete with annoying music. Famous for its white chocolate, which is sold under the brand "White Lovers" (白い恋人 shiroi koibito), and is only available in Hokkaido. There is also a cake buffet available at the restaurant on the top floor for "¥1,500" but reservations must be made 3 days in advance. ¥600 for a tour, free entrance to the premises. (updated Jan 2018)
Ōdōri Park (大通公園, ōdōri-kōen). Sapporo's most famous park, it is in the center of town and is considered to be a symbol of Sapporo. Although quite narrow (one might argue that it is a nice boulevard), the park is quite long, stretching over fifteen blocks across downtown Sapporo. Filled with (during the summer) numerous flowers, trees, and fountains, Ōdōri Park provides a welcome respite from the maddening crowds of the surrounding city. In winter, there's not much to see. (updated Jan 2018)
Sapporo TV Tower (さっぽろテレビ塔) (At the eastern end of Ōdōri.). A tourist trap carbon copy of the Eiffel Tower with an observation deck 90 m high. ¥700.
Sapporo Beer Museum (サッポロビール博物館 Sapporo Biru Hakubutsukan), North 7, East 9 (next to the Ario Shopping Center; on the Loop 88 Factory bus line from the Ōdōri Subway Station; close to JR Naebo Station (ask the attendant there for a map)), ☏ +81 1-1731-4368. Daily 09:00-18:00. Run by the Sapporo Brewing Company, offers free self-guided tours or "premium" guided tours (only in Japanese, ¥500) covering the history of beer in Japan and the process of brewing.

Two short movies about the history of the brewery also have English subtitles. At the end of the tour you can taste all the different beers. Finish off the tour with more brews at the Beer Garden next door (see Eat). Beer sample ¥300-350, 3 samples ¥800. (updated Oct 2019)
Hokkaido Pioneer Village (開拓の村) (JR Bus from Sapporo or Shin-Sapporo station). A large historical village on the outskirts of Sapporo, offers a snapshot of Japan in the newly-industrialised age. The front gate (an old railway station) opens up into a series of opens alleys and buildings of the style pre-20th century. Also a variety of different gardens and shrines. Don't expect costumed performers however — everything is self-guided. An English map is available. ¥630.
Moiwayama (藻岩山) (can be reached by cable car, or with a car, the summit (and tourist center) can be reached directly). This mountain, also called Moiwa Mountain, overlooks the city and is especially worthwhile at night to observe the city lights. An entrance fee is charged for cars.
View from Asahiyama overlooking Sapporo city
Asahiyama Park (旭山記念公園 Asahiyama Kinen Kōen). A beautiful flower garden and natural park that overlooks the city center. Noted for being a good place for romance, and is particularly good for cherry blossoms in spring and autumn colors, and local wildlife such as squirrels and foxes (somewhat of a feral pest around Sapporo).

Jōzankei (定山渓) (on the southern outskirts of Sapporo (but still in the city), a 40- to 60-minute drive). This area is famous for its onsen (due perhaps to proximity to Sapporo), and for the very beautiful autumn colours (especially around the Hōheikyō Dam). Accessible by public bus from the JR Sapporo station with multiple departures daily for ¥830 one-way. (updated Jan 2018)
JR Tower (JRタワー). Daily 10:00-23:00, last entry 22:30. The redeveloped building near JR Sapporo Station marks the center of the city. It is higher than the TV tower observatory is.

Edo-jo recreated from snow/ice at Yuki Matsuri
Historical theme of Perry arriving in Japan at Yuki Matsuri
Sapporo Snow Festival (雪祭り Yuki Matsuri). First week of Feb. This is Sapporo's largest event. The festival is best known for the ice sculpture competition attracting artists from around the world, competing to create the largest and most elaborate artworks from ice and snow. The festival is focused on Odori Koen, in the centre of Sapporo. It consists of a combination of large-scale replicas and artistic sculptures; children-aimed attractions; and a separate section for world-wide competitors (where you can see a wide range of smaller artistic sculptures). The festival should be enjoyed both in the day -- but particularly at night when the sculptures (especially the larger ones) are lit up. When the weather is warmer and there's a bit of melting, the smaller sculptures are literally remade every night to ensure that they are in perfect condition the next day. Book accommodation early, because Sapporo gets booked out during the festival.
Mt. Teine (手稲山 Teineyama). A ski mountain within easy drive from most of Sapporo. This ski mountain featured in the 1972 Winter Olympics.

Noboribetsu Onsen. It's a valley with set of hotels that provide onsens, accessible in 70 minutes by express train from Sapporo station and then 15 minutes commute by bus, so easy to do as a day trip. It has a few trails, gorgeous views and onsens to soak in. (updated Jul 2017)
Hoheikyo Onsen (豊平峡温泉), 〒061-2301 札幌市南区定山渓608番地2, ☏ +81 11-598-2410. Probably the most beautiful outdoor hotspring that is easily accessible from Sapporo.

Public buses (Rapid 7, Rapid 8 and Kappa Liner) also run regularly from Sapporo JR Station for ¥840. ¥1000. (updated Jan 2018)
For those living in Japan who have an omiyage (souvenir) obligation to fill in your Japanese office when you return from your Hokkaido holiday, the best omiyage to buy in Sapporo is the ubiquitous Shiroi Koibito (白い恋人, "White Lovers"). It is a chocolate slice sandwiched in two wafers of sweet biscuit, individually wrapped and available boxed in a range of different quantities — tasty enough, but rather bland, and few Westerners would associate the taste with Japan. The original flavour is white chocolate sandwiched in plain sweet biscuit, but there is also a dark chocolate version. It's available in every souvenir store in the city (try the Sapporo JR area or Tanuki Koji Shopping Arcade when shopping for souvenirs), and also most souvenir stores around the island.
Being a wintery kind of place for a good part of each year, Sapporo also has many stores selling all manner of snow goods. At the beginning and end of each season, many good deals on the previous year's gear can be found, often at discounts of up to 60% off, sometimes more! Also, there are several sports recycle stores in the city and suburbs where good deals on barely-used gear can be found, thanks to the Japanese fondness for having new gear every season. Ask Tourist Information to help you locate second-hand sports and snow-gear stores. One such second-hand chain is Hard Off, which can be found all across Japan. Generally, the more remote the Hard Off is, the more likely you are to find a treasure!
Sapporo is famous for hairy crab (毛蟹 kegani), an expensive treat available at any seafood restaurant, and miso ramen (味噌ラーメン), a more affordable local variation of the ubiquitous noodle dish with miso paste added to the stock. The ramen in particular will warm you up nicely on a chilly winter day. Sapporo soup curry (just what it sounds like) is also increasingly famous.
As elsewhere in Hokkaido, you can also enjoy dairy products (milk, cheese, butter, chocolate and ice cream), seafood (especially as sushi), fruits (honeydew melon, strawberries) and meat (sausages, ham, bacon and beef).
Kuwanomi (桑の実) is a popular mulberry. It is red or black in color and sweet. Preserved kuwanomi can be made into jam, which is a traditional food. In elementary schools, students make kuwanomi jam every year.

Sapporo's equivalent to Tokyo's famed Tsukiji Fish Market, this is where the best of Hokkaido's catch is traded — and like its Tokyo counterpart, there are many restaurants here offering top-quality, cut-price sushi and sashimi. Popular with locals and tourists alike. The entrance to Ramen Alley in Sapporo
Aji No Tokeidai (味の時計台). The best-known ramen noodle chain in Sapporo, now franchised around the country. Many famous people have eaten here including former Japanese prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama. Miso ramen is the most popular dish, but if you want something special, order the batā-kōn ramen, a Hokkaido specialty made with a hearty broth of corn and butter. ¥600-1000.
Ramen Yokochō (ラーメン横丁) (just east of Susukino Station.). Also known as Ramen Gai, this alley is chock full of ramen shops of all varieties. Get butter corn ramen, crab ramen, and even scallop ramen. It's touristy but fun, and locals come here as well.
Sapporo Beer Garden. At the same location as the Beer Museum is the Beer Garden, an incredibly popular Genghis Khan (mutton barbeque) restaurant. Even though the dining rooms span three large buildings, come early and expect to wait. The restaurant offers a 100-minute all-you-can-eat-and-drink plan, as well as à la carte. Bibs are provided, because the food can get rather messy.
Romantei. One of the most popular sweets shops. Famous for its Chocolate Mont Blanc, a delicious concoction of sponge cake, whipped cream and ganache. Other delectables include cream puffs, apple pie, and strawberry bavarian. Located at Moiwa Mountain. There is also a takeaway shop at Tokyu Department Store, right outside Sapporo Station. A second dine-in shop is located at Sumikawa Station.
Cafe Phyton, South 2 East 1 (just north of Nijō Ichiba, on the other side of the street that bounds the northern edge). M-F 08:00-00:00, Sa Su 08:00-20:00. This small coffee shop has freshly made specialty coffees and a few Belgian beers by the bottle.

The drink of choice when in Sapporo is obviously Sapporo Beer, and a good option for this is the Beer Museum (see See).
Susukino (すすきの), to the south of the center, is one of Japan's largest nightlife (and red-light) districts, which was created to keep labourers in Hokkaido. It has a somewhat unsavory reputation due to heavy yakuza involvement in the business, but is safe for travelers not looking for trouble. Get there on the subway Namboku line, Susukino station.

The hot springs and mossy canyons of Shikotsu-Toya National Park are within easy striking distance of Sapporo.
Asahikawa's Asahiyama Zoo is the most famous and most visited zoo in Japan, despite it being 2 hours away by train. Its most famous exhibits are the penguins which walk around the park twice a day, and the seals that you can see swim vertically through a large transparent pipe. It also features polar bears, wolves, Japanese deer, big cats, different kinds of monkeys and more. It's most impressive in winter when it's covered in snow (have you ever seen a giraffe walking in snow?) but a few of the exhibits are also closed during this season.
