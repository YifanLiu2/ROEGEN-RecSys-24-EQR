Sharjah (Arabic: الشارقة) is the third largest city in the United Arab Emirates and the capital of Sharjah emirate. Sharjah is known for its Arabic and Islamic architecture as well as its libraries, Islamic museums, and cultural centers. The city is known as the cultural and literature hub of the United Arab Emirates. The city is rooted in its Arabic and Islamic heritage with many Umayyad and Abbasid-styled buildings and offers a glimpse of Arabic and Islamic environment in an otherwise largely westernized country. It is a major hub for family friendly environment and activities and has a more conservative atmosphere. The city has many green parks, apartment complexes, and a large community of Arabs from all the Arab world making the city an effective cultural meeting point for many different communities of Arabs.
In contrast to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, Sharjah offers visitors a vastly larger view into Arabic and Islamic art, literature, and architecture. It's a usual destination for visitors who are looking for a cultural and a more local experience of Arabia and Islamic atmosphere compared to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
"Smile you're in Sharjah!"
A common slogan used around the city to describe the family friendly atmosphere of the city. The word Sharq (short form of Mashriq) means east in Arabic. Sharjah is east of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, thus its name. Its classical Arabic form is "Al Shareqah".
Sharjah is very closely connected to Dubai through the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area, with commuter traffic creating rush hour traffic jams. Many people live in Sharjah but work in Dubai to take advantage of lower rents, hence traffic from Sharjah to Dubai and Dubai to Sharjah is largely expected in rush hours.
The emirate is considerably larger than Dubai, with coastline on both west and east coasts of the peninsula, and with exclaves of Kalba, Khor Fakkan, and Dibba Al Hisn. The road to the east coast goes through rugged Al Hajar mountains. Public buildings in the Emirate are all in Umayyad and Abbasid architecture, and were all designed by the present Shaikh (a qualified architect). Therefore, the city offers a nice visual change and a more cultural atmosphere from the usual fare of skyscrapers in other Emirates.
The Sharjah Commerce and Tourism website dead link has sections on business, heritage, leisure, education, and coast.
As in the rest of the UAE, Arabic is the official language, although most residents speak other languages - particularly Hindi, Urdu and Tagalog. English is widely spoken in shops, souqs, and hotels.

Sharjah International Airport (SHJ IATA) (15 km from Sharjah city). It is the home of the low-cost carrier Air Arabia which has connections with various Middle East and Indian Subcontinent cities. Also, Air India Express connects most larger airports in India to Sharjah—a good way to fly into smaller places directly, like Leh in Ladakh instead of going through Delhi first. (updated Nov 2017)
By bus – Regular 24/7 buses (every ½-1 hr) run the distance of 20 km between the airport and Al Jubail Bus Station (Sharjah center aka Rolla)—10 dirham, cash only. From Al Jubail, you can connect to Abu Dhabi center (direct bus, 40-50 dirham), Abu Dhabi Airport via Ibn Battatu (see Abu Dhabi International Airport#By bus for details), Dubai (direct bus, 10-15 dirham), Dubai Airport via Deira City Center (red metro from there to the airport, less than 10 dirham with card possible).

By taxi – To go to Dubai International Airport, this will set you back at around 100 dirham. But Dubai Airport, just 20 km by road away, has many more international connections and is the more popular gateway to UAE.
Bus travel to Dubai is possible via an inter-emirate bus service run by the Government of Dubai Road and Transport Authority. Most buses arrive at  Al Jubail bus station, next to the Sharjah Fish market and the Sharjah Fruit and Vegetable market, nearby to the Central Souk. A bus from Sharjah to Dubai can take about 1 hr and costs 5 dirham. Timetables can be found at the RTA website.
Taxis are widely available. Taxis can travel from other emirates such as from Dubai to Sharjah or from Ajman to Sharjah and vice versa without any restrictions. Traveling from farther emirates such as Abu Dhabi or Ras Al Khaimah is also an option, but taxi fares may be costly.

You may also call the government sponsored Sharjah taxi service dead link to request a taxis to come to your location.
