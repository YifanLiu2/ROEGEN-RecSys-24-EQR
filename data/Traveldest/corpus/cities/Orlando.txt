Orlando deserves its reputation as the theme park capital of the world. The Greater Orlando area teems with an energetic spirit that almost never slows, and with an estimated 52 million visitors a year, how could it? Of course, many of those tourists are coming for the two pillars that gift the area its reputation: Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando (though Disney is not within the Orlando city limits). But Orlando holds a lot to offer besides those two amusement meccas. Of course, the International Drive area near Universal contains a multitude of independent attractions and smaller theme parks as well as hotels and restaurants galore. Beyond that, however, lies much to be explored. Expansive areas of untouched wilderness, world-class museums and theaters, and unique dining and nightlife in downtown are a few of the things that await the traveller who ventures outside of the constructed worlds of the theme parks.
At the center of the state of Florida, in Orange County, Orlando is about an hour from each coast. The majority of the area attractions are southwest of the city, in Lake Buena Vista (where Disney World is), Kissimmee, Bay Lake, Celebration and other nearby communities.
Lake Eola in downtown Orlando, Florida.The Orlando area contains some of the world's largest and most famous theme park resorts. However, only one, Universal Orlando, is within the city limits. Walt Disney World and SeaWorld are in the immediate area, as are many of the more minor tourist attractions, and as Orlando is most associated with these popular attractions, you will find details and descriptions of them below.
Until the Civil War, Orange County was widely considered a rural backwater. However, a Reconstruction-era boom in the area's population and the simultaneous growth of the citrus industry led to the establishment of the city of Orlando in 1885. Ten years later, the "Great Freeze" destroyed much of the citrus crop, forcing farmers to sell and the industry to shift southward.
Around the turn of the 19th century, Orlando became a somewhat popular resort city, and its downtown population grew during the Florida Land Boom of the 1920s. During World War II, the United States Air Force positioned a base in the city, and the military would go on to become Orlando's major industry through the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1965, Walt Disney went on television to announce his plans for "The Florida Project", the most important moment in Orlando's history. Walt Disney World opened in 1971 with one theme park – the Magic Kingdom – and development and population explosion rocketed the city into what it is today. Over the subsequent years, tourism has further entrenched itself as the center of Orlando's economy. SeaWorld Orlando opened in 1973, and Epcot, the second Disney theme park, came in 1982. Disney's Hollywood Studios came in 1989, and Universal Studios Florida a year later. The Universal Orlando resort was born with the opening of the Islands of Adventure theme park in 1999, just a year after Disney's fourth park, Animal Kingdom, opened. With these parks came countless hotels, restaurants, and other tourist attractions spread across the city.
English is the primary language spoken in Orlando, but Spanish is spoken by a portion of the population as well. Due to the high number of international travelers coming to the city, nearly all of the theme parks and resorts, and many of the hotels and restaurants provide menus, guide maps, and other information in a variety of languages ranging from English and Spanish to French, Chinese, and Portuguese. Many attractions also employ bilingual or multilingual staff.
Orlando sits nearly in the center of the state, about an hour's drive from both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, surrounded by suburban towns on all sides. Bordering Orlando to the north is Altamonte Springs, Maitland and Winter Park. Further north, the city of Sanford contains Orlando-Sanford International Airport, a secondary airport serving the city, and DeLand, where Stetson University is. To the southwest of the city lies Williamsburg (where SeaWorld is) and Lake Buena Vista (where Disney World is), as well as the Disney-inspired town of Celebration. The main airport is directly south of the city, as well as the town of Kissimmee.
There are lakes around the city and many of Orlando's suburbs have shorelines. Some of these, such as Lake Monroe, are a few miles across and are popular recreation areas. They form barriers between the otherwise adjacent suburbs.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Many say Central Florida has two seasons: hot and hotter. Orlando has temperate winters affected by the occasional cold front; hot summers with daily thunderstorms; and warm, balmy springs and autumns.
Spring in Orlando has highs in the 80s (27 °C) in March & April transitioning to around 90 °F (32 °C) in May and the low to mid-90s in June. Spring is the driest time of year, and in the past decade some spring months have seen less than a half-inch of rain. This is the time of year in which many small wildfires appear around the region, but this should not affect anyone who stays in the urban areas. March and April are great times to visit with dry days, clear skies, and warm temperatures with no cold fronts. In comparison, late May and early June are filled hot, humid, or dry days.
While most think of Florida as a year-round paradise, there are at least ten winter mornings each year when lows fall to near freezing. However, even on the coldest of mornings, highs reach into the 50s and 60s. Every 3-4 years, snow flurries will fall somewhere in the region. However, only once since records began in 1948 has any measurable snow fallen in the city (" in/ cm in Jan 1977). So if you visit between November and March, be safe and bring a jacket!
Summer brings daily thunderstorms starting in June. Highs from mid-June to mid-September are in the mid 90s, with 90 °F (32 °C) often being reached by 10 or 11AM, and lows in the 70s (23 °C). Due to Orlando's proximity to two coasts, thunderstorms form everyday in the summer from the humid ocean breezes that cross over land and heat up. Sometimes violent thunderstorms occur, see the "Stay Safe" section. After passing, they will often drop temperatures into the low 80s (28 °C), a welcome relief from the hot temperatures earlier in the day.
Autumn varies much more from year-to-year than spring. The daily thunderstorms taper off in September, leaving highs in the mid to upper 80s (29 °C) until mid-October. The first cold front of the season will usually pass by late October, plunging highs into the 70s (24 °C) and lows into the 50s (12 °C) and upper 40s (10 °C). The cooling trend continues into November and December, with highs falling into the 70s (24 °C) by late December and lows into the 50s (12 °C). These temperatures can be affected by the occasional cold front, which can plunge highs into the 60s (18 °C) and 50s (12 °C) and lows into the 40s (7 °C) and as low as freezing (32 °F/0 °C) by mid-December.
Winter is much the same as November and December. Highs are in the 70s (24 °C), lows in the 50s (12 °C), affected every week or two by cold fronts. With those fronts, highs can drop into the 50s (12 °C) and lows into the 30s (2 °C). Sub-freezing mornings typically occur two or three times a year. Small changes in latitude make substantial differences to temperature in the area, and every few miles north takes one or two degrees off the temperature on cold days.
Most tourists visit Orlando for summer vacations between June and August, or for spring breaks in March and April. Ironically, the quieter times correspond to the best weather in the Orlando area. Visiting when the weather isn't so hot means fewer people in the area, with emptier parks and more comfortable weather.
The atrium of Orlando International Airport.
Main article: Orlando International Airport
Orlando International Airport (MCO IATA). The city's primary airport and the busiest airport in the state. It's  mi ( km) southeast of downtown, close to the attractions in the area, and is a hub or focus city for Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways & Southwest Airlines. Flights are also offered from many international destinations throughout North America, South America and Europe.
Orlando International has two key components: landside and airside. There is a central landside terminal (one building divided into sides "A" and "B"), containing the airline counters, baggage claim, rental car agencies, and a hotel. It's connected by elevated trams to four other terminals, known as Airside 1-4, where the boarding gates are. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in both the central terminal and the four airsides. A newly constructed "C" terminal isn't connected to the central (A/B) terminal but is accessible via the same elevated tram system. Security lines can become extremely long (1 hr+) during the summer tourist season and near holidays. Combined with long check-in lines, it is advisable to arrive 2–3 hours before your scheduled departure.
Orlando is the "rental car capital of the world" and, as can be expected, there are many car rental agencies at the airport offering a large number and wide range of vehicles for rental. There are also many off-site car rental agencies which provide free shuttles to their location and may offer lower prices (See OIA website.)
Public transportation in the Orlando area is provided by the Lynx (☏ +1 407-841-5969) bus system. Lynx buses can be found at Ground Transportation (Level 1) of the landside terminal's "A" side, in Commercial Lane spaces A38-A41. Fares are $2/ride with free transfers within 90 minutes. Day passes are $ and a 7-day pass costs $16. Discounted fares for youth and the elderly require riders to present a Lynx-issued ID, available only by applying at the Central Station Terminal with a 5-7 day turnaround and therefore not viable for short-term visitors. Routes from the airport can get you to downtown, International Drive, Walt Disney World, and nearby Apopka.
Almost every mid- to high-priced hotel in the city offers airport transfers. Additionally, there are several shuttle services options that run from the airport to various points, including Kissimmee, the theme parks, the University of Central Florida, and the cruise port at Cape Canaveral. Approximate rates for shuttle vans range from $18–26 depending on your destination (see OIA website for details on local transport). You may wish to contact your hotel to inquire about discounts on certain shuttles or possible free airport transfers. Disney and Universal also offer free shuttles to their on-site resorts.
Taxi cabs/vans may carry up to 9 passengers with luggage and may be found at Ground Transportation (Level 1) of the "A" and "B" sides of the landside terminal. Rates are determined by a taximeter, regardless of the number of passengers, and flat fares are prohibited.
Orlando-Sanford International Airport (SFB IATA). A secondary airport which serves the Orlando, 28 mi (45 km) northeast of Orlando (via SR 408 and I-4 and 417) in Sanford. The airport is served by Allegiant, Flair and airlines chartered by tour operators. Check with airline or tour operator for schedules.

Other regional airports within an hour and a half drive include Daytona Beach International Airport (DAB IATA); served by Avelo, Delta and American; and Melbourne International Airport (MLB IATA); served by Allegiant, American Eagle, Avelo, Delta, Sun Country, and TUI (from the UK). In addition, Orlando area visitors who plan on visiting the Gulf Coast can also flying into Tampa International Airport (TPA IATA), about 80 mi (130 km) west/southwest of Orlando, or just over an hour's drive west/southwest, as it is less crowded and a bit easier to access by car.
If you plan on visiting more than just Orlando and plan on taking international flights, you may want to consider flying in to Miami International Airport (MIA IATA), 200 mi (320 km) south, which offers more international flights and is the largest U.S. gateway for flights from South and Central America and the Caribbean. Accessible by Greyhound, Red Coach, Megabus or Amtrak.
Orlando Executive Airport and Kissimmee Airport are other options to consider if you are flying in for the theme parks. Orlando Executive and Kissimmee exclusively serves general aviation and some air taxi. Orlando-Sanford International serves also general aviation alongside its commercial use.
Orlando Executive Airport provides 24-hour service through two fixed based operators, SheltAir Aviation Services and Showalter Flying Services. Air taxi and air charter companies such as Orlando Jet Charter fly a variety of private charter aircraft and jets, from charter luxury Gulfstreams down to economical piston twins for small groups and individuals.
Orlando's historic Amtrak station.
Main article: Rail travel in the United States
Orlando has a downtown Amtrak station that provides service from destinations such as Miami, but also connects to other points as far north as New York City via the Silver Star and Silver Meteor lines. Journey times are about 23 hours from New York and five hours from Miami. While trains are comfortable and includes both seating and sleeper options, delays are quite common.
Also, nearby Sanford is the southern terminus of the Auto Train which carries passengers and automobiles between Sanford and Lorton, Virginia, effectively serving as a car-rail link from Orlando to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The train runs daily with no intermediate stops and takes 17½ hours one way.
For intercity trips within Florida, Brightline offers fast and frequent connections with Miami (3½ hours) via West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale. Trains arrive and depart from a station at Orlando International Airport. Convenient if you have a connecting flight, but for other destinations within Orlando a change is needed.
Finally, while SunRail is mainly a commuter rail system within Orlando, it can be used to travel from Kissimmee, through the greater Orlando Metro Area, to Deltona (DeBary Station). There are several SunRail stations within greater Orlando.
Orlando railway station, 1400 Sligh Blvd (One mile south of downtown). Built 1926 in a Spanish Mission architectural style, the station is also known as Orlando Health/Amtrak Station. Same station/cross platform transfers between SunRail and Amtrak are only in Winter Park, Orlando Health and Kissimmee. (updated Sep 2023)
Sanford Auto Train Station (Amtrak Auto Train), 600 S Persimmon, Sanford. Separate station in Sanford for the Auto Train to load and unload vehicles and passengers. (updated Jan 2021)
Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal, 1 Jeff Fuqua Blvd. Terminus for Brightline intercity trains from Miami. (updated Sep 2023)

Being in the middle of the state, Orlando serves as a de-facto hub for multiple intercity bus companies for intrastate bus services. From here buses go to all directions of the state such as Tallahassee (NW), Miami-Dade (SE), Naples (SW), Jacksonville (NE) and points in between. Locally they have their own separate bus stations and stops in different parts of town that are far from the airports, Amtrak/Sunrail train stations and each other. Some may offer additional local stops in addition to their own bus stations. Check individual bus company websites for specific cities served, schedules, fares and local station/stop locations:

Interstate 4 provides access to Orlando from Tampa and Daytona Beach. Florida’s Turnpike can be used to connect from the Miami area.
Open road tolling is employed along most of Orlando's toll roads. A driver with a SunPass or E-Pass transponder and a prepaid account continues straight along the road at the speed limit, with the toll accounted for electronically; drivers paying cash (almost all tourists) must follow signage that diverts them to toll booths constructed off to the right side of the highway. Drivers who don't have transponders and continue going straight past the toll booth are photographed and ticketed. The fine is $100 per offense, plus tolls outstanding.
Some rental car agencies use Sunpass or toll-by-plate to cover tolls, with incurred tolls charged to the customer's credit card. Inquire with the company when renting a car.
Toll roads in the Orlando area are only compatible with Florida's SunPass and the older E-Pass, North Carolina Quick Pass, Georgia's Peach Pass, and within the Orlando area only, E-Z Pass.
If you mistakenly drive through a SunPass lane, you can still contact the Florida DoT to pay the toll without being fined; see sunpass.com/violationsMissedToll or contact ☏ +1-888-824-8655. You will need the license plate number and, to the best of your knowledge, note the date, time, and location of the missed toll.
The highway is omnipresent in Orlando, and it is a very easy and convenient (if sometimes congested) way to get to your destination. Orlando is a sprawling city, with most attractions lying far to the south of downtown and spreading into adjacent cities like Kissimmee. The roads are all wide and easy to drive on, with all major attractions well-signed. However, traffic jams around downtown are common during the morning and afternoon rush hours, and around the tourist areas when the theme parks close up each night. Orlando ranks 8th in the nation in terms of traffic congestion, and there are numerous ongoing construction projects on area highways. Traffic information is available from electronic signs over roadways, most local radio stations, and by calling 511 (a free, automated service which provides current traffic info).
As with most urban areas in the U.S., there are plenty of drivers who prefer to speed and drive aggressively. The Orlando area receives over 50 million visitors each year, many who drive while in town with little knowledge of the roads, while also home to 2 million permanent residents. The combination of these two types of drivers can make Orlando's roads a bit hectic at times. Speed limits in the Orlando area are higher than some parts of the U.S., around 45-50 mph (~80 km/h) on major roads. The speed limit on highways like Interstate 4 and the toll roads is 65 mph (~110 km/h), with urban sections closer to downtown posted at 55 mph (~90 km/h). Drivers in the left lane tend to drive 5-15 mph faster than the speed limit. While it is the law to keep right except to pass, this is not strictly enforced.
The main highway through Orlando, and the only Interstate serving it, is Interstate 4 (commonly called "I-4") which runs diagonally from northeast to southwest through the Orlando area. Major construction on it has widened the highway through areas south of the Beachline Expressway (SR 528), making it a commuter-friendly highway (except for traffic during rush hours and on weekend evenings). Downtown Orlando; International Drive; the Amway Center; the Mall at Millenia; Arabian Nights dinner theater; and theme parks and resorts such as Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld are all along or near I-4.
Every other highway in the Orlando area besides I-4 is a toll road. While the tolls are modest for short trips within Orlando, they can quickly add up on longer drives. For example, bypassing Orlando on SR 417 is $ for the 55 mi (89 km) drive.
& The main interstate highway through Orlando, between I-95 in Daytona Beach and I-75 in Tampa. Interstate 4 is still toll-free. The section of I-4 through Orlando runs north-south but is signed "east" (going north & east towards Daytona Beach) and "west" (south & west towards Tampa). US 92 closely parallels or is superseded by I-4 in many places between Tampa and Daytona Beach.
US Hwy 17-92 run concurrent with each other between DeLand in Volusia County and Lake Alfred in Polk County. It goes from the south of Sanford to downtown Orlando as Orlando Ave. It follows Colonial Dr (SR-50) from Orlando Ave to Orange Blossom Trail (OBT) where it continues south on OBT, concurrent with US Hwy 441, towards Kissimmee.
Orange Blossom Trail (OBT) serves as the main north-south thoroughfare through Orlando between Apopka and Kissimmee. OBT runs parallel to I-4 from W Colonial Dr to Kissimmee concurrent with US 92 and US 17. Going north, US Hwy 441 continues into Mount Dora from Apopka. From Kissimmee US Hwy 441 follows US Hwy 192, through St Cloud, to its own turn off at Holopaw to continue south. Orange Blossom Trail is a surface street with multiple traffic lights at slower speeds.
Colonial Dr goes east-west across the Orlando area including downtown Orlando. Overall it connects US 1 in Titusville (50 mi (80 km) east of Orlando) in the east coast to US 19 in Spring Hill at 80 mi (130 km) west of Orlando. Like the OBT it goes through Orlando as a surface street with multiple traffic lights at slower speeds.
East-West Expressway (Toll 408), serves as an auxiliary bypass of SR-50, which starts at Florida's Turnpike in the city of Ocoee west of Orlando, and travels through downtown Orlando before ending near the University of Central Florida at SR 50.
Central Florida GreeneWay (Toll 417), which starts at I-4 in Sanford and forms a partial beltway to the west of Orlando, passing both Orlando-Sanford International Airport and Orlando International Airport before ending just west of SR 192 south of Celebration near Walt Disney World.
Western Beltway (Toll 429), which starts at U.S. 41 in Apopka and takes you past the Florida's Turnpike and Disney World, ending at I-4 just west of SR 192 and Disney World, near SR 417.
& Beachline Expressway (Toll 528), which runs east from I-4 (exit 72) to the Space Coast area, ending near Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral, home of the Kennedy Space Center.
Florida's Turnpike, which starts in Miami at I-95 and heads north through Orlando, ending in Wildwood at I-75.
In Orlando, the tourist area is centered on International Drive, a strip of road south of downtown that runs parallel to I-4 for about 10 miles (16 km). Many tourist-focused shops, restaurants, hotels, and attractions can be found along "I-Drive". Due to this, it is excruciatingly hard to drive on and find parking in the area on weekends, especially in the summer and from Thanksgiving to New Year's. Trips to this area are best done by bus, taxi, or rideshare app during such times.
Other major roads include: U.S. 192 in Kissimmee (fronted by thousands of small shops and older attractions), Orange Blossom Trail (US 17/92/441, a north–south alternative to I-4), John Young Parkway (which can be an alternative to US-441), and SR 50 on Colonial Dr (east–west route along north side of downtown).
A few local laws to keep in mind:
Lights on when raining. It is the law in Florida to have headlights on when it is raining.
Move over when passing stopped emergency vehicles. Florida has a so-called "move over" law, which compels drivers to move out of the lane closest to stopped emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, fire trucks). If it is not safe to do so, drivers must slow down 20 mph below the speed limit to pass parked vehicles (this is higher than any other U.S. state with such a law, where it's normally 5-15 mph below the speed limit).
If you arrive by plane via Orlando International Airport and pick up a rental car there, you can go through the north exit and head to SR 528 West to get to International Drive, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld. This will require $ in tolls. Alternatively, you can take a direct route to Walt Disney World by going through the south exit and taking SR 417 South, following it to Exit 5, and taking SR 536 straight into Disney. This requires $2 in tolls. Toll booths along this expressway use open road tolling: see note above in box.

There's also an unlimited 1-day pass available for $5 per person. These 1-day passes, as well as multi-day passes, are not sold on the bus but are available in many locations around International Drive. However, because of the very limited route coverage of I-Ride (it goes nowhere near Disney) the better choice for many visitors is to use LYNX buses (e.g., bus 8, 42, 50, or 111).
With all of the tourists, it's no surprise dozens of taxi companies operate in the region. It's not be a problem to find a taxi from Orlando International Airport (MCO) to your hotel or from the hotel to a theme park, restaurant or mall. Mears Transportation Group, ☏ +1 888-983-3346, dominates taxi service in Orlando and operates several different brands (Yellow Cab Company, Checker Cab Company, and City Cab Company) with identical rates and yellow color. Taxi fares and rates are determined by the taximeter (no flat rates). Beware of taxis without meters, which are widely reported to be rip-offs. Plan ahead and know your route and never hail a cab off the street. Always call, or have your hotel call, to arrange for a cab to collect you.
Rideshare services, like Uber and Lyft, can be hailed and can drop you off anywhere in Orlando (including at MCO and the theme parks). However, MCO limits pickups to the high-end services, e.g. Select XL and Uber Black. They pick at the Express Pickup Tunnel on Level 1 directly next to the rental car counters, and they probably translate to a rate comparable to, or higher than, the regular taxi services at MCO.
The Go Orlando City Pass is very useful to pay one price to visit many of these attractions.

Despite the proximity of the theme parks and other tourist attractions, the city center has a lot to offer on its own. Downtown Orlando is a growing area around Orange Avenue that is packed with bars, clubs, restaurants, theaters, and concert venues. The main strip on Orange Avenue is closed down to cars most nights because of the large number of pedestrians. Just a few blocks over is Lake Eola, a picturesque park situated around a swan-filled lake with a lighted fountain that has been established as an icon of Orlando. On one side of the lake stands the historic outdoor shell theater, where tourists and locals alike can watch a production of the Nutcracker every December. Swan-shaped paddle boats are available for rental as well. Meanwhile, Wall Street, a small pedestrian-only alley off of Orange Avenue that houses several restaurants and bars, has been taking over for Church Street as the main nightlife hotspot. There are frequent concerts there, providing an area for bands to play during everything from Cinco de Mayo to the Capital One Bowl and Citrus Bowl celebration weeks.

Not a drop to drink?
Orlando's tap water is notorious among travelers for being unpalatable; many describe a sulfuric or metallic taste. Just as many find it perfectly drinkable, however, and it's absolutely as safe to drink as any other municipal water supply in the U.S. Either way, those who think they might be sensitive to Orlando's unique terroir should consider taking their refreshment from a bottle or can.

Visit Orlando partners with many restaurants in the Orlando area to offer a promotional Magical Dining monthdead link. During the promotion, partner restaurants offer three-course, prix fixe dinners for $35 per person (plus tax and gratuity). Typically the event is held in late August through September, which tends to be a slow season for the local attractions and restaurants are looking to bring in additional guests.
Orlando nightlife away from the theme parks is centered mostly around Central Boulevard and Orange Avenue in downtown Orlando. Here you can walk and find many bars. A short walk away is the tiny Thornton Park District, near the intersection of Washington and Summerlin. Among the dozens of cafes and pubs, you might stop in for a drink and a quick bite at Dexter's on Washington. For local flair head across the street to Burton's Frosty Mug, or sample the hip urban environment at the trendy HUE at the corner of Washington and Central.
Although most of the downtown Central avenue crowd is comprised of the "twentysomething" generation, for a more 30s-and-over entertainment experience, one can enjoy live jazz on many nights in the lounge of the Grand Bohemian Hotel, downtown on Orange Avenue. The jazz is excellent and the ambiance is quite comfortable, although drinks tend to be pretty pricey here.
Also, for a more professional crowd with a Latin twist, there is the Samba Room, on Sand Lake Road, about 3/4 west of I-4. This is a lively restaurant and happy hour type of place. The look is chic and the locals and tourists alike gather here for a quality food, beverage and people watching experience. You should ditch the shorts and flip-flops for a more casual chic look, but if you do you will be rewarded with a nice experience here. If you are traveling west on Sand Lake Road, after passing I-4, The Samba Room is on the left in a large shopping plaza. Latin food, music and mojitos are just some of the specialties here.
Across the street from the Samba Room, on Sand Lake Road, is the Old Vines wine bar, featuring live jazz usually from Thursday through Saturday nights. The wine selection is extensive and the live jazz is some of the best in town. The jazz is performed in the front of the room by the entrance. There is a divider that separates the more intimate rear portion of the establishment, which is the main dining area.
There are quite a few places to enjoy quality dining and drinks along Park Avenue in Winter Park, an adjacent suburb which is just northeast of Orlando. Winter Park is known for its many older grande homes that dominate the more historic sections of this suburb affectionately referred to by many as the center of Orlando's "old money." Park Avenue is an active pedestrian street featuring trendy shoppes, galleries, restaurants and nightspots. It has grown from a one-street attraction to more of a district, as several nearby streets have now added similar attractions.
Of particular interest and uniqueness on Park Avenue is the Wine Room, a converted bank featuring hundreds of wines available for self-serve sampling. The mode of purchasing here is to pre-load a wine "credit card" supplied by the Wine Room. You are then at liberty to peruse the entire building and select any wine you wish to try, merely by inserting your "credit card." Each wine station automatically deducts the value of your current purchase and advises you of your card balance. Dress is very casual here and you are likely to meet both locals and visitors, all sampling and enjoying their vinos of choice throughout the night.

With a hotel around virtually every corner (actually 4 or 5 around every corner) it seems impossible to throw a rock and not hit a hotel. There are hotels to meet every traveler's need, whether it be a hostel or a 5-star resort, although many visiting families often prefer to rent a private villa as they usually provide much more personal space and have their own private facilities. There are also a lot of lodgings in the surrounding cities and towns.

Never leave children, pets, or the elderly in a parked car for any length of time! Due to high temperature for most of the year, the interior of a parked car can easily heat to lethal temperatures in a short amount of time. During the summer, the interior of a parked car can reach 130-170°F (55-75°C) in just 15 minutes, regardless of the color of the exterior or interior, or whether the windows are open a small amount. You not only risk death, but it is illegal and the consequences are taken VERY seriously, including thousands in fines, potential imprisonment, and the involvement of the Florida Department of Children and Families and/or Adult Protective Services.
Like most cities in America, there are certain areas of Orlando which are more dangerous than others. Some areas travelers should be cautious of are:
Parramore District, area in downtown Orlando is a location where a lot of the area's homeless population congregates and crime rates are higher in this area.
Orange Blossom Trail, north of Sand Lake Road is known to be a bit of an unofficial red light district. Drug and prostitution-related crime is common here. Prostitution is not legal in Orlando, so you could spend a night in jail if you decide to indulge.
Pine Hills, around Silver Star Road and Pine Hills Road west of John Young Parkway. This is a lower income area that has struggled with high crime rates. The Greyhound bus station is in Pine Hills and is a place to use caution.
While it is unlikely that any one individual would experience serious crime in these areas, tourists stand out in these areas, and can unwittingly do things that can make them targets for criminal behavior, so it is sensible to stay away.
While crime in the Orlando area is not particularly high, with the annual tourists far outnumbering the regional population (~2 million), a substantial amount of local crime ends up being directed at tourists. The most common crimes are theft of items from cars and hotels, so following common sense travel precautions are particularly important in an area like Orlando.
Never leave valuable items in your car unattended, and get any purchased items to your hotel room as soon as possible. Consider utilizing the hotel room safe.
Never leave small children unattended for any length of time, especially at a pool. Most hotel pools do not have lifeguards.
Hotel room invasions do occur, especially open-air hotel and motel rooms when the victim leaves their hotel room unlocked and not dead-bolted. When you are in a hotel room, always lock your doors behind you, even if you expect someone in a minute or two.
While hurricanes attract most of the attention, the proximity to two coasts also brings frequent, and sometimes dangerous, thunderstorms. These occur nearly every day during the rainy season from mid-June through September. While some days it may only rain for 10 minutes, other thunderstorms can last for hours and its not unheard of for one location to remain dry while another spot 10 miles away gets a couple inches of rain on an afternoon. The summer thunderstorms are the main reason that Florida is the lightning capital of the western hemisphere. During these storms it is best to remain indoors due to the danger posed by frequent cloud-to-ground lightning. Golfers are especially vulnerable. A couple of dozen people are killed each year by lightning in Florida and many more spend much time receiving treatment for lightning strikes.
Pets are better off left with a friend or in a kennel. If you choose to bring your pet, note that most theme parks and hotels prohibit pets but may provide kennels for a fee. Under the ADA laws, businesses are required to accommodate service animals, which are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities; however, emotional support animals, comfort animals, and therapy dogs are not covered by the ADA so be prepared to find alternate accommodations if they are refused entry. Also note above about interior temperatures in parked cars.
Ten-digit dialing is in effect in the Orlando area. All calls from or within the area, even local calls, require dialing the area code. There are some public pay phones scattered around the city, but they are becoming increasingly rare with the predominance of cell phones. It is not safe to assume you will be able to find a pay phone at any given time.
Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau, 8723 International Dr, toll-free: +1-800-972-3304. The official sales and marketing organization for the Orlando and Orange County area.
Telephone Area Codes in and around the city of Orlando begin with 407, 321 or 689.
It is common for many of the larger hotels and lodgings in the area to offer free internet access for their guests.
Most consulates are honorary which means they offer limited services to travelers and their nationals living in the area and usually available by appointment only. They are located in different parts of the city rather than in a certain area. The nearest cities for additional foreign consulates for Florida and the Southeastern US, are in Miami and Atlanta. The consulate of Greece is in Tampa while the consulates of Panama and Peru are in both Miami and Tampa:

Walt Disney World, about 35 minutes southwest of Orlando, is so expansive that it needs its own travel guide.
Also within an hour of downtown Orlando:
Altamonte Springs - home of the Altamonte Mall, several parks including Crane's Roost Park, numerous chain restaurants, and many furniture stores.
Celebration - the Disney-designed and -operated community
Kissimmee - Large suburb close to Disney World.
Winter Haven - About 30 miles south of Disney off US27. Home to Legoland Florida.
A bit further, but good day trips or next destinations include:
Cocoa Beach - Closest beach to Orlando it boasts world-famous surfing.
Cape Canaveral - Home to the Kennedy Space Center and its large visitor's complex, which showcases many space-related artifacts (including some large rockets). While the space shuttle that once attracted tens of thousands of onlookers for lift-off no longer flies, there are occasional rocket launches throughout the year.
Daytona Beach - Home of NASCAR's famous Daytona 500 race, "Bike Week", and a popular beach.
Canaveral National Seashore 24 miles of undeveloped shore; central Florida's only nude(in one spot) beach; over 1000-year-old Indian relics; 58,000 acres for hiking, horseback riding, and biking; but no camping or concessions.
Melbourne/Melbourne Beach - Historic downtown and a great but "less touristy" beach than most on the Space Coast, beachfront camping nearby.
New Smyrna Beach - Popular beach destination.
Ocala National Forest - Great hiking and camping. Home to much fauna, including black bears and the Florida panther.
Port St. Lucie, Fort Pierce, and much of the Treasure Coast - great boating spots and an awesome opportunity to find sunken treasure from the 1715 wrecks, an hour or two down the Turnpike.
Tampa and St. Petersburg - At the west end of I-4. Tampa is home to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, the Florida State Fairgrounds and the famous Ybor City historic district. St. Petersburg hosts, among other things, Sunken Gardens and the Salvador Dalí Museum, and has its own well-known beaches.
