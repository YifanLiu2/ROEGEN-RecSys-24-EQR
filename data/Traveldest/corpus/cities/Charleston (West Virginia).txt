Charleston, established in 1794, is the state capital of West Virginia. With a population of about 49,000 in 2020, Charleston is the largest city in West Virginia. It's at the junction of Interstates 77, 79, and 64, as well as the confluence of the Elk and Kanawha Rivers, the latter of which flows prominently through the city.
Flowing west from New River Gorge National Park an hour's drive east of Charleston, the gorge of the New River gets wider and shallower after the New River meets the Gauley River to become the Kanawha River 37 miles east of downtown Charleston. It is in this steep valley where downtown Charleston is sandwiched in the narrow strips of flat land between river and cliff, an appropriately striking setting for the capital of the 'Mountain State', with striking views of the downtown skyline while driving in from every direction. The steep hillsides covered with greenery give Charleston a laid-back, lush atmosphere especially in summer. These steep hillsides make development difficult and costly, so Charleston has a much more dense, urban character than one may expect for a metropolitan area of roughly 250,000.
Its location an hour west of New River Gorge National Park makes it the closest large city to the park, putting Charleston in proximity of numerous outdoor recreational attractions; it's also a major hub of commerce for the vast rural southern coalfields regions of West Virginia, as well as the sparsely populated rural lands and cute tiny towns to the north, and Mountain Lakes region to the northeast.
Charleston has experienced noticeable population decline through the second half of the 20th century and into the 21st, as the United States has de-industrialized, and Charleston has some resemblances to a rust belt city despite being farther south. It is most similar in culture and architecture to its sister city, Huntington, along the banks of the Ohio River, 50 minutes to the west along I-64. Together, they make a combined metropolitan area of around 650,000; thus making the combined Charleston-Huntington area the largest metropolitan area for several hours drive in every direction.
Generally off the tourist radar, Charleston has much to offer the curious traveler, and prices tend to be relatively affordable compared to larger and more touristy cities and towns.

Charleston is accessible by three interstates - I-77 goes from Parkersburg in the northwest to Beckley and Bluefield in the south; I-64 goes from Huntington in the west to Beckley and Lewisburg in the southeast; and I-79 begins in Charleston and continues to Morgantown in the northeast. I-64 and I-77 run together along the West Virginia Turnpike, a toll road, from the far eastern end of Charleston to Beckley, and the Turnpike continues as I-77 to Princeton, near the state border with Virginia. However, tolls are not collected on the Turnpike in the immediate vicinity of Charleston; the nearest toll barrier is about 17 miles (27 km) south of downtown Charleston. US-60 and US-119 are the major US highways through Charleston. US-60 mostly parallels I-64 in West Virginia, except in the Beckley and New River Gorge National Park area to the east of Charleston, where US-60 stays well to the north of I-64. US-119 continues as a four-lane highway to the south, providing access to the towns of Madison, Logan and Williamson in the rugged coalfields of southern West Virginia and into Eastern Kentucky, connecting with US-23 in Pikeville, KY, 2 hours away. US-35 begins in Charleston's western suburb of Teays Valley at an intersection with US-60, crosses I-64, and follows the Kanawha River northwest as a four lane highway to Point Pleasant, and into southeastern Ohio, allowing access to the Hocking Hills region of Ohio and Columbus ( hours away), and continuing directly to Dayton.
Yeager Airport (CRW IATA) (near the junction of I-77 and I-64). Yeager Airport offers daily service from Atlanta (Delta), Charlotte (American), Chicago (United), Detroit (Delta), Houston (United), Myrtle Beach (Spirit Airlines, seasonal), New York City-LaGuardia (Delta), Philadelphia (American), and both Washington-Dulles (United) and Washington-Reagan National (American).

Map of Charleston (West Virginia)
Most of Charleston's urban development is built along the banks of the Kanawha River in a linear fashion; thus, from the center of downtown, one can find 1960's-vintage suburbs within a 15 minute drive into the hills, but 30 minutes away along the river are also old industrial suburbs with housing stock as old as in the city center. I-64 crosses the Charleston area from east to west, roughly parallel to US-60 and the Kanawha River, crossing the river on 4 separate occasions until both highways deviate toward the west to the suburbs of Teays Valley and Hurricane, and eventually the Huntington metropolitan area. MacCorkle Ave. follows the south bank of the Kanawha River through most of the Charleston area, US-60 follows MacCorkle Ave. east until after South Charleston where it deviates, crossing the Patrick Street Bridge to the north side of the Kanawha River, where it continues east through downtown and eventually through the Kanawha Valley towards New River Gorge National Park.
The South Side Bridge connects Dickinson Street downtown with MacCorkle Ave. via Ferry St and Thayer St, as well as to Loudon Heights Rd. and Bridge Rd. towards the Bridge Rd. business district in the South Hills. The southbound Kaufman Memorial Bridge (35th St) and northbound Bob Basil Memorial Bridge (36th St) connect the East End neighborhood and I-64/77 with the Kanawha City neighborhood. (Access to the bridges from I-64/77 westbound requires exiting at exit 97 and following Kanawha Blvd to a right turn on Chesapeake Av. and right on Washington St; getting on I-64/77 eastbound requires taking the exit to Washington Street from the bridge, and then turning left on Chesapeake Av. and left on Kanawha Blvd, following until the on-ramp to I-64/77.) Other useful bridges include in the western suburbs: the Dunbar Bridge connecting the suburb of Dunbar on the north side of the Kanawha River to the Spring Hill neighborhood of South Charleston; and the Saint Albans Bridge, connecting the suburb of Saint Albans on the south side of the Kanawha River with the suburb of Nitro on the north side; and in the far eastern suburbs: the Admiral TJ Lopez Bridge connects US-60 on the north side of the Kanawha River with I-64/77 on the south side of the river, this is the last exit before the first toll plaza on the turnpike.
Charleston can have tight streets, sharp corners and steep hills, the downtown street grid is not especially rigid, and consists of many sometimes-shifting one-way streets. Important turn offs can be poorly signed, and certain maneuvers can seem unintuitive or directionally backward, owing to the engineering needed to construct highway infrastructure in steep terrain.
In Charleston, as is the case in general with West Virginia, drivers tend to strictly follow the 'autobahn rule' of staying right, passing left while on multi-lane and interstate highways; speed limits and curve warning speeds are generally set appropriately for the road, and following them as posted is advised, especially the first time driving in the area.

Although it isn't exactly a capital of cuisine, Charleston is the capital of cuisine for West Virginia, with a variety of options catering to different tastes and budgets. One of the best things about eating here is that there are very few tourist traps, since major tourism in Charleston has not yet caught on. Unfortunately, the lack of tourism also means that the restaurants can be generic; chains like T.G.I. Friday's, Outback, Olive Garden, and Red Lobster are common. There are, however, some more unique local eateries:
