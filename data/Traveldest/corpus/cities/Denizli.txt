Denizli is a city in the Southern Aegean region of Turkey, which most visitors simply transit to reach Pamukkale 20 km north. It's a typical modern Turkish city, far from picturesque, but does have enough sights of its own if your schedule allows. It's the main conurbation of Denizli province and most of it is nowadays within Pamukkale District (formerly Akköy), with a population in 2022 of 347,926. This means that places in and around the city shown on maps as "Pamukkale" may be far from the travertine pools you're looking for.
Deniz means the sea, or a large lake, which this place never had: it's on the edge of a hillside south of the plains of Büyük Menderes River. The name probably derives from Tonguzlu, place of the wild boar, though it took its denizens until the 14th century to decide they didn't much like being called swine and to elide the pronunciation. The town however remained agricultural. It managed to avoid warfare, whereas the more important nearby city of Laodicea was wrecked by the Turks and Mongols, and its residents relocated to Denizli.
Denizli is a textile town and its other agricultural claim to fame is the Denizli rooster, honoured by a fibreglass model in Delikliçınar Square south of town centre. Excavations at Laodicea found it honoured 900 years ago. It's not a ferocious fighter and it certainly doesn't lay, but has a distinctive 20-25 second crow. Its population is declining but there are measures to protect the breed.
The climate consists of average summer highs of 35°C, and winter days around 5-10°C. Rains are concentrated in winter and spring, but the occasional shower can happen anytime.

Occasional seasonal flights are from Tehran, and Medina during the hadj pilgrimage. The airport is 65 km east of Denizli so you need to have onward transport set up - buses no longer run to town, and a taxi will cost you an arm and a leg. (updated Oct 2023)

Denizli Bus Terminal (Otogar). This is central: Denizli doesn't have a bypass, so it hasn't built an edge-of-town station like other cities. It's spacious enough for the number of passengers it serves, reasonably clean, and has ticket kiosks, toilets and left luggage. Inter-city buses are on the upper level, downstairs are local services including to Pamukkale - this runs from Platform 76 every 20 min and costs 24 TL. (updated Oct 2023)
Pamukkale Ekspresi trundles once a day from Eskişehir, taking 8 hours 20 min via Kütahya, Afyon and Çardak. It sets off after 11:00 to arrive around 19:30; the return train departs at 09:45 to reach Eskişehir by 18:15. Eskişehir has fast YHT trains from Istanbul, Ankara and Konya, but you'll struggle to make a same-day connection.
Göller Ekspresi typifies what's wrong with Turkish railways. It runs overnight, leaving Izmir Basmane station at 23:00 to reach the airport at 23:30, Selçuk at 00:40, Aydın at 01:45, Denizli at 04:10, Çardak at 05:15 and Isparta at 07:40. The westbound return leaves Isparta at 22:00, reaching Denizli at 02:00 and Izmir at 07:00. Thus it serves a large city, two airports and several major tourist destinations, at a time of night that renders it useless. It just has standard seating, no couchettes. The bus covers the distance in half the time at a convenient hour of day.

The city was wrecked by an earthquake of 60 AD but rebuilt. Its main avenue is called Syria Street.
