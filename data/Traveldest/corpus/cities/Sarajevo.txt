Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its largest city, with 420,000 citizens in its urban area (2013). Sarajevo metropolitan area that has a population of 555,000 also includes some neighbourhoods of "East Sarajevo" that are a part of Republika Srpska. Sarajevo is very tourist friendly, especially pedestrian area in the Old Town in the centre of the city.
The Latin Bridge, close to where Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, triggering World War I.
Sarajevo is one of the most historically interesting and diverse cities in this part of Europe. It is a place where the Western and Eastern Roman Empire split; where the people of the Roman Catholic west, Eastern Orthodox east and the Ottoman south, met, lived and warred. It is both an example of historical turbulence and the clash of civilizations, as well as a beacon of hope for peace through multicultural tolerance. The city is traditionally known for its religious diversity, with Muslims, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews coexisting here for centuries. Additionally, the city's vast historic diversity is strongly reflected in its architecture. Parts of the city have a very Central-European look, while other parts of the city, often blocks away, have a completely distinct Ottoman, some Soviet-like or Socialist modernism feel.
Some important events in Sarajevo's history include the 1914 assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which led to World War I; the 1984 Winter Olympics; and the 1992-1996 siege.
The city has physically recovered from most of the damage caused by the Yugoslav Wars of 1992–1995, although bullet holes can still be found in some buildings. Sarajevo is a cosmopolitan European capital with a unique Eastern twist that is a delight to explore. The people are very friendly, be they Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs or anyone else. There is little street crime, with the city ranking as one of the safest in Southeastern Europe.
The city of Sarajevo stretches west–east along the river Miljacka; the main arterial road and tram routes tend to follow the west–east orientation. It is set in a narrow valley, surrounded by mountains on three sides.
Most tourists spend a lot of time in Old Town (Stari Grad). The eastern half of Old Town consists of the Ottoman-influenced Bascarsija (BAHS CHAR she ya; etymologically baš (head, main), čaršija (bazaar, trading area) in Turkish), while the western half showcases an architecture and culture that arrived with Austria-Hungary, symbolically representing the city as a meeting place between East and West.

Sarajevo has a humid continental climate, since mountains surrounding the city greatly reduce the maritime influence of the Adriatic Sea. Summers are typically hot (record high of 41 °C in 2008) with an average of 46 days per year above 32 °C, while winters are snowy and cold with an average 4 days per year below -15 °C. Rain can be expected in every season, with an average of 75 days of precipitation per year, which in winter often falls as snow.
Sarajevo Airport (Medjunarodni Aerodrom Sarajevo, Butmir Airport, SJJ IATA), Kurta Schorka 36 (Butmir, 6 km SW of railway station), ☏ +387 33 28 91 00. (updated Jul 2019)
This is Bosnia's principal airport, hemmed in by mountains and fog-prone, so flight delays are common in winter. The only passenger terminal is Terminal B; it's closed overnight 23:00–05:00. In the groundside main hall (after customs on arrival, before security on departure) there are currency exchange booths, car rental desks, a bookshop that sells local SIM cards, and a fast food area upstairs; there's no luggage storage. Airside is small, with a cafe and duty free shops accepting major currencies. New terminal facilities are under construction, to open in 2021. About 1 km away, walkable by the route to the trolleybus (below) then keep straight on, is the East Bus Station for destinations in Republika Srpska.
The most important hub connections are from Frankfurt (by Lufthansa), Vienna (by Austrian), Istanbul (by Turkish Airlines), Dubai (by flydubai) and Doha (by Qatar Airways) as well as flights to neighbouring countries (Belgrade by Air Serbia and Zagreb by Croatia Airlines) amongst others. Service to London-Luton is operated by Wizz Air, and to London-Stansted from April to October.
While you're at the airport, consider visiting the Tunnel of Hope Museum (Tunel Spasa). This saves you a trip from city centre later on, though you'll probably have to drag your luggage along. The museum is southside of the runway (the terminal being north), which they tunnelled beneath in 1993 to create a lifeline to the besieged city.
By bus – Centrotrans bus runs daily between airport and Baščaršija in city centre. It runs roughly hourly 05:30-22:00, timed to connect with flights, taking 20-30 mins. A one-way ticket is 5 KM, return 8 KM, the first bag (up to 23 kg) per person is included and each extra bag is 5 KM. You pay on boarding the bus. It stops on request at central bus stops, which may not be specifically marked for the airport bus but they're usually next to tram stops.
By taxi – Taxis are notorious for scams! To the city centre should not exceed 20 KM, although some drivers try for double that from foreigners. Flagfall is  KM then it's  KM per km for 6–7 km; any "airport supplement" is bogus. Some drivers will refuse to use the meters; insist on them, and if they don't, then walk away. One scam is to wave a "fixed price list" at you, but it's just the product of a greedy imagination. Your hotel may offer an airport transfer, with rates varying from the competitive to the silly. A further option is to walk through Dobrinja as described below to pick up a taxi, though the saving on an honest fare is small.
By trolleybus – This involves a walk of 600 m through the nearby neighbourhood of Dobrinja to reach the stop on Bulevar Mimara Sinana. You might want a map or a compass: the general direction is northeast with the terminal directly behind you, but it involves a zigzag. You exit the airport at the main gate onto Kurta Schorka highway. Turn right (southeast) and walk 200 m, there's no sidewalk. Take the first left, Andreja Andrejevića, and cut through residential Dobrinja passing near Hotel Octagon. Emerge onto the main road and turn right (again southeast) along Bulevar Mimara Sinana. On the opposite side (with westbound traffic) after 200 m, before you reach Mercator Center, is the bus stop Dobrinja škola B. Trolleybus 103 runs every 6 – 7 minutes daytime to Trg Austrijski, in the centre on the south riverbank, taking 25 min; walk across the Latin Bridge to come into Old Town. (Don't take the 107 or 108 if you're aiming for Old Town.) The fare is  KM, pay the driver, and note there are frequent ticket inspectors.
Tuzla Airport is another way in, as it has budget flights by Wizz from across Germany and Scandinavia. The airport is 120 km north of Sarajevo. An airport bus runs direct from Sarajevo to meet the Wizz flights, taking 2 hours and costing €22 each way. Or you can travel via the frequent standard buses to Tuzla, taking a leisurely 3 hours.
Sarajevo Railway Station (Nova željeznička stanica), Put života 2 (near Avaz Twist Tower), ☏ +387 33 65 53 30. This communist-era station is in a dilapidated state, with few trains and lots of down-and-outs, though it's reasonably central in this strung-out city. The ticket office is cash only and they laboriously write out tickets by hand, so service is slow. There are toilets and cafes. Staff at the information desk speak good English and their stock reply to many enquiries is to try the bus station next door: this is good advice. (updated Jul 2019)
There are no international trains to Bosnia: Coming from the west, the work-around route is to travel first to Zagreb in Croatia. From Zagreb main station (Glavni Kol) take the local train at 09:00 to Hrvatska Kostajnica, arriving by 10:45: see Croatian Railways timetable. The fare's about €8. You're now 3 km from the Bosnian borderpost, either take a taxi, or walk south into town then east and cross the river by the first bridge. Once you've entered Bosnia, find a taxi to Banja Luka, 100 km southeast, costing around 100 KM and taking maybe 90 mins. You'll reach Banja Luka in plenty of time to catch the 15:49 local train to Sarajevo via Zenica, arriving by 20:41. The train is a modern Spanish Talgo and the fare is about 26 KM. When checking the Bosnian Railways website, use the timetable menu not the ticket menu, as the latter only offers the main towns and bookable trains.
For the reverse journey, be on the 10:15 train from Sarajevo to Banja Luka in order to make the 19:15 from Hrvatska Kostajnica and reach Zagreb at 21:00. And confirm that your taxi driver has agreed to take you to the correct Kostajnica on the Croatian border (ie north-west, a printed map may help), not accidentally-on-purpose to some other Kostajnica, e.g. the one 80 km east near Doboj.
The only other railway route you're likely to get in by is Čapljina - Mostar - Sarajevo, with only two trains a day, departing from Sarajevo at 07:15 and 16:49 and taking around 2 hours to reach Mostar. Since 2015 there are no passenger trains south of Čapljina into Croatia and the port of Ploče (which has transport to Dubrovnik, Split and the Adriatic islands), though the line is still open for freight.
If your accommodation is in the west of the city, e.g. the Ibis Styles Hotel, then coming from Banja Luka you could change at Zenica for the local train to Sarajevo, which also stops at  Alipašin Most on Safeta Zajke. But it doesn't save much time or effort. The trains from Čapljina and Mostar trundle through this station without stopping.
There are two bus stations in Sarajevo, Main Station for most long-distance services and East Station for Serbia and towns in Republika Srpska.
Main Bus Station (Autobuska stanica Sarajevo) (at Put života 8 next to the railway station). It's at the terminus of Tram #1 to the Old Town, fare  KM. Direct international services include Belgrade (7 hr), Budapest (12 hr), Budva (9 hr), Zagreb (8 hr), Maribor (9 hr), Ljubljana (9 hr), Split (7–8 hours), Dubrovnik (6 hr), Graz (11 hr) and Vienna (14 hr). Pristina in Kosovo may involve a change in Novi Pazar, else travel via Podgorica in Montenegro. Flixbus is the main international operator. Tickets can be bought online from them or Centrotrans, from the bus station itself, or from a centrally-located travel agent such as Centrotrans on Ferhadija behind the cathedral. If you bought your ticket online, you will need to purchase an additional ticket to access the departure platform from staff in the ticket hall. (updated Mar 2023)
On all intercity buses you pay a fee for luggage, usually 1 KM or €1 per piece. The driver will insist on exact change in one or the other currency pretty much at random, and then get picky about the denomination of the exact change you give him.
Major bus routes within the country are to Tuzla (hourly, taking 3 hours, fare 11 KM), to Mostar via Konjic and Jablanica (hourly, taking 2 hours 30 min, fare 14 KM) and to Banja Luka via Zenica (every couple of hours, taking 3 hours, fare 11 KM.)
East Bus Station (Autobuska stanica Istočno / Lukavica) (away west, thanks to the bitter geography and politics of this region). It's in East Sarajevo in Republika Srpska, and the route from central Sarajevo has to sweep west to get round the hills then approach south then eastwards near the airport. It has better connections to Serbia than Main Station; both stations have buses to Montenegro. The main services are to Belgrade, Novi Sad, Herceg Novi and Nis and also Zvornik for stop-over connection to Srebrenica. Routes within the country are to Bijeljina, Kalinovik and Trebinje not far from Dubrovnik. (updated Mar 2023)
To reach East Station, take trolleybus 103 from Austrijski Trg to the end and then walk for 400 meters, or a taxi for around 15 KM. There are no controls to cross into Republika Srpska, it's just like crossing any internal border. There's not much at the station except a ticket counter and the obligatory cafe/grill. Travellers reported harassments by a drunk guy hanging around at the east bus station (see e.g. Google Maps Reviews).
Sarajevo East Station asks you to pay a station tax which is 1 KM per person (for online tickets). Insist on your receipt that indicates the 1 KM as the staff usually tries to scam tourists and keep the money for themselves or asks for twice the price.
East Sarajevo has cafes, shops and ATMs, e.g. in TOM shopping centre 200 m southwest along Radomira Putnika.
The main route from the west is past Zagreb east on E70, then south on E661 to enter Bosnia and towards Banja Luka thence Sarajevo via the A1 highway from Zenica. You can also reach the city from the East via the suburbs of Ilidža or from the north via M18/A1 from the direction of Tuzla.
Hitching is easy to moderate, though make sure your sign is in the local language. Sarajevo is a long, thin city: if you can't get a lift into the centre, at least get yourself dropped by the tram tracks.
Sarajevo is a medium-sized, beautiful city with many landmarks. Getting lost is always possible, but much less so if you have a map; however, getting lost in Bascarsija's winding streets can be part of the fun, and may reveal some interesting surprises.
Very good free maps can be obtained from the tourist information office, shopping centres and hotels. Some bookshops may also sell printed maps of the city. Map apps on a smartphone are particularly useful.
Asking Sarajevans for directions is an exercise in futility. People might not know the names of streets a block from the building they've lived in all their lives. Taxi drivers can't be expected to find anything other than the most obvious addresses unless you tell them where to go, in Bosnian; showing the driver on your map may be necessary.
Avoid driving in the Old Town. The steep and narrow streets, with a one way system, means you are likely to get lost and possibly damage your car. Also, it is next to impossible to find a parking spot.
Otherwise, a car might be invaluable to reach the sights farther away from the city center, especially East Sarajevo which belongs to Republika Srpska.
Dariva promenade through the Miljacka valley
In Sarajevo, street signs are few and far between, and small and on the sides of buildings too far away to see when you're standing on a street corner. Building numbers are more or less consecutive. The city is mostly walkable, especially the city centre and the part of the city which is built on the slopes of Mt. Trebević.
Sarajevo's tram network operated by KJKP GRAS[dead link is among the oldest in Europe, and it looks it. A single line runs east from Ilidža passing within 2 km of the airport: an extension to the airport has been planned and intermittently constructed since the 1990s. It runs up the middle of the main highway into the city, with a spur north (Trams 1 & 4) to the main railway and bus stations. At Marijin Dvor it divides into an anti-clockwise loop, same direction as the traffic flow. All trams go east along Hiseta and the riverbank through Baščaršija (Old Town) as far as City Hall. Here they loop to return west along Mula Mustafe Bašeskije (a few blocks north of the river) and Maršala Tita to Marijin Dvor. Only Tram 3 runs the entire line out to Ilidža, the others go part route, e.g. the 1 & 4 terminate at the railway station. The length of the route is around 12 km. Old trams from Amsterdam were donated to Sarajevo and can still be seen touring the city, with the Dutch stickers still on it.
Buy tickets in advance from kiosks labeled tisak, duhanpromet, inovine on the street ( KM) or from the driver, where they cost slightly more ( KM, paid in cash). Validate your ticket immediately on boarding: it's only good for one trip, with no transfers. A day card for unlimited travel on all local public transport in Zone A costs 5 KM. There are frequent ticket inspections: if you can't reach the validator because the tram is too crowded, then don't board. If you are caught without a valid ticket, you will be escorted off and fined  KM.
You would only use these for the few sights or accommodation well off the tram route, e.g. the airport and nearby Tunel Spasa, (see "Get in"), Sarajevo East bus station or Vratnik district east of the centre, Buses 51, 52 or 55.
Bus tickets are always bought at the driver for  KM. You can not use pre-bought tram tickets in busses.
The planned departures of busses and trams can be found in the Moovit app (iOS, Android).
Only for seasoned urban cyclists: Sarajevo traffic is as hostile to cyclists as it is to fellow-motorists, only with worse results.
Nextbike has a bike rental scheme here and in Tuzla. First you need to register and pay a 20 km deposit, easiest done online. It may take 24 hours to activate but if you're already registered with them in another country, you should be good to go. There are 14 pick-up / docking stations all along the tram lines out to Dobrinja near the airport, their map shows real-time availability. The first 30 mins per day are free, a further 30 mins cost  KM.
Taxi scams are common especially at the main train & bus stations and the airport. Try to avoid using taxis when possible, as even supposedly legitimate operators can scam. Know roughly what the honest fare should be, and insist on them using the meter. All legitimate taxis have a "TAXI" sign on top, licence plates with "TA", and have a meter. Flagfall is  KM then it's  KM per km, plus maybe 1 km for luggage, so a trip between Baščaršija and airport shouldn't exceed 20 KM. Pay in cash, the driver will issue a receipt upon request. Some official operators are
Paja Taxi 1522 or ☏ +387 33 15 22
Žuti (Yellow) Taxi ☏ +387 33 66 35 55
The best way to find a reputable Taxi is to ask a local person you trust which one they would use. Ownership and management of official operators can change frequently.
Renting an electric scooter is available in Sarajevo like in many other European cities. You can use the app BeeBee to access them.
With the exception of the Tunnel Museum and the Bosna spring, all landmarks are in or within walking distance of Old Town. Several walking tours are available, a free/tip based walking tour starts every day at 10:30 at the crossing of Gazi Husrev begova street and Mula Mustafa Baseskija street (address: Velika Avlija 14) and covers most of the Baščaršija.
The municipality of Sarajevo provides an app called "Guide2Sarajevo" (Android, ios). It contains a map with sights and restaurants as well as several themed routes to walk in the city (ranging from 2 to 6 hours) on which you use your phone as audio guide (works even without mobile internet, because the files are downloaded on installation). It's remarkably well made.
Avaz Twist Tower, Tesanjska 24a (100 m east of railway station), ☏ +387 33 281 350. 07:00-22:00. The easiest way to orient yourself in the city is to look for this distinctive 176 m twisted tower, completed in 2008, and hosting the media company Dnevni avaz. There's a café-bar & restaurant on Level 35, reached by lift (free access). From there you pay 2 KM in coins to pass the turnstile and walk upstairs to Level 36, which has an observation deck with outside walkway. The café-bar and restaurant are smoky and the food & service aren't up to much. 2 KM. (updated Jul 2019)
Sebilj, the most iconic fountain of Sarajevo in the Baščaršija district
Baščaršija is the historic district of Sarajevo. The cobbled streets, mosques and oriental-style shops at the heart the city feel like a world away from Europe when the call to prayer starts. You could be walking by a Catholic church, Orthodox church or a synagogue and hear the Islamic call to prayer at the same time. In this old bazaar you can find dozens of shops selling copperware, woodwork and sweets. Many historic monuments are situated around Gazi Husrev-begova street.
Sebilj ( 1 2 3 5 Baščaršija, Pigeon Square). 24/7. Pseudo-Ottoman wooden fountain in the middle of an open square in the old town of Sarajevo. It was built by Mehmed Pasha Kukavica in 1753, and under Austro-Hungarian rule moved to its current location in 1891 by Austrian architect Alexander Wittek. Three replicas of the fountain exist, respectively in Belgrade and Novi Pazar in Serbia, and in St. Louis in the US. The fountain offers shadow and drinkable water. The surrounded Pigeon Square got its name from the countless pigeons swarming around. Feeding pigeons is allowed, and a seller with a trolley sells corn to tourists to feed the birds. Free. (updated Sep 2017)
Sacred Heart Cathedral (Katedrala Srca Isusova), Trg Fra Grge Martića 2 ( 1 2 3 5 Katedrala), ☏ +387 33 210 281, toll-free: +387 33 225 591, mestar47@bih.net.ba. Tu-Su 09:00-17:30. The largest Christian cathedral in Bosnia, and the seat of Archbishop of Vrhbosna. It was built in honour of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in a Neo-Gothic style with Romanesque Revival elements, and modelled on the Notre-Dame of Dijon. Construction of the cathedral began on 25 August 1884, under Austro-Hungarian reign, was carried out by the Viennese contractor Baron Karl Schwarz, and supervised by architect Josip Vancaš. The cathedral was the scene of peace demonstrations in 1991 before the Bosnian War broke out, and subsequently damaged during the Siege of Sarajevo. The design above the door to the entrance is part of the flag and seal of the Sarajevo administrative canton and the Romanesque towers are featured on the flag and coat of arms of Sarajevo, making the building a symbol of the city. The niche above the portal features an octagonal rosette and a statue of the Sacred Heart. The interior of the cathedral was designed by architect Josip Vancaš, including the main altar which is made from Grisignano marble and rests on four columns of red Tyrolean marble. The frescoes were commissioned to Alexander Maximilian Seitz in 1886 but due to deteriorating health, they were only completed in 1887, and he died a year afterwards. Most of the actual work was undertaken by his assistant Alberto Rohden. A prominent feature is the grave of archbishop Stadler, the first archbishop of Vrhbosna, and the sculpture is of the hand of Marin Studin. The stained-glass windows ornamenting the cathedral were manufactured by the Viennese workshop of the Tiroler Glasmalerei (German for glass painting artisan). An English language mass is held on Sundays at 12:00. For candles, ask the information desk at the entrance (1 KM each). Photography not allowed. Free. (updated Sep 2017)
Morića Inn (Morića Han), Sarači 77 ( 1 2 3 5 Baščaršija, entrance is on the south side of the block, from the Sarači street), ☏ +387 33 236-119. 08:00-22:15. The only preserved Ottoman Inn (han literally means roadside inn) in Sarajevo, built in 1551, under the benevolence of Gazi Husrev-Beg's endowment (vakuf). It served as a caravanserai, able to accommodate up to 300 guests, 70 horses, and offered 43 rooms where travellers could spend the night. On 29 July 1878, the inn became the scene of the protest movement against the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia, and the People's Council (Narodni Odbor) was founded here. The building was damaged or destroyed by fires numerous times and rebuilt each time, notably in 1697 and most recently in December 1957 when the entire complex was burned to the ground. Reconstruction took place from 1971 to 1974, and Persian calligraphic inscriptions from poems written by Omar Khayyám, a 12th-century Persian poet, were added as decorations. The property ownership to the inn was returned to the Gazi Husrev-Beg endowment in 1998, and houses a carpet shop and traditional restaurant, occasionally hosts exhibitions and offers business space for purposes that match the historical context and purpose of the building. Stairs on either side of the inner patio allow visitors to reach the first floor with the rooms. Free. (updated Sep 2017)
Clock Tower (Sahat-kula), Mudželeti veliki (next to the Gazi Husrev-bey's Mosque), ☏ +387 62 626 626. The clock tower, at 30 metres, is the tallest in Bosnia, and dates back to the 17th century when it was constructed by Gazi Husrev-beg next to the mosque that also bears his name. The tower has a staircase with 76 wooden steps arranged in a square, and displays the time on all 4 sides. When Eugene Savoy of the Austrian army laid siege on the city in 1697 and looted it, the tower was set on fire, but restored in 1762. After the Austro-Hungarian occupation, the upper part of the tower was upgraded, and the decaying Turkish clock mechanism was replaced by a new one from Gillet & Johnston, made in London in 1873. The original clock mechanism was moved to the Vratnik mosque where it remains on display until today. The last upgrade dates from 1967, when the dials were gold-plated. A peculiarity of the clock tower is that it appears to be the only remaining clock tower in the world that displays the lunar clock (a la turca, lunar reckoning). This method of measuring time counts hours up till the moment of (astronomical) sunset instead of midnight, as with contemporary time calculation, so the hands are in the 12 o'clock position at every sunset, when a new day also begins. Since the setting of the sun is uneven throughout the year, the time needs to be manually controlled and recalibrated every 2 to 3 days. The task of recalibrating the clock was assigned to the muvekit (timekeeper), who used astronomical instruments in a special room called the muvekithana to calculate the position of the sun. The current muvekit, Mensur Zlatar, who works at a nearby jewellery shop, has been assigned the responsibility since 1960s. The exact timing of the sunset used to be an important moment for locals to schedule their time of prayer, but the original religious purpose behind the lunar time has long since had its meaning forgotten, causing many to think that the clock is simply bad at proper time keeping. In 2006, the Commission for the Preservation of National Monuments proclaimed the clock tower as a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The tower cannot be visited, but it is possible to stand at its base by following the tunnel leading to Pekara Imaret right next to the tower. (updated Sep 2017)
Tašlihan, Zelenih beretki ( 1 2 3 5 Latinska ćuprija). 24/7. Tašlihan served as one of the three stone caravanserais in Sarajevo (the others being the Morića Han and Kolobara Han), the name literally translates to 'stone han'. It is believed that Tašlihan was the largest and most representative inn of its kind in the region, and built between 1540-1543 by craftsmen from Dubrovnik, who equipped the building with lead cupolas unlike the other two inns. It had a square foundation with sides of 47 m, guest rooms on two levels, and a fountain in the courtyard. Several fires damaged the building, and the last one in 1879 completely destroyed it. The last remaining bits of rubble were removed in 1912, except for the shared wall with the bezestan. When archaeological research was carried out as part of the 1998 renovation of adjacent Hotel Europe, the remains of Tašlihan were uncovered in the hotel's garden. The site was declared a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Committee for the Preservation of National Monuments in 2004. Free. (updated Sep 2017)
City Hall (Vijećnica), Obala Kulina Bana ( 1 2 3 5 Vijećnica), ☏ +387 33 292-800, kontakt@vijecnica.ba. 10:00-20:00. Iconic pseudo-Moorish revival style building in Sarajevo, constructed between 1892 and 1894 under Austro-Hungarian occupation of the city. It was designed in 1891 by Czech architect Karel Pařík, but after disagreements with the ministry, it was Alexander Wittek who continued work on the project from 1892 to 1893 until he fell ill and died in Graz in 1894. The work was completed in 1894 by Ćiril Iveković, at a total cost of 984,000 crowns. The city hall was formally commissioned in 1896 by the City Authority which occupied the building until 1949, after it became the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 25 August 1992, the building was set ablaze by Serbian shelling at the beginning of the Siege of Sarajevo, causing its destruction. Most of the  million volumes in the library's collection, of which 155,000 rare books and manuscripts were lost in the fire, despite civilian efforts to save them. Vijećnica was restored between 1996 and 2013 with financial aid from Austria, the European Commission and the city of Barcelona, at a total cost of 25 million KM. It is now a national monument, reopened since 2014, and designated as a cultural building for protocol events, concerts and exhibitions. 10 KM. (updated Sep 2017)
Officers’ Casino (Dom Oružanih snaga Bosne i Hercegovine), Zelenih Beretki 2 ( 1 2 3 5 Drvenija), ☏ +387 33 285-800. The Officers’ Casino was built in 1881 according to Karl Pařík’s design. It was the core of Sarajevo’s social life in late 19th and early 20th century. The Army Hall of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been used by the military ever since its establishment for various purposes, such as art exhibitions and public lectures. It holds two grand halls for receptions and cultural events, and was the venue of the first military music concert in the city, held in 1881. (updated Sep 2017)
Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Gavrilo Princip
By 1914 Franz Ferdinand-Este had become ruler of Austria-Hungary as the old emperor retired from public life. The Empire had occupied Bosnia & Herzegovina since 1878 and annexed it in 1908, angering Serbia and Russia, and provoking resistance. On Sun 28 June 1914 the Archduke and his wife Sophie arrived in Sarajevo to open the new museum. A team of assassins was waiting along the route, and one threw a bomb: it bounced off the Archduke's car and exploded under the next, injuring 20. The motorcade sped away to a reception at Town Hall. There the Archduke decided he should visit the injured in hospital, but when they set off at 10:45 the drivers hadn't been briefed on the change of plan. 19 year old Serb student Gavrilo Princip was among the assassins but had failed to shoot as the car sped away from the bomb. Hoping for a chance on the return journey, he stood in front of the delicatessen next to Latin Bridge, and got lucky. The Archduke's car was about to take a wrong turn and they shouted at the driver to stop, which he did just in front of Princip. Princip strode up to the footplate and fatally shot the Archduke and Sophie.

After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, different ethnic groups in the Yugoslav Federation also started to seek independence. This resulted in a series of armed conflicts in the Balkan region, leading to the independence of Slovenia and Croatia, while the goal pursued by the Serbs was a unified greater Serb state. This conflict of interest caused the Yugoslav army to lose support from Croats and Bosniaks, and effectively became a Serb dominated army, which evolved into the army of the newly created Republika Srpska. When Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence in 1992, the Bosnian War broke out, and Sarajevo found itself on the front line between Bosnia and the Republika Srpska, resulting in the Siege of Sarajevo. The war concluded in 1995 with independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the formation of an autonomous Republika Srpska within the country. The conflict was overshadowed by heavy civilian casualties and war crimes, including genocide, of which the Srebrenica massacre is the most infamous one. The UN enforced peace treaty froze the conflict rather than resolving it, and anti-Serb sentiments can still be felt in Sarajevo.

Scars from the Bosnian War can still be seen in many parts of the city, as bullet holes in walls or abandoned buildings. The unresolved conflict (see box The Yugoslav Wars) left traumatic memories, and museums and memorials associated with the Bosnian War are scattered around the city.

ICAR Canned beef monument In the vicinity of the National Museum and the Bosnian Historical museum.

Apr-Oct daily 09:00-17:00, Nov-Mar daily 09:00-16:00. Sarajevo was besieged and bombarded from 1992, and by 1993 the blockade was total. Serb forces seized the airport, but handed it over to UN peacekeeping forces to avert international intervention. The UN used the airport to bring in humanitarian aid, but wouldn't allow any military support to the city's defenders, and they severed the city from Bosnian-controlled areas to the south. A secret tunnel was therefore dug between Dobrinja just north of the airport to Butmir just south: 340 m of true tunnel, plus covered trenches either side, totalling over 800 m. It enabled arms, munitions, oil and food to be brought into the city, and served as an evacuation route for officials and civilians. Later it was equipped with rail tracks, an oil pipe and electricity and telecoms cables. A museum has been built over the Butmir entrance, with 20 m of tunnel accessible to visitors, plus displays on the siege. City tours often include this museum. 10 KM. 5 KM for students.

Cemeteries: those who died in the 1990s war were buried in pre-existing cemeteries. In these you find old Ottoman turbe, Austro-Hungarian dignitaries, casualties of two World Wars, Yugoslav citizens - and then row upon row upon aching row of simple white marble stones for people in their twenties slain in the latest conflict.
A good example is  Alifacovac (Alifakovac grobljanska cjelina) on the headland south of the river where it emerges from the canyon.

Sniper Alley was the informal name primarily for streets Zmaja od Bosne Street (Dragon of Bosnia Street) and Meša Selimović Boulevard, the main boulevard in Sarajevo which during the Bosnian War was lined with snipers' posts, and became infamous as a dangerous place for civilians to traverse. The road connects the industrial part of the city (and further on, Sarajevo Airport) to the Old Town's cultural and historic sites. The boulevard itself has many high-rise buildings giving sniper shooters extensive fields of fire. Signs reading "Pazi – Snajper!" ("Watch out – Sniper!") became common. People would either run fast across the street or would wait for United Nations armored vehicles and walk behind them, using them as shields. According to data gathered in 1995, the snipers wounded 1,030 people and killed 225; 60 of whom were children. Free. (updated Jul 2017)

The history of the tomb dates back to the founding days of Sarajevo, and it is assumed that a certain sheik who had arrived with the army of Sultan Mehmed II el-Fatih was the first to be buried at this spot. The sheik built his house next to the current tomb, and in his will asked to be buried at the base of his garden, with the remaining area used as Muslim cemetery. Later on, two dervishes were also buried here, falsely accused of stealing gold from the Sarajevo treasury in 1494. Over two centuries later, 4 army commanders who were accused of collaboration with Prince Eugene of Savoy in his raid of the city, were also buried in the tomb after, according to the legend, a heavenly light descended upon their grave as evidence of their innocence. Thus, the tomb unites the 7 individuals, who are brothers by faith rather than brothers by birth. In 1815 a wall with seven windows was built around the tomb, and a room for a tomb keeper was added. Some of the property was demolished in 1937, but the wall and tomb still stand today. (updated Oct 2017)

It was originally planned to be built in Split, owning its resemblance to similar buildings along the Adriatic coast, but eventually constructed in Sarajevo instead and consecrated by Serbian patriarch Gravillo V. It is the primary place of worship for the 50,000 Orthodox Christians in the region. The church has been the target of numerous attacks throughout its history. It was heavily damaged during the 1992-95 Siege of Sarajevo but renovated in 2003. Reworking of the valuable frescoes began in 2004. In 2016, the church was set on fire by pyromaniacs, without injuries. It was targeted by looters again in the same year, and 2 rare icons were stolen. (updated Oct 2017)

The Jewish population was first established in 1492-97 when Sephardic Jews fled the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal, and settled here and in other Ottoman cities. The Ashkenazi Jews mostly arrived during Austro-Hungarian rule in the late 19th century. Inter-community relations were mostly amicable and the population was relatively unharmed by the First World War, collapse of Austria-Hungary and formation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. By 1940, their numbers peaked at around 14,000, 20% of the city population. In 1941 the Nazis invaded, placing the country under the control of the Croatian Ustaše, who vigorously set about the deportation and extermination of minority groups. Those who could, fled to the west, and after the war most exiles remained abroad. Some 2000 Jews did remain or return, but when the 1990s civil wars broke out, there was a mass evacuation to Israel of Jews living in former Yugoslavia. Fewer than 1000 remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina today, perhaps half of them in Sarajevo.
Jewish Museum (Muzej Jevreja), Velika avlija bb, ☏ +387 033 535 688. M-F 10:00-16:00, Su 10:00-15:00. This is housed in the Old Temple (Il kal vjezu) or Grand Temple (Il kal Grandi) built in 1581 for the Sephardic settlers. It's a three-nave building with the front area used for preaching and the upper floors for the women's section. It's mostly a story of harmony and prosperity, but the third floor relates events of 1941-45. The building was badly damaged then and in the 1990s civil wars but has been well restored. KM 3.

Ashkenazi Synagogue (Aškenaska sinagoga), Ulica Hamdije Kreševljakovića 59, ☏ +387 33 229-666. The Old then the New Temples were for the Sephardic congregation, so the Ashkenazi synagogue (nowadays the only functioning synagogue in Sarajevo) was built for that community in 1902, designed by Karl Pařík in Moorish revival style. It escaped Nazi destruction and features large arches with painted decorations and an ornate ceiling highlighted by a ten-pointed star. A stone menorah at the entrance commemorates the 400-year anniversary of Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Tours are available in English on request. (updated Jul 2019)
Jewish Cemetery (Jevrejsko groblje s kapelom na Borku), Ulica Urijan Dedina. The cemetery lies on the slopes of Trebević mountain in the Kovačići district of southern Sarajevo. It is one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in South-East Europe, and in use from 1630 until 1966. It was established by Sephardic Jews during the Ottoman period, and also became the burial ground for Ashkenazi Jews after they arrived in Sarajevo in the late 19th century. It contains over 3850 tombstones and stecci, as well as four monuments dedicated to the victims of fascism. It began as a medieval necropolis of stecak tombstones, as still exist in Jablanica and elsewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Sephardi of Sarajevo created tombstones with a unique morphology, of which the symbolic motifs are not found on any other Jewish monuments elsewhere in the world. The cemetery was the front line during the Bosnian War, and was used as artillery position by the Bosnian Serbs. Several tombstones were severely damaged by bullets and explosions. It was also heavily mined, but completely cleared in 1996. In 2004, the cemetery was declared as National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Free. (updated Feb 2018)
During Ottoman rule of Sarajevo, 13 bridges were built over the Miljacka River and Bosna River. Four stone bridges remain: the Latin Bridge, the Šeher-Čehajina Bridge, the Goat Bridge and the Roman Bridge.
Latin Bridge (Latinska ćuprija), Obala Kulina Bana. 24/7. Archduke of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated on this bridge on 28 June 1914, sparking the beginning of World War I. A plaque commemorates the event. On the bridge was a memorial to the assassin Gavrilo Princip, but it was removed during the 1992-1995 War. Free. (updated Jul 2017)
Šeher-Čehajina Bridge (Šeher-Ćehajina ćuprija) (between the City Hall and House of Spite). 24/7. Built in 1585/1586 and survived major damage from flooding in 1619, 1629, 1843 and 1880, but was repaired each time. When the Miljacka River was dammed in 1897 to regulate the water flow, the riverbed was altered and one of the original 5 arches of the bridge on the left bank was buried, a subtle change that can still be seen by observers with a keen eye. According to the legend, the city's vizier Hadzi Husein had ordered to erect the bridge and embed a diamond in one of its pillars to finance future repairs. One night the diamond disappeared, and a poor young man confessed to have stolen it as a gift to a girl he fell in love with. Swayed by the love between the two and the return of the diamond, the man was released from prison, but the diamond was never embedded back into the bridge. In 2005, the Commission for the Preservation of National Monuments declared the bridge a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Free. (updated Sep 2017)
dead link Roman Bridge (Rimski most) (on the Bosna half way between Ilidza and the Bosna spring). 24/7. Crossing the Bosna River at the historic Western entrance into the city. It is the only preserved stone bridge over the Bosna River, and considered one of the most authentic Ottoman bridges in the country. It was built out of carved stone between 1530 and 1550 using lime mortar and stones from ancient neolithic, Illyrian and Roman settlements in the bridge's vicinity, most importantly the Roman village Aquae Sulphurae (Latin for sulfur waters) which served as the region's cultural and administrative centre. Numerous archaeological artifacts from that period (jewelry, coins, ceramics etc.) from the Roman period have been found around the bridge. Some of the stone tiles (kaldrma) have shallow engravings of Roman origin, from which the bridge derived its name. Free. (updated Sep 2017)
Goat’s Bridge (Kozija ćuprija) (follow the Dariva scenic walkway East from the City Hall until the bridge). 24/7. Architecturally interesting bridge at the historic Eastern entrance into the city. Free. (updated Aug 2022)
The bridge had an important ceremonial function, as it served as the place where each Ottoman vizier was welcomed by the previous vizier and citizens of Sarajevo. The bridge is constructed from white marble, has a single arc with two circular apertures, and is 42 m long and  m wide. The span of the main arc is  m. According to the legend, before the bridge's existence, a poor shepherd noticed his goats sniffing on a shrub along the Miljacka River. Upon inspecting the shrub, he found a treasure with golden coins, which he used to finance his own education. After he became wealthy and influential, he had the bridge constructed at the shrub where his goats found the treasure, which gave the bridge its name. The truth in the legend was lost in history, but the bridge was almost certainly built between 1565 and 1579, a time when the road network underwent major infrastructure upgrades under reign of Mehmed-paša Sokolović.
If you came to the bridge on the cycle/pedestrian path along the river by foot, you can continue the road after the goat bridge uphill to Vakuf Isa-bega Ishakovića (a view point) and then few hundred meters further on the cycle path to Pale turn right to Jarčedoli. Once you reached the  top of the hill, you'll have majestic views over Sarajevo, especially the hills and ruins on the opposite site.
From there follow many stairs and narrow streets down to Alifakovac which ends at the city hall.
Alija Izetbegović tomb in the Kovači Memorial Cemetery at dusk
Museum of Alija Izetbegović in the Ploča Gate
In the 17th century conflict between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, the decisive battle came at Zenta (now in Serbia) in 1697, when the Ottomans were routed, and their grip on central Europe was broken. The Austro-Hungarian forces then devastated Sarajevo before marching home. Further attacks were likely so a fortified city was built here 1727–1739, east of the old centre of Baščaršija. Later suburbs surrounded it, and the name Vratnik (probably meaning "gates") applies to this wider district, but the sights of interest are all in the Vratnik redoubt.
From Baščaršija either walk up Kovači past the war cemetery onto Jekovac and Carina (Buses 51, 52 & 55 run this way); or follow the river upstream taking the right fork just before the road goes into a tunnel, then ascend right for White Fortress or left for Yellow Fortress.
Martyrs' Memorial Cemetery Kovači (Sehidsko mezarje Kovaci), Sirokac. Here lie victims of the 1992-95 Civil War. The centrepiece is the tomb of Alija Izetbegović (1925-2003), first president of the independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Small museum within the Ploča and Širokac gates of Vratnik, dedicated to Alija Izetbegović, first president of the independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He served 1992-2000, much of that time only nominally as he was besieged in Sarajevo in the early years, and overshadowed by the EU High Representative after the war. The museum has a library of Alija's work and a few personal items. The first floor exhibits his life, the passage between Ploča Gate and Širokac Gate exhibits his role as commander of the army. See also his tomb in nearby Kovači cemetery. (updated Jul 2019)
Yellow Fortress (Žuta tabija). Small bastion and cannon fortress, regularly smashed up and rebuilt. The latest renovation was in 1998, so it's a pleasant place to picnic and gaze over the city, but that's about all there is. Café Kamarija (adjacent on Pod Bedemom) is open daily 08:00-23:30, but their prices reflect the view. Fortress free. (updated Jul 2019)
Jajce Kasarna are Austro-Hungarian barracks 200 m east of Yellow Fortress. They're derelict and unsafe to enter.
Visegrad Gate (Višegradska kapija (Zidine Vratničkog grada)). One of the three gate-towers of Vratnik, controlling the road east towards Visegrad and Istanbul. It was built 1727-1739 in limestone and Bosnian stone hreša with roof shingles. (updated Jul 2019)
White Fortress (Bijela tabija) (1 km east of City Hall). 24/7. This natural bastion had a fort at least from 1550, the nucleus from which the later fortifications of Vratnik were extended. It was rebuilt in the Austro-Hungarian period but nowadays is a shattered ruin, and not entirely safe - stealing the masonry for other buildings has done as much damage as later bombardments, such as in 1992-95. Good views over the city especially at sunrise / sunset, but don't get caught here in darkness. 5 KM. (updated May 2023)
Sarajevo hosted the 1984 Winter Olympic Games. These (officially the XIV Olympic Winter Games) were the first held in a socialist state, although Moscow had hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics. Some structures remaining from that era are in a sorry state.
Olympic Museum (Olimpijski muzej), Alipašina bb, ☏ +387 33 226 414, okbih@okbih.ba. M-F 09:00-17:00. A museum aimed at the preservation of the memories of the organization of the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. From 1984 to 1992, the museum was located in the city centre, in a mansion owned by Nikola Mandić, former Sarajevo citizen and later president of Croatia during the Nazi occupation in WWII. Declared an enemy of the state at the end of the war, Nikola Mandić lost his life and property, and the mansion was donated to the museum by the Sarajevo city council. At the start of the 1992-95 Civil War, the building was shelled by Serb forces and damaged beyond repair. A significant part of the museums collection went up in flames. The remaining collection was salvaged and transferred to the Zetra Olmypic Complex, and in 2004 the new museum at its current location was opened to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1984 Olympic Games. (updated Sep 2017)
Skenderija, Terezija BB (take tram 6 until Skenderija terminus), ☏ +387 33 201-203, toll-free: +387 33 211-016, info@skenderija.ba. Tito-era cultural and sports centre on the south bank of the river, constructed in 1969 and opened with the premiere of the film Battle of Neretva. It was later expanded for the 1984 Winter Olympic Games, and features a market and shopping mall. Because of its concrete construction, it only sustained minor damage during the war, but gradually decayed afterwards due to neglect. In February 2012, after a record snowfall in Sarajevo, the roof of one of the halls collapsed under the snow pressure, which was estimated to be around 160 kg/m². The building was subsequently restored by the city and returned to service, and receives 500,000 visitors per year. (updated Sep 2017)
Cable car (From Franjevačka south of the river, a short walk over the river from the City Hall.). M-Tu 10:00-20:00; W-Su 09:00-20:00. Restored in 2018, this cable car runs up to the former  Ski Station–Though, a little oberpriced. Nice views hilltop strolls and a decent cafè. Forest paths lead to the Pino Hotel (accessible by road, e.g. drive or taxi) and the pictureque and Instram-heavy Trebevic Bobsled Track which mad off-road bikers hurtle down, and which is being restored for winter sports. It makes sense walking one direction to see the bobsled track, and using the cable car the other direction, since the slide is pretty much between the Ski Station and city. 20 KM return, 15 KM one-way (locals pay less than a third). (updated Mar 2023)

Skakavac Waterfall (Vodopad Skakavac) (Take bus 69 from Sutjeska (near the train station) to Nahorevo, from where you can try to hitchhike, which is probably only better during weekend when also locals head here. Most people will probably only go  km before the waterfall, where the sealed road stops. But there is another parking, 1-2 km on the dirt road.). Waterfall 12 km north of the city, above the Nahorevo Village. At 98 m in height, it is the second tallest waterfall in Europe, after the Vinnufossen waterfall in Sunndal, Norway. Located in an area of exceptional natural beauty, surrounded by lush forests of spruce, beech and fir forests, the waterfall is worth a day trip if weather permits. A wooden pedestrian bridge takes visitors under the waterfall. (updated Mar 2023)
Dariva Canyon, Dariva (west of Goat's Bridge). 24/7. An 8 km long promenade from the historic centre of Sarajevo to the Goat's Bridge, following the canyon of the Miljacka.

There are 150 linden trees lining the promenade, planted by diplomats residing in Sarajevo at the invitation of the mayor. Some of the trees still have plaques bearing the names of those who planted them. Free. (updated Oct 2017)

Pijaca "Ciglane". Interesting local market where you won't find any tourist. (updated Mar 2023)
In addition to the usual types of souvenirs, such as key rings, are more distinctive carpets and copperware, not all of which are locally made. Over a century ago, each street in this area hawked a specific ware: for example, one street had all the coppersmiths, shoes were on another, jewellery on another. An underground souk (open 08:00-20:00) stretches along the west side of Gazi Husrev-begova street. Prices are generally fixed, and so whilst haggling for a 4 KM keyring is pointless it may be possible for bulk purchases or the odd 2,000 USD carpet.

The bedesten serves as the central building in the historic commercial part of the city, and has its origins in the Greco-Roman basilica or kaiserion which served a similar purpose. During Ottoman times, the bedesten was of such economic importance that cities were classified under two categories: those with a bedesten, and those without. These days the focus is on low end tourist tat and knock-off watches and handbags. (updated Aug 2017)

The local currency is konvertibilna marka (KM, Convertible Mark, international abbreviation BAM), fixed at €1 =  KM (~1 KM = €)), and is used throughout the country. Informally, restaurants may accept euros at €1 = 2 KM. The odd rate is because the Convertible Mark was originally pegged 1:1 against the Deutsche Mark, which was replaced with the euro at that rate.
There are many banks along Maršala Tita at the north boundary of Old Town, usually open M-F 08:00-18:00, Sa 09:00-13:00. Money can also be exchanged at any post office or at currency exchange booths, which stay open till 21:00: as always take care to check both the exchange rate and level of commission.

House of Spite, by the Miljacka river
It is said in Bosnia that some people eat to be able to drink, others eat to be able to live and work, but true Bosnians work and live to eat. A lot of attention is devoted to the preparation and consumption of food in Sarajevo. Gastronomy in the city was developed under Eastern and Western influences, and Bosnian cuisine focuses on local produce like meat, vegetables, fruits and dairy products. For information on typical Bosnian foods, see Bosnia#Eat.
Cheap food on the go, from a myriad small shops and cafés, is burek, ćevapi or pita. Burek is meat pie. Ćevapi are grilled meats; the word derives from "kebab" and the traditional Sarajevo style is minced beef and mutton in a somun flatbread. Pita is a filo pasty or pie, typical varieties being meat (meso), cheese (sirnica, similar to ricotta), cheese and spinach (zeljanica), pumpkin (tikvenica) and spicy potato (krompirusa).

The history of this restaurant dates back to the Austro-Hungarian occupation, when Sarajevo underwent large scale infrastructure projects which resulted in the post office, the National Museum, the Faculty of Law and many others. When the City Hall was to be constructed however, the Austro-Hungarians faced the stubbornness of an old Bosnian man named Benderija who lived in a hourse in that location. He refused to have his house demolished for the construction of the City Hall, and only after long negotiations he agreed to give up his property under 2 conditions: he wanted a bag of golden coins as compensation, and the house had to be moved brick by brick to the other side of the river. Since then, the building is known as the house of spite, and a symbol of Bosnian stubbornness and resistance against the government. In 1997, the house was converted to a lovely restaurant selling hearty stew-like meals and Bosnian specialities. A terrace offers a view over the river and the Sarajevo City Hall which it replaces. The house is decorated in oriental style, and worth visiting for the ambient alone. 6-20 KM (Aug 2017). (updated Aug 2022)

There are four mobile operators in Sarajevo: BH Telecom (060, 061, 062), m:tel (065, 066, 067), HT Eronet (063) and Haloo (064). Since Bosnia and Herzegovina is not part of the EU or EEA, the international roaming charges are not capped as those have been since 2017, and can be much higher. However Bosnia and Herzegovina is part of a Balkan roaming zone with Montenegro, Serbia and North Macedonia, capped at € per MB from July 2017. But that only applies if you have a local SIM card, from any of the operators, which can be purchased in one of the many kiosks around the city. BH Telecom, m:tel and HT Eronet have offers aimed towards tourists, starting from 20 km for 5 GB.

WARNING: As part of the Siege of Sarajevo from 1992-95, extensive mine fields were laid in the hills around the city, of which most had no or inaccurately recorded locations. Although extensive demining efforts were carried out and the canton of Sarajevo has been proclaimed as demined, land mines may still be hidden in the forests in places like Trebević that span through both of Bosnia and Herzegovina entities. Never leave paths when walking in the hills around the Olympic facilities, and never enter abandoned buildings.
Mines are still hidden in the forests around Sarajevo
There are still many minefields and unexploded ordnances in the broader Sarajevo area (although not in any urban area). Never go into damaged buildings (which are really rarely seen) and always stick to paved surfaces avoiding grassy hills that surround the city. As of 2020, Trebević has been completely demined. Areas that are not cleared are marked by yellow tape or signs, but still not all minefields have been identified due to the lack of resources and the lack of international help. Paved roads are always safe. Crime against foreigners is very rare and the city is safe to visit. (As with any country in former Yugoslavia, be careful not to get into sensitive discussions about politics with people you do not know, but even those can be very educational when you come across a person who's willing to discuss it.) Be aware of pick pockets who usually operate on public transportation.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has double the traffic fatality rate in Europe as a whole, and in the early 2020s there have been a few high-profile accidents with pedestrians. Be alert whether driving or crossing the street.
There are an incredible number of pickpockets working in the city and very few police officers on patrol; police are rarely seen. Pickpockets are very sloppy and it's pretty easy to spot them, but with that number of people picking the pockets they probably will succeed eventually.
Due to being surrounded by hills the air in Sarajevo in winter months (November-February) can be noticeably thick with pollution, so that asthmatics or those with other chest problems may find themselves short of breath a lot of the time, particularly at night. Ensure you have ample medication, just in case.
Avoid areas of the city such as Alipašino Polje, Švrakino and the surrounding areas of the Novi Grad municipality as those are mainly dangerous zones with high crime rates, shootings, violence and poverty. Go there only with locals and not during the night. Anyway it is off the tourist trail and you most likely won't have any reason to even go to those parts. Getting there accidentally is next to impossible as these rough neighbourhoods are far from the city centre and any of the sights in outlying areas.

Water from fountains and taps in Sarajevo is safe to drink, but it may have an unpleasant chlorine odour. The mains supply may be turned off overnight.
The main risk to your health, land mines aside, is the strong sunlight. Usual precautions: hat, long-sleeved shirt, seek the shade and apply sun screen.
Pharmacies (Apotheka) are dotted around the city. Two handy for Old Town are Al-Hana on Ulika Patka, and Apoteka Baščaršija at Obala Kulina bana 40 by the riverside.

Cultural heritage from the Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and most recently Yugoslav periods has been assimilated into modern Sarajevo as a multicultural, multireligious metropole. Catholic and Orthodox Christians and Muslims share the city, and as such, common sense regarding respect towards people of these religious backgrounds should be upheld. Even the younger generation is on average very religious in comparison to other European capitals, although not all religious traditions may be followed equally strictly. For example, young Muslims may choose to drink wine but refuse pork, while older Muslims likely abstain from both. Keep this in mind when offering presents to your host family. When visiting mosques, skin-covering clothing should be worn, and women should wear a scarf covering their hair. At the most touristic mosques, scarfs are available for visitors to borrow.
Although the Bosnian War ended with a UN enforced cease fire, the underlying conflicts between the different ethnic groups in Sarajevo are far from resolved. Many inhabitants have survived the siege of the city from 1992–95, and almost everyone has lost relatives and/or friends in the conflict. Strong anti-Serb sentiments may be present among the Bosniak population, and scars from the war are left in memory. While the war is not a taboo subject, as evidenced by the many memorials and museums scattered around the city, it remains a sensitive topic that easily brings up negative memories, if addressed uncomprehendingly. Aside from anti-Serb sentiments, many also feel dismay or anger towards the United Nations, which are blamed for the Srebrenica massacre and inadequate protection of Sarajevo citizens during the Siege.
There is an ongoing dispute between Bosnian unionists and Serb separatists, striving for the independence of Republika Srpska. Since the neighbouring town of East Sarajevo is on the territory of Republika Srpska, opinions will vary depending on where you ask in the city, although the relations are less tense than in other parts of the country and people don't have issues crossing the geographical borders. The political situation in Sarajevo in particular is complex, and outsiders taking a position may be accused of uninformed interference in internal Bosnian affairs. In general, it is advised to abstain from discussing politics, unless your conversation partner brings up the topic him/herself and asks for your opinion.
