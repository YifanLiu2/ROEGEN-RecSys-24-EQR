Regina is the capital city of the province of Saskatchewan. With about 215,000 people (2016), it is in the southeastern part of the province on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1).
Wascana Centre, created around the focal point of Wascana Lake, remains one of Regina's attractions and contains the Provincial Legislative Building, both campuses of the University of Regina, First Nations University of Canada, the provincial museum of natural history, the Regina Conservatory (in the original Regina College buildings), the Saskatchewan Science Centre, the MacKenzie Art Gallery and the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts.
Regina is pronounced with a long "I" in the middle. It's home of the RCMP Training Academy and the Canadian Football League's Saskatchewan Roughriders. Before Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces, Regina was the capital of the Northwest Territories. Louis Riel, founder of Manitoba and the leader of the Métis peoples, was executed in the city.
Residential neighbourhoods include precincts beyond the historic city centre are historically or socially noteworthy neighbourhoods – namely Lakeview and The Crescents, both of which lie directly south of downtown. Immediately to the north of the central business district is the old warehouse district, increasingly the focus of shopping, nightclubs and residential development; as in other western cities of North America, the periphery contains shopping malls and big box stores.
As demand has risen for Saskatchewan's agricultural and mineral resources, Regina has enjoyed a period of strong economic growth.
The site had been called Wascana ("Buffalo Bones" in Cree), but was renamed "Regina" (Latin for "Queen") in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria. This decision was made by Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Louise, who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada, the Marquess of Lorne.
Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West, on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off, Wascana Creek. Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre (850-ft) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake. Regina's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906.
In 1912, the Regina Cyclone destroyed much of the town; in the 1930s, the Regina Riot brought further attention and, in the midst of the 1930s drought and Great Depression, which hit the Canadian Prairies particularly hard with their economic focus on dry land grain farming. The predecessor of the New Democratic Party (the main left-wing political party in Canada), formulated its foundation Regina Manifesto of 1933 in Regina.

Much like Saskatoon, Regina has a higher-than-average crime rate per capita (at one point being known as Canada's most dangerous city), but unless you go out looking for trouble, nothing is likely to happen to you. The downtown area is quite safe, though you may run into the occasional panhandler or drunken person at night.
The two main neighbourhoods to avoid in Regina are the North Central and Heritage/Chinatown districts, (which are located northwest and northeast of the downtown core), and where most of the crime and prostitution is concentrated.
Moose Jaw - Chief attractions are the excellent Western Development Museum (one of four in the province) near the intersection of Main St. and the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway #1). This museum's focus is on transportation, which fills it with excellent, bright displays of antique trains, automobiles, and aircraft, with even one prairie boat thrown in! Another notable tourist attraction is the pair of "tunnels of Moose Jaw" tours, which take visitors through a set of winding tours above and below the downtown core of "the Friendly City." The tours have two themes: the Chinese immigrant experience, and the bad old days of the 1920s, when Chicago mobster Al Capone allegedly took a ride to the northwest terminus of the Soo Line Railway in Moose Jaw to hide out whenever the "heat" was turned up in Chicago.
Regina Beach - 60 km (35 miles) northwest of Regina, north of Hwy 11. This beach community and several others sit on Last Mountain Lake.
White Butte - 10 km east of Regina on Highway 1 or 46.
Fort Qu'Appelle for decades, has been another summer getaway, with several shallow lakes in the vicinity lined by rows of cottages and boat houses.
Rouleau, a small town about 45 minutes south of Regina, is a popular destination because it was used as the filming location for the popular TV sitcom Corner Gas from 2004-2009. (The studio where the rest of the series was filmed is near Broad Street and College Avenue in downtown Regina.)
