Changchun (长春; Chángchūn; lit. Long Spring) is the capital of Jilin Province. With a population of more than 6 million, it is one of the major cities in Northeast China (东北; Dōngběi), and is the largest center for China's automotive industry.
Despite its relatively high population and economic importance, Changchun has a lot of greenery, especially stands of pine trees, and though it is a draw for university students and some investors, it is not a major tourist destination, which is probably one of the reasons people who do visit this city are likely to meet friendly people who are interested in speaking with them, not necessarily to sell them anything but just out of curiosity.
Changchun was the capital of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo from 1932 to 1945. In 2007, the city hosted the Asian Winter Games.
Changchun in its present form is a new city with only about 200 years of history.
But there used to be a city thousands of years ago known by different names. The ancient city changed its name several times, 'Xidu', 'Helong', 'Tiangang' (Han Dynasty), 'Shushan' (Tang Dynasty), 'Longzhou' (Liao Dynasty), and 'Kuancheng' (Jin Dynasty). Eventually, Kuancheng was destroyed by the Mongolian army, leaving nothing except mention of its conquest in the annals of history.
In 1800 (Qing Dynasty), Emperor Jiaqing decided to build a town, as one of the junctions on the way from the capital Beijing, to the Changbai Mountains, the holy mountains of Qing royalty. The Emperor gave the reborn town a name with a blessing: 'Changchun'. In some tales, this new name came from a couplet made by the Emperor Qianlong, the father of Jiaqing. This couplet was made when the old emperor was on his way to the Changbai Mountains, to praise the spring-like summer of the Changchun area.
After defeating China in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), Japan had desires to expand, including plans to conquer the eastern lands of Fengtian Province (Liaoning Province today) from China. This expansion clashed with the wishes of Russia, France, and Germany; Japan had to settle for money from China instead (about 30 million liang). For their part, Russia got the rights to build a railway in the sought-after lands.
In 1896, Russia built a railway station and a settlement in Changchun.
In 1906, Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, and gained the rights to the railway in southern Northeast China. Changchun became the junction between the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railway and the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway, which had different rail gauges and permit licenses. There were railway repair shops, and branch lines originating in Changchun extended into Korea and Inner Mongolia.
An epidemic of pneumonia occurred in many parts of Manchuria from 1910–11.
On 18 September 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria. The leader of the area, Zhang Xueliang, commanded his army to retreat without counterattack, and pinned all his hopes on the intercession of the League of Nations, which was ineffectual.
The city's name was changed on 1 March 1932, to Xinjing (新京), the capital of Manchukuo, and Pu Yi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, was its designated overseer. The new tenants gave it a grand blueprint with broad avenues and modern public works. The city underwent rapid expansion in both economy and infrastructure and provided materials for Japan's wars.
The Chinese people were forbidden to learn their own language and culture, as they were now under the control of the Japanese Empire. Life under Japanese occupation was cruel.
The area changed hands again when on 20 August 1944, the Soviet army took over the city. They stayed until 4 April 1946, and took away all the machines and materials they could move. At that time, the army of the Republic of China took over the city. Two months later, the Chinese Civil War began, and Changchun once again became a battlefield.
From May to October 1948, the Kuomintang army was besieged by the Communist army. The Kuomintang army looted food from citizens and the Communists forbade anybody to leave. At last, the Kuomintang army surrendered and the Communist army captured the city.
A few years after the Civil War, in September 1954, Changchun became the capital of Jilin Province. Nowadays, it is a quiet northern city having short, windy springs and cool summers. It is also an important domestic optical research center, along with automobile and train manufacturing bases.
New train tracks have been laid, decades after world powers fought for its resources. On 27 May 2010, China's fastest high speed train, the 380A which can reach 380 km/hr, began operations as the city continues to make its own history.

Changchun has a monsoon-influenced climate, with great seasonal temperature extremes. Winters are long, very cold, and windy, with a January average high temperature of −10 °C (14°F). However, there is little snow and the air is dry. Summers are very warm and humid, with extended periods of 30°C (86°F) highs, though the average high in July is 28°C (82°F).
Changchun Longjia International Airport CGQ IATA (长春龙嘉国际机场) (around 30 km east of city center). +86 431 77783333. Large and clean, and passengers can find standard amenities such as restaurants, cafes, shops, lounges, credit card acceptance, etc. For first class passengers there are two lounges available, but the standard is far below of the lounges of international airports. Flights are available to many Chinese cities, plus other Asian destinations such as Tokyo and Bangkok. The most popular flights are to Shanghai (2 hr 20 min) and Beijing (1 hr 40 min).
The Longjia rail station is in the airport. It has high-speed train access to Changchun, taking just 14 minutes. The frequency is every 10-30 minutes during the day, but it does not run at night (about 8pm-7am).
From the airport there are regular coach services (¥20-30 one way) available to the center (e.g. People's Square (人民广场)). Travel time is around 45 minutes. A taxi to/from the city costs around ¥80 including toll, but from the airport to the city most of the taxi drivers reject a drive if you are not willing to pay at least ¥100 (do not discuss it, do it or take the bus).
Changchun has two main passenger railway stations:
Changchun Railway Station (长春站; Changchun Zhan) (at the north end of Renmin Avenue (人民大街)). Although it is large and chaotic, providing you read Chinese and speak some Mandarin and are prepared to fight through the queues, you can buy a ticket to almost anywhere in China from here.
Changchun West Railway Station (长春西站). High Speed Trains (D and G trains) depart from here.
There is also Changchun South Railway Station (长春南站), which is very small and only local trains stop there.
Thanks to the railroad-building efforts of Japanese in the early- to mid-1900s, the rail network in Northeast China is extensive and no place is very far by rail. (All times approximate.)
Beijing - 8 hours ( hours D Train)
Dalian - 7–10 hours (4 hours D Train)
Harbin - 4 hours ( hours D Train)
Jilin - 2/3 hours, D Train
Shanghai - 32 hours ( hours G train)
Shenyang - 2–4 hours ( hours D Train)
Rail travel is by far the cheapest way to travel in and out of Changchun. If you do not want to go to the train station yourself, you can go to any good travel agent who will do this on your behalf, usually for ¥10-20 extra.
There are long-distance coaches that regularly go from/to Beijing available from the coach station on Huanghe Road (黄河路), just off Renmin Avenue (人民大街). There is also a long-distance bus station at the south end of Renmin Avenue (take bus Z306 from the train station).
You can also catch coaches and buses from pretty much anywhere in Jilin Province, though they have a reputation for being dangerous and are slightly more expensive, though faster, than the train.
The main Long-Distance Bus Station is at 226 Renmin Avenue.
Beijing - takes about 8 hours
Dalian - takes about 8 hours
Harbin - takes about 4 hours
Jilin - takes about 2 hours
Shenyang - takes about 4 hours
Changchun is a very compact city planned by the Japanese with a layout of open avenues and public squares (guǎngchǎng). It is pretty easy to travel from one place to another; however, with the increase in private car ownership, traffic is getting worse by the day.
The Changchun Subway consists of 5 lines (1,2,3,4,8) which provide easy access to many parts of the city.
Line 2 serves the Changchun West train station. Lines 3 and 4 serve the Changchun train station (line 1 passes nearby but a station is not yet open).
Taxis are by far the best way to get around. They are cheap but you should have a piece of paper with the address if you do not speak Mandarin.
Taxi fares start at ¥5 up to  km (plus a mandatory ¥1 fuel surtax), after that ¥/.5 km. Several taxi companies are serving the city and they will not try to cheat you. It is common for drivers to pick up other passengers who might be going in the same direction if there are unused seats.
However, if the driver is taking you in circles, complain at the hotel drop-off point. The staff there normally will support you in such cases. For other cases simply pay not more than shown on the meter. In general: Make sure you know the name of the places you are going to in Mandarin or have a paper with the Chinese address with you. It would not hurt either to travel during the day and have one of Shangri-La's English maps, or even one in Chinese from Xinhua bookstore.
From May to October, Changchun is a decent walking city, as the weather is fine and there are no hills. The city does tend to be spread out, so travelers should plan on using other forms of transportation. During the winter months temperatures are too cold to walk longer distances in Changchun, so other forms of transport should be considered.
There are two light rail routes (54 and 55) operating in the west part of the city. Route 55 terminates at Changchun West train station.
An extensive bus network and most of the buses cost ¥1; however, those who can not read Chinese will find it nearly impossible to use the network.
Most buses go to the bus station outside the train station, and other central areas such as Guilin Road (桂林路), Chongqing Road (重庆路) and Hongqi Street (红旗街). The buses are often extremely crowded and especially uncomfortable during the hot summers as there is no air conditioning.
362 - 06:00-20:30 daily. From the train station to Hongqi Street (红旗街), Chongqing Road (重庆路) and Guilin Road (桂林路).
306 - 5:50AM-23:00 daily. Busy route that goes north–south along Renmin Avenue (人民大街) from the train station to Changchun University (长春大学).
80 - 06:00-20:00 daily. Circular route around Changchun that goes pretty much everywhere including Hongqi Street (红旗街), Chongqing Road (重庆路), Guilin Road (桂林路), the train station and the zoo.
240 - 06:00-19:30. Satellite Square (卫星广场) to Culture Square (文化广场) via Guilin Road (桂林路).
Although the city once had the most complex tram system in Northern China, there is now only one remaining route still open. The number 54 runs down Hongqi Street (红旗街) to the far west of the city (where there really is not much). Many of the trams still in use today are the original cars from 1940, so it is worth the ¥1 ride just for the experience of yesteryear.
If you are in need of an adrenaline rush, look no further than one of the minibuses that tear around the city streets. Some places out in the suburbs are only serviced by such buses, and the fare is usually ¥1-2, but the drivers seem to think that they are on a giant racetrack most of the time and you will get thrown around. Expect the front passenger to sit at the side-door, calling out to potential customers, and to be encouraged to hop on the bus while it is moving ever so slowly. If you were old, they would probably stop, or expect you to take a taxi for a little more. Very crowded at times.
Travelers should be cautious of bicycling in Changchun. For half the year it is generally too cold and during the summer months, too dangerous. Unlike other big cities in China, Changchun does not separate cycle lanes from the main traffic, which leads to buses, taxis, cars, and motorcycles sharing the same space as the cyclists. The whole situation is dangerous and this is perhaps the reason why by Chinese standards there are few people who regularly cycle here. The other problem is that because of the city's layout, there are plenty of large roundabouts where 4 or 5 busy roads converge on one another, making it extremely difficult to cycle without having to continually dismount.
If you want to bike around, it is recommended that you follow closely behind one of the local people on cargo-bike, merchant-bike, or donkey. There are off times during the day when biking would be less challenging. Drivers are not overly aggressive towards bikers.
There are brightly-colored three-wheel plastic taxis, available from near Changchun University (长春大学), which only operate for short distances in the south of the city. If you are in the Jingyuetan (净月潭) part of town, this is the easiest mode of transport as there are few taxis operating there. It is fairly easy to find a taxi anywhere in Jingyuetan. They are cheaper and slower than regular taxis. There is no meter, so expect to negotiate with the driver. A typical ride should not exceed ¥3.
If you need to get somewhere fast then jump on one of these. They generally hang around in the south of the city and out in the suburbs. They are unlicensed to carry fare paying passengers, so bear in mind that if there is an accident, you might find yourself in trouble. However, they tend to drive in the cycle lanes at quite low speeds and so are safer than you might expect. Expect to pay as little as ¥1 for a short trip.

The Puppet Manchukuo government's State Department
The 8 Puppet Manchukuo Government Departments (伪满八大部). Around 1936, the puppet Manchukuo government built its capital with several important government departments in what is now Changchun's Chaoyang District.

Norman Bethune Health Science Center of Jilin University (吉林大学白求恩医学部), 828 Xinmin Street, Choayang District (朝阳区新民大街828号) (about 1 km south of Wenhua Square Station on Metro Line 2), ☏ +86 13596115561 (contact number for the museum). Norman Bethune was a remarkable Canadian doctor. He is quite famous in China, partly because Mao wrote an essay about meeting him and millions of kids read that in school. He was a military doctor in both World War I and the Spanish Civil War, then came to China. The Americans wanted to send him to the Nationalist Army, but he refused and went to the Communists instead. He founded this school in 1939, initially to train "barefoot doctors", peasants trained to help when there was a desperate shortage of army medics. Today it offers more conventional training for doctors, nurses and other health workers. There is a small museum dedicated to Norman Bethune on the ground floor. The museum is open from 13:00 to 16:30 on Wednesdays and Fridays, but as of 2021, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, only staff and students are allowed to visit.

People's Square (人民广场; Rénmín Guǎngchǎng), Chaoyang District (朝阳区) (Renmin Square Station, Metro Line 1). In the Chaoyang District around the cross streets of Xi'an Lu (西安路), Renmin Dajie (人民大街), and Changchun Dajie (长春大街). It is one of the focal points of Changchun. It is close to Baishan Park (白山公园), and a mini "Culture Square" of sorts. The site commemorates the Russian soldiers, and specifically Russian pilots that died to liberate Changchun during the Second World War.
Wenhua Square (文化广场; Wénhùa Guǎngchǎng), Chaoyang District (朝阳区) (Wenhua Square Station, Metro Line 2; north of the crossroads of Xinmin Dajie (新民大街) and Jiefang Dalu (解放大路)). A pleasant urban hangout which offers a glimpse into Changchun's Japanese imperial past. The square is surrounded by several historical buildings from the Manchukuo era. On the north end of the square sits the majestic former New Palace of the Emperor of Manchukuo (新帝宫), which was intended to replace the Puppet Imperial Palace. On the south end of the square are the former Manchukuo State Council and Military Affairs buildings. These buildings, which are now affiliated with Jilin University, offer prime examples of early 20th-century Japanese architecture. On the square, vendors sell kites and various other products. Many people fly kites from this square, while others play traditional Chinese instruments or just sit and relax. More formal performances are sometimes held on a temporary stage set up near the high school. For casual visitors to Changchun, this is probably a good place to visit by taxi.

Changchun Teacher's College dead link (长春师范学院)
Changchun University of Technologydead link (长春工业大学)

There are also private training centers that will provide either small group Mandarin lessons, one-on-one lessons, or even a home tutor. The rates are around ¥40 for a one-hour or longer lesson with a professional teacher.
Currency exchange is available at the airport, various hotels and banks, including Bank of China on Xi'an Dalu (西安大路).
There are three major shopping areas: Chongqing Road (重庆路; Chóngqìnglù), Guilin Road (桂林路; Guìlinlù), and Hongqi Street (红旗街; Hóngqíjiē).
Ginseng - as the region around Changchun is a top producer of ginseng, it is available at most pharmacies in the city. Other products that may be of interest include wood ear fungus and lingzhi mushroom.
Kites - attractive and cheap kites are sold by vendors around Culture Square.
Sanfo is the leading outdoor gear stores in China and local store is at 668 Xikang Hutong, Ziyou Dalu District.
People's Square Here is the biggest selection of clothing shops and department stores in the whole city. Shopping runs along both Xi'an Da Lu and Changchun St. A well-visited mall, Charter Mall, (Zhuōzhǎn 卓展), on Xi'an Da Lu across from the Shangri-la Hotel. One can find luxury brands co-existing with the likes of Wal-Mart.
Guilin Road (桂林路) area is about  km ( mi) to the south of Chongqing Rd along Tongzhi Jie (同志街) and is the most cosmopolitan part of town. The area along Guilin Lu, Tongzhi St, and the surrounding side streets offer much to see, buy, and eat. There are many restaurants in this area especially if you are interested in Korean food. Be careful with Korean food in Changchun as many Korean restaurants specialize in "Dog pot." There is less overall choice than Chongqing Lu, but if you are looking for specifics - e.g. Korean fashions then is the best place in town - though the shops in this area are a little more expensive. This area can be extremely busy, and it is definitely a target area for younger shoppers. Many places will not haggle price.
Hongqi Street (红旗街) is to the west of Guilin Lu and is the smallest of the three shopping areas. It is dominated by one of the better department stores in Changchun: Ouya (欧亚). The 6th-8th floors of Ouya contain the largest electronics market in the city. You can find anything electronic here, from mp3 players to laptops. Prices can be very high.
The Underground Markets (Dìxià Shìchǎng 地下市场): These are now extensive underground shopping areas, originally dug out by POWs during the occupation, intended to be used as bomb shelters. There are three of these places in Changchun: Chongqing Lu (重庆路), the Train Station (长春站), and Hongqi Jie (红旗街). If you want anything cheap (and probably fake) then these are the places to come. There are hundreds of small shops selling relatively undifferentiated products, and the term buyer beware definitely applies. There are some good deals to be had, but some products are poor quality and have high ticket prices. Therefore, be prepared to haggle as the shopkeepers will try to get you to pay the sticker price, which the local shoppers will never pay. If you don't speak Chinese, bring a pen and paper to help negotiate your price. Start at 50% to 75% off the ticketed price. If the shopkeeper balks at your offer, go to another seller. More often than not, if the shopkeeper wants the sale, they will call after you. This can be a fun shopping experience, but you may get your best deal at a discount retailer at home.
Beifang Market (Beǐfāng Shìchǎng 北方市场)
Zhongdong Market (Zhōngdōng Dàshìchǎng 中东大市场)

Mayflower. It's been said this is the hottest club in town, and that the "old Mayflower" is simply the best. There are two rooms. In the outer room there is a live show daily from 21:00, and after that the DJ plays disco. The inner room is small but quite popular. It plays hip-hop and it gets out of control after 13:00. The third Mayflower bar was opened in the basement of the Shangri-La hotel. Here it's similar to the other branches, but because of the location in the city center hotel, the international hotel guest visitors bring in another facet into this bar.
