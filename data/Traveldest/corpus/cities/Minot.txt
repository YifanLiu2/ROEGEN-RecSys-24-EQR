Minot is a city in the Lakes and Gardens region of North Dakota with an estimated 48,000 in 2017. Known as the Magic City, it's a significant rail hub (for freight, anyway). However, its location deep within North America and off the Interstate System generally means you don't see Minot if you don't plan on it.
The Souris River goes through the middle of town, carving a valley in the middle of flat prairie. The town arose in 1880s as a stop along the Great Northern railway. During Prohibition the city became a nexus for alcohol smuggling. After World War II the city settled down into quiet suburbanation. Today Minot is best known for the US Air Force base north of town. You can drive to Canada in just over an hour.
Minot is a rather unusual city, though possessing levels of services similar to much larger cities, it struggles between small-town and cosmopolitan attitudes. Civic growth is not greatly helped by the climate. T-shirts available at the airport have this motto: "Why not Minot? Freezin's the reason!"

Minot International Airport, as of May 2024 not serving international destinations - even though a short hop to the north would take you across the Canadian border
Minot International Airport (MOT IATA), 305 N Airport Rd (2 miles north of downtown Minot on Broadway (US 83), at northside of town). The airport is served by Allegiant (Las Vegas, Orlando Sanford Airport, Phoenix-Mesa Airport), Delta/Delta Connection (Minneapolis-St Paul) and United/United Express (Denver and Houston). There are taxis, rideshare (Lyft & Uber), and hotel shuttles to bring you into town locally. There are also car rentals available from the airport which is the preferred method for greater flexibility in getting around to the surrounding areas. See this Link for a list of ground transport options.
Minot's location towards the center of the continent places it well off the beaten path for travelers. Most commonly, visitors are passing by. Often they are taking the scenic route west through Montana (or coming from that direction). Also, many Canadian tour buses bound for points east (Minneapolis, Chicago, etc.) will cross into the US through Portal, and stop in Minot for fuel and a quick bite.
The major routes through the city are US 2 (east-west), US 83 (north-south), and US 52 (northwest-southeast). US 2 intersects with Interstate 29 in Grand Forks, US 83 intersects with Interstate 94 in Bismarck, and US 52 intersects with Interstate 94 in Jamestown. Successors to 83 and 52 also intersect with the Trans-Canada Highway.
