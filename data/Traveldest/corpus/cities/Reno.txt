Reno, the "Biggest Little City in the World" is in the beautiful north-west region of the State of Nevada, right at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is the second largest tourist destination in Nevada, featuring resorts, gaming, family entertainment, outdoor activities, festivals, museums, fantastic cuisine, shows for everyone, art and culture.
Reno is steeped in a rich, diverse, and rugged history. This is where the historic Johnson-Jeffries fight happened. This is where Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable made The Misfits in 1961—the last completed film for both (Gable died in 1960, after shooting was complete but before release; Monroe died in 1962). It is where the railroad tumbles down out of the mountains from California to cross the Truckee River and begin the long journey east. It's difficult to walk the streets of Reno without seeing the history in this dynamic city.
Most Renoites consider the start of it all to be 1859, when Charles Fuller built a log bridge across the Truckee River and started charging to cross over it on the way to the Gold Rush in California or coming back to Nevada for the "Washoe Rush" in Virginia City. Fuller set up shelter for weary travelers to rest. He served meals at a price, and created an opportunity for prospectors to exchange stories and information.
The town site of Reno, named after Civil War General Jesse Reno, was established on May 13, 1868.
Since its beginning, Reno has spread across much of the Truckee Meadows. Reno and Sparks (a smaller adjacent city) now spread across this small valley separating the Sierra Nevada mountains to the West and Nevada's expansive desert areas to the East.
The profiteering characteristic of the founders may have occasionally plagued the course of Reno's subsequent generations. Some Renoites claim Nevadans are simply of a freer nature. Others think the city has repeated the steps of the goldrush era founders. Certainly, the choices made today are what will determine the true nature of the community. Regardless, Reno enjoys a pretty decent quality of life with four seasons, winter and summer fun, a major university, and plenty of other entertainment.
Reno is in Northwestern Nevada, at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and serves as the urban center for a region including nearby Carson City and the Carson Valley, Lake Tahoe, Pyramid Lake, and historic mining town Virginia City, home of the Comstock Lode. Along with the city of Sparks, Reno is in the Truckee Meadows, and together they form the Reno-Sparks Metropolitan Area.
Competition in the last years of the 20th century slowed down the gambling business in Reno considerably. Given that its downtown centered around these activities for a good 50 years, the same downtown suffered. Downtown today has weathered the storm, and is improving with projects like a baseball and entertainment district and several condo projects that were completed despite economic slowdown. Growth in the area has continued due to its livability. Reno is working hard to build a different kind of city for a greater variety of tastes, and keeping that in mind will help the visitor see the town through the right kind of eyes.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Reno is at the western edge of the Great Basin, a zone stretching to Salt Lake City that does not drain to the sea - water is carried away by evaporation only. Average precipitation is approximately 7 in (180 mm) a year, with much of that occurring in the winter in the form of snow. July is the warmest month, with an average high of 91 °F (33 °C), and January is the coldest month, with an average low of 19 °F (−7 °C).

As Reno and the Sierra Nevada are popular weekend destinations for Northern Californians, traffic can be bad coming to Reno on Friday evening, and leaving Reno on Sunday evening, especially in the ski season.
The most direct route to Reno from Sacramento is via Interstate 80 over Donner Summit (7239 feet or 2206 m). This route sees a great deal of snowfall during the winter, and will shut down for periods of up to a day several times during a typical winter. Northern California residents also use U.S. 395 in Susanville, which stays at a lower elevation and has less problems of traffic and weather. Residents living in the Redding and Chico areas of California find this route safer and quicker. If you plan on crossing this or any other pass in the Sierra Nevada in the winter, keep an eye on the weather forecast, and always carry tire chains if you do not have four-wheel drive.
An alternative route is US 50 over Echo Summit (7330 feet). This route follows the American River up from the Sacramento Valley, and then drops into the Lake Tahoe Basin. From there you can continue on US 50 into Carson City, and from there head north to Reno on US 395, or continue around the lake to Incline Village and drop into Reno on the Mount Rose Highway. This route is two lanes only for much of the way, and traffic can be heavy both in the winter and the summer, and winter maintenance is not as good as on Interstate 80.
Passes across the Sierra south of US 50, aside from CA 88, are not maintained in the winter (from approximately November until May.) And when they are open they are out of the way and potentially dangerous.
The most direct route to Reno is via US 395. This route takes you up the Owens Valley to Bishop, past Mammoth Lakes, into Carson City and thence to Reno. The portion between Bishop and Carson City crosses three passes as high as 8,143 ft (2,482 m) that may have moderately heavy snowfall during winter storms. In that event it would be better to take U.S. 6 from Bishop over Montgomery Pass to U.S. 95 (north) which stays in much lower valleys with less snow. At Schurz beyond Walker Lake take 95(Alt) north to Fernley, then I-80 west to Reno.
Don't be fooled by the fact that Las Vegas and Reno are in the same state - there are about 8 hours of driving time separating them. Take US 95 north to Fallon, US 50 west to Fernley, and Interstate 80 west to Reno. If you're not a fan of desert landscapes, boredom is a serious risk on this trip. Winter weather will generally not be a large problem on this trip, but don't count on being able to find food or fuel outside the major towns (Beatty, Tonopah, Hawthorne, Fallon, and Fernley)
During the summer the heat along US 95 can be hard on you and on your vehicle. A much more comfortable alternative to cooking in your car is to drive during the night. Many of the dark stretches between the small towns along US 95 reveal numerous shooting stars and other astral phenomena that you might miss during the baking sun. Keep in mind that driving at night can be dangerous due to the visibility limitations from the hills and the mountains. Be sure to have a lot of rest before undertaking this trip.
The most traveled route to Reno from the east is Interstate 80. Interstate 80 follows the old Emigrant trail along the Humboldt river for most of the way across Nevada, and thus the grades are generally easy. However, it does this at the expense of swinging well north of the direct route to Reno. US 50 ("The Loneliest Highway in America") is more direct, but it crosses several large mountain ranges and thus has some tight curves, steep grades and a few switchbacks. Don't count on finding food or fuel along US 50 outside of the major towns (Ely, Eureka, Austin, Fallon and Fernley).
Amtrak serves Reno via its California Zephyr service between Emeryville and Chicago, and stops once a day in both directions.

Reno is served by two freeways: I-80 running east-west, and US 580 (previously 395), running north-south. Circling the valley of the Truckee Meadows is the McCarran Blvd ring road. The primary business artery is Virginia Street, which runs north-south through downtown Reno. Major east-west routes include Moana Lane, Plumb Lane, Mill Street, Second Street, Fourth Street, and Sixth Street. Major routes running north-south in Reno include Keystone Avenue, Lakeside Drive, Wells Avenue, and Kietzke Lane.
Nearly all national car rental agencies serve the Reno-Tahoe International Airport. Note that several agencies do not have fleets within the airport property.

However, the terminal includes an Enterprise service counter, they offer free shuttle service during business hours, and taxi vouchers and a pickup hotline for drop-offs after hours.
Reno's transit system, called RTC RIDE, is operated by the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County. The busiest route, the #1 bus, has been replaced with two services, RTC RAPID, a priority express bus making limited stops, and RTC CONNECT, the local. RAPID runs 15 minutes or better headways most of the day through Downtown Reno (a good place to start is the RTC 4th Street Station at 4th and Lake) and down South Virginia Street (the major north-south street) to Meadowood Mall. RTC RAPID should serve any tourist well for most shopping, dining, and gambling needs.
Other routes to know about are the #11, which runs between downtown Reno and downtown Sparks, and the Sierra Spirit circulator bus (7AM – 7PM), which connects various downtown destinations along the Virginia Street corridor down to the Truckee River to the south and the University of Nevada, Reno, to the north. In downtown Reno, all buses stop at or near the RTC 4th Street Station at 4th and Lake St, where you can also find The Bus Book.
Fares may be paid on the bus by cash (exact change) or by pass. All RTC RIDE passes are available from the Pass Vending Machines (as of March 28, 2011 all day passes are $4 at the station, if you buy them on the bus they are $5. One trip fare is $2, but asking for a transfer allows travel on any bus in any direction for 1½ hrs from the time of purchase. All major casinos have a bus stop for easy access), available at RTC 4th Street Station and Meadowood Mall, and may be purchased with cash, coin, debit or credit cards (cash only if purchased on the bus).
By taxi or ride hailing service
Reno's taxis are plentiful, efficient, and comfortable. At the airport, downtown or near any major casino they should be very easy to come by, in other places expect to call to arrange pick-up. Uber and Lyft are available in the Reno area with short waits available in many of the spots a visitor might go inside the city. Don't drink and drive.

Chances are that, if you win it big in Reno and you are not a U.S. citizen your winnings will be subject to a 30% withholding tax from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry, though, you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino so don't lose it... it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.
Casinos are Reno's most common visitor attraction and no entry to Reno would be complete without an overview of them. In addition to gambling, these properties provide a variety of dining and entertainment opportunities and should not be overlooked.

Reno offers a kayak park at Wingfield Park. Equipment rentals and outdoor adventures can be booked nearby.
The open desert terrain that surrounds much of Reno, especially to the Northwest, offers some fantastic mountain biking. Peavine mountain has many networks of trails that are a biker's paradise, most of it singletrack, and most of it technical. Many cyclists start near Rancho San Rafael Park to access the Peavine trails. Be careful, however, as there are often gun-happy residents shooting away, not always sober, farther out in the government lands; also be sure to bring plenty of water, as the desert heat can be quite oppressive. Find more information in books such as Mountain Biking Reno & Carson City: Best Trails by R.W. Miskimins. Nearby areas, like Lake Tahoe offer even more for the mountain biker, such as Tahoe's famous Flume Trail.
There is a rather good bike trail along the Truckee River which extends from the eastern fringes of Sparks to the western limits of Reno and beyond. The section inside city limits is fun and easy for bikers of any skill level, but is actually only a section of the Tahoe-Pyramid Bikeway which—when completed—will run from Lake Tahoe all the way to Pyramid Lake: 116 miles (187 km) in total. Another paved and mostly flat bike trail runs alongside Veterans Parkway in the southeast.
The N, Rancho San Rafael Regional Park
Reno and its surrounding areas have thousands of miles of hiking trails, ranging from park strolls to mountain wilderness treks. Washoe county maintains a Truckee Meadows Trails guide, though this is not comprehensive for all trails in the region.
Evans Canyon and the "N". Begins in the northern half of Rancho San Rafael Park. For a moderate hike, the Evans Creek trail runs in a loop on both sides of the eponymous canyon creek. There is also "the N", a massive whitewash painted landmark set into the side of a hill on the north end of the park. Two trails lead up to the N: a longer but easier route from the side, or a harder straight ascent from the base of the hill.
Mt. Rose Trail. Hiking to the peak and back is over ten miles (15 km) and takes a large portion of the day but rewards you with some very impressive panoramic views on a clear day. For a shorter excursion, the waterfall around halfway up makes a good turn-around point. Very good area for wildflower viewing. (updated May 2023)
Winter Ski slopes overlooking Lake Tahoe
Reno is within two hours of an incredible number of ski resorts. Here is a short list.
Alpine Meadows, 2600 Alpine Meadows Rd, CA. (updated Oct 2017)
Mt Rose, Mount Rose Highway. The closest ski resort to Reno. This resort is at elevation 8,200 ft (2,500 m) and has a great layout and an impressive array of terrain for its no more than 1500 of rise off the base. Good powder here.
Heavenly (The Mountains above the Carson Valley, up Highway 207). Lake Views on one side (you're literally skiing above the casinos at the south end of the lake) and the desert valleys and pow pow on the other side. Huge amount of terrain and claims to have the West's largest snowmaking system for those dry years.
Sugar Bowl (I-80 to just above Donner Lake). Two base areas with a little village in between and an extensive network of terrain.
Diamond Peak (Incline Village, North Lake Tahoe). Ski right above Lake Tahoe on a well laid-out network of runs. They have carpetloader lifts, so be prepared for a strange boarding experience. Small resort, family-friendly.

Reno is the closest major city to Black Rock City and the corresponding Burning Man festival. Many burners pass through Reno on the way to Black Rock City, and many Reno businesses cater to burners by stocking extra water and camping supplies during the Burning Man week. Some hotels offer Burning Man discounts for travellers staying overnight in Reno.
Exploring the Truckee River Arts District will give you firsthand experience of Downtown Reno's 21st-century urban renaissance. There are two main shopping and dining hubs in the district:
The "Riverwalk" area. The North end of Reno's Riverwalk District meanders along Reno 's beautiful Truckee River. Most of the retail activity on this end is situated along First Street between Lake St. (east) and Arlington St. (west). This end of the district has galleries, coffee shops, great dining including a brewery and a French restaurant and even a movie theater. Reno 's renowned Truckee River Whitewater Park runs directly through this area offering visitors even more adventurous outdoor activities in the urban setting of downtown Reno. Kayak and raft rentals from Tahoe Whitewater Tours (☏ +1-800-442-7238) are available at Wingfield Park at the 1st and Arlington Street area.
The "CalAve" area. CalAve is the section of the Truckee River Arts District that runs along California Avenue. This area forms the southernmost border of the district and is quickly becoming Reno 's pre-eminent neighborhood retail, restaurant, entertainment and business district. CalAve is a must-see with highlights such as the Chocolate Bar - a trendy place to sip alcoholic and nonalcoholic chocolate drinks while sampling addictive confections like their Chili-Infused Truffles. Enjoy a slice of Blue Moon's famous gourmet pizza or enjoy wine, cheeses and other lunch specialties at the Cheese Board. The retail options on CalAve will satisfy the serious shopper offering a variety of upscale clothing, shoe and home decor shops.

Free. (updated Nov 2019)
Regionally, Reno features a variety of attractions which are hard to beat. These attractions are best experienced during the spring, summer, and early fall, as wintertime in the area renders most of them closed. Reno gets cold in the winter, so if you're visiting in the winter, look to ski resorts to entertain you during the day.
There are several world-class ski areas within a one-hour drive of Reno, including Squaw Valley (home of the 1960 Winter Olympics), Heavenly and Alpine Meadows.
The eastern entrance to Yosemite National Park is 150 miles (240 km) south (on US395 to California 120; allow at least 3 hours), and is generally much less crowded than the western entrances. Excellent dayhiking and backpacking are found around Tuolomne Meadows and Dana Pass before descending into more crowded Yosemite Valley. However, beware of this entrance if you suffer from altitude sickness - the elevation of the park gate is nearly 10,000 feet.
Washoe Valley: Bower's Mansion & Davis Creek Park. Washoe Valley is a very picturesque valley about 30 minutes south of Reno by car (US-395) and features two great regional parks which should not be missed: Bower's Mansion and Davis Creek Park. Davis Creek park features the creek of the same name and a great pond for winter ice skating (conditions permitting) as well as fantastic access to the Sierra Nevada mountains (it sits at the base) Features campsites and showers. Bower's Mansion is a park with a swimming pool open in the summertime and the mansion which is the park's namesake. Tours of the mansion are available throughout the day in the summertime and well worth it – telling a story of the enrichment and eventual tragic downfall of a family which struck it rich on the Comstock Lode. Washoe Valley is also home to Washoe Lake State Park. In years when the lake is full, this park features a boat landing and some of the best windsurfing to be found, plus campsites, and some fantastic scenery.
Virginia City. The home of the Comstock Lode, this was once the largest city between Denver and San Francisco. It is a historic landmark district and can be accessed from Reno via Geiger Grade (Hwy 341, east from Mt Rose Junction south of town) or Mound House just east of Carson City (also via Hwy 341) If you are not comfortable with mountain driving it may be worth your time to go through Carson City. Worth it to have a drink at one of its storied saloons (a popular one is Bucket of Blood, others abound), to wander its historic C Street, wander through its cemetery, and if you're a train buff, to ride the V&T tourist train (and learn more about the ongoing efforts to recreate the original route of this historic short-line railroad).
Carson City. From its founding this town was intended to be Nevada's capital city. The historic Carson City mint is now home to the Nevada State Museum, with exhibits dealing with everything from prehistoric native life to the Old West mining boom to the current day. The State Capitol Complex is an ideal location for a stroll and a look inside the political history and workings of the state, especially in springtimes of odd-numbered years, when the Legislature is in session. A tour of historic homes and the personalities behind them can be taken by following the blue lines on the sidewalks, beginning from downtown. The Brewery Arts Center features theater, live music, and visual arts offerings throughout the week.
Lake Tahoe. Shared with California, this alpine lake features crystal clear cold water, and a variety of attractions including the MS Dixie paddlewheel trawler, Vikingsholm Castle, and the South Lake Tahoe/Stateline casino and tourist center. Other notable things to see and do include the picturesque California town of King's Beach, in addition to beaches and parks at Crystal Bay, Zephyr Cove, and more. 45 minutes from Reno via Hwy 431, the Mount Rose Highway; with a less treacherous drive through Carson City via Highway 50 West taking an hour and a half.
Pyramid Lake. The second largest terminus lake in North America, this desert lake features a variety of interesting rock formations and is home to endangered but large Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. A high holy site to the native Paiute Indians, it is contained entirely within the Paiute Reservation. Fishing, boating and swimming are available, though caution is advised for the latter two (random windstorms and undercurrents belie the relatively placid appearance the lake usually assumes). Roughly an hour north of town, on Pyramid Highway, SR 428.
U.S. Route 50 eastward across Nevada, nicknamed the Loneliest Road in America crosses semi-desert mountains and valleys and passes through historic mining towns Austin, Eureka and Ely, then at the Utah line, the entrance to Great Basin National Park.
