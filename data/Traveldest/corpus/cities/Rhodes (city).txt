Rhodes (Greek: Ρόδος, Ródos) is the largest settlement and capital city of the island of the same name. It is famous as the former site of the Colossus, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, and as the oldest inhabited medieval town in Europe.
The Avenue of the Knights in Rhodes Old Town
Medieval buildings, mosques, traditional fountains, oriental motifs, Byzantine and Gothic churches, shops and cafeterias are scattered throughout the Old Town of Rhodes. There are approximately 200 streets or lanes that have no name, so getting lost is a distinct possibility.
6000 people live and work in the same buildings in which the Knights of St. John lived 6 centuries ago.
For the traveller, Rhodes City falls into four more or less distinct areas.
Rhodes Old Town, still enclosed by its medieval wall.
Rhodes New Town, north and west of the Old Town, is an extensive modern city, with various places of interest.
New Town's eastern waterfront, containing Commercial Harbor, the yacht and ferry harbour Mandhraki Harbor, and extensive Elli Beach.
Acropolis of Rhodes, the ruins of the ancient city, are about 2 km southwest of the Old Town.

Rhodes Old Town is surely the main attraction here, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved and most extensive medieval towns in Europe. As you wander from the bus station, and over the outer wall and moat, it's like stepping back in time and reliving all your childhood dreams of being a knight and attacking exotic castles in distant lands. It is also the location of many monuments and several museums: make sure to get a good map. If you want to see it all, plan for at least a day, and two will not be amiss if you want to see all the museums.
Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes. can be split into outside, courtyard, outside wall, first floor and second floor. Open in season till 20:00, entry is €6, outside wall is an additional €2. The first floor (photos prohibited) contains some artifacts of Ancient Rhodes but is closed. In it's absence, the entrance fee is entirely not worth it. The Archaeological Museum offers more selection and allows photos. Second floor has a variety of later "artifacts" such as mosaics from Kos and other odd bits and bobs, but it has almost no descriptions (probably to force people to wait for a tour guide). The Palace of the Grand Masters was demolished by a gunpowder explosion in 1856 and reconstructed by the Italians as a summer residence for Mussolini in 1940. This knowledge (that this isn't actually an authentic swords and knights castle and is instead basically a souped up country mansion) somewhat lessens the excitement. Take your photos outside, and come back to look inside when the ground floor exhibitions on Rhodes are open. (updated Feb 2016)

Note: Colorful sea shells offered for sale - mostly in the harbour area - are often actually imported from Asia or the Caribbean. Not only do they provide a non-authentic Rhodes souvenir, many species for sale are also protected. Bringing them back home may get you into considerable difficulty.
Many brand name products such as t-shirts, towels, hand bags and similar items for sale in the tourist shops may be fakes and/or unlicensed.
Labyrinthos Arts & Crafts, Theofiliskou 1 (Near Roloi clocktower). Original arts and creations by local artists, also the only place in the Old Town to sell historically accurate coat of arms of the Knights, medieval style heraldry and illuminated manuscripts.
Hatzikeli - Sea Food Taverna, Solomou Alchadef 9, ☏ +30 2241 027215. One of the best tavernas, serving innovations on traditional Greek dishes. The stuffed, roasted eggplant is notable.
Laganis, Solomou Alhadef 16. A more traditional taverna with good mezedes.
Mikes (prounounced MEE-kehs), in a tiny lane by 17 Socratous Street, Old Town. A hole-in-the-wall place with outdoor seating in a cosy backstreet, tucked away from the tourist masses. Serves fish, salad, and wine, and not much else. Mikes is a very simple place to eat, but it is very pleasant, and the seafood, whilst being simple, is fresh, well prepared and tasty. The dorado is particulaly tasty, and at €10 is good value. A decent sized meal with drinks will cost around €15 per person.
Pizanias (The Sea Star), Sofokleos 24. A decent sea food taverna with outdoor seating on the square. Fish is caught locally, then cooked on a grill built into the wall which means the smell of grilled sea food wafts over the local square! (Great publicity!) Because it's at the end of Sofokleos, you won't find quite as many people that come all the way down here, but it is worth giving the rest a miss and holding out for. The homemade tzatziki is very good, as is the grilled octopus. A reasonable meal for two will cost about €30, with drinks on top.
Mevlana Turkish Coffee and Shisha Bar, 76 Sokratous, ☏ +30 694 221 0846. Not open on Sundays. A rare, wonderfully atmospheric survival of Ottoman old Rhodes in the middle of the tourist hordes. Run by a charming couple, it serves excellent coffee and a small range of other drinks. Not much food except for a few snacks.
Avalon Cafe (In the courtyard of the Avalon hotel on the backstreet behind the Spanish Tongue Auberge on Ippoton St). Set in the quiet courtyard of an imposing 14th century town mansion, the Avalon cafe serves great drinks in a corner of Rhodes Old Town that most people don't even know exists. The courtyard is an oasis away from the bustle of Socratous St; make sure you head there when the cruise crowds get too much! Drinks are homemade, and the coffees are great, if a little expensive.
Socrates Garden, Socratous 124. Coffee shop snack bar with a nice atmosphere in a fake Greek kind of way, but it's not too fake. A good, shaded place to grab a cold drink and rest from the sun and the busyness and tourist rat race that is Socratous St (so much so that you'll even find Greeks in there.) Coffees about €3-4, beer about €.
