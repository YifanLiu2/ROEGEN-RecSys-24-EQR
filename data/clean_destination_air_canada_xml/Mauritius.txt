Understand

History
The island of Mauritius was first discovered by Arab sailors, at some time in the 9th century, the exact date is unknown. At that time the island was uninhabited and covered in a dense forest. The Arab sailors were not interested in settling on the island which they named Dina Arobi or Dinarobin. Diogo Fernandes Pereira, a Portuguese sailor found the island in 1505 and decided to give it the name of Cerne. However, the Portuguese did not settle permanently on the island either.

The first to colonize the island were the Dutch. They took possession of the island in 1598. The Dutch settlers landed on a bay in the south-eastern part of the island which was named Warwyck Haven after the commander VanWarwyck, the bay is now known as Grand Port. Mauritius also got its name during this period; the island was named after the Prince of Holland Mauritz de Nassau. His father William of Orange, (also known as William the Silent), was the head of the Duch East India Company and forefather of the legendary Scottish Clan comprising the Dukes of Atholl, and the Murray and Smythe families, through Mauritz' sister Charlotte of Brabantina.

In 1710, the Dutch abandoned the island, leaving behind macaques, the java deer, sugar cane, fugitive slaves, and, also, irreversible damage to the endemic and indigenous flora and fauna of the island - the Dodo was, by then, extinct due to extensive hunting, the bird being very easy to capture, while the once abundant black ebony tree population was almost completely depleted due to over-exploitation for its timber.

The French settled on the island in 1713, also landing at the bay in the southeast. They renamed the bay Port Bourbon and renamed the island Ile de France. They settled on the north-western side of the island and established their main harbor there, Port Louis, the present-day capital of Mauritius. During the French settlement, there was a lot of development in the country. Mahé de Labourdonnais, whose statue can be seen across from the harbor in Port Louis, is known as the founder of the capital city and the island prospered under his governance (1735-1746).

In August 1810, the British tried to take over the island but lost after a fierce battle against the French in the famous Battle of Grand Port. However, the British came back in December 1810 and successfully defeated the French. From then on, the island was renamed Mauritius and remained under British rule until it attained independence. 

In 1835, slavery was officially abolished and, as most of the African slaves chose to abandon the agricultural fields and move to small coastal villages, indentured laborers (coolies) were brought in from India (chiefly from Tamil Nadu & Bihar) to work in the growing sugarcane industry. 

On 12 Mar 1968, Mauritius became an independent nation within the Commonwealth led by Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, also known as the "Father of the Nation", led the island to independence and did a lot to develop the country. 

A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, Mauritius has attracted considerable foreign investment and has one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent poor weather and declining sugar prices have slowed economic growth leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community.

Climate
Tropical, modified by southeast trade winds; warm, dry winter (May to November); hot, wet, humid summer (November to May); Natural hazards: tropical cyclones (November to April), most cyclones usually occur from the end of December until March. Mauritius has only two seasons, winter and summer. There is not much temperature difference between the two seasons of the year. The climate on the central plateau is cooler than on the coastal areas.

 By plane 

The at Plaisance in the southeast of the island is the major gateway for travellers coming from abroad.

*Air Mauritius is the home carrier and operates a network of routes to the local islands and to international destinations in Africa, Australia, Europe, and Asia.
*Regional airlines: Air Austral Air Madagascar and Air Seychelles connect Mauritius with the surrounding islands.
*International airlines such as Air France Turkish Airlines Emirates Austrian Airlines British Airways Condor South African Airways Meridiana and Corsairfly all serve Mauritius from their home bases.

The arrivals hall can get rather congested in the morning when most of the flights from Europe arrive. Immigration officers tend to be rather slow and the whole immigration process can be a frustrating experience.

Visitors are required to provide accommodation details to the immigration service on arrival. 
If you arrive in Mauritius from a country where malaria is endemic, you may receive a visit from the government health service and be required to give a blood sample for malaria screening.

 By sea 
Vessels that arrive at the port are mainly cargo ships. The Mauritius Pride and the Trochetia are the Mauritian vessels that usually sail to and from Island, Rodrigues Island and . Costa Cruises ships have recently started an Indian Ocean cruise including a visit to Mauritius.

Travel from Tamatave in Madagascar to Mauritius takes at least four days, possibly more if transiting through Reunion. A boat leaves every other Wednesday.

The prices quoted are for a passage in a first or second-class cabin. In attempting to go directly to the port in Tamatave to negotiate with a boat captain for a non-cabin berth, tourists are turned away at the gate. Visiting the Nautical Club in Tamatave to enquire about yachts that might be heading to Mauritius also yields no results.

Get around
Bus and taxi services are best used in urban areas. Bicycles and motorbikes are also available for hire.

By plane
* Air Mauritius operates daily flights connecting Plaisance Airport and Rodrigues (flight time - 1 hour 15 minutes). 

By helicopter
Helicopters are available for transfers and sightseeing tours 
* Budget around USD850 per hour for a sightseeing trip.

By bus
Several fairly good bus services serve the island. Taking the bus is the most economical way of traveling. Air-conditioned buses have been recently introduced on some routes.

The major bus companies are:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* Other smaller companies have amusing names such as Apollo and Turbo.

Buses are still manned by a driver and a conductor who walks around collecting fares and issuing tickets after passengers have boarded. Tell the conductor where you want to go and he'll tell you the fare amount. Upon payment, he'll give you a ticket with the charged amount printed on it. 

Most conductors are very helpful in providing directions to tourists. In the local Creole dialect, the conductors are called con-tro-lair (literally controller).

Bus routes and schedules are available from the Ministry of Transport and Mauritius Buses who list all the main operators and their schedules.

Try to pay with small denominations or the conductor may not have enough change. Intentional over-charging of tourists is not common.

By car
One major highway runs north to south, otherwise, a good network of paved, if sometimes narrow, roads cover the island. Traffic drives on the left. 

Numerous car hire firms include major international and independent firms. Prices vary widely starting from MUR800 per day. To be on the safe side, with full insurance, visitors should rent cars from companies holding a tourism enterprise license. Also, now if you need a car rental keep in mind that you will need to pay a MUR20 charge when you are leaving the car park. This has to be paid in cash. Some agencies without office space in the airport will meet you with the vehicle in the airport parking lot

Regulations: Drivers are required to be over 18 years old. Speed limits are 110km/h (68mph) on the motorway and 50km/h (31mph) in built-up areas. Seatbelts are compulsory. Foreign licences are accepted.

Buy
*Shop &mdash; Mauritius is not at all like Bali or Thailand. Don't expect the local merchants to be interested in a long bartering game. Many shops will not come down on price at all and even at the markets don't expect more than a 10-20% discount. There are bargains to be had however, many large brand names in the textile world are manufactured in Mauritius and you can often find overruns or slightly flawed items at a fraction of the European prices. It is also a good place to find unique designed jewelry, a wide range of handcrafts such as: artificial flowers, model boats, wooden art, and more. It is possible to reach the main shopping centers by public transportation or to take a full day shopping tour which includes a driver to take you to the main centers and handcrafts workshops.

One should note that if you go shopping with a driver, there is a grant chance that the driver gets a commission from the shop. Always best to keep the driver waiting for you, don't let him accompany you shopping. Ask the driver for shops he would recommend and go alone and negotiate 20% discount.

Eat
Mauritius is a paradise for the senses, not only for the eyes with its beautiful landscape but also for the palate. Gastronomes will find a variety of flavors and aromas inherited from the different migrations through its history. Culinary traditions from France, India, China and Africa, the best-known and appreciated cuisines in the world, have been passed on through generations.

Depending on the region, rice or a variety of flatbread called chapattis or roti, called farata (paratha) by the local people, is eaten with curries. The extensive use of spices like saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves and herbs like thyme, basil, and curry leaves are the common ingredients that provide some powerful, yet subtle, savour. Dal, a variety of lentil soup, are many and varied according to which type of lentil is used; vegetables, beans, and pickles accompany the dishes. Dholl puri and roti, originally an Indian delicacy have become the fish and chips of Mauritians.

Biryani from Mughal origins is a dish expertly prepared by the Muslim community, with meat mixed with spiced rice and potatoes.

You can buy many snacks on the streets of Mauritius including the famous gateaux piments (a variant of the Indian vada ; literally, chili cakes), and vegetable or meat samosas (puffs), along with octopus curry in bread. The tomato and onion based dish called Rougaille (pronounced rooh-guy) is a variation of the French ragoût . The dish usually consists of meat or seafood (corned beef and salted snoek fish rougaille are very popular with the locals) and all Mauritians eat this dish often if not daily.

Mauritians have a sweet tooth and make many types of 'gateaux', as they are called. The cakes vary and you can find cakes very much like those in France and others similar to Indian sweets like Gulab Jamun and Rasgulla among many others. 

Check out the queues where the street sellers are selling their type of snacks and the longest queue will probably have the tastiest food on sale and is very cheap.

*Lunch &mdash; For an adventurous lunch of roasted wild boar, duck, or deer curry with one of the best island views, try Domaine du Chasseur's alfresco Panoramour Restaurant. This domain is the best place to glimpse the Mauritius kestrel in the wild. Be aware there is a steep hike up the hill from the car park to the restaurant. The restaurant offers a 4wd taxi service which is free if you eat one of their overpriced meals, but if you only want a cup of tea or dessert they will slug you an outrageous 230 Rupee per person, for the 5 minute ride.

When leaving Mauritius, don't wait until you go through passport control if you want to have a snack. The coffee shop after passport control is not valuable for money. You would be better off visiting the snack bar before check-in and taking your purchases through with you.

Drink

The drinking age in Mauritius is 18.

Mauritius produces a wide range of cane rum. It is very cheap and is a nice drink when mixed with cola and ice. Don't forget the coconut water with a dash of lime and a splash of local rum over ice. The serious amateur will try to find a bottle of five years old (or older) rum. Worth the price difference!

If you are staying in a hotel where the drinks are wildly expensive consider collecting your tipples while you are out and about from the local village shops or supermarkets where the prices are much cheaper.

The local beer Phoenix costs around 30 rupees (less than one pound sterling) for a pint. Usually served very cold.

The local Black Eagle beer, brewed in Nouvelle France is one to watch out for as well. Definite refreshment to match the sweltering summer heat.

Try visiting the Medine Estate Refinery shop at Bambous (4 km from Flic en Flac), on the west of the Island, for a wide variety of locally produced rums and liquors.

Sleep

Stay safe
The cyclone season in Mauritius lasts from December until March. Make sure to check the weather forecast and follow local news if you travel during that time. Mostly, the cyclones should not cause any major concerns if you follow common safety rules and stay inside. 
The fact that there is no malaria in Mauritius and that crime rates are very low making it the safest country in Africa. But you should still exercise common sense and look out for suspicious behavior, as you would anywhere in the world. You should still carry and use insect repellent also even if there is no risk of malaria on the island. 

Be a smart traveler. Organize comprehensive travel insurance and check what circumstances and activities are not covered by your policy before your trip. Register your travel and contact details, so that you can be contacted in an emergency. 

Some additional safety advice:
* Avoid remote areas alone.
* Do not leave valuables in view in your car.
* Avoid unexpected offers of (seemingly free) guided tours. Ulterior motives are common.
* Do not patronize unlicensed taxis (taxi marrons). Some robbers use this trick to lure and attack their victims.
