:The article deals with the Zimbabwean side of Victoria Falls. For information on the Zambian side, see .

Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of , across the border from , , and near . The town lies immediately next to the falls. They are a major attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventure seekers and sightseers plenty of opportunities for a longer stay. 

Tourist numbers are now back to historical levels, with many package tour operators adding Vic Falls back to their itineraries, and this is easily Zimbabwe's busiest tourist destination. In response, there is a lot of cartelization and price-fixing, with prices for accommodation and activities suspiciously high, even though the hotels are not full and activity operators not operating at full capacity. This destination is now considerably more expensive than other destinations in Zimbabwe.

Understand

Mosikalamosikala (meaning "The Smoke That Thunders"), commonly known as Victoria Falls, is one of the most amazing sights in the world: twice as tall as and several times longer. Although not the highest, the widest, or the greatest volume of water, they have the largest sheet of water for any fall in the world and are a sight not to be missed.

History
It took thousands of years of erosion for Victoria Falls to appear as and where it does now. Mosi-oa-Tunya, or "the smoke that thunders” became known to the western world as Victoria Falls only after David Livingstone first set eyes on this astonishing natural wonder in 1855, a heartbeat ago in geological time.

Formation

During the Jurassic Period (150-200 million years ago), volcanic activity resulted in thick basalt deposits covering large parts of Southern Africa. As the lava cooled and solidified, cracks appeared in the hard basalt crust, which was filled with clay and lime. Erosion and the course of the mighty Zambezi River cut through these softer materials, forming the first of a series of waterfalls.

Over at least 2000 years, the falls have receded 8 km upstream, as the Zambezi carved its way through seven gorges. This geological history can be seen in the dark basalt in the series of rocky gorges below the falls. It is believed that the Devil's Cataract, which is presently the lowest point of Victoria Falls, will eventually become the next gorge as the river continues to cut its way back upstream.

Essentially, the river falls into a gorge directly in front of the falls and then flows through a narrow cutting. You can view the falls straight on from across the gorge.

Livingstone
Scottish missionary David Livingstone first heard about Victoria Falls, known as Mosi-oa-Tunya, four years before he arrived there. The area was a sacred site for the Batoka and other local tribes. On 17 November 1855, Chief Sekeletu of the Makololo paddled Livingstone to an island in the Zambezi, known as Goat Island. Although the water was low at the time, Livingstone still felt a "tremor of fear" as he approached the wall of spray.

Gazing down into the churning chasm below must have been a heart-stopping experience (you can still make your way out to the island, now called Livingstone Island, from the during the dry season). Rumors that a Portuguese man beat him to it have little evidence. Livingstone described what he saw:
'"No one can imagine the beauty of the view from anything witnessed in England. It had never been seen before by European eyes, but scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight.

 Zambian or Zimbabwean side 
The big question is which side to visit: Zambia or Zimbabwe? There are two things to consider, views of the falls and cost.

Two-thirds of the actual falls lie within the Zambian territory, as does Livingstone Island, from where David Livingstone first famously set eyes on the falls.

The water from Victoria Falls dives into a narrow gorge running parallel to the face of the falls, with the spray going high into the air, causing permanent rain, rainbows, and the famous "smoke" which is visible from a distance, so, much of the time when you are viewing the falls, you are actually facing them. The gorge where the water exits are the limit on how far you can walk from either side. There is no crossing there. This limits your visibility from the Zambian side, as you can walk about only a quarter of the distance from the face of the falls. Although the view and the water flow is still impressive, you simply cannot get a perspective on the full width of the falls from the Zambian side.

The walk down to below the falls is closed on the Zimbabwean side. You can only walk down on the Zambian side. The footbridge on the Zambian side gives a unique experience, with permanent torrential rain from the wet season through to August. 

Travelers will have an assortment of visa charges involved in seeing both sides of the falls. The variables include your nationality, single or multiple entries, and whether you will stay longer than 24 h.

To cross the border from Zambia to see the falls on the Zimbabwe side, you will need to pay at least US$30 for a Zimbabwe single entry visa (depending on nationality), and if you want to return to the Zambian side, you will need to pay an extra US$20 for a multiple-entry Zambian visa. To cross the border from the Zimbabwean side to the Zambian side you will need to pay at least US$20 for a single day Zambian visa, and at least an extra US$15 for a multiple entry Zimbabwean visas.

You will need to decide whether you are getting a single or multiple entry visa when you first apply for it. If you are flying from South Africa just to see the falls, consider if it is worthwhile arriving on the Zimbabwean side and leaving from the Zambian, as you will minimize your visa costs this way (but may pay more for airfares). Flying to the Zambian side usually costs less than flying into the Zimbabwe side. 

Still, for less than US$100, you can do both sides.

Victoria Falls entrance fee is payable with cash or cards.

 When to visit 
The park is open year-round, but you will get a very different experience depending on the season in which you visit. 

*In the rainy season (December to March), the water volume will be higher, and the falls will be more dramatic. You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails winding near the falls. On the other hand, it is precisely because the volume of water is so high that your viewing of the actual Falls will be obscured: by all the spray.

*In the dry season, (April to October), the water volume will be lower, and by October, Victoria Falls might just be a trickle. You will get a clearer view of the rocky ledge beneath the falls, which is pretty spectacular by itself, but the falls might be somewhat underwhelming. This said it is still a great experience visiting the falls in the dry season (for instance November), as you can experience both "falls" and the rocky gorge. You can have the chance to swim in Devil's Pool.

Get in

 By plane 
British Airways and South African Airways offer daily flights between (JNB) and Victoria Falls Airport (VFA). Air Zimbabwe also offers flights between Victoria Falls Airport and other destinations within - NB please check whether Air Zimbabwe is operating at the time of your visit, as recently their schedule has not been reliable, and they ceased operations for a period of time. Cheaper flights from are often available to neighboring .

Direct flights can be had from Nelspruit Airport (Kruger National Park) to Livingstone three times a week. Any flights from Kruger to Victoria Falls must go through Johannesburg.

There is Proflight in Zambia who offers last-minute cheap flights from Lusaka Airport to Livingstone Airport if you are lucky.

 By train 

The classic way of reaching Victoria Falls is by the overnight train from Bulawayo, now back to running daily again. This train still uses lovely but somewhat downtrodden British 1950s coaches. First-class tickets are $12 while second class goes for $8, no bed linen included. With old coaches and bad maintenance, do not expect everything to work fine or sleep too well. However, the scenery is fantastic and during the last few hours before reaching Victoria Falls you're guaranteed to see a lot of wildlife. Departure from Bulawayo is at 7:30PM, arriving the next morning at 9AM, although delays are more the norm than the exception.

Trains from Zambia across the spectacular Zambesi bridge have been suspended for a few years time now, however, catching a train to Livingstone and then continuing by taxi is a possibility.

 By bus 
On the Zambia side, there is mostly recommended Mazhandu Family Bus. They have several buses every day. It takes around 5-6 hours from Lusaka to Livingstone. Roads are not bad and you can watch the African life in day time trip.

 By car 
The roads within Zimbabwe are not very good, with potholes commonplace. The most direct way to Victoria Falls overland is from . There is a good road network from the South African border at Beit Bridge right through to the falls.

It's possible to drive in through Livingstone. Crossing an international border with a vehicle, however, will incur extra costs like carbon tax and insurance. Very annoying is the time-consuming and disorganized procedure of obtaining a 'temporary import permit' for the car at the Zambian border post. Once at the Zimbabwe border post, the whole procedure is to be repeated, though it is a bit faster but also expensive.

Coming from or . the best road is from in Botswana using the Kazungula border post. The distance to Vic Falls is 70 km.

Get around

If you stay in the swanky hotels downtown, or even some of the budget accommodation options just outside the downtown area, walking is manageable. Most places are no more than 3 km away from Victoria Falls. 

Some of the hotels in Victoria Falls are not really in Vic Falls, but most of these have their own transfer services.

Cabs are plentiful, and should not cost more than $6 for a ride. However, for most occasions, it is absolutely okay to simply walk (during the day that is).
If you arriving by plane and you need an airport transfer or Chobe Day Trip Transfer or to go to the Boma, transfers from registered tour operators range from $5 Bomab, 15 Airport, $45 Kasane border.

See
Perhaps you have seen postcards, holiday snaps, or film footage of the seventh wonder of the world, Victoria Falls. But have you actually been fortunate enough to stand beside the "smoke that thunders" watching and listening as the roar of 546 m³ of water, minute by minute, plunges down into a 100 m deep gorge below.

* Victoria lunar rainbows. The famous Victoria Falls is a location where you can spot the rare lunar rainbow, the great creation of water and light. If you visit during the months of April, May, June, or July, that's when you're most likely to see one. However, the largest waterfall in the world is just as lively during the day, generating rainbows on rainbows.

Do
Besides the falls themselves, there are numerous land and water-based activities to keep you busy for a day or two. There are several tour operators in town, who all take bookings for various activities, all are on commission, and you can only seemingly haggle over the size of the commission rather than the cost of the activity. 

Water based
* On the river above the falls, is a nice way to see some wildlife and relax. Canoeing is best described as "drifting" at a walking pace with the flow of the river. If you want to cover some distance and do the paddling yourself, make it clear when you book.
* The "sunset cruise" is a bit of a misnomer as all boats have to be off the river by Sunset. You will see most of the sunset after you are back in the dock.
* A unique journey on a bohemian-styled dhow to admire a splendid sunset while sailing the Zambezi.
* On the river below the falls, spectacular and quite hair raising. Whitewater rafting day trips sell for about $120. The price includes a full day of shooting some of the best rapids in the world (including some Class V rapids); lunch, eaten on the water, and all the beer you can chug after the climb out. Note that it is a tough descent on foot down the gorge to the launch point so wear no flip flops. The white water rafting may also be dependent on recent rainfall and the season.

Victoria Falls Bridge-based
* Descend into the gorge and climb back out.
* 
* Flying yourself off, either solo or tandem.
* The bridge where you get a tour and a glimpse back at the history of the construction.
* The canopy tour, with 9 slides offers amazing views of the turbulent rapids, the falls spray, and the Victoria Falls bridge.
* It is described as "mildly adventurous", one of the cheaper activities that involve jumping into the gorge.
* A huge swing over the gorge.

Air-based

* 15 min in a chopper, seems very popular, a downside of which is the constant noise.
* This is possible from the Zambia side only. The cost is roughly $190 for the 15 min tour and $380 for the 30 min tour.

Land-based 
Wherever you stay you can be easily arranged for a safari (prices vary), a sunset cruise or a helicopter ride over the falls.
* You will be taken you Chobe National Park, Botswana side known for its prolific wildlife. Trip Included breakfast, cruise, game drive & transfers from Victoria Falls.
* 
* Animal park 
* For something different try this ride offered by a variety of tour operators in the town.
* Explore the Victoria Falls with guide!

* Offer many of the activities.

Buy
There is a substantial opportunity to shop in Victoria Falls, and you can find a good deal. The curio markets are just behind the post office and have dozens of tourist shops from which you may select wood and stone carvings, jewelry, t-shirts, curios, books, postcards, artwork, etc. (For fun, see if you can find the shop with the pictures of Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, from their visit.)

Traders in the sculpture markets are prepared to barter trade: hats, your shoes, T-shirts, pens, batteries are in demand. But think twice before you reduce people to the level of beggars. Just negotiate what you think is a fair price.

Eat
Vic Falls has a sprinkling of top-class restaurants, several African buffets often included in package tours, and a few coffee shops, sandwich shops, and fast food options. The price/quality ratio is pretty good. 

Budget

There is no food available within the park so bring it in yourself if you need something. Also, the monkeys within Victoria Falls will try to snatch your food if you are not paying attention to it. There is a Spar and a Seven-Eleven grocery store in town. Drinks and Food, snacks, camping supplies, are also available.

Mid-range

* 
* Offers a reasonable al a carte menu with a great view over a waterhole.
* 
* 
*Lovely terrace & garden setting where you can hear the falls and see the spray. Decent (border on fine dining) menu, with attentive service and tasteful surrounds. If you only have 2 nights in Vic Falls, eat here second (Vic Falls hotel should come first).

Splurge
* Dinner & Drum Show. Offers a gluttonous 'eat as much as you can' buffet dinner with, ahem, 'authentic' African dancing. As with all tourist traps do expect a few coach parties to be there and don't expect top-quality food, although the range is wide (Kudu, crocodile, impala, guinea fowl, mopani worms). Lots of add-ons and upselling (the "boma" cocktail made with the "boma" stick, the medicine man who will throw the bones for you - for a price, etc.). You have been warned.

Drink
Victoria Falls is not known anymore for its tremendous nightlife. There are a few small bars near the downtown area, but they are not well lit. It might be fun to stop in, but be careful. Alternatively, all the hotels feature huge, well-stocked bars. However, the prices will be higher, and you might not feel that you are in Africa anymore.

Mid-range
* It is an owner-managed lodging 2 km from the Victoria Falls. Eleven en-suite rooms, pool and cool garden to relax. Rates per person sharing around $70 per night incl breakfast depending on season.

*

* Quiet elegance with a beutiful colonial veranda for dining. A bit closer to town.
* Built in 1904, this is one of the most romantic hotels in Africa with a faded grand old feeling to it. The Queen Mother herself stayed here when she visited. Views from the manicured lawns out to the railway bridge with the mist from the falls in the distance is surreal.
* Located close to the falls and offers safari-themed elegance, a great casino and an excellent, reasonably-priced, buffet dinner.

 Farther afield 
* Lodge is carefully situated on a riverside fringe of the mighty Zambezi River where Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, and Namibia converge. It is 80 km west of Victoria Falls and accessed by transfer from Victoria Falls, Livingstone, or Kasane. Imbabala offers not only the chance to unwind but also some of the most amazing game viewing and bird watching in the region, in the seclusion of a private National Parks concession. The 12,000 ha concession has 14 km of private Zambezi river frontage and borders the Chobe Forest Reserve, which is renowned for its massive Elephant population. Herds of up to 1500 elephants have been seen on the floodplains below the Lodge.

Stay safe
You can expect to be met by tourist police on your arrival in Victoria Falls. They are plentiful around the town and the falls and can be trusted. You can identify them by their yellow vests. Zimbabwe is very keen to keep tourists safe after a period of instability that saw visitors at risk, and tourism on the Zimbabwean side dropped dramatically. Sometimes, it may feel there are more tourist police than tourists.

If you are staying at one of the resorts, it is likely that the guards at the resorts will keep an eye on you on the paths to the falls until you are within sight of the tourist police.

Touts are aggressive and desperate and best avoided (still, considering Victoria Falls to be one of THE tourist destinations in Africa, the touts and hawkers are not too bad). They keep a distance from the tourist police and guards. The markets are safe, and the traders there are very polite and keen on your trade.

The path along the side of the river to Victoria Falls Hotel from the falls is not safe to walk after dark. During the day, watch where the locals walk, as there are usually elephants nearby the path.
