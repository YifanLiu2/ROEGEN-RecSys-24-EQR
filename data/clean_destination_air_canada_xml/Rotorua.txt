Rotorua is known as the thermal wonderland of . Its hot springs and geysers have attracted tourists for over a hundred years.

Understand
Rotorua sits on the shores of Lake Rotorua of New Zealand. There are several other lakes nearby. Along with the geothermal wonders, there are also the more usual water activities such as fishing, boating and white water rafting. Tourism is a major industry in Rotorua, and for good reason, the tourism services are therefore well developed and visitors should definitely make a stop at the Tourist Information Centre on the main road, Fenton Street.

Rotorua is built over a geothermal hot spot. There are numerous natural vents, hot pools and other geothermal features in and around the city. Many of these are in parks and reserves. Natural eruptions of steam, hot water and mud occasionally occur in new locations. Many places have their own private geothermal bores for heating and water for bathing although private use of naturally occurring geothermal water and steam is controlled. It has recently been refurbished. Wai-O-Tapu is also an entertaining day out.

Geologically, Rotorua is in the middle of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, which is named after Lake Taupo, the largest volcano in the area. There are four major volcanic calderas, which now contain lakes, and several more recognisable volcanoes in the surrounding area. It is this geologically active zone that produces the heat that is needed to drive all the geothermal activity.

Get in

By car 
Rotorua is about a 3-hour drive south from , with several nice towns and villages along the way. 

There are two main routes, via initially travelling on State Highway 1 and then joining State Highway 5 at Tirau, or via on Route 27. The Matamata route is less busy and probably a more interesting bet for travellers, but sections of the road boast the highest accident rates in NZ, so caution is needed. Matamata is where Hobbiton was built for the Lord of the Rings. The set is now a tourist attraction.

A third option to get amongst the rural farmland is to travel via Te Aroha and then south along old Te Aroha Road, stopping to see Wairere Falls. Be careful on the narrow windy unpainted roads.

By plane 

Rotorua also has an small airport serviced regularly by Air New Zealand who fly there from Auckland, and (and onwards to without changing).

By bus 
Bus services are provided by InterCity.

Backpacker coach services tend to do pick ups from the major hostels.

By bike
Rotorua is a cyclists paradise; as well as boasting some of the best off road mountain bike tracks in the world, the city has no less than seven quality cycle stores, with six in the CBD and the Outdoorsman Headquarters on Tarawera Road. In addition several shops provide cycle hire, notably Lady Jane's ice cream parlour near the lake front.

New Zealand is one of the most hazardous countries in the developed world for cyclists. New Zealand drivers do not give sufficient lateral separation and have very poor forward hazard protection and tend to take blind corners at the limit of tyre adhesion and as if there were rally flag marshals to signal the hazards that they can not see. Having said that, many roads have wide verges.

Rotorua is 300m (985 ft) above sea level, therefore a trip to the Bay of Plenty (, or Papamoa will be a mainly down hill trip of between 70-100km (44-62 mi).

Travelling north towards Waikato also will be downhill to near sea level; conversely a trip to Taupo will be an up and down affair with some challenging climbs.

Get around
There is an functional, if somewhat limited, bus service. They are lime green in colour and branded "CityRide". These buses operate several routes from one side of the city to the other, including Ngongotaha (handy for accessing the Skyline, Rainbow Springs and Agrodome attractions), the Institute of Technology, or 'Polytech' as the bus will say (Te Puia is across the main SH5 road) and the airport. The standard fare is $2.50 regardless of how far you travel. If you are going to be in Rotorua for a while or just going to be taking the bus a lot then you can get a 'CityRide Card'. This is a card that enables you to preload a cash value onto the card and get a 30% per cent discount making the standard trip $1.75 - No ticket books available. The bus service stops operating at about 6PM Monday to Saturday and 4pm on Sunday. 

A circuit bus operated by national sightseeing operator GreatSights New Zealand visits several iconic Rotorua attractions including Te Puia Rainbow Springs Nature Park and the Agrodome. 

There is a reputable taxi company, metered, and also a shuttle bus operator with trailer for larger groups. 

Further info can be found at the tourist information centre on Fenton Street.

See
As New Zealand's busiest tourist centre there are a variety of attractions ranging from free to quite expensive.

Free
* Government Gardens is an immaculate park near the CBD, where there is also the city museum (small entry charge) and the famous Blue Baths. Nearby is the Sportsdrome and one of the many golf courses.

* The Lakes - there are 14 to choose from. Lake Rotorua gives its name to the city and boat trips can be arranged to Mokoia Island in the centre. The lakefront has a scenic promenade from where you can see Mokoia Island. From the Lakefront scenic floatplane or helicopter scenic flights can be taken. Alternatively a cheaper option is to take the Amphibious truck from Fenton Street, which does a 90 minute tour of several of the main lakes in the area. All the lakes are stocked with trout and fishing is very popular.

* Motutara (Sulphur Bay) - Fantastic walkway starting just beyond the government gardens. The walkway passes through several geothermal hot springs and sulpher vents (the posted warnings to stay on the pathway at all times are no joke.) The bay itself hosts many waterbirds and other wildlife. 

* Okere Falls - approximately 20km (12 mi) out of the city towards Tauranga on SH33 you will pass the end of Lake Rotoiti; most of the 14 lakes flow into Rotoiti, which itself heads off to the Bay of Plenty, descending nearly 305m (1000 ft) in less than 30 km (19 mi). For this reason it boasts some of the most spectacular white water challenges available to the intrepid traveller. These range from dual kayaks, to white water sledging (hurling yourself down stream with a life jacket and float), or rafting. Tuteas Fall is the worlds largest/highest commercially rafted fall; with a 7m (23 ft) drop, on average every fourth boat flips! If you don't want to get wet there is a pleasant 6km (4 mi) walk though the forest offering great views of the rapids and falls on the river, with remnants of a previous' century power station visible for travellers enjoying some technological archaeology. There are also some small caves where glow worms can be found.

* Whakarewarewa Forest also known as The Redwoods, is accessible either from Tarawera Road (where there is a visitors centre) or from SH5 on the Taupo Highway. Around 1900 New Zealand began a program of planting imported trees here to see which species grows best in NZ. A 6 hectare grove of majestic redwoods is surrounded by forest with other types of trees. Spectacular walks, mountain bike tracks (over 60km/37 mi in total) and riding trails. Bikes can be hired from bike shops in the city, although Planet Bike also usually have a truck with hire gear at the main car park.

* Rotorua Walkway - A 26km (16 mi) scenic walkway around Rotorua incorporating most of the above as well as several other parks and sights. Pick up a brochure for a map and explanations or download one in PDF format from the district council website in the link.

Paid admission

* Located on the Northern side of Lake Rotorua, the Hamurana Springs are a group of natural water springs in a beautiful reserve next to the Hamurana golf course. There's a circular path from the carpark to the main spring and the dancing sand spring. You'll walk on either side of a small creek with amazing blue water for about 1km. Entry $18 (as of August 2018.)

* Waimangu Volcanic Valley - born from the massive 1886 eruption of Mt Tarawera, the world’s newest geothermal eco-system, and an exciting and dramatic destination that the whole family can enjoy. Whatever your age or fitness level, you'll find something that suits you - self guided and guided easy walks, advanced hikes and boat cruise experiences, ranging in duration from 45 minutes to over 4 hours. If you want outdoor activity, peaceful New Zealand bush, unique ecology, rare botany and stunning geothermal features, then Waimangu is the 'must do' experience. It is easily accessible, just 20 minutes south of Rotorua, and 40 minutes north of Taupo. Daily from 08:30.

* Te Puia home to the Whakarewarewa Valley of geothermal activity, including bubbling mud pools and geysers. General admission is $40, but once inside there are regular, free guided tours throughout the park, including the geothermal areas, the marae, and the kiwi house. There are also Maori cultural experiences like traditional dances and meals available for an additional charge.

* Whakarewarewa Thermal Village the main competitor to Te Puia - ironically two Maori iwi competing with similar attractions. Good, and appears less developed and maybe more "authentic" than the next door Te Puia. 

* Skyline Skyrides (Fairy Springs Road) - located on the outskirts of town, this gondola ride up Mt. Ngongotaha offers a panoramic view of Rotorua and the surrounding mountains.

* Rainbow Springs Nature Park Beautifully landscaped nature park featuring sculptured ponds with cute fish and gardens including Kiwi birds and other native New Zealand animals. $27 + $2 for kiwi encounter tour. 

* The Agrodome (State Highway 5 North of Ngongotaha) - An agricultural park with farm animals, shows and exhibitions describing rural life in New Zealand both past and present. The sheep show and the farm tour are both exceptional! As well as the farming attractions, the Agrodome is home to the Freefall Experience simulator, the north islands highest bungee jump, a jet boat ride and the ubiquitous Zorb - where you are sealed in an inflatable ball and rolled down a steep hill!

* The Buried Village - Self-descriptive, the village was swamped with ash by the nearby Mt Tarawera in the massive 1886 eruption which killed 153 people. Now open to the public, The Buried Village takes visitors through the excavated ruins of the village, a recreated cottage and a museum with recovered relics, tracing back the history of one of New Zealand's biggest volcanic eruptions.

* Wai-O-Tapu Thermal Wonderland - A great park to see a variety of geothermal landscapes and active volcano activities, including the Lady Knox Geyser, which is a famous geyser that erupts daily to heights of 10 to 20m (33-66 ft). For those that don't want to pay for entrance, there is a boiling mud pool off SH5 within the vicinity.

Do
Your best bet is to spend some energy taking in some of the many day-time activities such as land-sledding down Mt Ngongotaha at Skyline Skyrides Luge Ride, heli-touring or hiking through the abundance of parks often alongside thermal vents. Nearby is the curious forest of California Redwoods that was planted last century and has thrived in the ideal climate so that it appears to have been there for many centuries. The forest in this area has been developed to provide world-class mountain biking tracks. Rotorua host several other adventure activities such as Zorbing, indoor rock-climbing and whitewater rafting or sledging. When deciding if spending $20+ per person for entry to "Volcanic Caldera Areas" remember that there are many free parks that have very similar sights and smells, often with less walking and no charge.

One activity that is unique is the ability to play a round of golf amongst the mud pools. The Rotorua golf course has a public course where you can play 9 holes and attempt to avoid the mud pool hazards, a unique experience. The course is at the top of Fenton Street opposite Te Puea, the Maori Arts and Craft Institute and geyser. As of Dec 16 fees are $70 +$30 club hire +$45 buggy hire.

Buy
There are numerous Maori arts and crafts on sale in the city centre and at the various tourist attractions. The quality varies from extremely professional contemporary artwork to cheap nick-nacks. Popular items include puonamu/greenstone (similar to jade) or bone jewellery, traditional weapons and statues. This selection is accompanied by sheepskins and the normal tourist giftware of t-shirts, caps, mugs and pens plastered with "Rotorua", other words and pictures. More attractive and practical gifts can be found such as simple clothing (jackets, shirts, ties, caps) with abstract maori designs on them.

Eat
Rotorua is a place to try the traditional maori feast, the Hangi. This "earthen oven" technique is similar to the Hawaiian Imu and results in a very distinctive smoky earthy flavour - well worth trying. There are numerous places to try a Hangi.

Rotorua has some nice cafes, including Capers and the Fat Dog. Restaurants are more scarce but several of the major hotels have good eating establishments (Novotel or Ridges on the raceway). The main centre for eating is lower end of Tutanakei Street (known locally as Eat Street), but, even after 21:00 you may find little left on the menu.

There are the usual generic chains for Pizzas and burgers. Another option is the buffet at Skyline Skyrides as this saves the cost of the gondola ride and you can often get a spectacular view of the sunset over the lake. Prices are about $60 per adult, with children charged at $1 per year of age.

*Small family-run Italian restaurant just 100m off Eat Street. The menu is small, but there's bound to be a tasty mediterranean plate on there you'll like. In summer you can sit outside, sipping a glass on a barstool next to some wine barrels.
*Probably the best Indian restaurant in town, this tandoori restaurant offers dine-in and take-away options.

Drink
Rotorua is sometimes referred to as Roto-Vegas because of the many neon-lit hotels along the main street, the numerous venues for gambling and the few brothels. Strangely though, there isn't much night life to speak of. You could try the Pig & Whistle or the Fat Dog Cafe.

*The closest thing to a historic pub you'll find in Rotorua, it has been open for a respectable time but its claim to be a historic pub is largely based on the building, which was constructed around 1940. A good number of beers on taps, decent bar food, and frequent live bands make this a good choice.
*Home of the Croucher range of beers, made in a Rotorua brewery owned by the pub's owner.

Stay safe
This geothermal wonderland has some hazards. Respect safety signs and barriers around active geothermal locations - they are there for good reasons. The hot water and mud from geothermal springs can be boiling hot. Superheated steam may cause eruptions - after all it is steam that makes the geysers spout. 

The sulphurous smell (that rotten eggs smell) in the air means that some toxic gases may also be present. Take care in confined and unventilated spaces, particularly those below ground level or around geothermal pools. Toxic geothermal gases have been known to asphyxiate people.

Avoid bathing in geothermal pools where the water has been in contact with the ground. At the very least do not put your head underwater. Geothermal ground water can carry the bacteria and/or amoebae that cause meningitis - a disease which can be fatal.

While New Zealand is a tourist paradise it should be remembered that as with most countries petty theft is a common occurrence. With so many of Rotorua's thermal wonders being situated in isolated areas it pays to take notice of the warning signs and to keep cars locked with valuables hidden from view so as not to have your visit ruined by petty opportunistic crime. In particular Kuirau Park after dark and Okere Falls are well known for car thefts and muggings. Expensive items taken to places like backpackers also need particular attention.

Get out
Heading south from Rotorua takes you to , a similar town on the side of New Zealand's largest lake. Northwest takes you to , and the Bay of Plenty coastline, a nice place to soak up the sun. There are two routes; via Te Puke and SH30 brings you into Tauranga via . SH36 is a shorter in land route that climbs to around 610 m (2000 ft) before dropping to the coast. This is the route most locals would use and avoids Tauranga CBD traffic if heading for the .

 is another coastal town in the Eastern Bay of Plenty, with empty beaches and one of the best climates in terms of hours of sunshine.

North leads to Hamilton, or and south east into the sparsely populated, and ruggedly beautiful Urewera National Park and .
