{{pagebanner|Papeete Banner.jpg}}


'''Papeete''' is the largest city in and capital of [[French Polynesia]] on the island of [[Tahiti]].

==Understand==

Papeete is not a tropical paradise. It is a typical government center and industrial port with small doses of French and Polynesian charm. It has shopping, eating, and drinking, but very little sightseeing for a capital city and even fewer top-class hotels. The residents speak French and Tahitian, although English is spoken by many in the tourist trade. 

==Get in==
 
Papeete International Airport (PPT) is located in the district of Faaa. Air Tahiti is located in the main building and Air Moorea about 100 m away. The following services are available at the airport: bar, self-service and gourmet restaurant, bank, ATM, post office, telephone, boutiques, newspaper stand, car rental agencies, baggage lockers and public restrooms. There is a taxi stand and a truck stop at the airport.

==Get around==

Papeete is a walking city. It's really too small to bother with any other form of transport, unless you are going out to the fringes, or would simply like to experience the famous ''le truck'' for fun (hop-on, hop-off, anywhere in the city center for about XPF100!) Bring a water bottle: it can be quite hot and humid.

Taxis are clean and efficient although relatively expensive and may be hard to find after 6pm.  There are two dedicated taxi stands along the waterfront. Fares are prescribed by the government and are displayed inside Taxis. The fare is roughly XPF 1000 plus a charge for distance. Hotels will know exactly what the fare is to the city centre. As an example the fare from the Manava Suite Resort to the water front as at 17/4/2014 is XPF2300 before 8:00PM. The fee increases by XPF 1000 after 8:30PM. Meters are unheard of, so confirm the fare before getting into a taxi.

Le Truck will take you to other parts of the island and around town quite cheaply. The service is infrequent or non-existent on weekends.

==See==

* <see name="The waterfront" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url="">Papeete has redeveloped its waterfront into a long park, with foods and carnival-like attractions.</see>

==Do==

==Buy==

Black pearls abound. There is just about every kind of store here, including some (particularly near the Marché) who have no problem selling you imitation balls of black glass or fiberglass at market prices.  Be sure to look for a certificate of authenticity on the wall of the shop, and trust your guidebook for recommendations.

==Eat==

You can go broke eating in this town. There are some fine restaurants but expect to pay US$30 for a hamburger at a hotel restaurant or other proper sit-down establishment. 

There are a lot of midrange places where you can expect to pay US$20-30 for your whole meal. French and Chinese are well represented here. Look for the word "Snack" in the name of the restaurant. There is also a conveyor belt sushi place that's very good, and the chefs are quite friendly there.

The best deal in town is the ''Roulottes'', the food trucks that set up shop every evening in the big square in the waterfront park. Every day they begin setting up around dusk. Chinese, French, and Tahitian cuisine are all well represented. You can get chow mein, ''poisson cru,'' crepes, pizza, ice cream, and because this is France, everything comes with bread. Expect to pay about XPF 1500 for your whole meal. Food trucks also set up further from town such as at others Marinas and near hotels.

==Drink==
You can expect to pay upwards of US$10 for a pint of beer. A (small) jug of microbrew will run you US$35. Buy pitchers of Hinano to keep the costs down.

* <drink name="Chaplain's" alt="" directions="Downtown on the waterfront" address="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url="">The decor is a tribute to silent film star Charles Chaplain. Expect loud French rap. Keep an eye on your tab.</drink>
* <drink name="Mana Rock Cafe" alt="" directions="Downtown on the waterfront" address="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url="">This open-air pub is a good place to sit outside in the shade and have a cold beer on a hot afternoon.</drink>
* <drink name="Les 3 Brasseurs" alt="" directions="Downtown on the waterfront" address="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="US$35 for a 3.5 glass jug" url="">The only microbrewery in French Polynesia. The beer is certainly better than Hinano, but you do pay a premium for it, and it pales in comparison to U.S. microbrews.</drink>
* <drink name="That tiki-bar near Les 3 Brasseurs" alt="" address="" directions="Downtown on the waterfront" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Its name doesn't really matter; it's the only other bar along this stretch. Some sidewalk seating and very limited indoor seating. Watch out for aggressive she-males. There's a sweet little dog that hangs out here. If you pet her, she will bark at anybody who gives you trouble for the rest of the night. Also remember to tip the bouncer extra when you want to get into the bar's "underground" club every night.</drink>
* <drink name="Bora Bora Lounge" alt="" address="" directions="Downtown on the waterfront" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax=""> Another standard overpriced bar. Does have French & English karaoke certain nights, and TVs tuned to the football match of the day. Most noteworthy for having '''free Wi-Fi''' with no login, which can be quite useful.</drink>

==Sleep==
*<sleep name="Stealth Campsite">From the waterfront, travel east along Prince Hinoi Street  for approximately 1 mi/ 1.6 km. Stay on the right side of the street. You will arrive at a bridge that crosses a stream. Before you cross the bridge, you will notice cement stairs that lead to a paved foot/bike path that also passes under the bridge, running parallel to the stream. Go down these stairs, and you will see the spot on the opposite stream bank under the bridge. There is graffiti on the wall and a fire pit. Bring a sleeping pad and some way to ward of bugs. You wont find anything cheaper than this.</sleep>
