'''Harrisburg''' is the capital of the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]], a state in the [[United States of America]].

==Get in==

===By train===

===By car===
Harrisburg is served by a rather extensive highway system for a city of its size. Interstate 81, 83 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike, Interstate 76 all travel through or near the city. The Capital Beltway is comprised of I-81 to the north, I-83 to the east and south and PA-581 to the west of the city. U.S. Routes 22 and 322 also pass through the city and U.S. 11 and 15 pass just to the west.

===By bus===
'''Capital Area Transit''' (CAT)[http://www.cattransit.com/], is the regional bus service for greater [[Harrisburg area]].  Travelers to Harrisburg from Cumberland and Dauphin Counties can travel via CAT.  CAT is also a convenient means of transportation from Harrisburg International Airport (HIA)

*'''Bieber Trailways''' [http://www.gotobus.com/biebertrailways/] is a regional bus line that offers roundtrip services from Harrisburg to NYC
*'''Rabbittransit''' [http://www.rabbittransit.org/] offers service to and from York on the rabbitexpress routes 83n and 83s.

==Get around==
===By car===
'''Parking''' - Weekdays, from 8AM-5PM, meter parking is enforced.  The typical cost is 15 minutes for 25¢.  Parking garages are typically the same rate, $3 for up to 2 hours and then escalating beyond that.  Many of the garages are run by the Harrisburg Parking Authority [http://www.harrisburgparking.org/]. Park for $5 from 5PM-5AM at River St, Walnut St and Chestnut St garages. 

'''Driving'''- Generally, roads are congested, especially on the Capital Beltway, during rush hour. The amount of time it would take to cover certain sections on the beltway (especially on I-83 between the York Split and I-81), can easily be tripled, or more. The freeways are far below capacity as they were built in the 1950s. However, a recent road construction project on the York Split (the PA 581/I-83 Jct.) just started and there are studies being done to widen very congested, narrow sections such as I-83. Keep in mind that the congestion peaks are between 6 and 9 AM and 3 and 6 PM on weekdays. Outside of those times, you should be able to get by with minimal (if any) delays.

===By foot or bike===
Harrisburg is a very walkable city, especially the downtown, midtown and uptown sections which are layed out in a simple grid without much change in grade. There are many beautiful walking and biking trails that run along the Susquehanna River. You can also walk or ride your bike across the Walnut St. Bridge to City Island without worrying about safety because it is blocked off to cars.

Harrisburg has been an important location for statewide transportation since selected as the capital of Pennsylvania in 1812. The canal system and subsequent development of railroads, highways and airlines in the early century played a key role in transforming Harrisburg into a commercial and distribution center for Pennsylvania and the East. The city is centrally located 80 miles north of Baltimore, 100 miles west of Philadelphia, and 100 miles north of Washington D.C.

*'''State Capitol Building''' 
''The Capitol was designed in the American Renaissance Style by Philadelphia Architect Joseph-Huston (1866-1940), who envisioned the building as a "Palace of Art".  Built and furnished at a cost of $13 million, the Capitol features paintings, stained glass and furnishings by some of the best artisans of the day'' - Extract Out of A Centennial Celebration 1906 - 2006, Pennsylvania General Assembly.

The state capitol of Pennsylvania is a beautiful architectural masterpiece that encompasses many artistic designs and marvels. The capitol building is an Italian Renaissance-style statehouse. It includes collections of art, sculptures and large murals. On the floor of the main hallway are tiles that show Pennsylvania's history, symbols, insects and animals. The capitol dome rises 272 feet, and was modeled after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, and its magnificent staircase looks like one from the Paris Opera.

==Stay safe==
Keep in mind that Harrisburg's crime rate is much higher than the national average. However, most areas that tourists and out-of-towners frequent are usually safe. Although these areas might be safe during the day, at night they can become more tense. Common sense should keep most people out of trouble. At night, stay away from areas such as Allison Hill due to the possibility for being affected from crime.
