'''Barcelona''' is the capital and largest city of [[Catalonia]] and [[Spain]]'s second largest city, with a population of over one and half million people (over five million in the whole province).  

Barcelona is the city of the football club FC Barcelona.
This city, located directly on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, has a rich history, having been under Roman, then Frank law before declaring its independence. 

In 1992, Barcelona gained international recognition by hosting the Olympic games which brought a massive upturn in its tourism industry. 

This had the effect of changing the city in ways that are still felt today with neighbourhoods renovated (and in some cases leveled) and the intense focus of modern design permeating all aspects of life in Barcelona from public buildings to something as simple as a park bench or an event poster.

For visitors, this has translated into the very modern, yet incredibly old city you see now in the 21st century, where the new elements work to both preserve and celebrate the ancient.

This beautiful city is full of what European cities are known for (outdoor markets, restaurants, shops, museums and churches) and is fantastic for walking with an extensive and reliable Metro system for more far-flung destinations.  The core centre of town, focused around the ''Ciutat Vella'' ("Old City") provides days of enjoyment for those looking to experience the life of Barcelona while the beaches the city was built upon provide sun and relaxation during the long periods of agreeably warm weather.<br clear=all>

===History===
The exact circumstances of the founding of the city of Barcelona are uncertain, but the remains of a settlement many thousands of years old have been found in the neighborhood of Raval. While legend has Hannibal's father founding Barcelona in the 3rd Century B.C., there is no substantiating evidence.

'''The Roman Period'''

Around 15 B.C., the Romans established the military camp of ''Faventia'' near the present-day Barcelona city hall. The colony was, at first, dwarfed in size by nearby Tarraco but soon grew large and prosperous, largely due to its excellent harbor.

To this day, there are vestiges in Barcelona of its Roman past, many on display at the ''Barcelona City History Museum.'' In the city's historic center, the original Roman street grid is still discernible. There are also fragments of ancient Roman walls built into the ''Basilica La Seu,'' a cathedral dating from the 4th Century A.D.

'''Medieval Times'''

Invading ''Visigoths'' captured Barcelona in the 5th Century and made it, though briefly, the capital of Gothic Spain. By the 8th Century, Islamic invaders took the city, but in 801, the French wrested it back into Christian hands and made it the capital of a new buffer state called the "Hispanic March.''

The Hispanic March was ruled by the Count of Barcelona, and as time wore on, local counts became increasingly independent of French rule. The County of Barcelona soon annexed all [[Catalonia]] and generally prospered, though in 985, the city was sacked by Almanzor, ruler of Muslim [[Andalusia]]. 

In 1137, the County of Barcelona was united to Aragon by royal marriage, ultimately forming the single ''Crown of Aragon.'' The County of Barcelona, united with the rest of the Catalan Counties, formed the Principality of Catalonia, which remained in personal union with the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca and others under the same Crown. Aragon then built up an empire, which included Naples and Sicily and achieved naval domination of the western Mediterranean.

In 1469, the Crown Aragon was united to Castile, again by royal marriage, and soon after Madrid instead of Barcelona became the capital of the new Monarchy of Spain. When Spain gained a New World Empire, the importance of Mediterranean commerce, and thus of Barcelona, declined.

'''Modern Times'''

Barcelona remained a hotbed of insurgency long after union with Castile, and this led to the failed ''Catalan Revolt'' of 1640 to 1652. Also damaging the city at this time was the ''Great Plague,'' which killed half the population. Barcelona took some damage during the ''Napoleanic Wars,'' but the 19th Century ''Industrial Revolution'' improved the city's fortunes, while at the same time it turned into a revolutionary center.

In 1931 Barcelona was one of the first cities to proclaim the Second Spanish Republic and it was declared the capital of the autonomous region of Catalonia the same year. During the ''Spanish Civil War'' of the 1930s, Barcelona was a stronghold of Republicanism but was eventually overrun by Anarchists and Communists until the Fascist Franco regime took the city and won the war. Francisco Franco ruled as dictator until his death in 1975, after which the monarchy was re-established under Juan Carlos I, who in turn, transitioned to democratic rule.

In more recent decades, Barcelona, again the capital of the autonomous Catalonia, has gained importance as an economic center and as one of Europe's busiest ports. In 1992, the city garnered attention by hosting the ''Summer Olympics.'' 

===Climate===
The city of Barcelona has a classic "Mediterranean climate" with mild, humid winters and hot, dry summers. While there are four distinct seasons to the year, they are not at all of equal length if measured by conditions rather than equinoxes: "summer" lasts from May till October (half the year), cooler winter temperatures continue for three months, (December, January and February), and the transitional periods of spring and fall are only represented by the single months of April and November.

====Temperatures====

The hottest month of the year is August, which has average highs of 29º C (84º F) and average lows of 23º C (74º F). The coldest month is January, with highs averaging 14º C (59º F) and lows averaging 9º C (49º F). April has average highs of 19º C (66º F) and average lows of 13º C (55º F), while November has highs of 18º C (64º F) and lows of 12º C (53º F).

As Barcelona's position on the Mediterranean coast makes it a haven for swimming and sailing, the sea temperature is of interest to many tourists. The average annual mean of seawater near Barcelona is 20º C (68º F). In January, the mean is 13º C (13º C), and in August, it is 26º C (79º F).

Temperatures tend to be relatively steady in Barcelona, rarely going through drastic fluctuation during the day- and this is especially the case in the summer. During winter, the warm seawater prevents most frosts, temperatures almost never drop below freezing and snow only falls once or twice in a decade.

====Precipitation====

Barcelona receives 640 mm (25 Inches) of rainfall per year, with the rainiest season being autumn and the least-rainy season being the summer. A typical year has 55 rain days, meaning days during which rainfall is one millimeter or greater. The important things for tourists to note are that September and October see a good deal of rain, June and July are very dry and the rest of the year has moderate to light rainfall.

====Humidity, Fog and Sunshine====

Relative humidity averages 72% across the year, with July being the least-humid month (69% humidity) and October being the most-humid month (75% humidity). While fog is relatively infrequent in Barcelona during most of the year, in early springtime sea fog often lingers in the area as warm African air masses move in over significantly colder sea water.

There are over 2,500 sunlight hours per year, and there is great seasonal fluctuation. December has the fewest sunshine hours at 138 and 4.5 per day, and July gets the most sunshine at 310 hours and 10 hours per day. 

====Wind and Storms====

Overall, Barcelona is not a particularly windy city, but sea breezes are not uncommon in the summer, and they can occasionally bring storms that flood the coastline. During the summer and fall, thunderstorms are common and occasionally quite severe. Winds blowing from the Atlantic and across the Iberian Peninsula usually arrive in Barcelona with little humidity and no rain.

===People===
Barcelona has a population of 1.6 million within its city limits and 5.3 million within its metropolitan area, making it the second-most populous city in Spain. Its also one of the most densely populated cities in all of Europe, having over 16,000 residents per square km. Furthermore, since half the city's territory contains only 10% of the population, the other half has nearly double the density of the city as a whole.

====Nationality====

Sixty-two percent of Barcelona's people are native to [[Catalonia]], and another 24% moved there from some other part of Spain. Thus, a large majority of the population are of Spanish descent. However, 17% of residents hail from another country — up from only four percent in 2001. The foreign-born populations consists of Arabs, Italians, Chinese, Ecuadorians and Bolivians among others. There is also a Jewish community of 3,500 — the largest in Spain — and a small Japanese community.

====Languages====
Spanish is spoken almost universally in Barcelona, but the Catalan language has also made a comeback due to intensive efforts in the school systems in recent years. Catalan is understood by 95% of residents, spoken by 72% and written by 53%.

====Religions====

While a majority of Barcelona's people have historically been Roman Catholic, a 2011 survey found that just 49.5% identify as Catholic. There are a number of other religious groups in the city that have sizable followings. First, there are over 300,000 Muslims, which is the largest Muslim population in all of Spain. The Jewish community of 3,500, as one could well guess, continues to follow Judaism. Finally, there are a good number of Evangelicals, Eastern Orthodox, Jehovah's Witnesses and Buddhists present in Barcelona.

====Economics====

Economically, Barcelona's people are fairly well off. The nominal GDP of Barcelona's metro area was  €151.1bn in 2016 according to Eurostat. Meanwhile, GDP of the city itself is estimated at about €50bn or €28,510 per capita.

====Industries====

Ever since the 18th Century, when Barcelona and Catalonia were among the first parts of Europe to industrialize, manufacturing has been a major occupation of the city's residents. Commerce has an even longer history in Barcelona, and that tradition continues to the present day. Trade fairs, media outlets, fashion centers, educational institutions and scientific endeavors are also all prevalent in the city. Tourism, however, is one of the biggest industries. Specifically, Barcelona is the tenth-most visited city on the planet and the third-most visited in Europe, seeing over eight million tourists every single year."

===Literature===
As the capital and main cultural center of Catalonia, Barcelona is also the central "literary hub" of works produced in the ''Catalan language.'' Under the long rule of the Franco dictatorship, Catalan was systematically suppressed and discouraged, but in recent decades, it has emerged with new life. It is being taught once again in Barcelona's school system, and most of the city's people now understand it. Spanish works are also, of course, important in Barcelona's literary tradition, and is the vehicle through which the city interacts with the rest of Spain and much of the world.

Some of the most popular literary works of Barcelona, both in Catalan and in Spanish (and often with an English translation) are as follows:

*'''The City of Marvels''' (La Ciudad de los Prodigios) is a 1986 Spanish-language novel by Barcelona-native ''Eduardo Mendoza.'' It describes the social changes that took place in Barcelona between 1888 and 1929 during a period of great urbanization. It was later adapted into film form in 1999. Mendoza also authored a Catalan-language work called '''Restauracio''' in 1990 and later translated it into Spanish.

*'''The 13 titles of the Detective Pepe Carvalho series''' by Barcelona-born author ''Manuel Vazquez Montalban'' are very popular among lovers of murder and crime mysteries. His 1999 '''Murder in the Central Committee''' is set in Barcelona and is one of his best-loved works. He also published a book of poetry called '''Memory and Desire,''' which contains poems he wrote across a 19-year period.

*'''The Gray Notebook''' is an firsthand account by ''Josep Pla'' of his experiences in Barcelona as a young man in 1918. It was only published in 1966, however, after Pla revised and expanded it. The original was written in Catalan, translated into Spanish by Dionisio Ridruejo and then translated into English by Peter Bush. Josep Pla also authored many other well received works, all in Catalan, including the political chronicle '''Madrid: the Advancement of the Republic''' and the narrative account '''Life Embitters''' (La Vida Amarga).

*'''The Diamond Square,''' by highly acclaimed Catalan novelist ''Merce Rodoreda,'' is considered by many to be the best novel ever published in the Catalan language. It has been translated into over 30 languages, but be aware that the English title was changed to '''The Time of the Doves.''' It is the story of an ordinary lady who goes through the turmoil of the ''Spanish Civil War,'' and it gives you a taste of what it might really have been like to live through that momentous event.

*'''O'Clock,''' an anthology of 16 short stories, written in Catalan by Catalonian native ''Quim Monzó,'' won the ''Catalan Critics' Prize'' in 1981. It has a wide range of works inside, including satires on South American society, a study of the AIDS epidemic and portraits of life in Barcelona.

*'''Homage to Catalonia,''' a 1938 classic by ''George Orwell,'' tells the story of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War — it is one of the few works by foreigners that makes the list of important Catalonian literature.

===When to visit===
August is probably the busiest time in Barcelona; at the same time about 10% of shops and restaurants can be found closed from mid-August to early September, when the owners go on vacations. In the centre of Barcelona you will find most shops and restaurants open. However there will still be plenty of tourists. Barcelona has decent enough beaches but the locals will really appreciate it if visitors do not consider it a beach resort and don't wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc.

Barcelona is great off-season and is a lovely city even in winter months of January and February as long as the possibility of rain is low. During these months the city is not too cold averaging between 9-10°C with sunny and blue skies. Given the high humidity, 19-23°C is considered comfortable weather, which is normally the temperature between April and June and between late September to November; this is the best time to visit the city - anything warmer can feel too hot.

Easter week, as well as Christmas to New Year's Eve, are very busy times. If you'd rather avoid the crowds, don't come during those dates. Also, avoid visiting during the Mobile World Congress or the Formula 1 racing, unless you are ready to pay extremely expensive hotel rates.

===With children===
Toddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain: in any public place people around you put every effort into making your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

======Bus======

[https://aerobusbarcelona.es/ Aerobús] is a shuttle bus service that connects the Airport (both terminals) with the centre of Barcelona (Plaça de Catalunya), leaving every 5-10 minutes (A1), every 10-20minutes (A2), every day of the year.  The "A1" line takes you to/from Terminal 1 and the "A2" line takes you to/from Terminal 2.  The shuttle bus service is available everyday from 5:30am to 1am, and the journey lasts about 30 minutes (although it can take considerably longer during rush hour).  From the Airport, the shuttle bus makes a total of 4 stops: Plaça Espanya, Gran Via - Urgell, Plaça Universitat, and finally Plaça de Catalunya. To the Airport from Plaça de Catalunya, the shuttle bus only makes a total of 3 stops: Sepúlveda - Urgell, Plaça Espanya, and finally the Airport.  A one-way ticket to/from either Terminal costs €5.90 or you can buy a return ticket for €10.20 which you must use within 15 days. You can pay by either credit card (machine only) or cash (machine/ticket agent). Buses are heavily air-conditioned in Summer, so consider having something extra to wear during the journey.  Aerobús stops running after 1am, but you can catch a Nitbús night bus service instead (line N17 to T1 or line N16 to T2, 22.00-05.00 every 20 min. The ride from Plaça de Catalunya to the Airport takes about 40-50 min).

The cheapest, but slower option than Aerobús, is a bus 46 serving both T1 & T2. Its last stop in Barcelona is Plaça Espanya reached in 25-30 minutes. The one-way ticket costs €2.40 and can be purchased from the driver. Even cheaper is to buy a T-Casual Travelcard (note: this travel card used to be referred to as T-10) from the machine located at the train station outside Terminal 2; this offers even greater value and convenience if further transfer by metro, bus, tram etc. will be needed as the T10 Travelcard journey is valid for 75 mins - see the [http://wikitravel.org/en/Barcelona#Train Transfer by Train] section for details. Between 11 pm and 6 am the 46 bus service is replaced by N16/17 buses; they take a diversion adding some ten minutes to otherwise a very rapid journey ending at the same Plaça Espanya.

======Train======
A cheap and fast option is the half-hourly RENFE R2 Nord suburban train line calling at Sants (travel time is 18&nbsp;min), Passeig de Gràcia (24&nbsp;min), El Clot-Aragó (30&nbsp;min) and more stations beyond Barcelona city limits. Please be advised that this airport train has changed, and no longer terminates at Estació de França (it now goes through the centre of Barcelona and into the suburbs, so it is important to know at which station you should get off). The train terminates next to T2 by section B, with a connecting green coloured bus service to T1 (plan for an extra 15&nbsp;min of travel). The airport train station has got facilities for disabled people: escalators, lifts, etc. A single ticket for the train is €6.30 (January 2018), '''but''' you can also buy a T-Casual travelcard (€11.35 for ten trips over any period of time; each of those trips includes 3 bus, metro, train or tramway transfers made within 75&nbsp;min) instead. You can buy a T-Casual from the ticket vending machine at the airport station and at the tobacco shop in front of Terminal 2B; you can buy a T-Casual travelcard at Terminal 1 in the tobacco shop just outside the arrival lounge exit.

If you arrive at T1, you'll need to catch the free airport transfer bus (it goes from T1 to T2B then T2C then loops again to T1) and stops right next to the Aerobus stop. The ride is at least 10 minutes long. Get off the bus, head into the terminal, follow the sign to Renfe, go up the escalators, leave the terminal building, go through the overhead pass until you get to the train station. About a 10-20 minute walk. Buy the T-Casual pass and use it to access the station.

Don't rely on trains if your flight arrives after 11 pm: the last suburban train's departure time is 23:38 (January 2018).

======Metro======
The airport is linked to Barcelona by Line 9 of the Barcelona Metro with a station in each terminal, the Aeroport T1 station situated directly underneath the airport terminal T1 and the Aeroport T2 station close to the Aeroport rail station at the terminal T2. The line connects with several Barcelona Metro lines to the city center. Going to the airport Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 stations is charged with an extra of 4.5 euros if you are traveling with a single ticket or with a T-Casual pass. The airport charge can be paid before exiting the metro. No need to pay the fee if you are traveling with daily, monthly, quarterly or Hola BCN! tickets.

======Taxis and Transfer Services======
Airport transfers can be arranged for groups, taxis are available but expensive (€30-40 to the city centre). Taxis and Minibuses can be pre-booked on-line:

====Nearby airports====
Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use airports in [[Girona]], nearly 100&nbsp;km to the north, or [[Reus]], around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair recently started operating at Barcelona El Prat (airport code BCN) check using the three-letter airport codes where your flight actually goes. Girona's airport code is GRO and Reus's airport code is REU.

For [http://www.aena-aeropuertos.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Girona-Costa-Brava/en/ Girona Airport], the Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci&oacute; del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport and this ties in with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs €16 and a return ticket costs €25. The journey takes approximately one hour and ten minutes. Timetables are available  [http://www.sagales.com/index.php?nIdioma=LANG3 on-line].

For '''Reus Airport''', the easiest way to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs €13 and a return ticket costs €24. The journey takes c. 100&nbsp;min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available [http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf? on-line]. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs €8.40 (Regional) or €9.55 (Regional Express) and then the bus costs €2.10. This takes roughly about two and a half hours. Train timetables can be checked at [http://rodalies.gencat.cat/en/horaris/ Rodalies de Catalunya website]. The bus timetable is available at the website of [http://www.reustransport.cat/pdf/L50.pdf  Reus public transport].

===By rail===
Several trains per day (including overnight hotel trains) from other parts of Europe (via France) are regular and reliable.

Main train stations:
* Barcelona-Sants (to the south west of the centre).
* Barcelona-Passeig de Gràcia (near Carrer d'Aragó on Passeig de Gràcia, in the center of the city).
* Barcelona-Estació de França, Avinguda Marquès de l´Argentera (on the edge of the old town next to the seafront district of Barceloneta).

From Estació de Sants and Passeig de Grácia there are several, but very slow, connections per day to [[Cerbère]] (France), connecting there on trains towards [[Marseille]] and [[Nice]]. There are no longer any "Talgo" trains  from Sants to France as these have been replaced by the High-Speed AVE trains.

Overnight ''Trenhotel'' trains operated by [http://www.elipsos.com Elipsos] runs daily from [[Paris]]-Austerlitz while depatures from [[Milan]] and [[Zurich]] are every second day. All trenhotels trains terminates at the Estació de França station. Prices starts at €74 for second class.

There is also a less-well-known rail line over the Pyrenees to [[Toulouse]]. There are four trains per day to La Tor de Querol (Latour-de-Carol), where it is possible to transfer to a French train bound for Toulouse. The journey takes 7-8&nbsp;hr (including transfer) and costs roughly €30 one way.

Note that on the departure boards in these three stations, trains are not listed by their train number, but rather by the time of departure and the terminus city.  It may be helpful to look up the terminus city of your train before arriving at the station.  However, you can also simply show your ticket to staff at the station (identifiable by bright orange Rodalies vests), who are quite happy to help you find the right platform.

At Barcelona-Sants, you must have a ticket to use the bathroom, though the bathroom is free of charge with a ticket.  The bathroom entrance is at the entrance to Platforms 13 and 14; you must show your ticket at the platform and explain to the platform attendant you want to use the bathrooms.

====High-Speed Rail====
The high-speed line between Barcelona and Figueres finally opened in early 2013.  The new SNCF and RENFE cooperation offers service between cities in France and Barcelona.  Paris to Barcelona is 6 hours, 25 minutes.  Barcelona to Lyon takes just under 5 hours.  Barcelona to Marseille is about 4 hours, 17 minutes. Barcelona to Toulouse is just over 3 hours.

The AVE high-speed train line to [[Madrid]] opened in February 2008. Travel time is 3&nbsp;hr with intermediate stops (11 trains a day) or 2.5&nbsp;hr non-stop (6 trains a day during morning and evening peak hours).

Note that for all high-speed rail routes at all stations in Spain, you MUST pass through a security screening, which involves passing through a metal detector and an x-ray screening for your baggage.  Make sure you factor this time into your arrival at the station; you cannot simply arrive five minutes before your train's departure time and walk to the platform.

===By sea===
The city's port is one of the busiest on the Mediterranean, with nine passenger terminals, seven for cruise liners and four for ferries. Large cruise ships dock 1-2&nbsp;km to the southwest. Many offer bus-shuttles to points near the south end of La Rambla.

You can arrive to Barcelona by boat from the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Genoa]], [[Rome]], [[Livorno]], [[Sardinia]], [[Tangier]], and [[Algiers]]. From Rome ([[Civitavecchia]]) it is actually cheaper than the bus. The [http://www.barcelonaturisme.com/Arribar-en-vaixell/_dHcEaVlbphzpxz9nGRHHNvmgn_IyLv0OvnCbQGAGY7I ferry] docks almost directly on the Rambles. 

You can have your luggage picked up and stored or transferred to the airport [http://www.bcnluggageservices.com] and [http://www.alquilerdeyatesenibiza.com]

They nominally provide UK plug sockets (one shared between two people - they also have a USB port for charging phones) and free wifi on board, but the plug sockets are unreliable and wifi only works while in the UK and Spain. Passengers should be at departure point at least 30 minutes before departure time (except London Victoria where you are required to arrive 60 minutes before departure).</listing>

===By car===
There are several main roads leading to Barcelona from France and Spain and traffic is usually relatively light outside of peak hours. It is possible to find free parking spaces a few metro stops from the centre of the city.

Blue parking spaces must be paid for M-Sa 09:00-14:00 and 16:00-18:00. At some crossroads the free time ends at 08:00. Anyone can use a blue space but they aren't that easy to find. You pay at the meter and put the ticket on the dashboard. Green parking spaces are for residents only. White parking spaces are free at all times but there aren't any in the city centre.

The [http://www.bsmsa.cat/mobilitat/index.php/bsm-car-parks/advantages-and-discounts/special-rates city car parks] have some special offers for tourists.

==Get around==
The department store El Corte Inglés publishes a helpful (and free) street map for tourists. You can pick a copy at the store, or from most hotel front desks. They're also available at the tourism information offices (including one at each terminal at Barcelona El Prat Airport).

At the Tourism Information Offices they also sell "official city maps", but they aren't that good. Ask instead for the free "Barcelona Hotel Map", which contains a pretty good blow-up of the Old Town alleys.

=== By public transport ===
* Smartphone apps are the best option to navigate inside the city. They provide bus information in real time and routes to destionations with train, metro, tram and bus. Some aplications for Android and iPhone are [https://www.google.com/maps/ Google Maps], [https://citymapper.com/barcelona Citymapper] and [http://www.adif.es/en_US/adif_movil.shtml Adif], the last provides real time for Renfe trains (Rodalies de Catalunya). Only some bus stations and FGC (Plaça Catalunya and Provença) provide free WIFI.

* The '''Barcelona Bus Tur&iacute;stic [https://www.barcelonabusturistic.cat/en/home]''' links all of the Barcelona tourist sites you could possibly want to visit. It has three routes (map provided as you board), including a northbound and a southbound line that leave from opposite sides of the ''Plaça de Catalunya''. Each takes 1-2 hours.  The hop-on/hop-off format lets you get-off risk-free at any interesting stop, see what interests you, then get back on any later bus at that or any other stop. One approach is stay on for an entire route, then continue while getting off at locations that interested you earlier. Buses are double-decked, with the open-air upper deck offering much better views...sunscreen essential in summer months, jackets in winter/early spring/late fall. As you first get on, you are offered earphones. Outlets near every seat let you choose among many languages and playback volumes. As you approach each significant location, you receive audio describing it.  You can buy tickets at the bus stops and elsewhere (e.g., better hotels) valid for one day (€27, April 2015) or two consecutive days (€38, April 2015). At least in March 2015, it's cheaper to buy tickets online.

* The '''metro''' can take you to many places. Stations are marked <M> on most maps; every station has a detailed map of exits to the city. A one-journey ticket cost €2.15, so it's best to buy a multi-person 10-ride ticket for €11.35 (2020) for Zone 1[http://www.tmb.cat/en/sistema-tarifari-integrat/-/ticket/T10] which includes most tourist areas (called a T-Casual) or a personal 50-ride monthly ticket. These tickets are also valid on the '''buses''', '''trams''', '''FGC (Catalan Railway Network)''' and on the main Spanish Trains ('''RENFE (Rodalies de Catalunya)'''). 2- to 5-day public transport tickets are available that allow unlimited travel on the metro and bus networks (€14 for two days, €32 for five (March 2015)[http://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona-travel-card]). These are an excellent value. Be sure to look after them well as bent or damaged cards will not be read by the ticket machines (such cards can be replaced at one of TMB's customer service centers). Metro operating hours are: Sunday and M-Th 5:00 to 24:00, Fri 5:00 to 2:00, Saturday 24 hr (continuous service from Saturday at 5:00 until Sunday at 24:00). Trains are fast, often coming in two minute intervals. Announcements are made only in Catalan and Spanish, though signs and ticketing machines are generally trilingual in Catalan, Spanish and English. In case of temporal break on the line -for example, power failure-, a announcements are made in Catalan, Spanish, French, Japanase, and other many languages.

:Pay attention to the fact that to get from metro lines operated by TMB (1,2,3,4,5, 9/10 and 11) to the ones operated by FGC (6,7 and 8), or vice versa, you need to exit and then enter through a new pay-gate. In this case, if you had a one-journey ticket, you need to get a new one. If you used a multiple journey ticket (such as the popular 10 rides T-Casual ticket -the one that locals use the most-) you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines (as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey). To be clear, you get 10 journeys on a T-Casual ticket, and once a journey begins, you have a certain amount of time (stated on the card) where you can use the pay gates the TMB metro, the FGC metro (6/7/8), TMB bus, tram, and local RENFE (Rodalies de Catalunya) lines up to once on each journey. The number of rides left will be indicated on the back of the card as well as the fact that the T-Casual has been fully used up. The text that appears in the ticket when you use the 10 travels is "Titol esgotat", below 10 lines of times used. The bus map may also be downloaded, this allows you to plan your route and make connections.
:Usual features are: all cars are air conditioned; there are large screens for video advertising between lanes (e.g. at Universitat).

* The RENFE trains are not the same that metro. Please use the correct word to avoid wrong indications, metro is subway/underground and train is RENFE. '''Renfe''' isn't the correct name, the real is '''Rodalies de Catalunya''' and outside Catalonia is '''Cercanias'''. You can referer using the previous names without problem. The trains can be very chaotic and no information or contradictory information. If you are lost, ask locals. Younger people in particular are more fluent in English and will be of better help. Indications are rarely in english, and public address system only in catalan and spanish. Civia trains, provides free spanish sockets in every entrance shared for 2 doors. That's mean exists 3 sockets for each car.

* The '''Barcelona Card''' [http://www.barcelonaturisme.com/Barcelona-Card/_vf-SMlY1yIuKQTV1aq49kKiai5xWH5aiyts88OxeIl1n-AUBYhubtQ] features unlimited free travel on public transport and free admission and discounts at around 100 visitor attractions. The card is available for purchase for periods of between 2 and 5 days, costing €37.00 for a 2-day card and €62.00 for a 5-day card. But you will get an online discount of 10% if you are booking in advance. If you don't plan to see lots of museums every day, then it is cheaper to buy transport-only tickets (see above).
:But there are many things that you will want to do in Barcelona that are not eligible for discounts. You can't use the Barcelona card on fun transport options like cable cars, funiculars (except to Montjuic), for example.

* The '''Barcelona ComboPass®''' [http://www.conciergerie.com/barcelona/pass/barcelona-combo-pass.php] is a non-Official combo pass available for periods from 2 to 5 days and includes the benefits of the Barcelona Card described above, plus the Hop on/off Bus Turistic and the Montjuic cable car.  However, it will not necessarily save you money compared to buying each ticket separately.  For example, it costs €78.90 for a 2-day Barcelona ComboPass, but if you purchase the [http://www.barcelonaturisme.com/Barcelona-Card/_vf-SMlY1yItM-U_l9RgLJoJPG-BcW4K5Nh9zolHzbfEZHPPl-quGpijiyridJcEtcsglia4xSXxSRadTfucdgD9zNMxJP80fs6HR8KU_MISCEV8mFsSPCA 2-day Barcelona Card] (€33.30), the [http://www.barcelonabusturistic.cat/web/guest/venda_titols 2-day Bus Turistic ticket] (€30.60), and the [http://www.barcelonaturisme.com/Montjuic-Cable-Car/_vf-SMlY1yIuKQTV1aq49kJLSZqWPVp5H4ouSb22zi_wPIXQ6GELBrQ Montjuic cable car ticket] (€9.27) separately and online from the Official city ticket offices, then you will only pay €73.17 and save over €5 per person.

* The [https://www.turbopass.com/barcelona-city-pass '''Barcelona City Pass'''] is another option that includes free entry and discounts to around 100 attractions, museums, shops and bars as well as free and unlimited use of the public transport. A highlight of this pass is the included admission to the famous Sagrada Família with skip the line priorities and the free use of Hop on/off Bus Turistic. The Barcelona City Pass is available for periods from 2 (€ 79,90) to 5 days (€ 129,90) and it always comes with a map of Barcelona and a practical travel brochure.

===By Segway===
Explore highlights the of Barcelona by segway in hours. Several tours give you the opportunity to Get to know the history of Barcelona from professional tour guides also get advice for the best places for eating, going out and shopping.

=== By car ===
Parking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (€3/hour, €20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.

Having a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, ''Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes'' is technically two-way, but in one direction supports only minor traffic: after every crossroad you'll find the traffic light on the next crossroad turns red by the time you reach it.

But if you have to take a rent a car there are several companies there to get great car rental rates. Some free parking spots reported by travelers are:
* Near ''Moll de Sant Bertran'' (which is south-west from ''Museu Maritim'') - driving at B-10, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.
* Somewhere near Guell Park.
* Near Font Màgica, in Plaça Espanya.

Getting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.

==Talk==
: ''See also:'' [[Catalan phrasebook]], [[Spanish phrasebook]]

Barcelona's official languages are [[Catalan phrasebook|Catalan]] and [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the administrative language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a language, not a dialect of Spanish, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese, and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.

These issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere, and there's no way to summarize here. The percentage of Catalan speakers is much lower In the city of Barcelona than in the rest of Catalonia. People here thus generally use Catalan with family members, close friends, and others that they are sure speak the language, and use Spanish, which is understood universally, with strangers. Spanish-speaking visitors will have no problems in Barcelona.

In tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak in English. If you are an English speaker you will not have any problem as Barcelona is a very touristic city.

If you are thinking of visiting several museums, an "articket"[http://www.articketbcn.org/en/barcelonamuseums] will save you some money. It is a combined ticket costing €30 and covering admission to six museums.

=== Attractions spanning several districts ===
* <see name="Harbour Cable Car" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="Jun-Sep: 11AM-8PM" price="One-way €10, round trip €15.1" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">The 1450 metre long harbour aerial tramway with red cars connects Montjuic and Barceloneta. It starts in Barceloneta on the top of the 78 metre tall ''Torre San Sebastian'' tower, which has also a restaurant at its top accessible by an elevator. It has an intermediate stop at ''Torre Jaume I'' tower (close to Columbus monument), which can be reached by elevator from ground--107 metre tall tower, the second tallest aerial tramway support tower in the world. The final point of the tramway is Montjuic. Overall, the tramway is quite old (built in 1929), and the car is packed with tourists during the daytime--particularly sensitive for a stroller or a wheelchair. Plan your route wisely as the capacity is limited. It can be up to 1-1.5 hours from the moment you join the queue to the moment you get in the car. Currently, the ''Torre Jaume I'' tower in Barceloneta is temporarily closed for renovation, while two other stops work as usual. The facility doesn't accept credit cards, it's cash only.</see>

* "'''Montserrat'''"A little ways outside the city of Barcelona (roughly an hour and a half), lies the beautiful Montserrat mountain range. Today there are a handful of newer buildings that have been built on the range, but upon visiting, it is easy to slip back into the past to imagine what the mountain range must have been like hundreds of years ago.

===La Sagrada Familia===
[[Image:Sagrada_Familia.jpg|thumb|200px|La Sagrada Familia]]

One of the most famous and breathtaking locations to visit in Barcelona the most famous building in the entire city and its landmark, La Sagrada Familia. Although incomplete, the church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in November 2010 was consecrated and proclaimed a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI.  From the outside, visitors are astonished by the sheer height and intricacy of the design of the church and although it is not completed yet, the progress that has been made is incredibly impressive. The project began nearly a century ago and was designed by one of Spain’s most well known and respected architects in Spanish history, Antoni Gaudí. Gaudí was born a Catalan (ethnic group in Spain) and produced some of the most moving buildings and works of art that are still standing and praised by the Spanish people. Undoubtedly, his most famous work is La Sagrada Familia. La Sagrada familia is a masterpiece in the center of the city of Barcelona. The height of the church will be, once it's finished, exactly equal to the height of the largest mountain in the nearby hills, the reason being because Gaudí felt that no man-made creation should ever rise above God’s natural creations. The height of the church is overwhelming when standing at its base and the inside is even more impressive.

Upon first walking into the church one cannot help to feel their stomach drop as they witness one of the most impressive and beautiful creations known to man. Visitors first gaze up at the height that the ceiling extends to, supported by beautiful hand shaped columns, which were hand-shaped to resemble the trunks of trees. As a lover of nature, Gaudí included many elements of God’s natural beauty within his work. As visitors move towards the center of church they cannot help but to twist their head in a full 360 to admire all of the stained glass windows that line the walls of the basilica. During the day these windows produce incredible natural light (a personal favorite of Gaudí) that illuminates the sheer beauty of the inner church. 

The church is absolutely breathtaking. La Sagrada Familia is an absolute must see for every visitor in Spain and the Barcelona. It is truly a masterpiece and is sure to please visitors of all ages. Images of this majestic church can be found [http://www.google.es/search?q=la+sagrada+familia&hl=es&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=Rt44UZzDAsGM7QawxoDgAw&sqi=2&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1129&bih=1005 here].

To avoid the queue, tickets may be booked online and collected at Sagrada Familia itself.  You can show your ticket on your mobile. You will need to indicate the time of visit. If you plan visit either the Passion Tower or the Nativity Tower. You can stay in Segrada Familia for as long as you want after descending the Tower. The Passion Tower has elevator both ways. The Nativity Tower option means you to take the elevator up and walk all the way down. You enjoy the view of the city as you climb down, not the external wall of the Tower.

Beware of third party apps that tries to sell you FAST TRACK or PRIORITY PASS, NO WAITING LINE. Those are overpriced tickets you can buy at the official website and show at the entrance. Buy at the [https://sagradafamilia.org/ official site] only.

=== Beaches ===
[[File:Barcelona Beach.JPG|thumb| Barcelona beach]]
Named the #1 Beach City in the world by [http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/#/beach-barcelona-spain_21757_600x450.jpg National Geographic], Barcelona's beaches are world-renowned.  Although locals prefer that you do not stroll through the city in beachwear, the beaches themselves have a very open and relaxed atmosphere.  As with many other European beaches, you will find topless (and even nudist) beach-goers.  Unlike many European beaches, however, you will find fun and friendly "chiringuitos" common on Spanish beaches that offer you a place to sit down and listen to music while you have a drink and grab a bite to eat directly on the sand as you watch beach-goers strolling by. Please be aware that the sand at the main beaches is quite rough - it may have small stones and shells.

'''Beach Season'''

The Barcelona beach season starts around March 15th and goes until around November 15th.  The High Season for beach-goers is usually from the end of May until the end of September.

Despite having 1.6 million people within its city limits and nearly five million in its metropolitan area, Barcelona is a relatively compact city, with many of its top tourist attractions within walking distance of each other.

===Things to Do in the Ciutat Vella===

The ''Ciutat Vella,'' meaning "Old City," is the oldest, most central and most tourist-visited neighborhood of Barcelona. Some of its famous streets and their attractions are:

*'''Les Rambles''' is the liveliest pedestrian walkway in town and is spelled in the plural because it is actually a series of streets (each one a "rambla"). Though crowded with tourists, Las Rambles is tree-lined and beautifully laid out. All along the way, you will meet with interesting street performers, some of them doing stunts, some of them costumed and some of them offering to do pencil sketches.

*'''Plaça de Catalunya''' is a square located in the very center of the city. It is the city's transport hub and a favorite rendezvous point. The square is famous for its many fountains and statues, and it is lined by shops on every side.

*The '''Barri Gòtic''' (Gothic Quarter) is at the very heart of the Ciutat Vella. Here, you can see numerous buildings that date from medieval times as well as a few that go back to the Roman Period.

*In various parts of the Old City, you will find literally '''miles of beachfront boardwalks.''' These are worthwhile just to walk along- but you can also get in the water to swim or lay down for a tan on the sand.

*'''El Portal de L'Àngel''' is a spacious pedestrian walkway lined by some of the most expensive and most in-style shops in all of Barcelona.

'''Things to Do in Other Barcelona Neighborhoods'''

*In '''Sants Montjuic,''' you can ride high in the sky on a cable car that takes you from the sea coast all the way up to the mountain known as ''Montjuic.''

*Also in Sants Montjuic, you can see a '''Flamenco Show,''' which is a traditional Spanish performance with guitar music, song and dance, at the '''Tablao de Carmen.'''

*'''Coastal tours of Barcelona''' can be had by sail boat [http://barcelonasail.com] and motor boat. The duration can be from 1 hour to a full-day coastal tour by "classic yacht." 

*Take a bike tour of '''Eixample''' to see its imposing ''Modernista'' architecture, some of it mimicking medieval style, and also stop of at the ''Japanese Library.''

*Attend a football match at '''Camp Nou,''' the home of ''FC Barcelona'' and the largest-capacity stadium in all of Spain, seating over 99,000. Besides football matches, concerts are also occasionally held there.

===Other activities===

* Cruise miles of '''beachfront boardwalk''' starting from Barceloneta or get a tan on the beach.
[[Image:Barceloneta.jpg|thumb|250px|Barceloneta Beach]]

If your accommodation is on Rambla, Born is a great place to escape the crowds, enjoy a relaxed atmosphere and meet off-the-beaten track travellers and non-tourist-industry locals--especially in the evenings.

* Ride the '''Cable Way''' to get from the sea front to Montjuïc mountain in [[Barcelona/Sants-Montjuïc|Sants-Montjuïc]]

* Sit and sip on a coffee in '''Plaça dels Àngels''' in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]], while admiring the whiteness of the MACBA and the best street skate tricks in town.

* Catch a performance at the beautiful '''Teatre del Liceu''' or the '''Palau de la Musica Catalana''' both in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]].

* Visit a '''Flamenco Show''' in a real tablao. Although the dance is not local to Catalunya, one of the best Flamenco Shows in the city is Tablao de Carmen in [[Barcelona/Sants-Montjuïc|Sants-Montjuïc]].  A cheaper alternative is in the jazzclub '''Jazz Si''' in [[Barcelona/Ciutat Vella|Ciutat Vella]].  

* Rent a bike or join a Biketour and get to see the highlights of the city in a different way. Ride from the magic beaches of the Mediterranean, to Gaudí's modernist buildings through the medieval atmosphere of the Old Quarter.

* Sail 3 hours to see Barcelona from the sea.

* Join a Barcelona photography walk or masterclass in English with [www.Meetup.com/BarcelonaPhotography]

Barcelona has an astounding 35,000 shops for tourists to explore, but since no one could hope to exhaustively shop Barcelona, a "buyers guide" is in order. First of all, you will want to walk the five km (three-mile) "shopping line" that stretches along the ''Les Rambles'' pedestrian pathway. There is very little vehicle traffic along this run, though there will be plenty of other tourists to navigate around. Along the route, you will find plenty of shops selling "big-name" items along with many specialty designer shops selling Spanish-made apparel, shoes, jewelry and more.

Most shops and malls in Barcelona will be closed for business on Sundays (by force of law), but there are exceptions- especially in the ''Ciutat Vella.'' There, you will find fashionable clothing outlets, small souvenir shops and local supermarkets open all week long.

Some of the best specific shopping opportunities that await the visitor to Barcelona include the following:

*'''Excellent antiques''' can be picked up in Barcelona if you know where to look. On the street called ''Passeig de Gràcia'' in ''Eixample'' district is lined with antique shops. There are also many to be found along ''Carrer del Consell de Cent'' (also in ''Eixample'') and along ''Carrer de la Palla'' nearby the Cathedral.

*'''Two flea markets''' are worth checking out: the one held every Saturday morning next to the ''Colum'' (Christopher Columbus) monument at the end of ''Les Rambles'' and another one in the square outside of ''Barcelona Cathedral,'' which is open on Thursday mornings.

*The '''El Corte Inglés''' department store has a number of locations all over the city, including in ''Eixample,'' ''Ciutat Vella' and the ''Inland Suburbs.'' In the city center, two ''El Corte Ingles'' locations are within easy walking distance of each other, and the '''Fnac''' department store is also in the vicinity. These stores are very large and have virtually everything you are likely to shop for, all under one roof.

*'''La Boqueria''' is a gigantic public market located in ''Ciutat Vella.'' It is worth exploring for its wide range of both produce and goods, and you can stop off for some fresh-squeezed fruit juice or other refreshments as you shop. Be aware that the market closes down on Sundays. Also, be careful while touching chocolate produce here or you they will force you to pay for it. 

*'''Jamon Iberico,''' a Spanish-style cured ham with a rich, nutty flavor is a very popular buy among tourists and locals alike. This ham is made from the ''Pata Negra,'' an ancient breed of pig exclusively native to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).

*'''La Gauche Divine''' is a unique, multifaceted store in the ''Ciutat Vella'' district that combines high-fashion, designer, musical and artistic fare.

Barcelona is a city with more than 20 Michelin stars in all its restaurants. The Catalans pride themselves in great food, which is anchored in [https://barcelonaeatlocal.com/secrets-about-the-barcelona-traditional-foods/ centuries of history and the use of fresh products]. However, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, as with all highly touristic cities, but good food does exist at reasonable prices. The golden rule of thumb applies well in Barcelona: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track by fellow travelers, seek out cafes and restaurants where the locals frequent, and avoid restaurants with touts outside.

{{infobox|Where to eat during migdiada (Catalan)/siesta (Spanish)|Majority of restaurants and cafes are closed between 4PM and 8PM for ''migdiada''. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:
* tapas in bars (not too healthy nor cheap to substitute a full meal)
* international chains
* selected restaurants who are flexible enough to cater for tourists all day long: Origen 99.9%, Udon, Vegetalia.}}

'''Set menus (menú del dia)''' Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a ''menú del dia'' (menu of the day), which usually means a simple and unpretentious two course meal (one salad, main dish, and a drink; plus a dessert, sometimes), 3 or 4 options each, with a drink and a dessert, for €8 to €15-20, depending on the restaurant. Keep in mind these are not going to be huge portions. Typically, you will get all of the items listed, but they will be one or two mouthfuls at most (i.e., all of the food will fit on one standard sized plate). During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 2PM to 4PM. The savvy traveler will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.

If you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve ''platos combinados,'' which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.

'''Smoking''' is not permitted in restaurants anymore.

===Dishes===
[[Image:PintxosBarcelona.jpg|thumb|250px|pintxos]]
[[File:Catalan meat.jpg|thumb|A selection of butiffara, beans, and another meat from a typical Catalan country meal]] 
You can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.

''See [[Catalonia#Catalan Cuisine|Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article]].''

The selection of '''seafood''' is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out). 

A treat to try that no travel guide mentions is '''waffles''' sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.

Even though tapas restaurants are now all over the city, tapas itself originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain and is NOT native to Catalan cuisine.  Catalans generally eat three course meals (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-dinner drink and pintxos (Basque counterpart for tapas) at a Basque taverna than for a meal consisting entirely of the new trend in tapas-only dining.  As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely to see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.

===Food Tours===
If you are looking for a quick introduction to Barcelona's cuisine, you could consider going on a food tour - wine tour, tapas tour, cooking classes, market tour... options are plentiful and the hard part is to choose one.

===Areas to eat===
Depending on where you are in the city, there may be restaurants galore, or none at all. The following areas tend to be restaurant "hubs", with a large variety of restaurants to choose from:
* [[Barcelona/Barceloneta|Barceloneta]]: A popular quarter for locals, where you can try fish based dishes, such as ''Paella'' (a name that may hide many different kinds of rice concoctions) or ''Arr&ograve;s negre'' (''Black Rice''), that takes its colour because it is made using squid ink. It's a very good place to eat ''tapas'' as well.

* Eixample Esquerra (between Gran Via and Mallorca)
* Barri Gòtic (especially for tapas)
* "El Born" (next to Barri Gòtic)
* Carrer de Blai: this street in Poble Sec (and close to the Metro stop) is wall-to-wall tapas and pintxos (a Basque bar snack food, similar to tapas) bars. Very cheap and popular, it's a good place to start bar-hopping, with each tapas/pintxos piece often costing no more than 1-1.50 EUR each.

Around Plaça Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving excellent ''tapas''.

For budget eating you may choose "menu del dia" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for €9-€11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.

The large cafes that line the Passeig de Gràcia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the Plaça Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas. This part of the town is quite touristy and a bit expensive.

===Groceries===

In several supermarkets you can find a wide stall with a great selection of ready-to-eat dishes. You can get a two-course lunch for less than €5.

=== Pricing ===
{{eatpricerange|Up to €10|€10 - €25|€25 and up}}
€10 is the lowest price for a standard ''menu del dia''; for less it can be only canteen or budget-style eating--or fast food.

==Drink==


===Nightlife Barcelona===
Barcelona's nightlife options are endless. There are clubs and bars lining every single street, and you can even find people enjoying a drink outside either on the street, in a plaza, or on the beach. The noteable club scene is what brings many partiers to the city. Places like Opium and Pacha are two major spots, especially notorious for their beach side location. However, this is not the only club hot spot. Head to Gracia to find places like Bling Bling and Sutton, boasting a more exclusive atmosphere. The best neighborhoods to find a bar are El Born, El Gotico, and El Raval. 
===Cafes===
Try a "''cafè amb gel''" an espresso with a drop of milk served with a glass of ice cubes on the side at any local 'cafeteria'

===Bars===

Barcelona is a city with a longstanding heritage of locally produced beers and wines. In fact, it has some unique drinks of other kinds as well, such as '''orxata''' which is a drink made from chufa (papyrus) juice, sugar and water as well as '''granizados,''' which consist of sweetened orange juice, lemon juice or coffee poured over crushed ice. As to alcoholic beverages, however, those most commonly consumed in Barcelona include:

*'''Cerveza''' (beer), Spanish style. Be aware that, if you ask for "una cerveza," you will be handed a bottled beer. For a draught beer, you must request "una caña."

*'''Vermuth al grifo,''' an herbal wine that is stored in small-sized barrels and mixed with aerated water before drinking.

*'''Cava,''' a semi-sparkling variety of champagne that is somewhat fruitier and "greener" than French champagne. Major brands include: Codroniu, Freixenet and Raimat.

*'''Moscatel,''' a naturally sweet wine with a floral aroma that is at least 85% from the ''Moscatel de Alejandria'' type of grape. It is best served slightly chilled and drizzled over various Catalonian/Spanish desserts along with fruit and ice cream.

Barcelona has a large number of both beer bars and wine bars, and there are some establishments that cross the line and double as both. The fact that the wine vineyards of ''Penedes'' lie within only a few km of Barcelona explains, in part, why wine bars are such a common sight in this city.

Some of the most popular places to go for a taste of Catalonian beer and wine include:

*'''La Vinya del Senyor''' located near the famous ''Santa Maria del Mar Church,'' offers a wide array of Spanish and international wines. Local snacks like specialty cheeses and Spanish olives are also to be found here.

*'''Viblioteca,''' set in the heart of the ''Gracia'' district, is a boutique wine bar and romantic restaurant wrapped into one. You can match Spanish wines and tapas to menu items like fresh tuna, steak tartar and "pan con tomate" (tomato bread).

*'''Lo Pinyol,''' also in ''Gracia,'' serves both wine and beer, tapas and vermouth being particularly popular. The prices are reasonable, and the ambiance is often described as "cozy but stylish."

*The '''Raimon Social Club,''' located in the ''Gothic Quarter'' and not far from the ''Les Rambles'' walkway, is well known for its Cuban Cocktail bar. Such drinks as fresh fruit mojitos and piña coladas are very popular there, and free salsa lessons are even offered.

*'''Espit Chupitos''' has multiple locations throughout Barcelona, including one in the beachfront ''Barcelonita'' area. This bar is known for its shot-drinks, such as the cinnamon-sprinkled ''Harry Potter'' and the flaming-hot ''Monica Lewinsky.'' There are literally hundreds of different shots to choose from, and live entertainment is also a regular feature of a night at ''Espit Chupitos.''

* '''Raimon Social Club''', best Cuban Cocktail bar for fresh fruit Mojitos, Daiquiris or Piña Colada, right in the heart of the Gothic, by Les Rambles and Plaça Reial, with free salsa lessons. Carrer Nou de Zurbano 8, Barcelona.

* '''Espit Chupitos''', are located in several locations through out the city, including one in Barceloneta. Chupitos is Spanish for "shots" and offers hundreds of unique shots including the "Harry Potter" (a shot that sparks as cinnamon is sprinkled over it), and "Monica Lewinsky" (a variety of flaming shots) amongst others. As much a show as it is a place to get a drink, it's a fun night out.

* '''Lo Pinyol''', cozy and stylish Bodega with Wine, Wermouth, Beer and awesome Taps for reasonable prices in the Gracia district: Torrent de l'Olla 7

===Discount cards===


* '''Discounted entrance to clubs''' Most nightclubs in Barcelona tend to offer guests lists, offering free entrance or discounted drinks for tourists who arrive early. Such guest lists can often be found on facebook. In addition, various apps for that purpose exist as well.

Barcelona offers an incredibly voluminous and diverse array of sleeping accommodations to the eight million or so tourists who visit the city annually. Knowing where to sleep among this plethora of options can be a bit bewildering, but there is something for everyone — one-star establishments all the way up to five. There is a wide range of hostels, guesthouses, all the way up to beautiful, luxurious 5 Star hotels. Prices tend to be higher around Summer time in July and August. February can be also very expensive due to the famous Mobile Conference. Usually, the cheapest months to travel to Barcelona are May and then again October and November.

Most people who visit Barcelona wish to tour the major sites in city center first and foremost, and therefore it makes sense to be located downtown. With your "headquarters" in ''Old City'' areas like ''Las Ramblas,'' ''the Gothic Quarter'' or the inner-city beachfront zone known as ''La Barceloneta,'' you have immediate access to the city's transportation hub and plenty of places to visit on foot.

==Contact==
===Internet===

As of april 2016 there is free internet service provided by the city council with 591 spots available.  [http://www.bcn.cat/barcelonawifi/en/]. It's slow connection, limited to 256kbps and schedule limitation. City council provides a [http://www.bcn.cat/barcelonawifi/en/ map] with the position of the spots available.

'''One of the best options''' is to rent a prepaid portable WiFi Hot spot. Service is available in all of Spain provided by some Telco companies; one of them is [http://www.alldayinternetspain.com AlldayInternet] which allows the connection to any WiFi device without roaming charges: Smart-phones, Tablets, PCs…

===Telephone and mobile services===

Visitors can pick up a Prepaid SIM which will allow them access to internet on their smartphone or device. There are many options to choose from, you can buy from the telephone companies or from the local shops or internet cafes. As an example, a Lycamobile prepaid card bought recently cost 8.50 and allows one to buy a 250mb plan for 30 days. Options run up to 2G for 30 days. Please note that your passport or ID is needed to register the prepaid SIM.


==Stay safe==

===Pickpockets===

Barcelona is Europe's [[Pickpockets|pickpocketing]] capital. '''Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed.''' As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. People may approach you asking for change, or to change money. Just ignore them. If you are asked to change money, then official-looking police may approach you afterwards to 'check' your wallet for ID, etc. These are not police, so be at your most vigilant or you might find they have taken a few cards or cash upon returning your wallet.

[[Pickpockets]] use the football trick as the local specialty. At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), an accomplice will pickpocket you. It is also possible that criminals will pose as tourists and ask directions to approach their victims. Keep your distance and be careful in tourist places.

The subway is a hotbed for pickpocketing activity, which can range from simple opportunistic thefts to coordinated attacks. Be especially wary on the subway platforms at Sants train station and Sagrada Família. A group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance ''and'' exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors while they close. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. Once they take stuff, they quickly return to the platform and walk off calmly while you are trapped in the departing subway as they make sure they exit just before the doors cannot be reopened. Violence in these situations is rare, and in most cases the goal of the thieves is to rob you undetected.

Stay vigilant: do not leave anything in a back trouser pocket (except maybe a map of the city). Hold on to your bag or purse at all times. Do not leave anything unattended while you sit in a cafe or restaurant. Traveling with another person or persons is a good practice. Have the others look out. The impression that you are paying attention is enough to deter most thieves. This makes someone else an easier target than yourself.

===Scams===

Scams are incredibly common, especially in very touristy areas. The number one thing to remember about a scam is that you should never speak with someone you don't know who walks up to you in a crowded area. Do not sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. Being rude is actually your best defense against scams. You can't be tricked if they don't have time to speak with you.

A common scam in Barcelona involves fake police officers, usually claiming to be "undercover" who will ask to see your passport or identification, then take your belongings when they can and run away. Overall various scams happen in the city which seems always performed by a group of professional scam artists. When it happens, it's pretty ok to just walk away instead of start any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. These are organized scams to steal things from you. If such incident happens, follow the advice above and just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation or speaking to them. Stay alert, especially in busy tourist areas near the Sants station and Plaça d'Espanya.

Another popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers pilfers their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays on the platform and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.

The bird droppings scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.

A version of [[common scams#Three Card Monte|Three Card Monte]] is one of many [[common scams]] played on Las Ramblas. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs (or any other thing, usually very vague, that they think you won't be in favor of, such as a petition "against drugs"). Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.

There is a flat tire scam that seems to be popular in Barcelona that targets rental cars or those with foreign license plates. There are a few varieties of this particular scam, but it involves distracting the driver and passengers by mentioning a flat tire. Sometimes, they are pedestrians crossing the street, other times they are people on motorcycles, but they are almost always working in teams.  Those in the car check to see if their tire is actually flat while someone reaches in to grab whatever they can. This can happen in traffic, but sometimes they'll offer to show you a garage nearby where you can get it fixed or they will offer to help you. In some instances, there will be absolutely no damage to your tire and in other cases the thieves will actually knife your tire. Be sure to keep your doors locked while driving in the city, and watch for any suspicious motorbikes stopping near your car.

===ATMs===

Choose an ATM in a busy area and merge quickly into the crowd to avoid being [[common scams#ATM_scams|targeted]]. Barcelona is particularly well-equipped with ATMs. Many offer a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.) and accept credit cards of various banks.

Most ATMs will not charge you a fee to withdraw funds (though your bank still may, of course). Catalunya Caixa is an exception: they will charge a several euro fee, so avoid their ATMs.

===Overcharging===

Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of [[common scams#Overcharging|methods]] are employed, including the [[common_scams#No-change_trick|No Change trick]]. You can touch items in shops but do not touch chocolate in la boqueria - the women there will force you to buy it.

===Areas of caution===
Just like any other city there are some particular areas in Barcelona that tourists should be aware of. None of these areas are deathly dangerous but their crime rate is higher than many other neighboorhoods. Here's a rundown of the neighboorhoods:
*'''Gothic Quarter and La Rambla''' - These areas are the epicenter of Barcelona's tourism industry. During the day you should '''really, REALLY be careful of your belongings'''. Barcelona is often called the pickpocketing capital of Europe alongside [[Rome]] and a significant amount petty thiefts happen in La Rambla and the surrounding areas. During the night the area is OK (there are many restaurants, bars and nightclubs) but most people tend to walk in groups rather than alone. In addition, many alleys of the Gothic Quarter can become rather dark and desolate; don't enter these alleys just like you would do in any other part of the world. 
*'''El Raval''' - This is the most notorious area in Barcelona when it comes to crime. The local goverment has taken huge steps to lower its crime rate and the area is nowhere near what it used to be some decades ago. However, the neighboorhood is still more dangerous than most others in Barcelona and the overall environment along with the dilapidated buildings can be a small shock for tourists for an area a few meters away from La Rambla. During the night it's better not to linger for too long in the streets (especially the further away you move from La Rambla). Prostitution is also present in some parts of the area too.

===Cars===

Tourist drivers may attract special attention, such as [[common scams#Red light bag snatch|Red light bag snatch]] or [[common scams#Flat_tire|Flat tire scams]]

===Reporting crimes===

If you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that is the downtown police station, officers may not speak English, despite that fact the official theft report form is in both English and Spanish. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath Plaça Catalunya beside the metro station, they have translators for English, French, etc.
