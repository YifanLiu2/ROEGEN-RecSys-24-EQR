'''Nashville''' [http://www.nashville.gov/] is a city in Davidson County and the capital of the [[United States of America|American]] state of [[Tennessee]], as well as being the state's largest city. It is usually called the "Country Music Capital of the World" or more often "Music City, USA"; however, in recent years, Nashville has done much to escape its country music image and become a regional center of culture and commerce. In fact, Dell, Nissan, GM Motors, Amazon, AllianceBernstein, Bridgestone, UBS Financial Services, HCA, Community Health Services, Lyft, Google, and Microsoft have all moved some operations to or near the city. The music is various; major rap artists and rock bands (Young Buck, Haystak, Kings of Leon, Paramore, and Ben Folds) claim Nashville as their hometown. Nashville is also the epicenter of the contemporary Christian music industry. Nashville is also notable for line dancing as well.

Nashville is quickly becoming a fun and enjoyable American city, and is drawing the most tourists from out of the country out of any city in the United States. The New York Times gave Nashville the moniker of the "it" city, and the overall progressive and loving environment, along with the diverse $100 billion economy consisting of health care, music, tech and automotive industries, have made people want to visit and live alike in the music city. Nashville is an '''experience''' that many people across the United States and the World love and enjoy, and it is highly recommended to go and visit. 

Nashville has been the home of the world-famous '''Grand Ole Opry''' [http://www.opry.com/] since 1925. The Opry has been located in the Grand Ole Opry House in eastern Nashville since 1974. From 1974 to 1997 the Opry House was part of a theme park called Opryland USA, which closed due to low attendance and was subsequently torn down and replaced with a mega-shopping mall called Opry Mills. Nashville also has a great bar scene. If you like to drink, you can go "Honky-tonking," also known as "bar-hopping." Recently Nashville has been called a top ten destination to visit in magazines such as Lonely Planet, New York Times, Conde Nast, and Travel and Leisure, and is quickly developing into a fun and cosmopolitan city.

===History===
Nashville was founded in 1779 and it grew rapidly because of its excellent location on the Cumberland River. It was incorporated in 1806 and became the county seat of Davidson County. Nashville was named the capital of Tennessee in 1843.

Like many Southern cities, Nashville was not immune to the economic woes of the post-Civil War South but it quickly rebounded. It only took a few years for the city to reclaim its important shipping and trading position and to develop a solid manufacturing base. The post-Civil War years of the late 19th century brought a new found prosperity to Nashville. These healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, which can still be seen around the downtown area.

Since the 1970s, the city has experienced tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of Mayor (later-Tennessee Governor) Phil Bredesen, who made urban renewal a priority, and fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Nashville Public Library downtown, Bridgestone Arena, and LP Field.

Currently as of 2015 Nashville is experiencing another economic boom with many national publications highlighting the authenticity and gentrification around the city. It is rapidly becoming more cosmopolitan and attracted the most increase in international tourism out of any US city for 2015, therefore the time is now to go and enjoy the Nashville experience.

===By car===
Nashville is a nexus of several interstate highways, including '''I-65''' (north-south), '''I-40''' (east-west), and '''I-24''' (northwest-southeast). The various highways sometimes merge and split without the typical exit-offramp design, so travellers should consult maps[http://www.mapnashville.com/nashvillemapdistribution.html] before attempting to navigate the area. There is easy access to/from [[Chattanooga]], [[Knoxville]], [[Memphis]], [[Louisville]], among others.

===By bus===
*'''Greyhound''', 1030 Charlotte Ave, ''+1 615'' 255-3556, [http://www.greyhound.com/]. Located right Downtown a few blocks north of Broadway.
*'''Megabus''', [http://us.megabus.com]. Service from [[Memphis]], [[Knoxville]], [[Atlanta]], [[Chattanooga]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Chicago]]. Buses stop on Commerce St between 5th Ave N and 4th Ave N.

==Get around==
===By bus===
'''Nashville MTA''', ''+1 615'' 862-5969, [http://www.nashvillemta.org/]. Operates routes throughout downtown and the surrounding area. $1.70 for an adult local fare. As of 2016, free transfers are provided with fare payment; ask the bus driver for a transfer pass upon boarding. An all-day pass for an adult is $5.25.

===By train===
'''The Music City Star''', ''+1 615'' 862-8833, [http://www.musiccitystar.org]. Commuter train runs Monday - Friday. The train runs from Lebanon to Downtown's Riverfront Station. One-Way tickets purchased at the platform are $5 each. There are two shuttle services that transport people for no extra charge, passengers use their Music City Star ticket to board. Shuttle 93 goes up Broadway, West End, and around the Vanderbilt area. Shuttle 94 loops through Downtown. If you wish to go to any other place in the city, you can catch the Downtown Shuttle at the Riverfront Station and exit at the downtown bus mall then catch the bus that is going to your destination.

===By car===
Car is always your best bet. Average speed on highways ranges from 55-70 mph, while city streets are generally 35 mph unless otherwise posted.

I-40, I-65, and I-24 are the major interstate highways that run through Nashville.

All major national car rental agencies operate in Nashville.

Taxis are also very prevalent in Nashville, especially Downtown. Taxi companies that operate in Nashville are:

For Executive transportation, sedan or limousine services are available, these often work like Black Cars in [[New York City]], and offer Executive Sedans, SUVs, or even full limo transports to and from downtown or the airport.

===Parking===
If you are looking to park Downtown in a lot or garage, be sure to have a good idea of where to park. The '''Metro Owned Facilities''' managed by the '''Nashville Downtown Partnership''' (branded as '''ParkIt Downtown''') seems to be the best deal. For example, the '''Metro Courthouse/Public Square Garage''' is just $5 after 5pm & on weekends. This is much cheaper than nearby private lots. [http://www.parkitdowntown.com/parking/metro.php]

Taken by Union forces early in the war, Nashville quickly became second most fortified city in the U.S. during the Civil War because it was seen as crucial to supplying troops engaged on the war's western front. The 1864 Battle of Nashville -- a failed attempt by the Confederate army to retake the city -- raged throughout what are now the residential and commercial districts on the fringes of the city. Much of the work on the fort was done by slaves and freed blacks who were rounded up and forced to work on the structure.

==Eat==
Nashville has a great food scene, with Zagat rating it in the top 5 up and coming American food cities, but does not abandon Southern traditional favorites. Hot Chicken is a dish that originated here that has recently gained national attention and is a must for anyone looking to experience something unique to the city. Nashville is a great barbecue city, ranked number 6 by USnews and ranked number 1 by Travel and Leisure. Unlike nearby Memphis and North Carolina, however, Nashville does not have a particular style or cut of meat that defines its style, making it somewhat like a Southern Kansas City, and combining all different types of flavors to create a one of a kind barbecue taste. 

===Supermarkets===
The dominant local grocery chains in Nashville are Kroger, Publix, and Aldi. The city is also dotted with dozens of ethnic groceries, especially Hispanic, Kurdish, Indian and Vietnamese around Nolensville Pike. For organic and or specialty grocery stores both Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe's, and Fresh Market also have locations throughout the city.

The frosted haired waitresses will call you "honey," and the pancakes will be better than you'd ever realized pancakes could be. Don't be daunted by the line snaking around the block on weekends; it moves quickly, and you get free coffee while you wait.

* '''Rosepepper Grille and Cantina''', 1907 Eastland Ave, ''+1 615'' 227-4777, [http://rosepepper.com/]. A neighborhood favorite for several years now, this popular and upbeat nouveau Mexican place is in East Nashville, a bit off the tourist's beaten path.

* '''San Antonio Taco Company''', or ''SATCO'', 416 21st Ave S, ''+1 615'' 327-4322, [http://thesatco.com/]. Always a favorite with Vandy kids, offering reliably so-so Tex-Mex food (very little meat on the tacos, and the guacamole has tons of pepper) and cheap buckets of beer. Right off the Vanderbilt campus. Stop by Ben & Jerry's next door for dessert. Caveat: Towing in this area can be ruthless. Check the signs wherever you park. If you go, get the queso and chips for around $3. It's the best thing on the menu and is enough for 2.

When booking in the next few years, look for new accommodation options as many new hotels are opening around the city as a result of the economic boom. Some new choices include a Kimpton Hotel across from Vanderbilt University in midtown, a Thompson Hotel in the Gulch operated by Commune Hospitality, a 34 story Westin across from the Music City Center, a Tribute portfolio hotel near TPAC, a 21c museum hotel next to that hotel, a 35 JW Marriott approved for construction next to the Westin, and a possible Virgin hotel and Hard Rock Hotel opening in the near future.

==Stay safe==
Be careful and use good sense as you would anywhere else when visiting Nashville, TN. Although it is good to be cautious, in recent years it has been called one of the most livable places in the United States via magazines such as the New York Times and Travel and Leisure

North Nashville, the Bordeaux district, Is a VERY dangerous area that should be avoided at all costs, and contributes to over 90% of Nashville’s violent crime statistics. Always use caution when driving any area at night. Napier, Antioch and the Inglewood areas also are high in crime, but still relatively safe compared to North Nashville

While crime still does exist in the city, much of it has been either eliminated or concentrated to far away areas.
Unlike other downtown areas in similar cities such as Memphis, Downtown Nashville has become very safe, with rarely any crime reported due to the rapid development of the main road Broadway, and other areas such as the Gulch, SoBro, Germantown and West End. However, be cautious as you would be in any other city in terms of pickpocketing, small theft and sexual harassment and do not show off any overly valuable items while walking around. The Nashville Metro Police department has been praised as one of the best police forces in America due to their non-confrontational nature, so feel free to ask them for help.
