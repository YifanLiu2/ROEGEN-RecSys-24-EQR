Main St within walking distance of downtown, which features a wide array of shopping and dining (almost entirely local independent businesses).

==Drink==

Try the "Barmuda" triangle which consists of three dive bars arranged around a back lot between Main Street and Babcock at 8th ave.

'''The Scoop''' faces Main Street and must be one of the oldest bars in town.  A few pool tables, a few slot machines and TVs for the game. 

''' The Haufbrau''' is equally as old - if not older - but offers a small stage for locals and even a few out-of-towners to dish out their songcraft with anything from saws to buckets to fiddles or guitars.  Great, friendly crowd unless you arrive ''before'' the local rednecks get sloshed. Bringing up the rear of the troika would be 

'''The Molly Brown'''. It's the biggest of the three, with a pool hall, poker tables and a couple rows of slot machines.  Montana being one of those rare states that allows machine gambling, you might as well try your hand while passing through.  A quick fifteen bucks would not be unheard of, but a vanished fifty is far more likely.  All three of these bars are of ecclectic crowd; college students, montana hippies, construction workers, out-of-work ranchers, divorcees, and that one guy who operates under the illusion that cowboys still exist.
