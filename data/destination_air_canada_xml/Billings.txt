'''Billings''' is the largest city in [[Montana]], with an estimated 100,000 people. As a destination in itself, Billings does a significant amount of convention business and is also the host to various regional events such as music festivals, athletic contests, rodeos, and outdoor activities. Billings hosts the largest hospitals in a 500-mile radius, as such the medical profession is a major source of employment in the area.  Billings also is a frequent overnight or meal stop for westbound visitors to [[Yellowstone National Park]], as it is the last major city for visitors going to the park via the Beartooth Highway.
