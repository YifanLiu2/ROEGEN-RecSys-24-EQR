'''Bus''':Most parts of the city and suburbs are knitted together by this bus network run by the APSRTC. A local bus is generally referred to as a 'City bus', and can be boarded at numerous bus-stops spread all across the city. Most bus-stops do not have a timetable displayed,so you have to catch a bus simply by reading the nameplate on the top. Also,during rush hour (which is usually around 8.30 in the morning and 4.30 in the evening.The evening rush-hour may continue well until 7.30.) there tends to be a lot of hassle when a bus halts,with people trying to get on and off the same time. Overcrowded buses can be tedious and suffocating ,they are best avoided. If you have to take a bus at all, then better try boarding one that has enough room inside.
You have to purchase a ticket when you board a bus, and make sure you have the right amount of change on you.
The bus station is in Krishnalanka,and some city buses as well as buses that terminate there ply there. You can board a bus to almost any place in the Andhra Pradesh from here. You may also like the private buses, that connect the city with Guntur, Hyderabad, Vizag, Bangalore and Tirupati over a comfortable night-journey,though there are also options for the day-traveler. The tickets for these have to be booked at the offices of the operators.
