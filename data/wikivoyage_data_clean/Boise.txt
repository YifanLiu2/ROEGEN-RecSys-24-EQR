Not to be confused with Boise City, Oklahoma.
Boise is the capital and largest city of Idaho. Boise offers numerous recreational opportunities, including extensive hiking and biking in the foothills to the immediate north of downtown. Boise is a regional hub for jazz, theater, and indie music, and is home to several museums.
The Idaho State Capitol, looking north from Capitol Blvd.
Although its economic growth has its roots in agriculture, the city is now home to many high-tech firms, including Micron Technology. Related to Idaho's agricultural history, notable food-related firms such as Albertson's, WinCo Foods and the J.R. Simplot Company are headquartered in this city.
Although the origin of the name is disputed, "Boise" is thought to be derived from the French les bois, or "the woods." The name is a reference to the tree-lined Boise River, which passes through the heart of the city. To this day the city takes its "City of Trees" moniker very seriously, although before white settlement, there were actually very few trees in the area.
Boise began its life in the mid-1800s as Fort Boise, a U.S. Army installation located at a strategic junction on the Oregon Trail between what were then the major settlements in southern Idaho Territory, the mining camps of Silver City to the south and Idaho City to the northeast. A city grew quickly around the fort, and by 1865 became the capital of Idaho Territory (much to the chagrin of northern Idahoans, namely residents of the original capital of Lewiston). By the dawn of the 20th century, Boise was far and away the dominant city in the region, having long eclipsed the likes of Silver City and Idaho City.
Today Boise is sometimes seen as the eastern edge of the Pacific Northwest, or the western edge of the Rocky Mountains, or both, depending on whom you ask. Downtown Boise and the North End neighborhood offer a PNW feel every bit as strong as anything in Portland or Seattle, while suburbs such as Meridian and Nampa steadfastly cling to the decidedly self-reliant ethos of the Intermountain West.
Boise is a sports town strongly supporting its local teams, especially the ECHL Idaho Steelheads (which as of 2018 have never missed the playoffs in their entire history), and the college football powerhouse at Boise State University. Slowly but surely, Boise is beginning to accept its role as a major metropolitan area in the western United States, while at the same time embracing its small town past.
Regions of the city are best distinguished by the age of construction (pre-1950s, 1950s-1980s suburbs, and post-1990 suburbs) and the affluence of their inhabitants, with the premier exception being the downtown core, which primarily consists of non-residential corporate and nightlife establishments. The North End refers to a distinct neighborhood due to the grid style of street construction, smaller pre-1940s suburban houses, relatively dense vegetation, and numerous amenities within walking distance of most residents. Boise has no culturally discernible neighborhoods, although a few ethnic restaurants and food stores exist.
The name "Boise" is a shibboleth and is universally pronounced with the English "s" sound by locals like "Boy-see," as opposed to the common outsider pronunciation of an English "z" sound like "Boy-zee."

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Boise is one of the warmer spots in Idaho. It is always dry in terms of humidity, and it is relatively dry in terms of precipitation year round. There is much less rain than average for US cities, and a bit more snow than average. The rain mostly appears in cooler winter and spring months, but there is a chance of rain even at the driest point in the summer. When it does rain, it is rarely a torrential storm; when a whole inch of rain has fallen in one day, it usually sets a record that can remain unbroken for a century.
Mid-summer is a good time if your idea of a vacation is hanging out at the swimming pool. If you want to spend your visit outside under milder conditions, then consider late spring or September as pleasant moments in between the heat of summer and the winter's rain and ice. If you're camping, plan for overnight frosts from early November until the end of March. The temperature will go below the freezing point, but it rarely gets extremely cold, even after taking the wind chill factor into account. Speaking of wind, there's usually enough wind to fly a kite, with a bit more in late winter and spring than in the rest of the year. The Treasure Valley Kite Festival is usually scheduled for the end of April, in peak kite-flying season.
Boise Airport (BOI IATA), 3501 W Airport Way (terminal at the south end of S Vista Ave, off of I-84 at Exit 53). is less than 5 mi ( km) south of downtown Boise. It can be directly accessed from both directions of Interstate 84 at Vista Rd (Exit #53). Getting downtown from the airport is simple, essentially requiring driving in a straight line (i.e. north on Vista Avenue). The airport is serviced by several airlines, including Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, Jetblue, Southwest, and United.The airport sports a modern terminal building and offers free WiFi.Buses #3 and 4 run hourly from the airport to downtown Boise and further. It costs $1 or a daypass is $2. (updated Jun 2018)
Boise can be accessed by car via Interstate 84, which connects to Meridian, Nampa, and eventually Oregon to the west, and to Twin Falls and eventually Utah to the southeast.
Boise can also be accessed via State Highway 55 from McCall and Northern Idaho.
Boise can also be accessed via State Highway 21 from Idaho City, Stanley, and broadly into central Idaho.

Idaho is not known for public transportation, so most places outside the city center require a vehicle.
Valley Regional Transit. Routes are lacking compared to other cities of similar size. Make sure to check schedules since most buses do not run on Sundays and many stop running at 6:45PM. $/ride or $/day pass. (updated Apr 2024)
Cars can be rented at the Boise Airport from major rental companies including Hertz, Avis, and Enterprise. Traffic in Boise is relatively light and peaceful, especially compared to Seattle or Portland. But Boise is no stranger to heavy traffic in certain places. Interstate 184, Capitol Boulevard, Meridian Road, Eagle Road and State Street should be avoided during rush hours. Interstate 84 between I-184 and the Garrity Boulevard exit in Nampa (and sometimes into Caldwell) can be challenging as well. I-84 traffic in eastbound lanes is heavy in the morning, and in westbound lanes in the afternoon.
If I-84 is in bad shape, Ustick Road can be a smart alternative from Boise to Canyon County and vice versa, passing north of Nampa and south of Caldwell. Ustick runs unbroken for some 35 mi (56 km), from the Boise Bench neighborhood to U.S. Route 95 northeast of Homedale, close to the Oregon border. Victory Road provides a similar but more direct alternate route between south Boise and Nampa.
Traffic east of the Idaho City (State Highway 21/Federal Way) exit on I-84 from Boise towards Twin Falls is rarely - if ever - problematic. However, winter storms can make the Mountain Home area treacherous.
If you're going downtown, expect to pay to park even though parking meters aren't enforced on weekends or after 6PM. After hours you might get lucky finding a spot on the street, but chances are you'll be heading to a private parking garage and paying a $2 minimum. This is especially true on weekends. Fortunately, parking outside the downtown core (i.e. east of Broadway, south of Myrtle, west of 15th and north of State) is insanely easy - and almost certainly free 24-7.
Taxi service has been decimated by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Boise City Taxi is now little more than a network of Uber drivers. Taxis are still common at the airport, though.
Because the city is so spread out even traveling between neighborhoods can easily run over $20. During peak times, wait times for a cab can be upwards of 45-60 minutes. Companies and drivers must be licensed by the City of Boise. Established companies include:
ABC Cab Company, ☏ +1 208-344-4444. 24 hr. metered.
The Boise city center is extremely bicycle-friendly. The Boise Greenbelt is a paved pedestrian and bike path that stretches approximately 25 mi (40 km) from Lucky Peak Reservoir east of Boise all the way through town 1. For avid bikers and walkers, much of the river and Boise's parks can be accessed this way.
Cyclists should avoid main thoroughfares west of downtown, particularly Meridian Road and State Street west of 27th Street. Several bicycle-related fatalities have been recorded in those areas. Stick to side streets in Meridian and western Boise.

Big Jud's, 1289 Protest Rd, ☏ +1 208-343-4439. Not to be outdone and with a national reputation in its own right, Big Juds offers quite possibly the biggest hamburgers in the state. They have one-pound burgers, and yeah, they do doubles.

Boise has a surprisingly well-rounded nightlife, all stereotypes to the contrary, but once again, the best places to drink are all downtown. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, throngs of young women in midriff-baring outfits (no matter the weather) and young men strutting their stuff cruise downtown bars.
Boise bars may serve from 10AM-2AM daily, however some close earlier. All bars within Boise city limits are smoke-free, although smoking at bars is still permitted in nearby Garden City.

Red Feather Lounge. Sibling of next door's watering hole Bittercreek, these two bars/restaurants share a bathroom and a patio, but just about nothing else. Red Feather is a swanky, low-lit lounge with an amazing three story, award winning wine selection. Red Feather's menu emphasizes products that thrive in the southwest Idaho region. Both have freshly made cocktails and share an outdoor see-and-be-seen patio on the pedestrian friendly 8th street corridor.
Bardenay Restaurant and Distillery, 610 W Grove St, ☏ +1 208-426-0538. M 11AM-9PM, Tu-Th 11AM-10PM, F 11AM-11PM, Sa 10AM-11PM, Su 10AM-9PM.

Somewhere, 3544 W. Chinden Blvd (Corner of Chinden and Orchard), ☏ +1 609-202-4709. Daily 11AM-2AM. Gay bar.
Dirty Little Roddy's. Maybe a little what you might expect; Country music, sawhorse tables, peanuts and a mechanical bull that ladies can ride for free. You might not expect that this bar is popular with college kids and is nearly impossible to get into on a weekend night. It's in the basement, so be prepared to walk drunk up a narrow flight of stairs if you plan on spending any time here.
Mulligans. A typical would-be Irish dive bar with a very distinctive, but not altogether unpleasant smell. There's pool, of course, but also airhockey and foosball. And well shots sometimes. It's a great place to enjoy a drink on the patio and people-watch.
10th Street Station. Located in the basement of the Idanha Hotel (now apartments) you can experience the relaxed crowd, friendly staff, and charm of a former speakeasy. As long as you don't ask for a 'pint' (only 10 oz glasses are served) you'll be welcome to stay the night. They generally close at 1:30AM.
Neurolux. The stiffest drinks in Boise, bartenders here use a five-count pour, instead of the standard three-count. Arguably the best jukebox in town. The clientele are about as varied as their tastes in music, so nobody is judgmental of anyone else, just what's playing on the jukebox. This is the place for indie rock shows; the biggest bands played here before they played the arenas.
