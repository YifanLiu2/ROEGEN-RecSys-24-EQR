Guadalajara is the capital of the central state of Jalisco in Mexico, and the second-largest city in the country, with about a million and a half citizens (known as "Tapatíos"). It is considered a colonial city, though much of its architecture dates from the independence period. Although it has a far more relaxed feel than Mexico City, the city center can still seem a bit stuffy and dusty, especially during rush hour when the sun is out. All in all, however, it is a lovely city and contains many nice areas for walking, not just in the center.
Guadalajara is Mexico's second largest city, and one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the country. This growth has been driven in part by the booming electronics industry in the industrial outskirts of the city. Other important and growing industries are pharmaceuticals, food processing, and fashion.
Guadalajara proper is divided into four districts corresponding approximately to the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast quarters of the city. At the center of everything is the main area of interest to tourists, the Centro Histórico, or the historic downtown. Most of your time will probably be spent here. It is filled with colonial-era buildings and, famously, also boasts several important mural paintings by Jalisco-born José Clemente Orozco, one of Mexico's most important artists.
Outside the Centro Histórico are:
Sector Hidalgo— in northwest of the Centro Histórico, Hidalgo is a largely residential sector encompassing the financial district and the Country Club Guadalajara.
Sector Libertad— northeast of the Centro Histórico, Sector Libertad is mostly given over to industrial use. However, the southwest part of the sector, close to the Centro Histórico, boasts a traditional market (Mercado Libertad) and the Plaza de los Mariachis.
Sector Juárez— southwest of the Centro Histórico, Sector Juárez is a shoppers' paradise: it boasts two shopping malls (Centro Magno and Galerias), as well as the popular Minerva, Chapultepec, and Zona Rosa shopping areas.
Sector Reforma— southeast of the Centro Histórico, Reforma is also a mostly industrial sector, but visitors will no doubt be interested in the pleasant, tree-filled Parque Agua Azul, as well as the Tianguis Cultural de Guadalajara, a street market where alternative clothing and articles such as spiked belts, black trenchcoats, military uniforms, used books and trading cards are for sale at good prices.
Still further from central Guadalajara are several suburbs (municipios) that are cities in their own right. Several of these are also of interest to visitors, including:
Tlaquepaque — about 30 minutes by car southeast of the Centro Histórico, downtown Tlaquepaque is a charming streetscape redolent of old Mexico. An important arts and crafts center, Tlaquepaque has a vibrant shopping district where you can buy local pottery and handicrafts, as well as many lovely restaurants, art galleries, and a regional ceramics museum.
Tonalá — immediately east of Tlaquepaque, Tonalá contains Guadalajara's main bus station, handicraft shops and markets, and the large Parque Solidaridad.
Zapopan — a large, busy suburb southwest of Guadalajara, is famous for the old-fashioned charm of its downtown, its active nightlife fueled by the three large private universities within the city limits (Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara, Tecnológico de Monterrey and Universidad del Valle de Atemajac), its proliferation of modern shopping malls that will make American suburbanites feel right at home, and—by contrast—also large expanses of pristine nature, such as the Bosque de Colomos and the gargantuan Bosque La Primavera.
The 275-diagonal bus route runs from Tlaquepaque through the Centro to Zapopan, providing convenient access to all of these outer districts.
The co-founders of Guadalajara were Doña Beatriz de Hernández and Governor Cristobal de Oñate. In the Plaza de los Fundadores there is a monument in honor of both of them.
Guadalajara, and Jalisco in general, were the epicenter of the Cristero Wars (1926-1929) — a rebellion by Catholic guerrillas against the secularizing reforms of President Plutarco Calles. One of the first armed conflicts of the rebellion took place in Guadalajara in the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe on August 3, 1926, where a group of several hundred Cristeros engaged in a shootout with federal troops. Guadalajara was attacked (unsuccessfully) by the Cristero armies in March 1929.
In the 1950s, Avenida Juárez was widened to create today's arterial road of Juárez-Vallarta which you see today. A famous part of that work was the moving of the central telephone exchange without the disruption of service. Pictures of this feat of engineering can be seen in the City Museum (Museo de la Ciudad).
In April 1992, Sector Reforma was rocked by a huge explosion of gasoline, when a gasoline pipeline leaked into the sewers over a period of days until the fumes finally detonated. Some 200 Tapatíos were killed and several thousand injured. The explosion affected mostly the working-class and industrial areas on the south side of the city.
In May 1993, Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo of Guadalajara was killed at the Guadalajara airport. Though at the time the murder was thought to have been some sort of politically motivated assassination, subsequent investigations favor the theory that the cardinal was caught by mistake in drug-related violence, his motorcade having been mistaken for that of a drug lord. Cardinal Ocampo is buried beneath the high altar of the Catedral de Guadalajara, probably because it was first suspected that the motives for his murder were political, rather than accidental.
Aeropuerto Internacional de Guadalajara Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (GDL IATA) (south of city along the Guadalajara-Chapala Highway). Airlines serving GDL include AeroMexico, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Copa Airlines, Delta, United, VivaAerobus, and Volaris. (updated Jan 2017)
At the airport, always buy the taxi chit from the booth before exiting the terminal, then present it to the licensed driver. Many hotels offer airport pickups that can be cheaper.
Uber drivers are not allowed to pick up passengers at the airport. A common way to get around this limitation is to walk outside the airport a few minutes away to the nearby UPS distribution center (labeled as "Centro de Envios UPS" on Google maps). Set your Uber pick up location at this UPS center, which is outside the airport's restrictions and a driver will pick you up there.
The app Moovit finds a better bus connection from the airport to your accommodation than Google Maps (as of Dec 2021). The bus stops at the bottom of Terminal 1 and goes to the Old Bus Station close to the Centro Histórico and costs M$ (Dec 2021). To get to the bus station of the airport, take a right upon exiting the airport building and follow the signs to the "Terminal Terrestre." Walk past the police station and FedEx building. Pay when getting on the bus.
Guadalajara has two bus stations:
Central de Autobuses Guadalajara – This is the new main bus station in the suburb of Tonalá, which serves all long-distance routes (generally those which leave the state of Jalisco). From this bus station to the Centro Histórico it's convenient by the subway or e-hailing.
Old Bus Station (Antigua Estación Central de Autotransporte) – Just south of downtown and is served by bus lines to nearby pueblos such as Tequila and Chapala. The buses themselves are very comfortable.
If you come from León and want to take a second-class van to Guadalajara: Roll&bits has daily rides for about M$200 (May 2022). Just book your ticket online on their website. The vans have a big trunk for luggage.
From and to Puerto Vallarta it's around M$300 (Nov 2021) on Blablacar.
Federal Highway 15 (Carretera Federal 15) connects Guadalajara with Mexico City to the east.
The Centro (downtown) is best accessible by walking. Most attractions lie within an area of about 1 km long by 350 m wide. For longer trips, or to get in and out of the Centro, use the bus, subway or a taxi. There are also horse-drawn carriages (calandrias), which are more expensive and touristy.
Uber, Cabify and Didi cover the city.
For finding connections, Moovit and Google Maps cover the city including the subway. Regular buses cost M$ (Dec 2021). You can pay with the public transport card or in cash. You don't get change. If paying with a bill, you can fold it and push it through the coin slot inside the bus.
The bus stops are shown in Google Maps or when calculating a route with Moovit. Not all bus stops have a signpost with a blue sign and a picture of a bus as well as triangular markings on the road with the word parada (bus stop).
Some bus lines show a different bus line number on their destination screen. When you wait for a bus, check the destination screen, the windshield and on the left of the front door, whether it's your bus line. It might be good to always ask the bus driver if he goes to your destination.
Dozens of bus routes provide transportation around the city. There are also luxury buses (Turquesa, Tour and Cardenal). Look on the front window of the bus to determine its destination, and ask the driver if you're uncertain.
Riding the bus also provides a good chance to see different parts of the city and get your bearings. Bus drivers will give you change within limits, though after even a day in Guadalajara you might find more 10-peso pieces in your pocket than you can dispose of.
Metropolitan Area Mass Transit System (Sistema de Transporte Colectivo de la Zona Metropolitana). Alternatively, try Busca Tu Ruta (Search for Your Route).
Map of the Tren Ligero system
One particularly useful method for getting back and forth between the Centro Histórico and the Zona Rosa/Minerva area is the Guadalajara Trolley Bus (Trolebús de Guadalajara). Westbound trolleys travel along Avenida Vallarta; eastbound trolleys along Avenida Hidalgo. Just look overhead for the pair of electrical power cables. In the Centro Histórico you can catch the Trolebús on Avenida Hidalgo up to the east side of the Plaza de la Liberación, where it makes the turn to head up to Calzada Independencia and back west.
There is also an open-top double-decker tourist bus (TuriBus) that leaves from the Rotunda and will take you past all the main sites in Guadalajara, Tlaquepaque and Zapopan. Riders can get on and off the bus at will all day long, for a flat rate.
Taxis are another option if you don't want to try to figure out the buses. You can either agree on a price with the cab driver or ask him to turn the meter on. Using the latter option, there is a risk that the driver won't the take the shortest possible route if he thinks you don't know it yourself. The meter will normally be a better price than the price the hotel will tell you to pay if they call you a cab. As always, be sure to ask the fare before you get in. Cabs cost more at night or when they have to cross the outer ring (Anillo Periférico) of the city. At night, the prices are doubled. If the driver is using a meter, there's also a starting price.
Fares to and from the airport are set. If arriving at the Guadalajara airport, a taxi monopoly provides the service from the airport. Pay for your taxi ride at the booths outside of the arrival halls. You can take a normal taxi to the airport, though.
There is a light-rail subway system (the Tren Ligero) that can be useful for travelers who are headed where the trains go. There are two lines that meet at the western edge of the Centro Histórico, and a third line that runs diagonally across the city. One runs north-to-south beneath Avenida Federalismo to the edges of the city in both directions. The second runs west-to-east through the Centro Histórico to the eastern suburbs, and the third runs diagonally across the city from Zapopan in the northwest to Tlaquepaque in the southeast.
The fare is M$ (Dec 2021). You can pay with the public transport card or by cash at the machine: For the latter just push on the blue button on the screen. The machine does not give you change. The subway closes at 23:00.
A public transport card costs M$30 (Dec 2021) and can be purchased e.g. at a ticket machine of a subway station. It can be used for the metro, bus and bikesharing.
A new bus service named Pre-Tren ("Pre-Train") extends from the main subway station (Juárez) through the Zona Rosa to the west Anillo Periférico at a 50% discounted fare for subway card users. Pre-Trenes provide a good service with air-conditioned, red-colored units. The service is better than the smaller buses (camiones).
You may also rent a car from airport, most major car rental companies such Avis, National Car Rental, City Car Rental,Hertz and Europcar have booths at the baggage claim area. There are also some local car rentals such as Veico Car Rental and Mobix Car Rental just outside the airport that also have good cars and often lower prices.

Cross of Plazas (Cruz de Plazas). These four plazas are laid out in the form of a cross, with the Catedral at the center. Any of them offer a nice spot to walk through or rest in for a few minutes, and most have plenty of food vendors nearby. The plazas that make up the Cross are:
Plaza Guadalajara (West of the cathedral, between Av. Hidalgo and Calle de Morelos, Zona Centro). Located directly in front of the cathedral, Plaza Guadalajara contains a circular fountain and an outdoor restaurant. Under the fountain there is an underground commercial center which offers all kinds of goods for sale including fruit, beverages and jewelry.
Plaza de Armas (south of the cathedral, between Calle de Morelos and Calle Pedro Moreno, Zona Centro). Plaza de Armas offers one of the best views of the cathedral, as well as the Government Palace.

Rotunda of Illustrious Jaliscans (Rotonda de los Jaliscienses Ilustres) (north of the cathedral, between Av. Hidalgo and Calle Independencia, Zona Centro). This lovely circular monument of fluted columns is a mausoleum containing the ashes of 98 important men and women born in Jalisco.

The current towers were replaced on 1854 by architect Manuel Gómez Ibarra after an earthquake destroyed the originals in 1818. While visiting the Cathedral, a must-see is the mural "The Immaculate Conception" (La Purísima Concepción) by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. Also here is the Museo de Arte Sacro. The cathedral's architecture is an eclectic mix of the Gothic, Neoclassical and Palladian styles. (updated Jul 2017)

Plaza de los Mariachis, Av. Javier Mina at Calz. Independencia Sur, San Juan de Dios. The official name of this small triangular plaza is Plaza Pepe Guizar, named for the composer who was responsible for the song "Guadalajara". However, its popular name comes from the mariachi bands who, for a small fee, will serenade you while enjoying the restaurants and bars around the square (a word of warning, though: this neighborhood becomes sketchy after dark). The Plaza de los Mariachis is where the famous Mexican Hat Dance (Jarabe Tapatío) was born.

The municipalities of Tlaquepaque and Tonala to the southeast of Guadalajara are essentially suburbs, though they retain muc of their small-town charm. They had similar origins in originally being settlements of indigenous tribes with a pottery industry and were overtaken by the Spanish conquistador Nuño de Guzmán in 1530. Tlaquepaque also hosted Miguel Hidalgo on his way to Guadalajara in the Mexican War of Independence. Today the hallmark feature of these places is still pottery, though shops with furniture, textiles and other handicrafts are plentiful.

Map of the region around Guadalajara
You can make a sightseeing tour in a very economically and animal friendly carriage. These are not powered by a horse, instead by a battery like an electric car. The start is at the cathedral. Prices are M$300 for half an hour, M$400-500 for a whole hour (Dec 2021).
Guadalajara's sports culture is one of the most vibrant in Mexico, with a well-developed infrastructure of stadiums and facilities, achievements under its belt such as its successful turn as the host of the 2011 Pan-American Games, world-class athletes such as professional golfer Lorena Ochoa calling the city home, and big plans for the future. Guadalajara is also home to many ballet schools surrounding the metropolitan area.
Of course, one would be remiss in talking about Guadalajara sports without mentioning the three professional football (futbol, i.e. what Americans call soccer) teams based there: Estudiantes, Atlas, and of course, Chivas. Chivas, more properly known as Club Deportivo Guadalajara, is, according to FIFA, the most popular football team in Mexico. Chivas has won 11 first-division titles and holds the longest-ever season-opening winning streak: 8 back-to-back wins. Chivas is also the only football team in Mexico with exclusively Mexican players, whereas other teams have players of varying nationalities. The team colors are red, white, and blue, signifying "Fraternity, Union, and Sports". The new stadium, Estadio Akron, with a capacity of 49,850, was inaugurated in 2010.
Estadio Akron (formerly Estadio Omnilife), Circuito JVC 2800, Ayamonte, Zapopan, ☏ +52 33 3777 5700. This is the stadium where most of the outdoor events for the 2011 Pan-American Games were held, and—more importantly—where the most popular football team in the city and the whole country, Club Deportivo Guadalajara (Chivas), has played since 2010. Chivas plays here every other Saturday at 19:00, unless otherwise specified. If you happen to be in Guadalajara on a Saturday, you are most likely to find either a Chivas football game in this stadium, or an Atlas game at Estadio Jalisco (below). Big games to watch out are Chivas vs. Atlas (which can be held in either stadiums depending on which one is scheduled as the home team) and Chivas vs. América—the "National Superclassic" (superclásico nacional)—as these teams are bitter rivals. Either of these match-ups are sure to sell out the stadium and treat those lucky enough to get tickets to an intense atmosphere. Estadio Akron is a difficult place to reach by public transport. It is close to the Periférico Oriente, so taking a taxi is the best option. Alternatively, use any bus that will go around Periférico and you'll eventually get there, just ask the driver to let you know when you are there, since the stadium's visibility from Periférico is very limited.
Estadio Jalisco (Jalisco Stadium), Siete Colinas 1772, Independencia, ☏ +52 33 3637 0563. It's in Colonia Independencia, and can be reached by taking any bus along the Calzada Independencia and asking for the Estadio Jalisco. You will almost definitely see it if you look out, it will be on your left as you come from the center. Here the football team Atlas plays. Chivas used to play on this stadium until 2010, when Estadio Omnilife was completed. During the season there are league games every other Saturday. If Atlas is playing as a visitor, then you can look for a Chivas game at Estadio Omnilife. A big game to watch out for is Atlas vs. Chivas, which has an incredible atmosphere, though most games are worth experiencing. If you are of a nervous disposition, perhaps avoid the upper stands when there is a large crowd as it's known to shake when the crowds begin to jump.
Estadio Tres de Marzo (March 3rd Stadium), Patria 1201, Villa Universitaria, Zapopan, ☏ +52 33 3610 1834. The Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara's football stadium in the north of the city, where "Los Estudiantes" play, is named for the date of the founding of the university in 1935. The Estudiantes play in the Primera Liga along with the other Guadalajara teams, Atlas and Chivas.
Guadalajara hosts teams in both of Mexico's major professional leagues. Both play in the Estadio los Charros de Jalisco in the suburban municipality of Zapopan. The stadium was built in 2011 for the Panamerican Games and is often referred to as Estadio Panamericana, though it was purchased by the Charros.
Estadio Los Charros de Jalisco (Estadio Panamericano), Calle Sta. Lucía 373, Tepeyac, Zapopan (use bus or taxi (no on-site parking)). Modern, state-of-the-art baseball stadium that is home field for both the Charros de Jalisco (Pacific League, winter) and the Mariachis de Guadalajara (Mexican League, summer). The stadium is modern with unobstructed sight lines. Small, intimate park seating just 8,000 fans. Very clean and comfortable. Beware: Inconvenient, fan-hostile payment policies.

Bullfights take place at the Plaza Nuevo Progreso every Sunday at 16:30.

Mariachi bands from all over Mexico and the world meet the last week of August and the first week of September, usually at Teatro Degollado and the surrounding area, to play and compete for the delight of fans. You won't witness anything like this unique event anywhere else.
Independence Day (Día de la Independencia). Visitors who find themselves in Guadalajara on 16 September are in for a festive and patriotic treat. One traditional way that Tapatíos enjoy celebrating this holiday is with a reenactment of the "Cry of Pain" (Grito de Dolores), the incident that, in 1810, kicked off the war that ended with Mexico's independence from Spain. At the stroke of midnight, locals go to the main square and shout out in unison: half yell "Viva" and the other half "México", going on to the names of important heroes of Mexican history: "Viva Hidalgo", "Viva Morelos", and so on.
Pilgrimage of Our Lady of Zapopan (Romería de la Virgen de Zapopan). Celebrated in Guadalajara on 12 October, this event honors the local Virgin Mary figure of the Guadalajara area, the Virgen de Zapopan.

This festival is only celebrated in the Guadalajara area, and is one of the largest examples of a romería outside Spain.
International Book Fair (Feria Internacional del Libro). The "FIL" takes place every November in Guadalajara. Companies and delegations come from all over the world to exhibit their books and see books from other places. Every year a country or region serves as the guest of honor, presenting books that represent its particular literary tradition.
Christmas (Navidad). A Tapatío Christmas tradition that you may witness if you're in Guadalajara over the holidays is known as "Las Posadas" (The Inns). Children parade through the neighborhood recreating the passage of Joseph and Mary through Bethlehem, asking for shelter and being refused. Generally nowadays this is a celebration for family and friends, but if you know a Mexican, it's a great way to experience Mexican culture firsthand. Regular appearances include piñatas, mariachi bands, Mexican beer, tequila and general merriment.
Foundation of Guadalajara (Fundación de Guadalajara). Held on February 14th, this is a celebration to commemorate the foundation of the city of Guadalajara on that day in 1542.
Tequila – 65km in the west. Situated in a picturesque countryside setting, it's perhaps the quintessential Guadalajara side trip, and is the best place to sample Mexico's favorite liquor. The Jose Cuervo distillery has a packaged tour that will pick you up from your hotel, take you to an agave farm, then to the distillery for a tour with free samples and a gift shop, then gift you with vouchers for a free margarita and 10% off at a local restaurant. The city itself is also quaint and worth exploring. Tequila is easily accessible by bus (about 90 minutes one-way), and many hotels organize excursions there for their guests. However, perhaps the most charming way of getting to Tequila is the Tequila Express, a charming tourist railroad complete with tequila shots and roving mariachis. The train leaves Guadalajara's train station Sa & Su 10:00, returning the same evening.}}
Laguna de Chapala – 50 km in the south. It's the main regional vacation spot, a lovely lake surrounded by picturesque towns such as Chapala and Ajijic (the latter of which has a sizeable gringo expat community).

On the way back the bus departs hourly 15 min after the full hour from Chapala.
Guachimontones. 65 km in the west. A pre-Columbian archaeological site near the town of Teuchitlán, about an hour west of Guadalajara, that dates to the period between 300 BC and 900 AD and is known for its unique circular stepped pyramids.

Parque Bicentenario Puente de Calderon (off Route 80 east of Zapotlanejo). 07:00-18:00 daily. 45 km in the east. This 17th-century stone bridge was the site of the key Battle of the Bridge of Calderón in 1811 in the Mexican War of Independence. (updated Dec 2020)
The Universidad de Guadalajara, often referred to simply as "U de G", is the most important institution of higher learning in western Mexico, and the second most important in the country after Mexico City's mammoth UNAM.

Guadalajara offers many language schools for the fast growing need for learning Spanish.

The shopping scene in Guadalajara is centered around two opposing faces of Latin American culture: traditional open-air markets (tianguis) and the modern shopping plazas and malls that, more and more, are sprouting up around the outskirts of town. The latter can be found in particular proliferation southwest of the Centro Histórico in Sector Juárez, as well as in suburban municipios such as Zapopan.
A refreshing exception to this rule is the historic downtown district of Tlaquepaque, southeast of Guadalajara proper. This area is characterized by a lively collection of shops centered on the pedestrian-only streets, Calle Independencia and Avenida Juárez. Emphasized in these charming shops are arts and handicrafts of all kinds: one-of-a-kind handmade furniture, textiles, jewelry, paintings, sculptures, glassware, home decor, and even chocolate.
These temporary open-air street markets or bazaars are a Mexican tradition dating back to the Aztec days, and are a great way to get up close and personal with local culture at its most real—and score some bargains in the process. Some of the biggest tianguis in Guadalajara include:
Guadalajara Cultural Tianguis (Tianguis Cultural de Guadalajara), Plaza Benito Juárez, corner Av. Wáshington and Av. 16 de Septiembre, Zona Centro. Sa 07:00-19:00. Popular especially with young people, the Tianguis Cultural is not only a great place to buy clothes and music, but also to catch free open-air concerts, mingle, see and be seen.
Liberty Market (Mercado Libertad), Javier Mina 52, San Juan de Dios, ☏ +52 33 3618 0506. Daily 06:00-20:00.

The market also houses a very popular and very good food court featuring everything from seafood to local favorites like birria (goat stew) and pozole (hominy and pork stew). It's a great place to get souvenirs. Unfortunately, it isn't the safest place in town, so make sure to always keep on the lookout for purse-snatchers.
Tianguis el Baratillo, Calle Juan R. Zavala 38, Santa María. Su 07:30-15:00. The largest tianguis in Guadalajara, this market sells anything and everything—tools, furniture, food, clothes and accessories, kitchenware, toys, and all manner of other articles—with an emphasis on used items sold at great bargains (hence its name El Baratillo, which roughly translates as "The Flea Market").

Clothes and electronics can be bought here, and there are also convenience stores and a supermarket. Served by bus routes 24, 25, 604, 622, 632, 634 and 701.
In rare cases this may happen towards foreign tourists: For example, when trying to get some tacos or a burger or something from a street food vendor, the vendor will tell you not to worry about the price, and when it's time to pay you will get an inflated bill. Be sure to ask for the price before you order. If the vendor tells you not to worry about the price, say "necesito saber" (I need to know). Of course, do this with a smile and you will not be ripped off.
Birria, tortas ahogadas, and chilaquiles are some of the most traditional Tapatío dishes.
Mercado Libertad – The food court is a good place to sample the variety of local specialties. You can go eat here multiple times, as there is a big variety of cooked meals. You can also find Chinese and Japanese dishes. The majority of the food stalls has price tags. Most vendors let you walk through the food court without disturbing you. The prices are low. It's open daily from 8:00-20:00.
Birria is a savory stew made of roast chiles, spices and traditionally goat meat, though you will usually be given other meat options like mutton or beef depending on the restaurant. For birria, the restaurants in the Nueve Esquinas area (a few blocks south of Templo San Francisco) are popular and reliably good.
Tortas ahogadas (literally "drowned sandwiches") are elongated sandwiches on birote bread, akin to submarines or po' boys, smothered in a savory chile and tomato sauce. Numerous restaurants in the Centro Histórico specialize in these.
Pozole is a hearty soup of pork and hominy topped with fresh cabbage, radish, onion and cilantro. There are some very good pozole stands in the food court of the Mercado Libertad.
Mollete. Popular for breakfast among locals, this is a French-style roll split and covered with refried beans, then topped with ham or chorizo and cheese and toasted.
Tamales consist of pockets of masa (a starchy dough of corn flour) filled with mole (a sauce or gravy made from any of an infinite combination of chili peppers, spices, and chocolate) and the choice of chicken or pork. Most people make tamales for holidays such as Christmas, the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), Independence Day, or New Year's Day.
Enchiladas are a corn or flour tortilla rolled around and filled with meat, cheese, vegetables and/or potatoes and covered with spicy chile sauce, dressed variously in sour cream and/or cheese.
In addition to traditional Mexican specialties, Tapatíos seem to be especially fond of Italian food—a considerable number of restaurants of that type can be found around Guadalajara. If you miss American fast food, worry not: in addition to the restaurants listed here, Guadalajara has 14 McDonald's outlets.
In the centro and Americana district you find several low priced restaurants and eateries, even more in the streets around the eatery El Vegano Urbano (in the west of the Centro and in the east of Americana). To find a low priced place to eat near your accommodation, you can search in Google Maps for "cheap restaurant" and filter by price ('$' symbol).

Guadalajara has a vibrant nightlife that's spread out all over the city, from the touristy places in the Centro Histórico (Plaza de la Liberación is a good place to start your search) to the college bars in Zapopan. However, perhaps the most active bar district in Guadalajara is centered along Avenida Chapultepec between Hidalgo and Niños Héroes, about 2 km west of the Centro Histórico. This is the place where GDL's hipster crowd makes the scene, with bar after bar lining the sides of the streets. Many of these places double as popular live music venues.
A good suggestion is to search out a bar with a large collection of tequilas and taste a great blanca, reposada and añejo. If you ask for a traditional tequila from Los Altos, you will almost certainly get something good. Los Altos is the region northeast of Guadalajara where the best tequila in the world is made, bringing up images of tradition, patriotism and individualism.

In operation since 1986, this colonial-style hotel is a few blocks from the storied Teatro Degollado and is centered on two covered courtyards.

Guadalajara is known as one of the safest cities in Mexico. Nonetheless, as in any large city, the usual precautions should be taken. Crimes against tourists and foreign students are quite infrequent and mostly take the form of purse-snatching. Criminals usually work in teams and target travelers in outdoor restaurants, bars and other busy places. Should anyone spill something on you, be alert to your surroundings and step away—accidental spills are a common method of distracting their marks.
Never carry illegal substances with you; Mexican police are very strict regarding these cases.
Due to the intense rivalry between local club Chivas and Mexico City-based Club América, you should avoid wearing Club América jerseys in Guadalajara unless you want to risk getting singled out for harassment or worse by local fans.
