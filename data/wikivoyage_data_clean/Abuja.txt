Abuja is the capital of Nigeria. Because most Nigerian government agencies are now headquartered in Abuja and most other countries' embassies have been relocated from Lagos to Abuja, it is a surprisingly expensive city.
Abuja is very beautiful. One of few purpose-built cities in the world planned and built from scratch, it has an excellent road network, a beautiful rolling terrain and modern Nigerian architecture. However, power is often erratic.
It is part of the Federal Capital Territory and one of the six local area councils, formally known as the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC). It is surrounded by the other councils which include Kuje, Gwagwalada, Kwali, Bwari, and Abaji. Majority of government institutions headquarters and offices are located in Abuja, mostly in Garki and the Central Business District.
The National Assembly, which the legislative arms of the government, is located in Maitama.
Abuja is one of the world's fastest-growing cities, and the exact population is uncertain. The capital territory had  million inhabitants as of 2016.

Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport (ABV IATA). Several airlines offer international flights, notably, Lufthansa, KLM, British Airways, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines. Many visitors arrive on connecting flights from Lagos. (updated Jul 2022)
While the industry is being overhauled and aviation safety is being upgraded, only a few local airlines are reliable: AeroContractors, Arik Air, Air Peace, Max air and Dana Air. The quasi-government-owned Arik Air has frequent flights from many domestic locations. Air Peace, Max air and Dana Air are private airlines but operate quite a few routes into Abuja as well.
From the airport, take the official Green Cab. Board the cab with only people you know. Uber operates here as well. The Abuja light rail system connects the airport with the city centre. Bolt (formerly Taxify) also operates extensively within the city and off rides to and fro the airport. The airport is quite a distance from the main city. There are also private shuttle services offered to customers in the city.
You can travel to Abuja by bus from major cities like Lagos, Benin, Kano and Port Harcourt. Reliable services include: ABC Transport (with air conditioned luxurious bus rides), Ekene Dili Chukwu, Chisco Transport (CTN) and Young Shall Grow. The preferred bus service would be ABC transport. These are for purposes of moving from other parts of the country to Abuja.
Take day trip buses from wherever you are coming from in the country because part of the interstate roads are not maintained and full of potholes. And also the issue of being attacked by robbers by night. If you're unfamiliar with the country, take a bus with an escort. Buses allow you to appreciate the terrain, the towns and cities and the subtle changes in these and culture as you drive towards the capital either from the South or the North.
Bus shuttles have been banned in the city. You may find few buses that ply the outskirts of the city. Motorcycles (popularly known as Okada) has been banned as well but can be found in the slums and lowly areas.
Nigeria Railway Corporation has completed an inter-city line between Abuja and Kaduna, where you can connect with the rest of the Nigerian rail system. Trains arrive and depart from  Idu Station which is about 15 km west of the city centre. As of 2018, there are four daily departures in each direction. The train service offers three types of fares: Economy, First Class and Sleeper. The schedules and current fairs can be found on the Nigeria Railway Corporation website.
There is a light rail connection from the railway station to the centre.
Car or taxi is the main mode of getting around Abuja: public transport is limited. However, the Abuja Light Rail provides service mainly on the west side of the city, and provides connections between the city, rail station and the airport.
Abuja has a few strict driving laws that are enforced by different bodies of the government. The prominent road traffic and driving control enforcement bodies include VIO, FRSC, the Police. Seat belts are required of the driver and front seat passenger. The vehicle can be impounded and not released until the fine is paid. It will be helpful to have your papers updated as to avoid getting into trouble. Drivers don't typically observe lanes within the city, and often attempt to squeeze in what might seem to be dangerously close to your vehicle. In some cases they may drive on the sidewalks. However these happen mostly where there are no law enforcement officers present. Observation of traffic laws and traffic lights by drivers is higher in the city than in any other part of the country. Occasionally, drivers from other parts of the country that are unfamiliar with the driving culture in the city try to beat traffic lights. If you're driving, keep an eye out for other motorists, especially at intersections, who may try to beat the traffic lights. Occasionally, traffic lights stop working during outages and road marshals are deployed to critical intersections.
Abuja is a beautiful city. The tourist attractions are:
Aso Rock. A 400m monolith and the city's most noticeable feature.
Millennium Tower. Topped out in 2015, this 160-m tower is quite amazing. It is a part of the National Cultural Centre, which is under construction as of 2017.

National Church of Nigeria (National Christian Centre). A large inter-denominational church built in a neo-Gothic style.

Abuja tends to be a sharp contrast against the background of the rest of Nigeria. While car hijackings and armed robbery are high in Lagos, and kidnapping of foreign oil workers is prevalent in the Niger delta, Abuja, in sharp contrast, is one of the safest metropolitan cities on the continent.
General security measures like elsewhere in the world should be observed. Like anywhere else in the world, it's always a good idea to have company when exploring unfamiliar places. If you're driving, observe simple measures like keeping your car door locked when parked to avoid opportunistic crime. Armed robbery at gun point is the most prevalent form of crime. A calm disposition and full cooperation with robbers is the best line of action in the unlikely event that you are the victim of a robbery.
Robbers tend to become violent when victims try to pull tricks. Contact your embassy in Abuja and the police if you are robbed. Occasional pick pockets target mobile phones and wallets as well. Do not carry large amounts of cash. Usually, US$250 cash (or ₦30,000) would more than suffice for impulsive purchases and other daily costs.
When moving in Abuja, as a foreign visitor, you are best advised to use the official Green Cabs. There's a remote chance that privately operated unofficial cabs could be traps. Cab fares would be around ₦500 for trips within the city. Cab rides to the airport are significantly higher. Negotiate a fare before you enter a cab.
There have been reports of fraudulent use of credit card details almost immediately after people have used their cards to pay hotel deposits, even in the very top hotels.
