Minsk (Belarusian: Мінск, Russian: Минск) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Belarus. Its population is about two million people in 2021.
For many years after the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, Minsk and Belarus, in general, had a reputation of a Soviet experience park. In the late 2010s, this stereotype started losing its relevance: Minsk offers reliable and affordable public transport, plentiful hotels, convenient banking, and shopping and dining that international tourists will find familiar. The quality and number of sightseeing opportunities have improved remarkably too. Still, the Soviet past — Stalinist architecture and socialist street art, old-style canteens and department stores — exists alongside the renovated churches, fancy restaurants, hipster joints and tourist sightseeing traps. This makes Minsk an attractive destination for those who look for new experiences.
Minsk is one of the oldest Belarusian cities. Its age is counted from 1067, when it was mentioned in a medieval chronicle for the first time. In the 13th century, Minsk peacefully joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By the middle of the 16th century, it was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It suffered badly during the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667) and the Great Northern War (1700–1721). Minsk was annexed by Russia in 1793. It enjoyed a speedy development throughout the 19th century as one of the provincial centres of the Russian Empire. By the end of the 19th century, the city had over 90,000 inhabitants, with Jews constituting more than half of its population. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians, Poles and Belarusians. Ethnic Belarusians dominated in rural areas on the country.
In the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Soviet Communists, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnius. The First World War devastated Minsk. By 1915, it was a battle-front city.
The first attempt at an independent Belarusian state, the Belarusian Democratic Republic, was made in Minsk in March 1918. In 1919, Minsk became the capital city of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, BSSR, one of the founders of the Soviet Union (1922-1991). Minsk was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941-1944. Before the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After the war, Minsk was almost completely rebuilt. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Many magnificent and precious buildings, including churches and synagogues, were lost in the post-war decades of disregard to the pre-Socialist past.
Minsk is increasingly more confident in being the capital city of a country in the very centre of Europe. It is becoming better connected and more open, both economically and culturally. In return, it makes Minsk more attractive to all kinds of visitors, not only those who are after the quirkiest experiences.

Period passes and carnets from Minsktrans are not valid on minivans.

Minsk is a safe and clean city. If you are in need of assistance, there is a strong police presence in the downtown area. Emergency medical help can be accessed 24/7, either in designated hospitals or by phone.
All Minsk Metro stations are equipped with security scanners and police are always present there. Passengers with large bags and, particularly, backpacks, are routinely asked to submit their belongings for scanning. The procedure is quick and the police are usually polite. Both the police and Metro staff keep an eye on not letting drunk passengers in, particularly in the evening. Even if you are tipsy, be prepared to answer about your destination station and address. Alternatively, use a taxi, buses, trolleybuses and trams.
The Belarusian law prohibits taking photographs of the government buildings. Locals tell stories of tourists approached by officials after attempting to photograph the monumental KGB headquarters on Praspiekt Niezaliežnasci.
Attending political and any protests may not be safe for tourists. Even bystanders may be detained by uniformed and plain cloth police. The judge is likely to accept the police story.
Belarus is safe for LGBT travellers most of the time. Belarusian law neither recognises nor bans same-sex relationships; it has some provision for transgender people. Homophobic and transphobic abuse is not recognised as a specific hate crime; any such incidents would be treated as generic hooliganism. This has its impact on society: most people would not mind having LGBT people around but would regard any explicit signs of affection disturbing. This may also lead to violence. In the past, there were reports of vigilante groups using dating apps; the police challenged those crimes. Taking reasonable precautions should be enough to stay safe.
The Belarusian law prohibits the distribution of pornography. While it is not used to routinely police people's belongings and video-streaming habits, there were odd cases of prosecuting Belarusian citizens for posting explicit content on social media and even in password-protected profiles.
The enforcement of road safety for pedestrians and drivers by the traffic police is often ruthless, so observing traffic lights and crossings are well-engraved in Belarusians' behaviour. As a rule, drivers always give the way to pedestrians crossing the road in the designated places.
There is a pharmacy in the basement level at the Central Railway Station. The pharmacy staff do not speak English so it's preferred to have a Russian or Belarusian speaker with you, or have something written in Cyrillic.

Language may be a barrier for tourists to a certain extent. Virtually all Belarusians speak or understand both Belarusian and Russian; the latter remains the default means of communication. Increasingly more young people speak English and many of them will be eager to practice it. The older generation is unlikely to understand English. It is wise for visitors to learn some key phrases in Russian or Belarusian. Also, being familiar with the Cyrillic alphabet used both by Belarusian and Russian is essential for travelling without a guide. Many street signs and notices in public transport in Minsk are transliterated into the Latin alphabet. A confusion may arise as names of landmarks, objects etc. may be transliterated either from Belarusian (as the current official practice requires, however it is not strictly enforced) or Russian; to add to the confusion, the old practice of translating geographical names still has a place. As the result, Плошча Перамогі (Площадь Победы in Russian) may be referred to in publications as Plošča Pieramohi (or Pieramohi Square, transliteration from Belarusian), Pobedy Square (transliteration from Russian) or Victory Square (direct translation). There is no an easy way to completely avoid this confusion, but be aware of the possibility that the same place can have a different name depending on the primary language of the speaker. There is more coverage of this issue in the Belarusian phrasebook and links from there.

Most Belarusian trains are cheap, comfortable and reliable. Some destinations are served by high-speed services, but slow overnight sleepers are widely available as well. Minibuses (maršrutka in Belarusian, маршрутка) is the most common local and intercity transportation used by Belarusians. They are not always less comfortable, but quick and cheap. You can also rent a car.
