Zhanjiang was a small fishing port when it was under French occupation in the early 20th century. French colonizers forced the Qing Dynasty to agree for a 99-year lease in 1899 (in a manner similar to what British colonizers did with Hong Kong's New Territories) and renamed the city as Fort Bayard — some old colonial buildings still survive. That said, mismanagement and fierce competition with other neighbouring cities failed to create another Hong Kong for the French, and they returned Zhanjiang to China in 1946 due to unprofitability. In 1964, Zhanjiang began its development into a naval base owing to its geographic importance, and this also enabled Zhanjiang's heavy industrial development. Now it is a rapidly developing modern city and the gateway to Hainan by car and railway.
Cantonese is the main language spoken in Zhanjiang, albeit with a distinctive accent. Nevertheless, if you are fluent in standard Cantonese, this shouldn't pose too much of a challenge. The local language in Leizhou is Leizhouhua (雷州话 Léizhōuhuà), a member of the Min family of Chinese dialects that is closely related to Hainanese, though not mutually intelligible. Most younger locals are able to speak Mandarin as well, though often with a heavy accent.
Zhanjiang is at the base of the Leizhou Peninsula that points toward the island province of Hainan. Travellers often pass through Zhanjiang en route to Hainan. There are trains and buses to and from nearby mainland cities and boats to Haikou, capital of Hainan. The boat is an hour's bus ride away from Zhanjiang.
There are two major train stations and a small airport that service Zhanjiang. Buses also run daily to most nearby cities. The downtown bus terminal next to the downtown train station (end of Jiefang West Rd) has one bus daily to Kaiping at 14:00.
Zhanjiang Railway Station (湛江站 Zhànjiāng zhàn). The old Zhanjiang Station is commonly referred to (on maps, bus schedules) as Zhanjiang South Station (湛江南站), to distinguish it both from the former Zhanjiang North Station and the new Zhanjiang West Station. It is the terminal station for the slow "conventional" trains that come to Zhanjiang from a number of cities throughout China; it also has the baggage/parcel service department (中铁快运). It is located at the western end of the old Xiashan downtown area, and has good local bus service. The Xishan intercity bus station, with bus service to destinations throughout Guangdong and south China, is a block to the north from the train station.
Zhanjiang West Railway Station (湛江西站 Zhànjiāng xī zhàn). Zhanjiang West Station has two kinds of service. It is the terminal station for the frequent high-speed (D series) train service from Guangzhou South (a bit over 3 hours), via Kaiping South and Maoming. This is also the station where "conventional" trains connecting Hainan (Haikou or Sanya) with mainland destinations stop. As many other new train stations in China, Zhanjiang West sits in an empty field a few miles west of town, but it is well served by city buses. There is also a small intercity bus station adjacent to it.
Zhanjiang Wuchuan Airport (湛江吴川机场), ☏ +86-0759-8210000, zjazb@gdairport.com. A new airport in Wuchuan that is far away from downtown Zhanjiang to accommodate growing air traffic. The old airport in Xiashan District was closed and will be demolished to free urban land for redevelopment.
