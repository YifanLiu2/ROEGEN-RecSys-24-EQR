Online timetable can be checked at the Pleso prijevoz website. Airport buses leave from the main bus station which is in the wider city center; they leave from its northeast wing (toward the city)—look for "Croatia Airlines" and "Eurolines" banners on the building.
A cheaper local ZET bus 290 also goes to the city center (and back to the airport) from the main road outside the terminal.

Glavni kolodvor - Zagreb's Main Railway Station
There are direct services from major European cities such as Vienna (6½ hours) via Graz (4 hours), Budapest, Zurich, Munich, Salzburg, Ljubljana and Belgrade as well as domestic services to all major towns (except Dubrovnik). There is also an all-year-round overnight train (with sleeping compartments) between Zagreb and Split (6 hours, 8 if going overnight). The main rail station is centrally located.
Trains are not fast everywhere in the country; a journey to Split takes ~6 hours while by bus it takes ~5 hours, while other destinations along the coast are practically not reachable by train.
Croatian railway times and prices can be found here where you can buy e-tickets for travel within Croatia. There is a Croatian rail app but this does not appear to be available to non residents of Croatia.
Tourists coming from or going to neighboring capitals should note the following EuroCity and InterCity as well as EuroNight railway lines:
EC "Mimara": Villach - Ljubljana - Zagreb
EC "Croatia": Vienna - Maribor - Zagreb, also by EuroNight train

Trains no longer run across the border to Sarajevo in Bosnia. The work-around route is to take the local train from Zagreb main station at 09:00 to Hrvatska Kostajnica, arriving by 10:45, for a fare of €. This is 3 km from the Bosnian border crossing, either take a taxi, or walk south into town then east and cross the river by the first bridge. Once you've entered Bosnia, find a taxi to Banja Luka, 100 km southeast, costing around €50 and taking approximately 90 min. You'll reach Banja Luka in time to catch the 15:49 local train to Sarajevo via Zenica, arriving by 20:41. (The easier workaround, but with less trains, is a direct bus from Zagreb to Banja Luka for €23-28; The journey takes  hr and you'll arrive in Banja Luka directly at the joint bus and train station at around 14:00.)
Most of the services are operated by Croatian Railways. EuroNight trains can be booked via ÖBB (Austrian railways), DB (German railways) or SBB (Swiss railways), or any other ticketing agency.

Almost all highways (motorway; autocesta in Croatian) in Croatia start or end in Zagreb.
Travellers from Vienna can pass by Graz and Maribor and then take the A2 highway upon entering Croatia. Mind the toll in Slovenia.
Travellers from Budapest can pass by Székesfehérvár and then use the Croatian A4 motorway. It also connects Varaždin. You will have to pay toll from shortly after entering Croatia until shortly before reaching Zagreb.
Travellers heading from Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey can use the Croatian A3 motorway to reach Zagreb.
Travellers heading from Ljubljana can use the A3.
Travellers coming from the west - Italy, Rijeka or Istria - can use the A7 motorway (near and bypassing Rijeka), A6 motorway (Rijeka-Bosiljevo) and then the A1 (Bosiljevo-Zagreb).
Those travelling from Italy can bypass the expensive motorway toll in Slovenia by using the state route SS21 through Trieste, route E61 through Slovenia (in a bad shape) and then A7 south to Rijeka, then Rijeka bypass, then A6 east to Bosiljevo and A1 northeast to Zagreb.
Travellers heading from the south - Dalmatian coast (Zadar, Split, Dubrovnik...) or from Montenegro - can use the A1 highway, often combined with the state roads D8 (by the coastline) and D1 (through the hinterland).
To use highways in Croatia you must pay in euro. You may also pay by credit card- American Express, Diners, MasterCard, Maestro or Visa cards. A third option is to use the HAC Smart Card, which can reduce the cost of travelling on the Croatian highways by 10-25%. It is issued by Hrvatske Autocestedead link, but pays off only if travelling more than 500 km (that's a return trip Zagreb-Zadar or Zagreb-Serbia) or 250 km for a seasonal Smart Card (a return trip Zagreb-Rijeka or two return trips to Zagreb from Austrian border). There are also transponders by Hrvatske Autoceste for electronic toll collection (called ENC). You can find a toll details here.
Zagreb has a well-developed and efficient public transport system that consists of trams, buses and trains. You can find routes and schedules from Easyway journey planner or Google maps.
The tram network operates 24 hours a day - from around 04:30 to just after 00:00 there are 15 "day-time lines" (tram lines 2–9, 11-15 and 17). From 00:00 to 04:00 there are 4 "night" lines (tram lines 31-34) which cover most of the day-time lines on a reduced (around 30-40 minute) frequency. Occasionally, buses replace trams on night lines. Tram lines 1, 3, and 8 do not operate Saturdays, Sundays and on public holidays. Tram 1 doesn't operate in Summer. Maps of daytime lines are available under the link "Network of daytime tram lines". Both buses, trams and the funicular are operated by ZET.
As for the buses, there are 138 day-time and 4 night lines. ZET buses cover the area outside the city center, and some neighboring towns in Zagreb county. The buses use the same ticketing system as the trams. There does not appear to be a map of bus routes. Google Maps is probably the easiest planner to use.
A historic funicular railway (uspinjača in Croatian), one of the steepest and shortest in the world, operates between the lower and upper towns with a travel time of just one minute. The funicular operates every 10 minutes, but for a fee of € (in addition to regular tickets for everyone on board), an immediate ride can be purchased.
Ticketing system for buses & trams
ZET operate city buses, trams, funicular & Sljeme cable car.
Paper tickets & chip cards can be purchased at any news-stand/kiosk (Tisak), including at the airport. It is cheaper to buy a ticket here than from a driver.
Many locals use Stored Value electronic chip cards to pay for the ride. These can be bought at ZET company offices for € and need to be charged with money in advance. They are also used for the multiple day tickets. The advantage is that they are easier to use than paper tickets, as buses and trams often have fewer machines that accept paper tickets (one by the first and one by the last tram doors). If you want a cheaper short-duration option, you need to select it on the display before waving the chip card, otherwise you'll buy a -hour ticket.
Another easy option is to buy tickets by smartphone using the MOJ ZET app (iOS, Android) which can be topped up in euro increments using a credit card. You purchase tickets on the app and then activate them by reading the blue QR code near the vehicle doors or using NFC.

Once you enter a vehicle, validate your ticket by inserting it in the little orange machine. All single tickets are valid for travel using all vehicles in a single direction within the alloted time after validation, so you won't need a new one when switching trams and/or buses. Zoned fare exists, but only relevant for travel to places outside of Zagreb city limits; all trams as well as buses in the City of Zagreb are in zone 1. The most significant place in zone 2 is the airport.
Trains operated by Croatian Railways (Hrvatske Željeznice) run every 15 minutes from the east to west of the city, connecting the suburbs of Zagreb with the central railway station. They are usually the quickest form of transport for those coming from the areas of Zagreb far from the railway station (Glavni kolodvor), or beyond the tram network.
Travellers who intend to visit many museums may consider buying the Zagreb Card. The card offers unlimited travel on public transport in Zagreb, discounts at virtually all of the city's museums, reduced prices at many restaurants, shops, and service providers and many other concessions. As of 2023, it costs €20 for 24 hours or €26 for 72 hours from the date and time entered on the card. Holders of the card also receive a special booklet with a list of all of the establishments and the discounts available to them. The card can be purchased at any of Zagreb's Tourist Information Centre, at the reception desks of the majority of Zagreb's hotels, and ordered online (shipping cost is added).

King Tomislav's Statue at his square
Caution: Several of Zagreb's historical buildings sustained damage due to a moderate earthquake that struck the city in March 2020 and are temporarily closed until repairs are finished.
The city of Zagreb is mainly divided into two parts Gornji grad (Upper Town) and Donji grad (Lower Town). They are the cultural, religious, and commercial hubs of Zagreb. These are where most of the restaurants, bars and tourist sights are located. The Upper Town, which is the medieval core of the city, developed as two separate (and often warring) towns - Kaptol, the seat of the Bishop (where the imposing Cathedral now stands), and Gradec, the free town where tradesmen and artisans lived (proclaimed by King Bela of Hungary in the 12th century) merged in the 1770s to form the northern section of historic Zagreb. Following this, the city expanded south of today's Trg Bana Josipa Jelačića (Jelačić Square) to the railway station and the Sava River.
Apart from the two main parts, the City of Zagreb is extended both north-south and east-west. The northern part consists of the mountains and wilderness while the Southern part extends beyond the River Sava and consists of modern Zagreb and is known as Novi Zagreb.
So Zagreb can be classified under five areas:
Upper Town (Gornji Grad)
Lower Town (Donji Grad)
New Zagreb (Novi Zagreb)
Gornji Grad (Upper Town)
Zagreb Cathedral (Kaptol). It is closed due to March 2020 earthquake damage. The Zagreb Cathedral with its twin spires is the most well known landmark of the city.

Near the Old Town Gate is the sculpture of St. George having slain the dragon. The other statue, him fighting the dragon, is located on the Marshal Tito's Square near the Croatian National Theatre (roughly 1 km away).
Ribnjak Park (next to Zagreb Cathedral, Kaptol). the Ribnjak is an English-style park complete with exotic plants, sculptures, and a children's playground. The park was originally the site of Bishop's fish pond.

Many universities in Croatia accept a small group as international students every year, who stay in dorms and learn Croatian.

For creative types, Croatia is occupied by some street performers and many stands selling jewellery or other hand-crafted products, so the populace has an open mind to casually buying things from an interesting stand near the main square or dropping a few coins into a musician's case.
There are many small grocery stores around Croatia such as Konzum and Diona. There you can buy most necessary foods, hygiene products and items like cigarettes and alcohol.
If you have a more specific need (like appliances, cutlery) or wish to go bulk shopping then try one of the larger Konzums or Kaufland.
Bread in Croatia is sold unsliced, and with no preservatives used is generally inedible after the second day, so if you don't eat bread much then ask for half a loaf ("pola").
Most international brands, like Nutella or M&Ms, can be found in the larger stores but are rather expensive. Trying a domestic alternatives is not a bad idea.
Zagreb also has designated areas, the singular being a "platz", where you can buy and bargain for clothes and shoes as well as perfume, chocolate and souvenirs. Illegally imported cigarettes are also cheap (because of high importation taxes).

As of April 2023, the city has 5G from all three major carriers (HT, A1 and Telemach). Wi-Fi is widely available in public places.
As with much of Croatia, Zagreb is very safe on the whole. But just as anywhere else in Europe, dark/poorly lit alleys, parks (during the night), and some poorer neighborhoods should be avoided, and common sense should be followed. The chance of getting in trouble in Zagreb is fairly low, especially in the centre where most of the hotels and restaurants are located, and for foreigners, who are in general respected and welcome. Visitors soon realize that Zagreb is safer than the majority of European capitals such as London, Paris, Vienna, Rome, and Budapest.
Pickpocketing isn't a particularly common occurrence in Zagreb, but you might be approached by beggars and similar people on the street – ignore them and they will go away. Do be extra careful inside and close to the main railway station.
Though Croatia has become a more tolerant nation, outbursts of homophobic behaviour have been known to occur regularly, so it is advisable for non-straight couples to not show affection in public, especially in low control conditions and when near groups that look like football hooligans, skinheads or similar. For example, a lesbian couple from UK was assaulted by an angry passenger in a tram, and they suffered minor injuries, and the perpetrator was apprehended by the police.
Park Ribnjak, very close to the city centre, is safe during daytime and worth visiting, especially for children. However, it has become a night-time meeting place of alternative youngsters, and subculture violence involving skinheads and similar violent young people has occasionally occurred. It's best to steer clear of Ribnjak after dark, which shouldn't be a problem because of a lack of interesting activities there for most tourists anyway.
Further, if you are going out at night (especially on weekends), steer clear of any drunk and rowdy groups of young people you might encounter in the street or night trams as random beatings have been known to occur. It is not uncommon for such groups to start unprovoked attacks on passers-by, although they target mainly younger crowd and teenagers. These are not common, but have occurred, and individuals have been beaten up and even killed by such attacks in the past, so take precautions. It is advisable for men not to wear feminine styles.
Avoid night clubs playing "Turbo-folk" music, as violence erupts in them quite easily. Also, do your best to avoid strip clubs at all costs. Zagreb is not famous for such clubs and they are rare; however, most of them are often run by very shady characters, and often overcharge their guests. Foreigners have been charged €2000 for a bottle of champagne. These clubs overcharge their customers to the extreme, and their bouncers will not have any mercy if you tell them you are unable to pay. You will soon find yourself in a local hospital. This not only applies to strip clubs in Zagreb, but also all over Croatia.
Croatian children start learning a foreign language in primary school, and for the majority it is English, so younger people can usually speak the language well enough, and many older people know some. You may also try German or Italian, as both are popular (for historical and cultural reasons).
It is also advisable to learn a some basic Croatian words and phrases - because Zagreb can be a vibrant, busy city, a few basic molim (please), hvala (thanks) or oprostite (excuse me, pardon me, I'm sorry) will go a long way to avoid being ignored by a busy local.
Summer time is traditionally time in Zagreb for maintenance and road repairs. If you visit Zagreb at that time, you should do some research on what streets are open and what aren't and also be prepared to get stuck in traffic jams during rush hours.
