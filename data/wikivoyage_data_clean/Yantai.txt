Yantai (烟台 Yāntái) is a port city on the Shandong coast that still retains some of its colonial charm. The city is fairly small but there is a bustling development zone and large container and shipbuilding ports. There are a number of western expats working here on the docks and teaching English.
Yantai is home to Yantai Raffles (烟台莱福士船厂) (Coordinates: 37°35′48″ N,121°23′39″E), which owns the largest shipbuilding crane in the world, towering over the eastern edge of the T shaped peninsula. Yantai is known for tasty fruit, especially cherries, apples, peaches and pears and is also the home of Changyu Wines, whose founder Zhang Bishi introduced viticulture and winemaking to China in 1892.
The seaside is home to a promenade for walking or relaxing. Among the seaside attractions is a great water, light and sound show: nightly at the promenade. It is definitely worth seeing.
Mandarin Chinese (普通话) is the lingua franca; the Yantai accent differs in tone distinction and is often described as gritty. Yantai is also the government seat for the surrounding areas and attracts many workers from those areas, each with a different flavor of Mandarin on a spectrum of intelligibility.

Hailing a taxi during mealtimes (around 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00) can be especially difficult due to a tradition of cultural breaks and siestas.
