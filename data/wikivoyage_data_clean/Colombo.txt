Colombo (Sinhala: කොළඹ, Tamil: கொழும்பு) is the largest city and commercial capital of Sri Lanka, and still perceived by many as the capital though the suburb of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is now the official capital. Just like another typical South Asian big city, Colombo is congested, noisy, busy, and vibrant with a mixture of modern life and colonial buildings. It is the financial centre of the island and a popular tourist destination.
Colombo is the commercial and financial capital of Sri Lanka after the administrative capital was moved to Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte, a suburb east of the city. "Colombo" could refer to either the city proper, or to Greater Colombo that includes the areas of Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte and Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia.
Due to it being on a strategic route in the Indian Ocean, Colombo hosts one of the busiest ports in South Asia, and was known to traders 2,000 years ago. It was an important port on the Maritime Silk Road. Today, the city is the centre of the country's activities and is home to most of the country's restaurants and entertainment venues.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Colombo has a tropical monsoon climate, bordering on tropical rainforest climate, so the weather is warm or hot around the year with temperatures usually around 25 °C (77 °F)-30 °C (86 °F), and wet during much of the year. For the best weather, visit during the north-east monsoon season, including the driest months December to March. There's also a shorter dryer period in July and August.
The Portuguese gave the city its current name, which is derived from Sinhala: kolon thota - "port on the river Kelani" or kola-amba-thota - "harbour with leafy/green mango trees" or kolamba - "ford or harbour". And thanks to its natural harbour it has been a trading point for thousands of years, visited by traders from as far as China and the Roman Empire. From the 8th century Arab traders settled in the area and eventually came to control the trade through Colombo.
They were followed by the Portuguese, who in 1505 made a treaty with the Kingdom of Kotte where they were allowed to establish a trading post in Colombo and trade in cinnamon in exchange for protection from outer invaders. The Portuguese eventually set up a fort, expelled the Arabs from Colombo and proceeded to take over the whole island, formerly ruled by many kingdoms, over the course of the 16th century. The surroundings where the fort stood are now known as the Fort district, though the Dutch tore it down replacing it with their own fort, which the British replaced with military barracks and other buildings, and the barracks were demolished in the 1970s to make room for the Colombo World Trade Center.
The Portuguese presence in Sri Lanka was marked by a long war, the Sinhalese-Portuguese war from 1527 to 1658. The Dutch, Portugal's main rival during the age of colonization became involved in the war and took over Colombo in 1656. The city became a centre for the Dutch East India Company's operations on the island, and by that they also came to control the rich cinnamon lands in the region.
In 1796, during the Napoleonic Wars, Colombo was captured by the British, first serving as a military base and from 1815 on as the capital of British Ceylon. During British rule, Colombo grew and started developing into the city it is today and many of its notable landmarks were built during this period. The first representative government on Sri Lanka, the Legislative Council of Ceylon, was established in 1833.
After World War II, in 1948, Ceylon became a British dominion, and in 1972 an independent republic. After that a decision was made to move the capital out of Colombo, to the suburb of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. The new parliament opened in 1982 and officially it is the national capital, but the relocation of governmental offices is reportedly still in progress. Even so, Colombo, the biggest city by far, remains the commercial capital and the centre of much of what's going on in Sri Lanka.
Map of the numbered districts (click to enlarge)
Colombo is divided into numbered administrative districts. They're used for postal services but also for indicating where in the city a place is, and some businesses include them in their address information. There are 15 districts in Colombo. Outer districts have higher numbers – see the adjacent map.

Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB IATA), Canada Friendship Rd (at Katunayake, close to Negombo), ☏ +94 11 2 252861. Sri Lanka's primary international airport, on the coast north of Colombo. (updated Oct 2021)
Ratmalana Airport (RML IATA). Has flights from domestic locations such as Hambantota-Mattala, Jaffna, and Trincomalee. It has limited international flights that tend to be corporate jet operations and charters. This airport is on south side of Colombo, so leave plenty of time if you have a connecting flight between the two airport. (updated Jan 2024)
Ground transportation serving Bandaranaike International Airport
The international airport is closer to Negombo than to Colombo, so if you're arriving late or departing early, it might be a better option to stay the night in Negombo. Confirm the cost of any mode of transport before using it.
The journey from Colombo Fort will take about 40 minutes by taxi, if taking the toll expressway (Highway E03), and is the fastest option available. Unless you ask to take the expressway, the taxi will take a normal, much slower road, as the toll expressway between Colombo and the airport costs Rs 450 each way.
At the airport, immediately after leaving customs there's a taxi counter on your right. Tell them your destination and they will print you a voucher with the price. An A/C van from the airport to Colombo 1 (Fort) costs Rs 7500 (2024).
Other popular taxi services: Kangaroo Taxi and Taxi Yala airport taxi service Airport Taxi booking. Most 4- or 5-star hotels have their own counter just outside the arrivals hall.
You can also take a tri-shaw aka tuk-tuk from the bus depot (get there by free airport shuttle bus), it takes about an hour and Rs 1500 (2011) from airport to Galle Road.
This is the cheapest way to get into Colombo, but will take some effort and time. There are types of two buses.
Public bus #187 operates between the  airport bus depot (about 1 km drive southeast of the airport) and the  Colombo Fort train station's eastbound bus stand (on the opposite side of the street from the station, about 50 metres west of the pedestrian overpass crossing the street). These large non-A/C buses take about 90 minutes each way, departing every 20 minutes until 11:20 pm. These buses take the regular road to the airport and make stops at marked bus stops along the way. Bus fare is Rs 200 (as of 2024). Luggage is best stored in the area immediately to the left of the bus driver, though the bus is not set up for transporting the largest size luggage that tourists may be using. Local buses traveling through Colombo Fort toward Pettah stop at the same bus stand as this #187 route, making it a very easy and short transfer.
Private bus #187 (with its sign identifying it has A/C) operates between the airport bus depot (just like the public bus) and the  private bus depot in Pettah (about 700 m east of Colombo Fort train station, at the east end of the north most bus stand in the bus depot). These medium sized buses are equipped with A/C and take the expressway, taking about 40 minutes each way, departing every 30 minutes until 10 pm. Bus fare is Rs 320 (as of 2024), but taking luggage larger than a medium sized backpack costs extra.
This is probably the least known way to get into Colombo, but completely possible. Take either the free airport shuttle to the bus station and then follow the road (Canada Friendship) to the Katunayaka South station (nearly 2 km, if you don't have luggage) otherwise just to take a tuk tuk right from the airport to the train station. The price should be a few hundred rupees.
Then, at the train station, get a ticket to Colombo Fort, you'll be arriving right next to where the buses drop people off. Cost is Rs 30. Compared to buses, the trains are much less frequent, do not operate as late, and sometimes are delayed, but consistently will take an hour between the stations. if you manage to just catch a train without much waiting. Check online timetabledead link (look for Katunayake, as "Katunayake Airport" station is not in use) on one of the free computers in the terminal when arriving about the next train, if it suits you, it's an easy way into the city for very little.
Long-distance train services are starting to improve after decades of neglect due to the civil war. Sri Lankan Railwaysdead link resides over an increasing network with the central station Colombo-Fort as main hub. As of early 2021 there are daily trains from Jaffna, Kandy, Batticaloa and Badulla, and on weekends from Nanuoya. Nighttrains from Badulla, Batticoloa, Trincomalee and Vavuniya.
Fort Station is in the heart of the city, next to Colombo Fort and Pettah and close to the meeting points of the A1 and A4 highways. The station provides access to businesses and offices in Colombo Fort, as well as the markets at Pettah.
Maradana Railway Station is another major rail hub in Colombo. The station is served by Sri Lanka Railways, with many inter-city and commuter trains entering each day. It is the terminus of several intercity trains. Maradana is home to the suburban-Colombo network's centralised traffic control centre.
Slave Island Railway Station, Station Passage. Coastal Line. Platforms 2. - Tracks- 2. (also known as Kompanna Vidiya Railway Station) serves the Slave Island area in the centre of the city. It is served by commuter rail. The station building is significant for its historic architecture.

Fort Railway Station, Olcott Mawatha Rd (Connections : Buses, via Central Bus Stand, Pettah.). A major rail hub, the station is served by Sri Lanka Railways, with many inter-city and commuter trains entering each day. Fort Station is the main rail gateway to central Colombo; it is the terminus of most intercity trains in the country.
The Sri Lanka Transport Board is the government-owned bus service. Buses are the principal mode of transport in the country. If you cannot speak or understand Sinhalese, however, travelling by bus might prove more difficult than train travel but is entirely feasible and may be much quicker. Prepare for severe over-crowding and make sure to confirm your destination with the driver and conductor of the bus.
The three primary bus terminals — Bastian Mawatha, Central, and the Gunasinghapura Bus Terminals — are in Pettah.
Bastian Mawatha Bus Terminal, Olcott Mawatha (A1 Highway). It handles long distance services.

Getting around by Tri-shaw (Three wheeler, tuk-tuk) is most convenient. Some three-wheelers have built in meters or the drive uses a phone app that does the same. Drivers hanging out in tourist areas often will not have or not allow meters as an option. Ask if there is a meter and if there is not a meter to use, always negotiate and agree on a price before you take a trip. But it's best to hail a meter taxi (identified by the words "Meter Taxi" on its windshield) that is traveling in the direction that you need to go instead of hiring one from the parking area or the tuk-tuk stand. The meter taxi costs Rs 100 for the first kilometre and increases in increments of Rs 10 based on distance and waiting time. It is best to have an offline map, as drivers relying on meters will agree to take you without an understanding where they need to go, whereas drivers negotiating a price will not agree to a price unless they understand how to get to the destination.
The Sri Lankan Tourist Development Authority also operates its own fleet of 'tuk-tuks' around Colombo which are tourist friendly and metered to ensure that travellers are aware of the price being paid. Tourist board tuk tuks are distinguishable by their unique paintings. These three-wheelers can be booked 24 hours a day by calling 0712 500 800 or 0772 299 299.
Colombo has an extensive network of buses going around the city/region. It's fairly easy to find the right one by asking locals or your accommodation. Fares depend on the type of bus and distance. Fares are only for the trip on bus that you are riding. Prices start usually at Rs 30 (as of 2024). Traveling by bus is an adventure in itself!
Taxis are safer and much more comfortable than tuk-tuks.. There are 'Tata Nano' cars in service nowadays and the charges start from Rs 40 per kilometre with air-conditioning. The tuk-tuks also offer their service for a fee of Rs 30 per km and do not forget to go for the ones with the "Metered Taxi" name board in front. Others may not have the meters running. Uber is available in Colombo with options for smaller cars (Go and Zip), as well as UberX, but XL is not available. A local ride-sharing app called Pick Me allows to order everything from a tuk tuk to a van, although there have been reports about the app not working for all users.
PickMe, ☏ +94117433433. A ride hailing service based out of and operating in Sri Lanka. Serves more of Sri Lanka than other ride hailing options. There are different prices for tuk-tuks as opposed to cars. (updated Jan 2024)

Colombo's cheap accommodations in the centre of town apart from the famous YMCA (containing a gay bathhouse) are mostly concentrated along the road opposite the Colombo Fort Railway Station. Many rooms are available but with shared bathrooms. These, however, tend to be dirty and dingy affairs that even seasoned travellers are unlikely to tolerate.
Moving south along Galle Rd, one can find a lot of more reasonable housing.

Further down south, prices and people will get more reasonable. There are quite a few small hotels in the side streets off Galle Rd. in Wellawatte area. If you continue south and get as far as Mount Lavinia, there will be hundreds of small guesthouses, some of them very affordable, in a quiet old-fashioned area with a lot of greenery and right by the sea (the only problem being that it's far from the centre). As of May 2014, typical costs were Rs 1,000-2,000, depending on the room quality. Buses 100, 101 and others go down Galle Rd. from Colombo Fort station (Rs 20 to get to Wellawatte).

Colombo is like most other South Asian capitals. Although it is not as dangerous as one would think, tourists should be very vigilant. Many first time visitors to Colombo find themselves falling victim to scams and touts; however, seasoned visitors to Sri Lanka are rarely scammed and it is very simple to avoid being a victim of scammers as long as you take precautions such as:
Being on guard for anybody trying to help you by giving you unsolicited directions or travel advice. Take any advice from taxi and auto drivers with a grain of salt, especially if they tell you the place you want to go to is closed, dangerous, or non-existent. If you are unsure, check a map.
Not engaging in business with people who have to actively approach you for business such as Tuk Tuk drivers, street vendors, etc. If people have to approach or make overtures to you for business without you seeking them on your own volition, then they shouldn't be considered for business dealings. Because, you will likely be overcharged, as you have been denied the option of shopping around for the best price.
If you have been told your hotel is closed or full, give them a call. If you are a first time visitor to Sri Lanka, don't admit it as it will make you a target for the scam artists.
Once you are past the scammers, Colombo is a far more welcoming destination than other South Asian cities. Certainly single women, although not advised to explore every nook and cranny of the city on their own late at night, will not find the pestering attentions of leering men. Sri Lankan women are also very "western" in their dress sense, so it is very normal to wear skirts, tank tops, etc. You may get a few whistles and hellos from bored school boys, but they are more friendly and not meant to be threatening, so just ignore it and they will leave you alone.
The civil war that once raged is now long over, with much development occurring since. The country is now generally free from terrorism, though in April 2019, an Islamist terrorist bomb attack against churches and hotels in Colombo and elsewhere in Sri Lanka killed 259 people and wounded more than 500.
Seemingly innocuous public displays of affection between lovers such as kissing and/or hugging are not culturally acceptable in Sri Lanka as it is considered to be secluded behaviour (this does not apply to private functions or establishments designated for adults such as nightclubs, casinos and beach parties). Much lenience is given to foreigners and holding hands and public affection between parents and their children is not frowned upon.
In most buses, it is local etiquette to provide or give up the very front passenger seats to members of the clergy, such as monks or priests if they are present.
Do not turn your back to (or be alongside) a Buddha statue when within a reasonable distance (observe what others are doing). This includes posing for photos. It's OK to photograph a statue, but all persons should be facing it.
Public nudity is illegal in Sri Lanka. Nude/topless sunbathing and skinny dipping should be avoided at beaches, except in the few private beach resorts which allow it.

Dialog Axiata PLC, 475 Union Pl, Colombo 00200, ☏ +94 77 767 8700. Network headquarters (updated May 2020)
Mobile data is a simple way of connecting when traveling in Sri Lanka. The internet is supplied through Data cards (this is the local interpretation of the item) . They are simple, small-sized scratch coupons available in almost every store in the city. A data card is priced according to variations of the package and the company manufacturing it. A few trustable companies are Dialog, Mobitel, Hutch and Airtel.
In a normal coupon, usage details are normally applied in the back, along with a hidden serial number which can be accessed by scratching off the top layer with a coin (Quite similar to a scratch lottery). You have to dial the given ussd code and proceed with the instructions given in the back of the card. If you are not so sure about trusting local stores (scammers are present in most of them), you can easily request a card from the hotel reception (depends on the hotel quality, a low budget hotel might not serve willingly.) or visit the company headquarters (most of them are located in Colombo).
WiFi can be accessed easily in the city. Travelers can either log into free public WiFi which is usually available in parks, cafes and shopping malls, or they can log onto the hotel WiFi by requesting the password from the reception. Most hotels provide free WiFi. Public WiFi is usually slow and laggy due to high usage, WiFi in hotel lobbies are the same, however, WiFi provided in hotel rooms works well.
Delhousie— town at the foot of Adam's Peak which is considered a place of worship and pilgrimage by many religions. The 2,224-m peak, also known as Sri Pada, is home to a foot imprint on a rock at its summit. Depending on the faith, the footprint has been considered that of Buddha, the god Shiva, St Thomas, and even Adam, after he was expelled from the garden of Eden. The stairway to the top is believed to be one of the longest in the world. After reaching the top, climbers can ring the bell to mark the journey they just made. The panoramic view makes the journey well worth the effort. Reaching Delhousie from Colombo can be an adventure in itself, unless you are lucky enough to find a direct bus. The route is Colombo-Hatton-Maskeliya-Delhousie. The distance is quite short on the map but can take 6–8 hours.
Kandy, 120 km (less than 4 hours away) outside of Colombo. Kandy is a small, tranquil town that holds the sacred tooth of Buddha, a sacred relic of the Buddhist faith. According to the legend, the tooth was taken from the Buddha on his funeral pyre and was smuggled into Sri Lanka hidden in the hair of a princess in the 4th century. The Dalada Maligawa, or Temple of the Tooth, is a main attraction for pilgrimages. Each July and August, the tooth is carried in a procession. Although one cannot see the tooth, the festivities are a sight to see.
Sigiriya, 160 km northeast of Colombo, is a very important Buddhist site in Sri Lanka. The remains of the ancient fortress and city date back to 477 AD. Legend has it, King Kasyapa built it in order to protect against attacks from his brother, whom he had stolen the throne from. The only way into the city is through the giant lion's jaws. The site is also famous for its 5th-century frescos. Sigiriya is approximately 2–3 hours away from Colombo, and can be reached via train, bus, or car. It is open daily from 8:30AM to 6PM. For foreign nationals the entrance fee is Rs 2,000.
Negombo, beach town just north of the airport, also famous for its canals and fish market. It used to be a backpacker haven, though it's more and more becoming a resort with new expensive hotels being built. 1-1½ hr by bus from Colombo.
