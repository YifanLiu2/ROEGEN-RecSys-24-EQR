The city of Asheville is a liberal, artsy community nestled between the Blue Ridge Mountains and Great Smoky Mountains in Western North Carolina. A popular tourist destination, this "Paris of the South," has one of the most impressive, comprehensive collections of Art Deco architecture in the United States. In 2011 Asheville was picked as one of the “10 Most Beautiful Places in America” by Good Morning America.
Asheville is the county seat of Buncombe County, and is the largest city in Western North Carolina with a population of approximately 93,000 (2019) and a metro population of 425,000 (2018). Asheville was named after the ninth governor of North Carolina, Samuel Ashe.
It is the principal city in the four-county Asheville metropolitan area, with a population of about 425,000 in 2010.
It has been described variously as the "San Francisco of the East," "New Age Mecca," and "Land of the Sky." It's a city that Rolling Stone magazine dubbed "America’s New Freak Capital." Self magazine proclaimed Asheville as America’s "Happiest City."
Before the arrival of the Europeans, the area belonged to the Cherokee Nation. In 1540, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto came to the area known as Guaxule, bringing the first European visitors along with European diseases, which seriously depleted the native population. The area was used as an open hunting ground until the middle of the 19th century.
In 1784, Colonel Samuel Davidson and his family settled in the Swannanoa Valley. Soon after, Davidson was lured into the woods by a band of Cherokee hunters and killed. Davidson's twin brother Major William Davidson formed an expedition to retrieve Samuel Davidson's body and avenge his murder. Months later, Major Davidson and other members of his extended family returned to the area and settled at the mouth of Bee Tree Creek.
The American Civil War "Battle of Asheville" was fought in early April 1865 at the present-day site of the University of North Carolina at Asheville, with Union forces withdrawing to Tennessee after encountering resistance from a small group of Confederate soldiers in prepared trench lines across the Buncombe Turnpike. In late April 1865, North Carolina Union troops captured Asheville. After a negotiated departure, the troops nevertheless returned and plundered and burned a number of Confederate supporters' homes in Asheville.
In 1880, the Western North Carolina Railroad completed its line from Salisbury to Asheville, the first rail line to reach the city. Asheville experienced a slow but steady growth as industrial plants increased in number and size, and new residents built homes. Textile mills were established and plants were set up for the manufacture of wood and mica products, foodstuffs, and other commodities.
In 1900, Asheville was the third largest city in the state, behind Wilmington and Charlotte. Asheville prospered in the decades of the 1910s and 1920s. During these years, Rutherford P. Hayes, son of President Rutherford B. Hayes, bought land to create the African-American Burton Street Community.
The Great Depression, the period of Asheville's history made famous by the novel Look Homeward, Angel, hit Asheville quite hard: eight local banks failed. Because of the explosive growth of the previous decades, the per capita debt owed by the city (through municipal bonds) was the highest in the nation. From the start of the Depression through the 1980s, economic growth in Asheville was slow. During this time of financial stagnation, most of the buildings in the downtown district remained unaltered. Therefore, Asheville has one of the most impressive, comprehensive collections of Art Deco architecture in the United States.
From the 1950s to the 1970s, urban renewal displaced much of Asheville's African-American population. Asheville's neighborhoods of Montford and Kenilworth, now mostly white, used to consist of majority-black home owners.

Asheville is nationally renowned for its unique architecture, especially downtown and around the Biltmore Estate. The city suffered greatly during the Great Depression, and consequently little development happened during the time. This actually had a positive effect, as the city's famous Art Deco Architecture of the Roaring 20s was saved from destruction. Therefore, today, Asheville boasts the nation's most complete collection of Art Deco structures. Other architectural styles, of course, are present in abundance throughout the city; from the Neo-Gothic Jackson Building "Skyscraper" to the modern BB&T Tower.

Asheville does not necessarily have a specific commercial district but rather it resembles a long line, curving through the mountains. Beginning directly north of downtown, Merrimon Avenue has many low density restaurants and small shopping strip malls. It is the typical American shopping street and many locals consider it “The Strip.” As you move south towards the city-center, Merrimon Avenue changes names to Broadway, then Biltmore Avenue after it intersects with Patton Avenue at Pack Square, home to the Vance Monument, located directly in front of City-County Plaza.
Surrounding this area, Downtown, you will find many boutiques, cafes, museums, and interesting historical buildings. At the eastern end of downtown, The Beaucatcher Tunnel is carved directly into Sunset Mountain. The street leading out of downtown and into the mountain goes into the edifice as College Street and comes out as Asheville’s most celebrated shopping street, Tunnel Road.
Tunnel Road is very commercial and hosts mostly large corporate chains. Construction has boomed along this stretch, and reaching towards the skies above the restaurants and stores you will see some brand new hotels. Finally, Tunnel Road transitions into South Tunnel Road, which is home to the city’s main mall and smaller chain shopping centers. This area of town is not at all touristy, and prices are average and intended for locals.
At the end of South Tunnel Road there is a vast shopping center that extends across the Swannanoa River and up over the mountain, eventually overlooking the Industrial district, containing a relatively new and quite controversial shopping complex along the river, having the city’s Super Walmart as its flagstore. It was built upon the rubble of the abandoned Sayles-Biltmore Bleachery, which used to bleach paper for the US Treasury's currency manufacture.
From Pack Square going south (away from I 240), Biltmore Ave continues down past Biltmore Village and into South Asheville and Arden, with many chain stores and strip malls, from which one can access via NC 146 Long Shoals Rd, Biltmore Park an exurb with high end shopping around a reproduced downtown square.
Downtown Asheville is full of neat and quirky shops and prides itself on the lack of corporate chain stores. Spend some time exploring downtown (it's very walkable) and see what you can find. Here are some highlights:
The Grove Arcade. A newly-restored and exquisite building built by E.W. Grove, who also designed the Grove Park Inn in the 1920s. It is filled with specialty food markets, restaurants, and local mountain craft stores.
Malaprop's Bookstore & Cafe, 55 Haywood St. An independent bookstore with a good selection and an open mind. Great staff recommendations. Grab a book or bring your own and relax in the cafe with coffee and a pastry or bagel.
French Broad Chocolate Lounge, 10 South Lexington Ave, ☏ +1 828 252-4181, info@frenchbroadchocolates.com. An artisan, local chocolate shop owned and operated by Dan and Jael Rattigan, dedicated to using organic ingredients and buying fairly traded goods.
The Chocolate Fetish, 36 Haywood St. A European-style chocolatier with some of the best truffles to be found anywhere. Although it's easy to spend a lot of money here, the pricing is quite reasonable given the quality and size of the chocolates.
Mast General Store, 15 Biltmore Ave. Has an old-fashioned to modern day assortment of products. Old-time candy in barrels to hiking and camping equipment and apparel.
Lexington Avenue is one of Asheville's hippest streets. For your music needs visit Static Age Records, specializing in vinyl, punk rock and heavy metal. Instant Karmadead link and the Octopus Garden specialize in smoking accessories along with a wide variety of other products. Hip Replacements has some great vintage clothing, while up the block Spiritex offers a wide variety of sustainably produced clothing. Buy a used book or read the newspaper or a magazine at Downtown Books and News. Get a tattoo at Liquid Dragon, and stop by one of the many restaurants on Lexington for a quick bite. On the next block up is the Chevron Trading Post for all of your beading needs, and Tops for Shoes, the biggest shoe store in Asheville. While many wonderful stores and hot spots along this street are facing increasing pressure from landlords who want to "gentrify" the area, Lexington is still the best place to get a taste of Asheville's counterculture.
Biltmore Village Just South of Asheville's downtown, and right outside the gates of the Biltmore Estate is the quaint village built around the 1890s called Biltmore Village. It is easily accessed from I-40 (Exit 50). A number of small independently owned retail stores which have carved out specialty niches can be found intermingled with restaurants beneath the shade of the tree-lined streets. You'll find national specialty stores and a boutique notel have begun construction there. Of particular note are:
New Morning Gallery. Probably the best collection of regional Arts and Crafts in Western North Carolina. The gallery features ceramics, glass, jewelry and furniture from local Appalachian artisans. It is in front of Bella Vista Art Gallery.
River Arts District Wrapped along the river, and visible from the bridge over the French Broad River (i.e. from I-240 or Patton Ave.) is an enclave of Art Studios, Galleries, and restaurants that is still not quite user-friendly but accessible to the adventurous. Some worthy points of interest are:
Asheville Glass Center and Gallery. Glassblowing instruction and studio rentals and a glass gallery representing some of the regions finest glass artists.
The Phil Mechanic Building. Cutting-edge galleries, artists and a bio-diesel plant can be found if you wander around inside the old building. Jolene Mechanic, the owner, is a great resource for getting to know the area.
240 Clingman. This used to be warehouse. Right after the Katrina Hurricane it was turned into a gallery by the owners of Bella Vista Art Gallery. After they left, Jonas Gerard, from Miami, took over the space. He was featured on 20/20 and has some eye-popping art on display, and for sale.

Liquor is available by the drink in Asheville, but if you want to buy liquor by the bottle you must do it at state-run ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Commission) stores rather than at a traditional liquor store. These stores have limited exterior decorations so they can be difficult to find. If you plan to explore nearby counties keep in mind Madison County (to the north) and Yancey County (to the northwest) are "dry counties" and prohibit all alcoholic beverage sales. Open containers of alcohol are never permitted on the street; if you order a beverage you must finish it before leaving the restaurant or bar. Beer and wine are available for purchase at most markets, grocery stores and gas stations. The alcohol laws of the state prohibit the sale of alcohol after 2AM Monday through Saturday, and from 2AM until noon on Sundays. Pick up a copy or check the website of the local alternative newsweekly Mountain Xpress for an up-to-date, detailed guide for what is going on at each bar and club for the night.
