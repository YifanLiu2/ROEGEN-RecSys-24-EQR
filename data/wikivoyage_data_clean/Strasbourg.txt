Strasbourg (German: Straßburg, Alsatian: Strossburi) is the capital of the Grand-Est region of France and is most widely known for hosting a number of important European institutions. It is also famous for its beautiful historical centre - the Grande Île - which was the first city centre to be classified entirely as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
Strasbourg railway station, known for the sky dome
Strasbourg is the ninth largest city in France with nearly half a million inhabitants in a metropolitan area spanning across the river into the German city of Kehl, on the eastern bank of the Rhine.
The city is the seat of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, the European Ombudsman, the Eurocorps, the European Audiovisual Observatory and, most famously, the European Parliament, which also holds sessions in Brussels.
Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination primarily thanks to the beautifully preserved and pedestrian friendly city centre, which can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. Don't forget that Strasbourg's appeal now brings tourists to the city throughout the year, with large tour groups especially frequent during the summer months and during the annual winter market.
The main Tourist Office, Place de la Cathédrale. 09:00 to 19:00. If you ask whether they have maps they try to sell you one for € - be sure to ask if they have free maps, what you then get is basically the same as the paid one. They also sell a variety of self-guided walking tours through the town (Middle Ages, Renaissance, Modern and Contemporary) for €1 each, and can arrange bike tours through the Faubourgs (the suburbs of Neudorf and Neuhof).

While you will very likely find people who will engage in a conversation in Alsatian (which may vaguely sound like German to you), the lingua franca of Strasbourg (and all of Alsace) is French. It is possible to hear Alsatian spoken on the streets, especially around the Cathedral. Alsatian (the historic Germanic language of Alsace) is a declining language, spoken mostly by the region's older residents or in rural areas but efforts are underway to revive it. Due to the presence of the EU, chances are you might encounter locals that speak pretty good English. As Germany is right next door and due to heavy tourism from there, nearly everyone in the tourism sector can speak some German.
Strasbourg has its own airport, however there are (relatively) nearby airports which have a wider range of destinations:
Strasbourg International Airport (SXB IATA) (southwest of the city, at Entzheim). There are domestic as well as international flights. Air France is the principal operator. Destinations include Casablanca, Istanbul, Madrid Barajas, Brussels and Amsterdam Schiphol among others. A train runs to the town center (€4, including a tram connection, valid for 90 min. If you only need to get to the central station, buy your ticket not from the machines in the arrivals hall but on the train platform directly where the ticket will cost €). The travel time is 9 minutes and the frequency is 15 minutes. (updated Mar 2023)
Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg Airport (BSL IATA). Jointly operated by France and Switzerland: there is a short bus connection to the railway station of Saint-Louis, which is 1 hr 20 min by train, from the main Strasbourg train station. Low-cost companies offer flights from and to several other European countries, with flights to London (Heathrow, Luton, Stansted and Gatwick), Paris Charles de Gaulle, Berlin Schönefeld, Belgrade, Frankfurt and Istanbul (Sabiha Gökçen). EuroAirport serves as a base for EasyJet Switzerland, so there are many EasyJet flights to European holiday resorts.
Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport (FKB IATA) (about 60 km (37 mi) away in Germany). There are flights to Berlin Tegel, London (Stansted), Warsaw (Modlin), Belgrade and Budapest. Ryanair operates from Karlsruhe following a court ruling that declared its subsidy arrangements at Strasbourg Airport a contravention of European legislation. The best way to get to Strasbourg is by bus from the airport to Baden-Baden Hauptbahnhof (Main Station); from here trains run to Strasbourg, normally with one change. From station to station the journey is about 45m-1hr. See the timetable dead link for direct bus from the airport running to Strasbourg, this is tied into meet Ryanair flights from London. Flibco operates buses to from the airport and on to Strasbourg.
Stuttgart Airport (STR IATA) (about 110 km (68 mi) away). A focus airport for Condor and Eurowings, Stuttgart Airport offers flights to most major European cities, but also to cities in the Middle East and, rather interestingly, Atlanta. There are many ways to go to/from Strasbourg. Driving by car should take about 2 hr in normal traffic. If buses are your thing, there are direct buses connecting the city to Stuttgart airport in 2 hr 15 min. Travelling by train might be trickier though. You will most likely have to change once, either in Karlsruhe, Offenburg, or Stuttgart. Train journeys can vary from 2 hr to 3 hr. (updated Feb 2020)
Frankfurt International Airport (FRA IATA). About three hours away from Strasbourg in Germany, and is one of the nearest intercontinental airports to Strasbourg. Lufthansa operates an Express Bus shuttle between Strasbourg and Frankfurt, Germany (but an indirect connection by train can be cheaper if booked online in advance, connecting in either Karlsruhe or Offenburg). The bus takes 2½ hours and costs €49 (one way). Reservation is necessary for the Lufthansa Express Buses from/to Strasbourg.
Due to the excellent train connection to Paris, it may make sense to fly into Charles de Gaulle airport and take the TGV from there. Air France and some of its partners offer combined tickets in an air rail alliance.
Strasbourg is well served by regional, national and international train services, predominantly by SNCF (French Railways), but also by Deutsche Bahn (German Railways).
Strasbourg is the eastern terminus of a major high speed rail line and thus served by numerous TGV and some ICE trains, most of which continue onwards to Paris or Germany respectively. Unfortunately this has also resulted in the end of many long running sleeper trains such as the original Orient Express.
Major destinations include the following major towns and cities with multiple daily departures. Journey times are approximate, some require TGV trains: Paris 1 hr 50 min, Dijon 2 hr, Lyon 3 hr 40 min, Metz 1 hr 15 min, Nancy 50 min, Marseille 5 hr 30 min, Besancon 1 hr 40 min, Luxembourg 1 hr 40 min, Mulhouse 50 min, Basel 1 hr 25 min, Frankfurt 1 hr 45 min, Stuttgart 1 hr 20 min, Munich 3 hr 40 min, Saarbrücken 1 hr 30 min by direct local train, Brussels 3 hr 40 min.
The TGV Est Européen provides direct services to: Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport 2 hr 25 min, Lille 3 hr 20 min (for same-station connections via Eurostar to London), Rennes 5 hr 15 min, Nantes 5 hr 10 min, Bordeaux 6 hr 45 min.

The main train station in Strasbourg is the  Gare de Strasbourg, 20 Place de la gare. . The station, impressively renovated with a new glass cocoon frontage, is located a short walk west of the town center on Place de la Gare. There are connections to the tram system and buses, with many taxis waiting outside (to the left of the station forecourt).
For details of all services, and to make reservations, contact SNCFdead link. For regional travel, check SNCF TER Alsace dead link who co-ordinate the efficient and well served regional train network.

The German town of Kehl just across the border was linked to the Strasbourg tram network in 2017. It is one of only a handful of places worldwide where you can just hop on an urban rail service and let it take you across an international border. Both sides being within the Schengen Area, you don't need to take a passport or answer the question "business or pleasure" and you'll likely not be asked by customs agents how much booze you are carrying, either (and the limits are very generous at any rate). There are of course fare inspectors, so don't forget to get a ticket.
You can reach Strasbourg by various highways:
from the west (Paris, Benelux) taking the A4 highway (E25). About 4 hours from Paris and 2 hr 15 min from Luxembourg.
from the south (Switzerland, Lyon), taking the A35 highway (E25). About 5 hours from Lyon
from the north and east (Germany), taking the A5 highway (E35).
Driving into Strasbourg's old city is relatively easy although there are a few streets off limits to cars. There are many large garages surrounding the old city if your hotel does not have its own parking facility. Some carparks are more expensive than other, especially for longer stays. The one at Petite France Ste Margueritedead link is the cheapest at €/24 hour and € for each consecutive day.
Tickets P+R (parking for the day plus return fare on the tram for up to 7 passengers of the car): €, P+R Rotonde: €.
Strasbourg is most easily explored on foot, and the historic city centre can easily be explored in a day or two. To be able to cover more ground, you should consider hiring a bike or using the public transport network.

the automatic or manned bike sharing stations vélhopdead link.
rue du Maire Kuss, in front of the train station
rue des Bouchers, on the south bank of the Ill river, near the rue d'Austerlitz and the Porte de l'Hôpital tramway station.

Houses in the "Petite France" area
Petite France is the name given to the small area between the rivers, just south of the Grande Île. It is home to some of Strasbourg's prettiest and most photogenic streets and buildings, with half timbered townhouses leaning out over the narrow cobbled streets. Petite France resembles Colmar (a city an hour south), with picturesque canal and half-timber houses.

From time to time, the city organizes a general market in vast parts of the center, where many street vendors offer various products and the shops join in with special discounts. Then, the city center on the island is partly closed for parking or driving and the trams don't go on the rue des Francs Bourgeois. Information about regular market dates is hard to find on the net. If you manage to track down the date of this market, write it here and don't miss it.

Alsatian specialties are numerous and can be eaten in many traditional restaurants, in the city or in the neighborhood. Particularly you shouldn't visit Alsace without having the sauerkraut (choucroute in French). Choucroute seems to have a standard price throughout Alsace of €14. Don't be too dismayed by this seemingly high price as what is brought to you is a heaping plate of Sauerkraut (big enough for 2 people) as well as sausages and other meats. This is usually translated as "garnished sauerkraut" on English menus, when in doubt ask your server. There is also a delicious fish choucroute. Other specialties include the Alsatian pork-butcher's meat, Flammeküche or flams (tartes flambées in French) which is a sort of wafer thin pizza made with onion-cream sauce, Baeckeoffe, beef and pork stew cooked, with potatoes and carrots, usually served for two or more persons and Fleischnackas, mixed beef meat presented like spirals and served with salads.

There are many hotels around the station, especially in the place de la Gare and in the rue du Maire Kuss, but this area does not offer consistent quality for accommodations. Most international hotel chains are represented with the usual 2- or 3-star hotels, many of which host the large tour groups who come on weekend breaks. If your budget allows, try staying on the Grande Île (city centre). Most of Strasbourg's hotels are fully booked during the Christmas Market period (December) and when the EU parliament is in session for a few days every month, usually for the period around the tenth. Book ahead if in doubt, as last minute accommodation can be difficult to find during these periods.

Strasbourg is just like any other major French city: there are safe areas and there are unsafe areas. In any case, standard safety precautions need to be applied.
In the city center, watch out for pickpockets near the Cathedral (and even inside, according to the signs), during the high tourist season, and throughout the old town.
The areas immediately surrounding the railway station might look unsavory at night, but there are usually lots of people around there, and the streets are well-lit. Avoid looking like a lost tourist and you will be fine. If you do feel uncomfortable, don't hesitate to approach a police officer or taxi driver.
Some areas in the south (especially the Neuhof neighborhood, which often ranks among France's worst neighborhoods) and west (Hautepierre, Cronenbourg) of the city might be iffy, especially at night, but they have little tourist appeal.
Local mobile phone services are provided by Orange, SFR and Bouygues Télécom. Payphone kiosks are plentiful and international calling cards can be purchased in post offices and 'tabacs' (corner shops). Most of the internet cafés listed below are also equipped for making online telephony calls (Skype etc.).
In most McDonald's in Strasbourg you get free WLAN.
