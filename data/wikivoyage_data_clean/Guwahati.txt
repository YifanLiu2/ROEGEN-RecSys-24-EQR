Guwahati (Assamese: গুৱাহাটী Guvāhāṭī guah-hah-tih), previously Gauhati, is the capital and the largest city in the Indian state of Assam. Guwahati is one of the fastest-growing cities in India.
Excavations trace the origins of the city to around the 4th century and it was the capital of Assam until the 10th century.
The rapidly-growing metropolis has a population of  million in 2020, and encompasses an area of over 360 km2 (140 sq mi), making it the largest city in the state and the region. It is the main centre for shopping, retail and business; attracting people from all over North-Eastern India as well as from Eastern Bhutan. The slow, meandering Brahmaputra River is a focal point of the city while the lush hills of the Shillong Plateau provide a verdant backdrop for the suburbs.
The pleasant environment, however, is somewhat tempered by the inadequate investment in the region, which is apparent from the low quality of roads. Still, despite the average infrastructure, private investors have been drawn to the city, and there has been something of a boom in the construction of shopping malls and high-quality condominiums, which has helped raise the economic profile of the city. The end of the decades-long insurgency in Assam has also helped in the economic boom of Guwahati.
This article also covers Dispur (দিছপুর Dichpur), Assam's seat of government. In 1973, Assam was reorganized to form the smaller states of Meghalaya, Manipur and Mizoram. Assam lost its capital, Shillong, to Meghalaya. A search for a new capital ensued and the choice settled on Dispur, then a suburb of Guwahati.
