The Remarkables and Lake Wakatipu from Queenstown
Queenstown (Māori: Tāhuna) is a world renowned resort town in the South Island of New Zealand. The town sits on the edge of Lake Wakatipu and is surrounded by the Southern Alps.
What was once a small, remote, South Island town has transitioned since the 1980s, first to a busy ski destination, and now to a year-round tourist mecca and centre for adventure tourism. It is a world-famous destination attracting around  million visitors every year, undoubtedly the tourism capital of the South Island if not New Zealand, and a must-see stop for most visitors to New Zealand.
Situated on the shores of Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand's third-largest lake (291 km2 or 112 sq mi) and one of Otago and New Zealand's most scenic lakes, surrounded by mountains, it's not hard to see why its stunning scenery draws people here year round. Queenstown happily caters for all visitors with a full range of attractions, activities, accommodation and eating options for any budget, from backpackers to five-star luxury. This popularity is not without its problems though - in many respects, Queenstown can be a tourist trap. However, reasonable prices and a few bargains can be found for those prepared to look for them.
Queenstown is a bustling town throughout the year, peaking over summer and during the ski season. There is a vibrant nightlife with the town's small central area packed with bars and restaurants. If you plan on getting a good nights sleep, then you might consider staying slightly out of town. It's common to see people on the streets up to 5AM returning from disco or pub. If you're looking for a relaxing scenic holiday, Wanaka (just over an hours' drive away) is smaller and more tranquil with less of a manic teenage party atmosphere.

The Mirror. The first of two free community newspapers to hit the streets (on Wednesday morning), The Mirror is a great source for catching up on all things that are happening in the entire Queenstown-Lakes area. In addition to the news articles, there is a weekly restaurant review and profile of a band or DJ that will be headlining at one of Queenstown's many nightspots that week.
Lakes Weekly Bulletin is an additional source of second-hand items for sale, community noticeboard, employment vacancies, film/gig guide, flatmates and rentals.

Queenstown Airport (ZQN IATA), ☏ +64 3 450 9031. The country's 4th busiest airport by passenger numbers. It is served by Air New Zealand, Jetstar, Qantas and Virgin Australia. There are direct flights from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Gold Coast in Australia, and from Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch in New Zealand. The frequency of flights varies seasonally, with the biggest number during the winter ski season. Typically, flying to Queenstown is more expensive than to other South Island destinations from Australia. (updated May 2023)
Queenstown Airport is known for its spectacular approach with the snow-covered hills surround it on four sides. However, the surrounding terrain also makes it a tricky airport to fly in and out, with aircraft often having to circle near the airport to lose or gain height. Upgrades to the airport lighting and the introduction of high-accuracy GPS approach and departure procedures in the 2010s have greatly reduced delays and cancellations due to low cloud or cold weather. During winter peak loadings, flights departing to Australia are sometimes too heavy to take-off from Queenstown with full fuel, so they have make an enroute diversion to Christchurch or Invercargill to fill up.
Queenstown Airport also provides for private jets and other aircraft, and there is a huge number of helicopter take-offs and landings each day. Scenic flights and heli-skiing are a popular attraction for the region.
From the airport, the cheapest way into town is on the Orbus service 1, which runs every 15 minutes and this costs $10 (cash) or $2 Beecard one way - pay the driver when boarding (2018 prices). Alternatively, catch the bus from the McBride St station on Kawarau Rd (10 minute walk from the airport) and the cash fare is $5 into town. Taxis into town cost about $35-45 while Supershuttle shared vans will take you straight to your accommodation for $26 for one or two people (Mar 2019).

National bus operator InterCity Coachlines provide daily services in and out of Queenstown with connections throughout the South Island. Fares start from just $1 and can be purchased on-line or via numerous local ticketing agents including the i-SITE information network.

National sightseeing tour operator GreatSights New Zealand has daily tour options to Queenstown from Christchurch via Mt Cook and operates daily services to the West Coast including (Fox Glacier Franz Josef and Greymouth).

Many international tour companies carry holidaymakers into Queenstown by coach.
Queenstown is 6½ hours non-stop from Christchurch via the Mackenzie Country and the Lindis Pass, so allow a full day driving. The drive is spectacular, through the diverse countryside of New Zealand's South Island, with vast plains, rolling hills, multicoloured lakes and mountain passes. The Lindis Pass does occasionally close in winter due to snow; a slightly less scenic detour via Oamaru and Alexandra will add 2–4 hours to your journey.
Major international and all national rental car and camper van companies have offices in Queenstown.
There is no rail line into Queenstown. There used to be a rail line from Invercargill to Kingston at the southern tip of Lake Wakatipu, but the line closed after a major washout in 1980, well before Queenstown's tourist boom.
The Taieri Gorge Railway scenic tourist train seasonally operates to Pukerangi and Middlemarch, with a coach connection for the remaining distance to Queenstown.

A number of boat tours depart from the Queenstown Wharf at the bottom of the Mall - including the historic steamship , affectionately known as the "Lady of the Lake".
There is also a water taxi service.
Queenstown has a small local bus service operated by Orbus. You can buy tickets from the driver. There are five routes - the most useful for tourists being services route 1 which operates every 15 minutes to the airport and the Remarkables Park shopping centre. Fares are reasonable if you pay cash: $4 for most trips and $10 to the airport. If you'll be taking the bus more than a handful of times, it is better value to get a Bee card for $5 and top it up with $10 to get $2 fares on all buses. The bus network has two bus hubs, at Camp Street outside the O'Connell shopping mall in central Queenstown, and on Kawerau Road at the Frankton shopping centre (junction of Highway 6 and 6A) near the airport.
If you want to save money getting to or from the airport, consider taking a bus to the Remarkables Park shopping centre. From there, it is an easy 10 minute walk on good footpaths to the airport. This saves $6 per person if paying cash.

The spectacular mountain scenery and Lake Wakatipu dominate the view from most parts of town. Most attractions in Queenstown make the most of the view and it's enough reason to spend time in Queenstown even if you choose not to do anything else.
After that though, there are not a lot of things to 'See'. Its in the 'Do' category below where Queenstown really excels. Nevertheless, there are a few sights around the town to check out:
Skyline Gondola. One of the best views is from the top of Bob's Peak reached by the Skyline Gondola. Breathtaking views of Coronet Peak, the Remarkables mountain range and across Lake Wakatipu to Cecil and Walter Peaks. It's truly magnificent and awe-inspiring! If you're fit, you can save money by hiking up the Tiki Trail, a very steep 1-2 hr hike from town. Adult $39, child $24, family of 4 $113, family of 5 $135. (updated Mar 2019)
Queenstown Gardens (adjacent to centre of town). Jutting out into Lake Wakatipu, these botanical gardens contain a variety of exotic and native trees and plants as well as a large pond and a range of facilities.

Getting out there and 'doing' is really what Queenstown is all about. Skiing was the first drawcard, but now it shares the limelight with a multitude of ways to test your bravery. If you can think of a way to get adrenaline pumping, Queenstown's budding entrepreneurs have probably tried at some stage to make a tourist attraction out of it. Bring a lot of money. It's easy to get swept up in the excitement, and ring up thousands of dollars of exciting activities quickly. A bungy jump, for example, can cost $200 or more, skydiving $300, jet boating $100, and so on (Mar 2019). And don't forget about the upgrades: a higher jumping-off point, photo and video packages, and more jumps.

Most businesses will have a store in the CBD where they can arrange things for you. Hostels and hotels generally have a stack of pamphlets showing what is on offer, and staff are generally happy to help with recommendations and bookings. All providers generally provide transfers from Queenstown.

Although limited in number, the police in the Queenstown area are intolerant of disorderly behaviour and are prepared to arrest for quite minor offences. As with anywhere in New Zealand, they have no tolerance for possession of drugs.
Other emergency services in the area operate on a volunteer basis. Occasionally you may hear what sounds like a World War II air raid siren go off in Queenstown. This is not signalling that someone is trying to attack New Zealand with nuclear weapons, but signalling volunteer fire-fighters to get down to the station because there's a house fire/car accident/kitten stuck up a tree.
Rental car companies have restrictions in their rental agreements to prevent their vehicles being operated on some high country roads. New Zealand's ski-field roads also take many visitors by surprise, but driving to suit the conditions will considerably reduce any risk.

Queenstown can be used as a base to see the surrounding country, including Arrowtown, Glenorchy, Kingston, the Kawarau Gorge, Cromwell and Wanaka.
The drive to Glenorchy, 50 minutes to the northwest and alongside Lake Wakatipu for much of the journey, is rated as one of the top scenic drives in the world.
The Gibbston Valley wine area is 20-min drive, just before the ancient Kawarau Gorge.
More distant tourist destinations such as Te Anau and Milford Sound are a day trip away, with many tour operators providing bus tours and flights.
Fox Glacier, the bigger and less crowded west coast glacier, is  hours drive north.
