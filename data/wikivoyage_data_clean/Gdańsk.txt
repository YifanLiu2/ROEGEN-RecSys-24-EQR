Gdańskdead link (also known by its German name Danzig) is a city in Poland on the Baltic Sea. Gdańsk is considered one of the most beautiful cities on the Baltic Sea and has magnificent architecture.
Gdańsk is the capital of Pomerania. In 2021, it was home to 471,000 people. Gdańsk with nearby Sopot and Gdynia are often referred to as Trójmiasto ("tricity").
Its position on the Baltic has made Gdańsk one of the most important port cities in Northern Europe, and the scene of a disturbing past. Gdańsk used to be the biggest and richest city in the Polish Kingdom. The first claim to fame for Danzig (as it was then known) was its membership in the Hanseatic League as an important Baltic port on the crossroads of North East and Central Europe.
World War II was ignited by a dispute over the control of the city. By the end of the war the city lay almost completely in ruins. The German population was expelled and replaced by Poles as the city came under Polish rule and changed its name to Gdańsk. However, the impact of its former German ties are still evident. Most of the old buildings were damaged or destroyed in World War II, but they have been painstakingly restored or rebuilt, although in a style that is not exactly the same as before the war.
In modern history, Gdańsk is known as the birthplace of Solidarity (pl: Solidarność), the labour and democracy movement that helped to bring down the Communist government in Poland at the end of the Cold War. The movement was led by the charismatic leader, Lech Wałęsa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and in 1990 became Poland's first post-Communist president.

sea resort Sopot with the longest European pier
sea resort and port Gdynia with the biggest Baltic port
Many of the boats (to Sopot in particular) end up fully-booked and you can't buy your ticket on the boat itself. This is a harsh lesson to learn when you have already waited in a huge queue. Tickets for the Sopot ferry must be purchased from an office directly across from the terminal. Also be aware that in Sopot you will need to buy an access ticket for the pier (around 5 zł, even if you already have a return ticket to Gdańsk) in order to board your boat back.
sea resort and medieval town of Frombork with the grave of Nicolaus Copernicus.
sea resort Kadyny with one of the best European studs.
Slowinski National Park with the biggest dunes in Europe
Take the train to Hel. It's at the end of the peninsula opposite Gdańsk. SKM trains are the cheaper option. Train from Gdańsk Główny to Gdynia every 15 minutes and then SKM diesel to Hel. If you get the 09:45 from Gdańsk you have 7 minutes to change about 4 platforms across the underpass. The journey is wonderful - straight through pine forests and sometimes with the sea on either side. Single ticket costs  zł (get a  zł single from Gdańsk to Gdynia - and then the  zł single from Gdynia to Hel, just in case you miss the connection.) When you get to Hel have a walk into town, it's a Polish beach resort full of holiday makers. You should have time for lunch and then get the hydrofoil from the end of the pier at 15:30. But make sure you buy the ticket from the office halfway down the pier or you could be walking back! The trip is 50 zł back to Gdańsk but it will be the best value trip you can get. It takes 1hr 50 min but the first hour is getting across to Gdańsk, then the next 50 minutes is navigating the canals back to the town centre. You could pay a tourist company for this trip, but the cost is in your ticket, you see Westphalia lighthouse where the first shots of World War II were fired, the huge ships and the massive remains of the former Lenin Shipyards.
