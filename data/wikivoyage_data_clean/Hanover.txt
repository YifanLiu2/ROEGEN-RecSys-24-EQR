Hanover (German: Hannover, Low Saxon: Hannober) is the capital of Lower Saxony in Germany. Hanover built a huge exhibition complex for the World Expo in 2000 and has been host to several of the biggest exhibitions in the world. Consequently, it calls itself the "Expo City" or "Exhibition City" (Expo Stadt/Messestadt). Hanover also played host to the 2006 Association Football World Cup. The major language spoken is German. English is not common, except during major international events. Nevertheless most people understand English and will be able to help you find your way around.
Hanover City Hall (Neues Rathaus)
Hanover was one of the hardest-hit cities during World War II, leaving it with only a few historical landmarks. Don't expect to see beautiful centuries-old buildings; even the Old City (Altstadt) area is "new", as all the old houses left standing after the war (around 40) were taken from throughout the city and collected in one place. This area is surrounded by some 1950s and 1960s buildings that give a somewhat heavy atmosphere to the streets. However, there are still several residential neighborhoods consisting of late-19th-century housing stock with often elaborate historicist (Victorian) and Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) decorations just outside the downtown area, such as Oststadt, List and Linden.
Hanover has large green areas, with forests and big parks. The landscape is mostly flat, with the river Leine going through the city. The lake Masch (Maschsee) is rather spectacular, considering its size as a man-made object.
The city had a special relationship to the late French artist Niki de Saint-Phalle. She had several of her works in public spots in Hanover (i.e., "the Nanas", "the Cave" in the Great Garden) and also in the Sprengel Museum. To honor her contribution to Hanover, she was granted an honorary citizenship from the city government. Moreover, the renovated "underground" shopping passageway from the central station to Kröpcke was named "The Niki de Saint-Phalle Promenade".
Hanover's public services are excellent, due to major reconstruction for the World Expo 2000. The shopping area under the train station was renovated in 2005-2006 in preparation for the World Cup.
Hanover was founded in medieval times on the bank of the river Leine and became a comparatively large town in the 13th century. Its original name Honovere may mean "high (river)bank". There was a time of personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714–1837). Soldiers from Hanover emigrated to Great Britain, leading to the formation of the King's German Legion, which was the only German army to fight throughout the entire Napoleonic Wars against the French. They later played an important role in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. After World War II, Hanover became the capital of Lower Saxony, a state created from several disparate elements and the most sparsely populated of the old Federal Republic but also the second biggest by area of all 16 states of reunited Germany. Hanover profited from its new status as capital and is the northern endpoint of Germany's first (opened 1991) – and still longest – high speed rail line, linking Würzburg and Hanover along a North-South spine that was totally overwhelmed with traffic during the era of German partition and still carries significant amounts of traffic to this day.
Hanover has arguably become Germany's trade fair capital in a highly competitive market, hosting Germany's only world exhibition after the war in Expo 2000 (with some buildings from the event still extant) and also CeBit, considered the premier computer-related event in the world. The trade fair area of Hanover is the largest in the world by most measures.
Kröpcke is a large pedestrian area in the heart of Hanover. It is Hanover's major shopping spot, home to the Opera house and has lots of places to eat. The main station in the Hanover Stadtbahn network is also located here. All Stadtbahn lines except the 10 and 17, call at the station and it is the main interchange point for the network. It has six platforms in total on three lines that cross each other in independent tunnels. There is a big green clock in Kröpcke - the  Kröpcke-Uhr - which makes an ideal meeting point.
The Tourism Office, Ernst-August-Platz 8 (nearby Central Station), ☏ +49 511 12345111, info@hannover-tourismus.de. Offers self-guiding maps. Follow the red line (Roter Faden, literally Red Thread) which starts from the exit of the Tourism Office. The red line will pass the most significant attractions in the oldest part of Hanover and can be completed on foot in 1½ hours. Refer to the map for explanation every time a number on the red line is encountered.
Hannover Airport (HAJ IATA) (about 11 km ( mi) north of the city centre). This airport is served by many European network airlines (through their respective hubs) and some budget airlines flying point-to-point. The airport is the ninth busiest in Germany by passenger numbers. Despite its comparatively modest passenger numbers, the airport has two runways.
On line S5, S-Bahn (stations are indicated by this sign) trains run twice-an-hour from the airport to central station (Hauptbahnhof) (and on to Hamelin or Paderborn). A 2-Zone ticket is needed from the airport to city centre. The fare is € (2016) for a single ticket (see chapter public transportation for other ticket options) and will take around 17 minutes. The last train departs around midnight. A taxi ride to the city centre costs about €20 and will take about 15 minutes.
The airport offers the option to check in the day before your departure (18:00-21:00) for some airlines (Condor, Croatia Airlines, Sky Airlines, and TUI).
Due to its location, Hanover has good connections from all major cities in Germany through Deutsche Bahn (DB), the German rail service. There are also direct trains to the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria several times a day, including a few sleeper trains operated by (Nightjet).
Hanover is also reachable by regional trains, making it possible to use the cheap and popular “weekend tickets”dead link (German: Schönes-Wochenende-Ticket) on weekends, the “travel throughout Germany tickets”dead link for the rest of the week. Both are applicable for the whole republic and cost €40 or €44 (2016) for a single person. It gets even cheaper if you travel in a little group of up to five people. If you are already in lower saxony, you can use the “Lower-Saxony-Ticket”dead link (German: Niedersachsen-Ticket) for €23 (2016).
The high speed Inter City Express trains (ICE trains) can take you all over Germany to places such as: Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Munich, Cologne, and Berlin. The trip to Hanover from Berlin takes 1 hr 30 min, from Hamburg 1 hr 20 min, from Frankfurt 2 hr 20 min, and from Munich 4 hr 30 min. Prices vary depending on time of travel and the ticket type such as an economy, freedom or comfort ticket, but a freedom ticket from Berlin to Hanover will cost you from €75.
Flixtrain serves the city. DB tickets are not valid here.

Hanover is linked to the rest of Germany and parts of Europe by frequent bus services. Bus rides tend to be fairly quick avoiding unnecessary hold ups but they are not the most comfortable way to travel especially for long distances. The Central Bus Station (Zentraler Omnibus Bahnhof or "ZOB") is behind (to the north-west of) the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof). The biggest company by far is Flixbus with Berlinbus a clear second and all others accounting for pocket change by comparison.
International buses still serve Hannover, for example:
Buses to Bosnia are run by Globtour
Buses to Croatia are run by Čazmatrans
Buses to Czech Republic: Student Agency
Hanover is served by the excellent German road system, being on both the Hamburg to Kassel (Autobahn A7) running north and south and the Berlin to Düsseldorf (A2) running east and west. The city is easily reached after leaving these two motorways. In Germany they drive on the right, and while the autobahns have no speed limits unless individual speed limits are clearly indicated, they do have a recommended speed limit of 130 km/h. Note that at minimum drivers may be held partially responsible when travelling in excess of that recommended speed limit at the time of any accident. While the limits on the B-roads are quite high (usually 100 km/h, even more on motorway-style B-roads), they can drop to as low as 50 km/h in built up areas. From Hamburg the drive is around an hour and a half. From Berlin and Düsseldorf, the drive is around 3 hours, but heavy (truck-)traffic on the A2 can play havoc to plans.
Stadtbahn Hanover (light rail)
Hanover has a fantastic network of public transportationdead link, so it's best to park your car and ride. If you plan to make more than two trips by tram, bus, or subway, a day ticket is your best bet, buying you unlimited travel on the public transport system. Day tickets are valid until the last connection of the day (which normally ends sometime after midnight). The public transportation adopts an honor system for tickets, but they do have ticket inspections once in a while (also late at nights and early mornings). The fine is quite high, so make sure you have a ticket all the time. Be aware that some tickets will need to be validated (stamped on the 'blue box'), and some not, depending on the machine.

Price: Single ticket: 1 day €, 2 days €, 3 days €; Group ticket (2-5 persons): 1 day €, 3 days €.
Ticket and Cards Regions. It may be confusing to understand the zones of Hanover public transportation. The key is to know that there are "tickets" and "cards". The term "tickets" applies to the ones bought at the machine or elsewhere, while "cards" are the ones with (monthly) subscription. Inside the city area, you only need a 1-zone ticket as it already covers a good part of the city. However, for the airport you will need a 2-zone ticket, as it is located outside Zone 1. Tickets are valid on bus, tram, fast tram (S-Bahn), and regional train.

Unless you have limited time, lots of heavy baggage, or are travelling after public transport stops at night, you might want to think twice about using taxi, as it is very expensive.
