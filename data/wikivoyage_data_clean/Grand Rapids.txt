Grand Rapids' crime rate is one of the most uneven in the USA. On the one hand, the city has dealt with rampant property crimes and pick-pocketing in the past.

The downtown area is safe if you use basic precautions. Several areas across the river and to the southwest of downtown are best to be avoided. The rest of the city is safe.
