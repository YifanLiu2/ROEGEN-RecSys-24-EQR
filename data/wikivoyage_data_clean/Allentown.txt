Allentowndead link is the largest city in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, the county seat and largest city in Lehigh County, and the third-largest city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and Pittsburgh with a population of 125,845 as of 2020.
In the Lehigh Valley, Allentown borders South Whitehall Township to its northwest, Emmaus to its southeast, Whitehall Township to its north, and Bethlehem to its east. The city lies in the center of the highly populated U.S. Northeast megalopolis region, 19 miles (31 km) west of the Skylands and the New Jersey state line, 63 miles (101 km) north of Philadelphia, and 93 miles (150 km) west of New York City.
Allentown was founded in 1762 by William Allen as "Northampton Towne." It was renamed Allentown in 1838, and was incorporated as a city in 1867.
Founded in 1762, Allentown has deep roots in American history. The city was among the first to support American independence, establishing a Committee of Observation as early as 1774. During the American Revolutionary War, the Liberty Bell was hidden under the floor boards of an Allentown church for nine months from September 1777 to June 1778 to avoid its capture by British troops. In the 19th century, following the Confederate victory at Fort Sumter in April 1861, Allentown deployed the Allen Infantry to aid the Union Army and protect the nation's capital from Confederate attack. Allen Infantry and its associated regiment proved among the Union Army's most effective and bold fighting forces, leading some of the Union Army's most daring attacks against Confederate bases in the deep southern states of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina.
In the early part of the 19th century, Allentown was among the first U.S. cities to emerge as a hub for industrialization with significant mining and heavy manufacturing industries, including anthracite coal, iron, and other minerals, that helped spark America's Industrial Revolution. In the early 20th century, the city blossomed as a national hub for heavy manufacturing. The late 20th century erosion of these industries in the area was captured in the 1982 Billy Joel single "Allentown," which elevated the city globally as a symbol of industrial decay and the devastating social impact associated with the Rust Belt.
Allentown lies on the Lehigh River, and the river has historically been a centerpiece of the city's economy and culture, serving as a means of transport for its mining and manufacturing products and closely associated with its rise as an industrial city. Allentown is 338 ft (103 m) above sea level. It lies along the Lehigh River in the Lehigh Valley, which is so named because of the prominence of the river and because it is located in an actual geographic valley between two Appalachian mountain tips, South Mountain and Blue Mountain.
Allentown's climate is highly seasonal. July is the warmest month with an average high-temperature of °F (°C). January is the coldest month with an average low-temperature of °F (°C).
The city experiences an annual average of  days of rain with  inches (692mm) of average annual rain precipitation and  days of snowfall with an average of  inches (351mm) of annual snow accumulation. July is the month with the most rain with a monthly average of  days of rain and monthly rain precipitation of  inches (77mm). March has the most snow with a monthly average of  days of snowfall and  inches (111mm) of snow precipitation.
September is the driest month in Allentown with  days of rain and a monthly average of  inches (41mm) of precipitation.

English is the dominant language and accents and tones are sometimes rough-edged and blunt as you might find in New York City or Philadelphia.

Other languages found here include Arabic, Portuguese, and Vietnamese.

The primary and most convenient point of airline entry to Allentown and other Lehigh Valley locations is Lehigh Valley International Airport, but three primary options exist:
Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE IATA), 3311 Airport Road, ☏ +1 610-266-6000, toll-free: +1-800 FLY LVIA (3595842). Lehigh Valley International Airport ABE IATA, which is a mere 6 miles ( km) northeast of Allentown, is the closest airport. This airport has nine gates, six aircraft holding spots, and two runways. Allegiant Air, American Eagle, Delta Connection, United Express, and other commercial airlines offer direct flights to Lehigh Valley International from Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Nashville, Fort Lauderdale, Myrtle Beach, Orlando, Clearwater, St. Petersburg, and elsewhere. Car rental services and commercial and public bus services are available for ground transportation from the airport. (updated Jun 2022)

PHL is 71 miles (114 km) south of Allentown. Cars are available for rent at PHL, and roughly a dozen buses a day depart for Allentown from the airport or from Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal at 1001 Filbert St. in Center City Philadelphia. Phone: 1-800-PHL-GATE
Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR IATA) in Newark. New Jersey, roughly 80 miles (129 km) east of Allentown, is even a bit further away than PHL but is sometimes worth considering, especially for international travelers. Like PHL, it offers car rentals and bus service to Allentown. Phone: 1-973-961-6000
30th Street Station, a major East Coast United States train station at 2955 Market Street in Philadelphia, is the third busiest Amtrak station in the U.S. and the closest commercial rail station, 61 miles (98 km) south of Allentown. Cars are available for rent inside the station. ☏ +1-800-872-7245

Allentown is easily accessible by several major highways. The two interstates most commonly used are:
Interstate 78, which is a major east-west highway that runs from central Pennsylvania in the west to the Holland Tunnel and Manhattan in the east. Allentown-area exits are 57, 58, and 59.
U.S. Route 22, which is a major freeway that runs from Cincinnati, Ohio in the west through Newark, New Jersey in the east. Exits 45, 49A, and 49B (Fogelsville) are all Allentown or Allentown-area exits.
If you are driving to Allentown from New Jersey, note that all of the major bridges across the Delaware River are free eastbound, but some require tolls westbound. Locating the free bridge in Phillipsburg is possible, but not recommended to those unfamiliar with the area. It is called Northampton Street and adds only about half a mile to the trip.
From points southeast and northwest of Allentown, PA Route 309 provides fairly quick access and is a good road to travel.
PA Route 33 from I-80 is the best approach for travelers coming to Allentown the Poconos.
Once in the city, Allentown is relatively easy to navigate and most of it is even walkable or bikeable. The main east-west streets are listed from north to south: Sumner, Whitehall, Greenleaf, Cedar, Washington, Green, Tilghman, Allen, Liberty, Gordon, Chew, Turner, Linden, Hamilton, Walnut, and Union. Numbered streets run from north to south. They begin towards the west at 1 and continue to 42.

Because 7th street in Allentown is one-way, if you aim to go north to Whitehall Township, you will want to be on 6th street. Route 145 turns off 6th Street at Greenleaf Street for one block, and then joins 7th Street (beginning as two ways). Continuing on 6th will bring you to the same place, but will not carry the PA-145 designation.
Hamilton Street is a continuation of US 222/Hamilton Boulevard and provides easy access for travelers from Reading and Lancaster. Hamilton Street continues into nearby Bethlehem as Hanover Avenue, providing direct access to its downtown as well.
Tilghman Street is also a useful east-west urban thoroughfare that also provides access to Bethlehem and Easton as Union Boulevard.
US Route 22 is a four-lane limited-access freeway across the north side of the city, and is often the best route of approach. However, this road is prone to minor traffic jams and accidents, especially during rush hour. Don't panic, though; most traffic jams are only a mile or so long, and usually take less than half an hour before opening up into freer travel.
Interstate 78 is a better bet during rush hours as it is as wide as eight lanes in some areas.
Riding a bike can also get you around in Allentown and its fabulous park system. The city is known for its extensive trail and park systems, especially the Bridle Path in Lehigh Parkway (stop to feed the fish in the Fish Hatchery, go to the Museum of Indian Culture, or pedal along a trail that takes you to a covered bridge).

Allentown has a crime rate almost twice the national average in every category, including rape, robbery, theft, auto theft, murder, assault, and burglary. Rougher areas include parts of East Allentown and some neighborhoods of Center City north of Linden St. and south of Tilghman St. and the area between the American Parkway and Lehigh River, just east of Center City. Random acts of violence and crime against visitors are rare; most of the crime in the city and region involves drugs, gang rivalries, and other illicit activities. It would be unwise to try to buy drugs or other contraband in the city.
It is fairly easy to stay safe by following common sense. Car and other forms of theft are issues, so be sure to lock cars and stay out of poorer areas at night. Prostitution and street racing are also very prevalent in Allentown. Don't walk alone late at night or on dimly lit streets. The most likely victim of a mugging on an Allentown street is someone who is alone and intoxicated, so keep your wits about you. If homeless approach you for change, just keep walking if you don't want to give anything. Pickpocketing is not a large problem, but don't flash around your money.
There is a large police presence in the neighborhoods most frequented by visitors, especially Hamilton Street, and many officers in Center City Allentown patrol by bicycle.
If you are in need of medical attention, here are the primary hospitals in the area:
Lehigh Valley Hospital - 17th Street, 1627 W Chew St. ☏ +1 610-402-CARE (2273)
