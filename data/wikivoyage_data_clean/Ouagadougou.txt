Ouagadougou (pronounced: WA-ga-DOO-goo) is the capital of Burkina Faso and the nation's cultural and economic centre. Its name is informally shortened to Ouaga.
The dominant ethnicity is Mossi (60%), but many other tribes are also represented (Samo, Gourounsi, Lobi, etc).
Languages spoken: French, Moore, some Jula (derivative of Bambara).
The primary language spoken by the general population is Moore. However, many merchants, shopkeepers, taxi drivers, and restaurant and hotel staff will speak at least some French. In the nicer parts of town, most people speak excellent French. Some people speak English.

Its climate is classified as hot semi-arid (BSh) with the rainy season from June to September. Daytime temperatures are hot all the year, but are hottest from February to May.
Ouagadougou International Airport is the main gateway and is located to the immediate south of city centre, distance from the airport to the United Nations roundabout is less than two kilometres. The airport is quite small and, like many African airports, somewhat disorganized. National carrier Air Burkina has flights most West African capitals as well as Paris, from where Air France also offers daily service. The other European capital with scheduled flights is Brussels via Brussels Airlines. Other popular connections includes East African cities of Nairobi and Addis Ababa. Some of the best fares from Europe seem to be with Turkish Airlines.
A shared taxi, the green ones, to city centre should cost no more than XOF500, but be aware that many will ask for up to CFA 1,000.
A twice weekly train operated by SITARAIL runs from the Ivorian capital Abidjan via Bobo-Dioulasso. First and second class carriages are available, the journey is supposed to take 36 hours but trains are often much delayed. Tickets are open for purchase a day before departure at the train station.

There are plenty of bus operators serving Ouagadougou but there's no central bus station, each operator has its own depot.
Transport Confort Voyageursdead link, on Rue de la Mosquée is one of the largest bus companies in town with connections from most regional cities as well as the neighbouring capitals. Other operators includes STMB dead link and SOTRAO.
Ougadougou is a very orderly and clean city, and the traffic is very civilized. The city has a grid-based street system. There are traffic lights everywhere and motorists actually obey them. The people here are proud of their country and create a good impression.
Ouagadougou is serviced by two types of taxi: white and green. White taxis are rarer, more expensive, and exclusive. Green taxis are ubiquitous and of much lower quality, but are much cheaper to use. As there are no meters, all fees for all taxis are negotiated in advance, and you should not enter a taxi until you and the driver have agreed upon a price.
The small green taxi cabs should cost no more than CFA 300 per person during the day for straight runs on main roads. Fees increase with distance or with departures from the main routes. Be prepared to share the cab with as many people as can be crammed in, or to pay a premium rate. Cabbies may attempt to charge foreigners far more. If you have a lot of baggage, expect to pay more as well.
Prices go up at night especially to the city center (centreville). You should never pay more than CFA 1,500 per person, and this is negotiable if you have a lot of people in your group to share the cab.
Travel to and from the airport is always expensive, even if you are only going a short distance. Expect a minimum of CFA 1,500, and do not be surprised at asking prices in excess of CFA 5,000. Be firm, and you can negotiate the price considerably downward.
Although Ouagadougou is generally a very safe city, maintain the same caution that you would in any urban environment: only use green or white cabs, don't accept rides from drivers that appear to be drunk or who have cars that appear unsafe, and know that whites, obvious tourists, people with many bags, and people seeking rides at unusual hours are all at a higher risk of theft and other crimes.
Place des Nations Unies (United Nations Square)
