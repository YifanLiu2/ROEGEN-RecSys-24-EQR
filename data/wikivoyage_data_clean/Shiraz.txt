Shiraz (Persian: شیراز) is the capital city of the Fars province and a treasure trove of Persian culture. It was the capital of Iran during the Zand dynasty's era (1747–79), and is the celebrated birthplace of the great Persian poets Hafiz and Saadi. The city has a population of about 1,500,000. In previous centuries, Shiraz was famous as a locally produced wine, although this has no connection to the modern Shiraz (or Syrah) wine, which is of French origin.

If an unmarked car stops while you are hailing a taxi, don't be alarmed. Many taxis in Shiraz are unmarked and also as a means to supplement their income, is not uncommon to find private car owners touting themselves as taxis.
However, it is always best to find a taxi through a reputable "telephone taxi" agency. For a set fee, drivers of these agencies will take passengers to their destination, drive them around town and also wait for them while they shop or run errands. All hotels and local residents will have a phone number of one these agencies. There are also taxis driven by women that specifically cater to women passengers.
The most secure way (if you have mobile internet) will be to use the taxi app called Snapp. With Snapp you can see the exact price before ordering the taxi and you can also call a taxi driven by women.
The city also has a reasonable bus service.

Don't hesitate to talk to people, especially youths. Almost all of them speak English well enough to talk to you, answer your questions and chat with you. Respect the Iranian government(Of course, most of the local people hate the government, but don't talk for political caution). and do not air condescending views of Iran.

Traditionally, Shiraz was known for producing high-quality wines, and had a thriving wine industry, though this was shut down after alcohol was banned following the Islamic Revolution in 1979. That said, the Christian and Jewish minorities are allowed to ferment limited quantities of wine for personal consumption and religious ceremonies, and you may get a chance to try the local wine if you have local Christian or Jewish friends.
