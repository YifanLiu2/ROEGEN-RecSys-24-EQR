For other places with the same name, see Venice (disambiguation).
Venice is a huge city with several district articles that contain information about specific sights, restaurants, and accommodation.
Venice (Italian: Venezia; Venetian: Venexia) is a sanctuary on a lagoon that is virtually the same as it was 600 years ago, which adds to the fascinating character. Venice has decayed since its heyday and suffers from overtourism, but the romantic charm remains. It is also known as the birthplace of composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi, and of the poets and opera librettists Apostolo Zeno and Carlo Goldoni. Venice and its lagoon are a UNESCO World Heritage site. It used to be an independent republic, and remains one of Italy's most important cities, with a quarter million inhabitants. Venice is also known as the home of the world's first international film festival, founded in 1932.
Map of Venice's six historic sestieri (districts)
San Marco Sharpen your elbows and get to stepping. St Mark's Basilica, Doge's Palace, and half a dozen other top sights are crammed in to Piazza San Marco. If you'd like a good picture (or even a place to sit!), try visiting at dawn or during the winter months.
San Polo One of the oldest parts of the city—and featuring the Rialto Bridge—one of its most visited. Several museums and churches hold dozens of antiquities and artistic masterworks.
Dorsoduro It consists of two parts separated by the Giudecca Canal. It is home to the Guggenheim and Gallerie Accademia Venezia, some of the finest museums in Italy. This area also plays host to many students, so those seeking budget conscious amenities may have more luck here.
Castello Several captivating palaces, basilica, and museums all live within the "tail of the fish". On your walk from San Marco, pass by the Bridge of Sighs to catch a glimpse of a convicts last view.
Cannaregio A more residential neighborhood, the city's historic Jewish ghetto is found here as well as the nearby island of San Michele Cemetery. Receives fewer visitors than neighboring areas, although that's not saying much.
Santa Croce Transit oriented Santa Croce is where Venetian visitors will arrive by bus, car or tram. The rail station is just across the Grand Canal in Cannaregio. The park and churches found here are lovely, while the museums cover mostly non-Italian work.
Many visitors also pay a visit to Mestre (mainland Venice) and some of the neighboring islands in Metropolitan Venice during their stay.
Burano — Popular with artists and known for its many small, brightly painted houses.
Murano — Filled with quaint shops and restaurants, Murano is known far and wide for its high quality glass making.
Lido — Venice's long skinny beach, Lido offers a respite from more touristy and expensive areas.
Torcello — Sparsely populated and accessible by vaporetto, this island offers a unique window into Venetian life.
Metropolitan Venice has nearly a million inhabitants, and includes coastal and inland towns such as Bibione, Chioggia and Eraclea.
The comune (municipality) of Venice lies at the coast of northern Italy. It is made up of many islands in the Venetian Lagoon and a stretch of terraferma (mainland). The comune is divided into six boroughs, the most famous of which (known as Venezia Insulare) comprises the historic city of Venice as well as the islands of Giudecca, Murano, Burano, Torcello, Mazzorbo and Sant'Erasmo. Lido and Mestre are other popular areas of the comune.
The historic city is divided into six sestieri (districts): Cannaregio, Castello, Dorsoduro, San Polo, Santa Croce and finally San Marco, where the main monuments and sights are. Each sestiere uses separate house numbers, however they are not allocated in a specific pattern.

The Most Serene Republic of Venice dates back to 827, when a Byzantine Duke moved its seat to what is now known as the Rialto, and for the following 970 years, it prospered on trade (especially from the Silk Road) and under the rule of a Roman-style Senate headed by the Doge. Eventually, the Republic of Venice grew into a powerful city-state, and the cradle of Italian renaissance. In the late 15th century, the Ottoman Empire's expansion around the Mediterranean, new routes on the high seas shifted commerce to the Atlantic, demoting Venice's political status.
The city remains a centre for the arts. One of the significant events in the history of Venice was the opening of the first public opera house in 1637, which allowed members of the general public (those who could afford to pay for the tickets) to enjoy what was once court entertainment reserved for the aristocracy, thus allowing the genre of opera to flourish. Venice was an important destination of the Grand Tour from the 17th century. In 1797, the city was conquered by Napoleon, a blow from which it never recovered. The city was soon absorbed into Austria-Hungary, then ping-ponged back and forth between Austria and a nascent Italy, but Venice is still a monument to the glory days of the Renaissance, and historical culture still throbs powerfully in the old Italians' veins.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Venice has a humid-subtropical climate with hot summers and cool winters. For those who don't enjoy the heat, July and August may be the worst time to visit: it's sometimes very hot and often humid, there are mosquitoes and occasional infestations of flies, and there are a lot of tourists and large crowds. Mid to late spring and early to mid autumn are probably best, a compromise between temperature (expect 10-25°C) and the tourist load. Between November and January, you may manage to feel you have Venice all to yourself, an interesting experience. Beware of the weather during the winter months: it can be quite chilly, windy, and damp. Fog is an additional hazard if you are driving in or out, doubly so in the unlikely chance that you will pilot a boat. But if you've never been to Venice, it's better to go in summer than not to go. You won't regret it. Many cities are far worse in summer. Although Venice has no cars, diesel motors used by boats contribute to less than stellar air quality.
Acqua alta (high water) has become a fact of life in Venice. The lagoon water level occasionally rises above the level of the squares and streets, flooding them. This can happen several times a year, at irregular intervals, usually in the colder months. Acqua alta usually lasts a few hours and coincides with high tide. You'll see raised walkways in side alleys ready to be pulled out when acqua alta hits. When the city begins to flood, sirens will sound to warn residents and businesses. If you speak fluent Italian, tune into news programs since their predictions of the times the flood begins and ends are usually accurate. Normally, the tide rises and falls in six-hour cycles.
You can get an acqua alta map at the tourist offices either at the railway station or St Mark's Square. This will show you the higher, dry routes and the ones with walkways set up during the various flood alerts. There is a tide measuring station at the Rialto vaporetto piers, and a noticeboard at the base of the Campanile in the Piazza San Marco that shows a live tide reading and predictions for the next few days.
Water plays a crucial role in transportation, as Venice is on a lagoon. Whichever way you arrive, the last part of your journey will be on foot from the nearest waterbus/watertaxi jetty. Bear this in mind when choosing your hotel location and route to it, especially if you need to carry bags along the narrow streets. (The sound of hard suitcase wheels on cobblestones is annoying, and they can damage marble steps.) A lot of the higher priced hotels will offer complementary water boat transfers from the airport.
Marco Polo Airport and Treviso Airport serve the city. If no flight suits you, check flying to nearby Bologna or Verona. From both cities trains and buses depart to Venice.

Venice, the world's only pedestrian city, is easily walkable, and the absence of cars makes this a particularly pleasant experience. However, walking and standing all day can also be exhausting, so it is best to pace yourself. The Rialtine islands – the 'main' part of Venice – are small enough to walk from one end to the other in about an hour, provided you don't get lost (a common occurrence).
If you want to get around a bit more quickly, there are numerous vaporetti (water buses) and water taxis. The vaporetti are generally the best way to get around, even if the service route map changes frequently. If you are going to be in Venice for a few days visiting, it is a lot cheaper to use vaporetti than private water taxis. If you want to have a romantic ride along the canals, take a gondola ride, although they tend to exist for more scenic purposes, rather than getting people from point A to point B.
GPS navigation services such as Google Maps are notoriously unreliable in Venice. The density of stone buildings makes it fairly difficult to receive a proper GPS satellite signal. You can mitigate some of these navigation issues using the Live View function in Google Maps, which uses your camera to orient yourself relative to businesses and landmarks around you. However, as of February,2024, Google Maps has been reported as to be working well for pathway navigation.
The one surprising way you can't get around in Venice is by bicycle. Bicycles are banned in the main city. You are allowed to carry your bike in your arms (not ride, not wheel/walk) from the pIazzale Roma to the Venezia Santa Lucia train station, and if you are traveling through Venice to reach Lido or Pellestrina, then you can carry a bicycle like any other large package on public transit. There is a €100 fine for riding a bicycle in Venice.

A single ticket (biglietto solo andata) costs €, permitting the use of public transports for 75 minutes from the moment you validate the ticket including transfers heading in the same direction. If you board a boat without having bought a ticket, you have to buy one from the on-board collector. There are no return tickets.
There are tourist travel cards (biglietto turistico a tempo) that cost €25 for 24 hours, €35 for 48 hours, €45 for 72 hours and €65 for 7 days. There are other versions available, including those offering discounts for youth under 29 year of age. Current rates can be found here.
Something you won't be told easily is that now anyone can purchase the Venezia Unica City Pass card (formerly IMOB) - the only difference is that in addition to its €10 cost for residents, foreigners need to pay a €90 extra "transport activation" fee. Unless you are in town for a couple of days and planning never to return, do it. It's a durable plastic card with your (webcam) picture, and once you have it, you are more or less a local - which means access to € single vaporetto tickets (save even more by recharging the card with 10 at once for €14), half-price discount on Alilaguna services, and even € traghetto crossings (instead of €2; flash the card to the gondolier). It is valid for 5 years from the month of issue. Register at the Venezia Unica site and pre-fill the application online, then go to one of the ACTV offices (not simply ticket points; probably the easiest location is at Piazzale Roma) and tell the clerk that you have a "contratto precompilato" - they'll pull it up, ask you to sign the privacy disclosures and issue the card on the spot (or you can fill the form at the counter; bear in mind it's in Italian). Moreover, if you happen to have a +39 Italian cell phone number, with it and your new Unica you can get a free code for use of the communal WiFi spots. If you lose the card, do not despair: it costs only €10 to get an immediate replacement, and the balance (along with your old photograph) is automatically transferred over.
The Venice Connecteddead link website of the Comune di Venezia (now integrated into Unica site) makes possible to book online (at least 7 days in advance) most services controlled by the town administration (public transportation, access to the civic museums, access to public restrooms, car park tickets, entrance to the Casinò and access to the municipal WiFi network covering the entire historic centre); the online prices vary according to the projected number of visitors but are always cheaper than the current on-site prices (and cheaper than with a Venice Card).
You can also get a Venice Card, which has various options that you can choose when you buy it (public transportation, cultural attractions, toilet access, Alilaguna, etc.) There is a 'Junior' version of the Venice that is available at a slightly reduced rate for those between 5 and 29 years of age. A Venice Card is not recommended for those with less than 3 days in Venice, as most of the top attractions are not included in the Venice Card. If you'll be staying in Venice for a week - get the Venice Card and enjoy travelling from island to island and exploring the various museums and churches it offers access to.
Maps are available at the vaporetto stops in the ticket booths. The map is quite reliable, and is free when getting a Venice Card (€2 otherwise) can be viewed on Internet.
Venice Cards can be reserved on-line dead link for a considerable discount. There are long lines when taking the Venice Card from the ticket booths. The Venezia St. Lucia ticket booth that offers Venice Cards is the one most on the right when you exit the train station.
Directions are all over the city
Otherwise, take a walk! The city is not that big, and you can walk from one end to the other in a few hours if you stick to the paths conveniently marked with arrows in the direction of major landmarks. But it would take months for a fit person to discover every path in the city. Make sure to visit some of the smaller alleyways, as they can be very interesting. Along the way you will discover marvelous art, superb architecture and breathtaking urban landscaping. Exploring the city randomly by walking is well worth it, but also be prepared to get lost easily! Signs all over the city indicate the direction to the main attractions, "Rialto" and "San Marco", as well as the way back to the train station ("ferrovia") and the bus terminal ("Piazzale Roma"). These signs make it easy to have the "get lost experience" even as a one-day tourist. For a faster and safer walk, you should walk on the right side of every path.
Be aware that addresses in Venice are of the form "District Number" (the Venetian word for district is "Sestiere"), not "Street Number". To find a specific place using a map, make sure you know which district it is in. The numbers are assigned at the start of the district and increase as they move farther away from the Grand Canal.
Travellers with mobility impairments will need to plan their routes carefully and allow extra time. Although the city is nearly flat, moving from one section to another requires either getting on a boat or climbing stairs to cross a bridge. The water buses are generally wheelchair accessible, though a wheelchair user may not be able to board when they are crowded. A few bridges have temporary ramps, and the city plans to add permanent ramps to a few more. This should, hopefully by 2030, allow people to move between the most popular attractions in the city without climbing stairs, although some areas of the city will remain difficult to access.

Venice is packed full of sights, with something interesting to see around each corner. The most spectacular sights, such as the Doge's Palace and Saint Mark's Basilica, are in San Marco, the historic seat of power.
Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale), Piazetta San Marco, San Marco 1 (vaporetto line 1 or 2 to San Marco), ☏ +39 041 2715911. Nov to Mar 08:30 to 17:30, Apr to Oct 08:30 to 19:00, closed Jan 1 and Dec 25. Don't miss the guided tour named Secret Itinerary, which will let you discover the part of the palace where the city's administration worked, as well as Casanova's jail and the wonderful 500-year-old roof structure.

Bell tower of St. Mark (Campanile di San Marco), Piazza San Marco, San Marco (vaporetto line 1 to San Marco), ☏ +39 041 5224064. Nov-Mar: 09:30-15:45; Apr-Jun, Oct: 09:00-19:00; Jul-Aug: 09:00-21:00. The current tower dates from 1912; an exact replica of the previous tower which collapsed in 1902. The top of the tower offers great views of Venice and the lagoon. €8.
Clock tower (Torre dell'Orologio), Piazza San Marco, San Marco (vaporetto lines 1-2-5,  to San Marco), ☏ +39 041 5209070. Having been closed for restoration for many years, the restored astronomical clock is now visible. The fascinating tour of the clock mechanism (and rooftop bell) can only be visited on a guided tour, in English: M-W at 10:00 and 11:00, on other days at 14:00 and 15:00, in French M-W at 14:00 and 15:00, advance reservation required online or by phone at +39 041 5209070. A MUVE museum. Adults €12, reduced €7.
Scuola Grande di San Rocco, San Polo 3052 (vaporetto line 1 or 2 to San Tomà, near the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari), ☏ +39 041 5234864. Daily 09:30-17:30, closed Dec 25, Jan 1, Easter Sunday. A masterpiece of Tintoretto, this guild house is an exquisite example of Mannerist art at its best. In order to allow a comfortable admiration of the detailed ceiling, mirrors are offered to the visitors. Cycles of allegories, life and passion of Christ, scenes from the Old and New Testament. Adult €10, concessions €8.
Jewish Ghetto of Venice (Ghetto Ebraico di Venezia), Cannaregio. While racial and ethnic neighborhoods had existed prior to the Venetian Ghetto, Venice's ghetto was the first "ghetto" (coming from a Venetian word for the Iron Foundry that was on the site previously) and "ghetto" eventually came to mean any neighborhood that was made up of a single ethnic or racial group. Today, Jewish life is still very active in the ghetto, and elsewhere in Venice, and is home to five synagogues. Visiting on Saturdays or late Fridays (the Jewish Sabbath) will prove very fruitless because all shops, restaurants, and other Jewish places will be closed.
Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge) (connecting sestieri San Polo and San Marco across Canal Grande). The bridge has become one of Venice's most recognizable icons and has a history that spans over 800 years. Today's Rialto Bridge was completed in 1591 and was used to replace a wooden bridge that collapsed in 1524.
Zattere, Dorsoduro. It's a long and sunny walk along the Giudecca canal, protected during winter time from cold northerly winds for being exposed to south and shielded by buildings. You might find interesting to see how a gondola is made, stopping by the Squero (Venetian for small ship yard) across the canal near San Trovaso Church. It's one of the few still in business in town. With some luck, you'll see some gondole through various manufacturing steps (note that gondole are not straight to counterbalance the gondoliere push).
A lot of churches will charge an entry fee. This is true of the Basilica di San Marco. There is a "Chorus Pass" for entry into some churches, but be aware there is a limited selection of churches this applies to. If you plan to visit three churches or more, you are better off buying the churches pass. There is also a combined pass for museums, churches and transportation only available at the tourist information office but it is relatively expensive.
Saint Mark's Basilica (Basilica di San Marco), Piazza San Marco, San Marco 328 (water lines #1, 52, and 82 will take you from Santa Lucia (the train station) or Piazzale Roma to Piazza San Marco. Walking is another option but will require a map and lots of time and energy), ☏ +39 041 5225205 (procuratorial phone number). Oct-Mar: 09:45-16:45; Apr-Sep: 09:45-17:00. Saint Mark's Basilica is on the Piazza San Marco and is one of the highlights of a visit to Venice. As with most churches in Italy, you must be dressed appropriately to be allowed in; this means no short skirts or bare shoulders. You are not allowed to carry large bags or rucksacks inside, sometimes even small daypacks may need to be deposited. Storage is available just around the corner from the main entrance (free of charge). Filming and photography is forbidden so be prepared in advance. The visit within the basilica lasts ten minutes. Waiting for entry into the basilica can last up to five or so hours and it may be wise to use a ticket service to reserve your visit (reservation costs €3). Once you have a reservation you can take the group entrance on the left, where you hand in the printout of your reservation. As of April 2022 there is a small charge for admission to the basilica. Do note there are extra charges for the high altar and the museum. The museum entry is worth paying for as it allows you access to the balcony overlooking the Piazza San Marco; do note that museum access may be difficult if you have mobility issues..

This is a huge city article, so detailed listings go in the district articles. This article should only provide a brief overview.
La Biennale di Venezia is one of the most well-known culture institutions. Two events organised by Biennale are the Art and Architecture International Exhibitions happening alternately (Architecture Biennale in even years, Art Biennale in odd) but other fields are also covered - contemporary theatre, dance, music, cinema (Venice International Film Festival). Exhibitions take place mostly in two locations:  Arsenale and  Giardini. They are both worth visiting even when no event is scheduled. Arsenale is the largest pre-industrial production centre in the world, dating back to 13th century, and Giardini is architectural gem filled with national pavilions from different parts of the world, often designed by famous architects, it was a venue for the International Art Exhibition since the 19th century.
Art Biennale (Esposizione internazionale d’arte): April – November 2024, ☏ +39 041 5218711, aav@labiennale.org. It is held at Arsenale (vaporetto line  and  to Arsenale) and Giardini (vaporetto line  and  to Giardini). The Central Pavillion and the pavilions of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brasil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Korea, The Netherlands, Nordic Countries, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela and the pavilion of Venice are located in the Giardini. The Biennale is open every second year from April to November, Tu-Su 10:00-18:00. Admission for 219 was €30 for two days, multiple entries (ID required); €25 one day, single entry to each venue; €20 over 65, €14 students. There are many other exhibitions (collateral events) all over the city, often permitting to visit buildings which normally are not open to the public. Online guides to the exhibits are not substantive. The British Council provides a comprehensive guide to all exhibits available at the British pavilion at the Giardini. The Concordia/Antarctic Exhibition has closed early.
Carnival of Venice (Carnevale di Venezia). Annual festival that is world famous for the carnival masks.
Regata Storica (Historic fleet event): , ☏ +39 041 2424, vela@velaspa.com. Celebrating a historic event from 1489, the regatta displays almost a hundred varieties of Venetian boats from the city's rich past. Large oarships, replicating ancient roman and medieval vessels, are rowed along the Canal Grande, followed by many smaller boats. There are several races, including a master championship for solo sculling in streamlined gondolini, painted in unusual white, pink, etc. colours. There are many excellent photo opportunities for this event. Early September. (date needs fixing)
Vogalonga: 2, ☏ +39 041 5210544, fax: +39 041 5200771, info@vogalonga.com. The yearly equivalent of a marathon run on water. Vogalonga competitors must row 32 km under 3½ hours to receive a certificate of attendance at the finish line, but everybody with a human-powered vessel is welcome to participate (some foreigner teams take up to 10 hours to complete the journey just for the fun of it). The official purpose of the Vogalonga was to protest the sharply increasing use of powerboats in Venice, but the event has gradually grown into a festival since 1974, with up to 5500 racers in 1500 vessels attending by the early 2000s. The racetrack visits different parts of Venice as well as some of the nearby islands. Locals and tourists lining up alongside rios and canals cheer the racers. Visitors wishing to participate should have serious experience in rowing or sculling and practise duely, as the journey is physically demanding (even seasoned oarsmen develop calluses by the finish line). The event is mainly for teams, completing Voga Longa on a single oar is considered a major achievement. Extreme participation (scuba frogmen and surface swimmers) sometimes occurs, but it is not recommended due to water contamination issues. Late May. (date needs fixing)

Riding a gondola along the canals with your own gondoliere, the oarsmen who symbolizes the city, is one of the major joys of being in Venice. It's also one of the most expensive, as gondolier-for-hire business licences are limited to just 430 to 455 oarsmen in Venice, making the market artificially scarce and inflating prices. The gondoliers trade is shaped by 900 years of tradition: most are born locals, and it wasn't until 2010 that Venice got its first licensed female gondolier.
Short trips of 30 minutes to an hour cost upwards of €100. A small comfort is that the price is per ride, and not per person. Most gondolas can accommodate between three and four people. Make sure you reach an agreement on price and time before you start in order to avoid unpleasant surprises. There are many tips on how to negotiate prices in guidebooks; some are pretty wild and even include walking away and letting them chase you. Whatever method you choose, bargaining with the gondolieres might knock €20-30 off the price. However, there's an informal habit among the oarsmen to cut the most interesting and little-known parts from the journey path for "discount" customers. Reduced rate riders get less marvel in exchange for a moderate price drop, which may not be worth it.
If you find spending hundreds of euros for a gondola to be a bit much, ride a vaporetto or traghetto instead. There are plenty of vaporetto lines that passe by interesting sights at a more manageable price of €5–10. Additionally, one can cross the canals on a traghetti, stripped down gondolas used as municipal ferries. In the 1950s there were as many as thirty, but now there are seven points to find them, with some only operating at rush hours. The length of any crossing is just a few minutes. Many visitors enjoy visiting the open air markets near the Rialto Bridge and there is a traghetto station there, at the Pescheria (fish market) joining the Santa Sophia church along the Strada Nova. You will notice that traghetti passengers tend to stand up, but if you are not comfortable doing so, sitting is possible, if you are careful.
Venice is home to several expensive rowing clubs.
San Michele Cemetery Island, Cimitero stop
Spend a day on the islands, mainly Murano, Burano and Torcello. There are boat services to all these islands at scheduled times, including between the islands themselves. Be prepared for long lines and long waits for the boats between islands. The Glass Museum in Murano and the Lace Museum in Burano are certainly worth a visit. In Burano you will find some of the most picturesque streets and houses, with each house sporting a different pastel shade. Its really beautiful. Though there is not much to see in Torcello except for the old church, and the supposed "Throne of Atilla". However, the peace and tranquility of the island is not to be found anywhere else in Venice! Torcello is also home to a very expensive Cipriani restaurant. But just walking around on these islands is a nice enough experience. If you've had enough of the hype and the other tourists, hop off the vaporetto at 'Cimitero', Venice's graveyard for a peaceful walk. There are many famous tombs, and the section dedicated to deceased children is particularly haunting. There is also a free toilet there.
While going through Venice, make sure you take in the beauty of it all. Walk through the alley ways, and take the water taxi to different parts of the island, sometimes at night you can just go sit in an open area and watch locals and tourists passing by. It is wonderful. There are many museums and churches that are around the city that allow tourists to go in a visit. They are many great sights to keep you busy throughout your visit.
The “Secret Itineraries in Doge's Palace” worth a visit, take the visitor into the most secret and fascinating rooms in the Palace. It's better to book in advance.
Because Venice is now pretty much only inhabited by tourists and people serving the trade, it gets very quiet by 21:00 and there is very little to do in the evening (outside of eating). There are a few exceptions, like some classical music concerts, which most probably only play Vivaldi.
If you would like to have a guide to show up the highlights of Venice, you can choose between many offers. There are walking or boat tours, focused on shopping or history or for art lovers, and many itineraries.
Take photos, using your camera or phone on every corner of Venice will inspire you. And if you have taken good pictures, consider entering the photo competition "OneDayInVenezia", running all year round, awarding monthly winners, and dedicated to amateur photographers. The Grand Prize is a weekend in Venice, trip included.
Send a postcard or even better, an entire letter dedicated to a loved one (the old "snail mail" one, not the electronic variety)! Venice has a long, celebrated tradition in postal services, paper and written communication in general (including one of the earliest medieval book printing houses).
Venice it's also Riviera del Brenta old canals. The Riviera del Brenta is famous for its extraordinary Palladian villas along the Brenta river, its museums and historical buildings and it is 40 km (25 miles) from Venice. This Riviera and its mainland include 7 small cities: Stra, Fiesso d’Artico, Dolo, Fossò, Mira, Oriago and Malcontenta.
These places are good for cycling excursions and to see antique Palladian Villas built on the Brenta river. In Stra village, there is the famous gardens of Villa Pisani and the museum of the shoes is in Villa Foscarini Rossi. In this last museum you can admire 1,500 models of Italian-made shoes created in local factories for major brands including Fendi, Genny, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Ungaro, Anne Kleyn, Richard Tyles and Vera Wang.

Football: Venezia FC were promoted in 2024, so they now play soccer in Serie A, the top tier. Their home ground Stadio Pier Luigi Penzo (capacity 11,000) is on Sant'Elena, connected by streets to the main east island.
Venice is home to two major (and expanding) public universities, Università Ca' Foscari Venezia and Università Iuav di Veneziadead link. There are possibly hundreds of smaller schools in the city. Neither university exploits its name for merchandising, and "Università degli Studi di Venezia" sweatshirts for sale at stalls are not only unlicensed, but there is no single university in the city with that name to begin with.
This is a huge city article, so detailed listings go in the district articles. This article should only provide a brief overview.

Venice has always been a city of merchants. Consequently, most of the Venetians working in Venice still own or work at a shop. The pride of the Republic of Venice was the extreme diversity and quality of goods and services which could be found in Venice. These days, however, mass tourism led Venice to be populated with many shops selling low-quality souvenirs. The local shops are suffering a lot from this situation and it is not easy to identify them within the crowd of shops selling harmful imported goods. Buying from the authentic local businesses has never been more important, as it is essential to the future of the Venetians and guarantees you to get the real thing and to have a much better experience of Venice. It is not easy, though. Thankfully, there is a social enterprise in Venice that works closely with the Venetian business owners (shops, restaurants and bars included). They have a certification process where the local artisan shops attest and commit to be selling products both authentic and sustainable as well as to give a 10% discount to the customers carrying a Venezia Autentica Friends' Pass (buyable online for only €10).
Euronet runs the majority of ATMs within tourist areas, which carry both hefty ATM fees and extortionate exchange rates. To avoid the extortionate exchange rates, you should reject the first currency conversion offered to you, which will allow you to default to your bank's rate. When possible, you should use ATMs provided by actual banks and financial institutions. The Credit Agricole ATM machines are notable because they do not charge ATM fees or offer excessive currency conversion rates for most Visa Debit and Prepaid cards.

There are reports that some travellers were cheated in this store, by being told that transaction didn't occur while using their credit card, and demanded cash while in fact transaction did occur properly and thus having made the travellers pay for the same item twice.

If you've come to Venice thinking that you won't be able to do a bit of designer shopping, think again. Just like in every major Italian city, you get the big fashion brand names. For label clothing shopping, the best area is that around the Piazza San Marco, where you can find Versace, MaxMara, Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton, Prada (and numerous more) big names. If you want to shop for clothing or accessories, though, you don't necessarily have to shop through the biggest names in fashion. In the Campo Santo Stefano and Calle della Mandola, you can get less famous or local boutiques, but you can find some excellent quality and/or unique items such as clothes, shoes, wallets or handbags.
Look for the hand-made paper and the exquisite miniature buildings made by Moro. Watch out for fakes; Moro "signs" his name on the back. Also, beware of fakes and "free" trips to neighboring Murano for its famous glass. (See article for details.)
Tourist Traps: "Coloured Pasta" and "Venetian Limoncello" (not the original napolitan one) are not Italian food, no Italian would ever eat them, they are particularly made for tourists. For typical regional Italian food in food shops, check the labels to discover where they have been made.
Don't miss the Rialto market on San Polo, the smallest sestiere. The Rialto market is for shoppers. To the east is an area of small shops and restaurants; to the west is the Rialto farmers' market. Shopping is slightly less expensive than in the tourist-filled Piazza San Marco.

A plate of cicchetti and two glasses of prosecco, enjoyed al fresco.
Sepe al nero, cuttlefish cooked with their ink lagoon, a traditional Venetian dish.
Venice is home to a rich and distinct regional cuisine and there are numerous wonderful restaurants, including a few Michelin starred ones. However, the city is also home to many more mediocre eateries that will not shy away from serving you undercooked pasta for overinflated prices. This has led to it becoming widely regarded that the restaurants in Venice serve food of a quality and in quantities much lower than anywhere else in Italy. However, with a bit of caution and planning ahead you'll have many excellent experiences eating in Venice. Rule of thumb is that if there's a waiter outside pimping for business, it's probably best avoided!
One of Venice's trademark foods is Sepe al nero, cuttlefish and its ink. This intense black ink serves as a sauce and ingredient for polenta (corn meal), risotto (rice), and pasta. These dishes are normally indicated by the Italian words "nella seppia" (in cuttlefish), "alla seppia" (in the style of cuttlefish), or "nero di seppia," (black of the cuttlefish). For example, Polenta Nella Seppia is fried corn meal with the black ink of a cuttlefish. Despite the intensity in color, the ink has a surprisingly mild taste. Other Veneitian dishes include Fegato alla veneziana, chopped liver, cooked with chopped onions and Sarde in saor: fried sardines, dipped in fried onion, raisins and pine nuts, spices and vinegar.
For snacks, Venice has its own version of tapas, the cicchetti. Often paired with wine you will find that most restaurants and bars serve some variant of it. There are also many 'bacaros in Venice, a wine bar that serves a wide selection of cicchetti to go along.
What Venice is not famous for is its pizza, Italy is a big country and pizza is generally more of a speciality in its southern parts. While there are restaurants serving it and some even do it acceptably, don't compare it to other parts of the country. If you really are craving for pizza, try the local chain Pizzeria Ae Oche. Meals are plentiful and prices reasonable, look to spend between €5-10 for a pizza depending on how exotic your selection is. For Americans, you can find a place called Quanto Basta pizza that serves an American-style pizza with pepperoni and french fries.
Be careful when the prices are on a weight basis (typically by the "etto", abbreviated "/hg". or 100 g). One dish can easily contain 400g of fish or meat (almost a pound) - coming to 4 times the indicated base price! Restaurants might offer low prices for food on their menus that they advertise outside the entrance, but they will sometimes compensate this by charging high prices for drinks (which is naturally *not* advertised). €5 for 33 cl of beer is not uncommon. Le Bauta, an eatery on Fond del Gaffaro, is a good example. Also, please make sure that you get your change back after payment as sometimes it may be 'forgotten' by the waiters.
To save money at lunch, eat standing up - that's what Venetians themselves do. Every cafe, trattoria, osteria, enoteca or whatever it chooses to call itself is stocked at lunchtime with cicchetti - Venetian tapas, including tramezzini (triangular sandwiches on white bread), bite-sized rolls with various cold cuts, polpette (fried balls of minced fish or meat) and assorted antipasti. Order by pointing at what you want on the glass shelves, and wash the whole thing down with a glass of wine (un' ombra) or a spritz (made with, in order of bitterness and alcohol content, Aperol, Campari or Select). Bear in mind that as soon as you allow yourself to sit at the table and be waited on, instead of ordering and consuming your food at the counter, the prices for the same items go up - you can end up paying double. If you look at the (government-mandated) chart of prices stapled to the wall near the bar, you'll see 2 columns of numbers, accommodating this arrangement. However, sitting is worth it if you plan on staying a while. Some places will also serve free bread and water for seated patrons, but then there is usually also a small charge (€1-3 per person) for "pane e coperto" (bread and cover charge).
There are a few supermarkets in the city, so if you are in the need to save some money, these are an option as they serve a wide array of prepared and semi-prepared food. On the main street from the station to the Rialto bridge there is a Coop and a Billa supermarket. There are still many small bakery shops and "biavaroli" where you can buy bread, cheese etc., particularly near the Rialto market area. For fresh fruit (including chilled coconut) watch out for the street market stalls. There is always a boat parked in the canal on campo San Barnaba selling fruit and vegetables into the late hours.
If you want to buy water (Venice has excellent free tap water easily accessible at the numerous fountains located outside throughout the city) it is usually cheapest to get it at the supermarkets: there are Billa or Co-op stores located throughout the city, though supermarkets are often "disguised" in nondescript buildings in Venice for space limitations.
Head to the Dorsoduro area of Venice if you want to save a few euros. It is located on the south side of the city. It has the highest concentration of places where locals, especially students, go to eat. Generally staying away from the main squares will be the cheapest option. If you're willing and able to walk around the town, some back streets offer the best food for the lowest price. Seeing the city from this vantage point is a lot of fun too!
The Rialto food markets are an absolute must for fruit, vegetables and cheese, but most of all for the huge range of seafood, much of it fresh out of the lagoon and still moving! There are a variety of small stores around the city that sell fruits and vegetables, but tourists will be hard-pressed to find them. Anything else you will find in the one of the few supermarkets in the city.
There are 6-7 Michelin star restaurants in Venice, with prices to match.
Near the Rialto bridge there's a row of restaurants with tables by the canal, where you can have the quintessential Venice experience of dining by the canal lights. Although they do have waiters outside bugging you, some have pretty acceptable quality for price, which is almost always expensive anyway.
You will find ice cream all over the city, and you will hardly survive a hot summer day without it. Prices are € for one scoop, € for three scoops.
Aperol Spritz, a small cicheti and gorgeous Venetian backdrop.
A classic Billini, as served at Harry's Bar where it was invented.
The typical local drink loved by all Venetians is Spritz, which is a mix of liquor and Prosecco with sparkling water to top it off. Aperol Spritz is by far the most common but there are variants with Campari or Select too. Almost all bars in the city serves it with prices range from €5 to €12, depending on how close you are to the main tourist arteries. Spritz are usually paired with cicheti, the Venetian version of tapas.
Another famous drink is the Bellini was invented in Harry's Bar in Venice. It is a mix of white peach juice and Prosecco (the ubiquitous Venetian Champagne-like sparkling wine). Fermented at a low temperature Prosecco develops amylic aromas (fruit drops), though these perhaps mix better with fruit juices than does the more austere Champagne. Classic Bellinis should never be made with Champagne. Although by normal standards expensive, a Bellini in Harry's Bar (€17 for a  oz drink is obscene) is still much cheaper than on the terraces of similar '5-star' establishments in the city.
A small Grappa is a common way to end meals, but be careful as it is brandy with 30 to 60 per cent alcohol.
Beer in a small pub is about €5 for a pint (birra media).
A cafe in Piazza di San Marco.
Coffee is everywhere in Venice, and both Venetians and the tourists avail themselves of the opportunities, usually by downing a quick dose at the counter (see warning about sit-down prices above). Rule of thumb: the bigger (and shinier) the espresso machine, the better the result. Espresso, the real Italian, is about €1 at the bar, €2 at a table.
E Rosa Salva. One of the favorites is the mini-chain "E Rosa Salva", with three locations in the center - on C. Fiubera (from Piazza San Marco, take the underpass in the middle of the arcade, cross the bridge and take second right off C. Fabbri), Merceria S. Salvadore (off the campo of the same name), and right on Campo San Zanipolo (to the right of the church looking from the canal); the last one is a gelateria as well. For your €1 you'll get exactly 2 and a half sips at the bottom of a small cup, with rich crema and no bitterness. Assorted house-made sweets are €.
There are a number of fantastic bars in Venice, most are small places with lots of charm. Bars that stay open after 23:00 are clustered around a few few late-night drinking areas in Venice. Notice that Piazza San Marco is not one of them, although it is very pleasant with many people wandering around late.
The actual late night scene is in either Campo Santa Margherita, where the student crowds from nearby the University Ca' Foscari in Dorsoduro hangs out; upscale Erbaria on the West side of the Rialto Bridge where the main vegetable market is held during the day and along Fondamenta de la Misericordia in Cannaregio. The bars along Fondamenta de la Misericordia is anchored by Paradiso Perduto, which features live music on most nights. There's usually youths cruising (in motor boats) along the canal, blaring Italian rap songs in Italian from the loudspeakers.
Pub crawls are best planned in advance, as there's a real risk of wasting an hour or two wandering aimlessly in search of a watering hole that's open, especially midweek. Most bars close at 1 AM, so make sure you notice which ones are open until 2 AM or 3 AM.
There's next to no night clubs in proper Venice, to get to those you have to follow the locals and head over the bridge into Mestre, or hop on the boat to Lido. Those looking for LGBT nightlife in Venice will be disappointed. Hop on the train to Padua instead.
There are two Irish pubs in Venice. One is located along the Strada Nova in Cannaregio; the other one is the Inishark just before Campo Santa Maria Formosa.
This is a huge city article, so detailed listings go in the district articles. This article should only provide a brief overview.
The Palazzo Civran and Grand Canal at dusk. This 15th-century building that was substantially altered in the early 17th century now houses the Guardia di Finanza.
Due to the historic city's constrained area and international popularity hotels are expensive. Bed and Breakfasts and guesthouses offer better rates. Real budget solutions (like camping and hostels) can be found in Mestre (mainland Venice) and on the island of Lido. Alternative accommodation can also be found on the island of Murano. These are worth considering since historic centre is quite well-connected with buses and ferries, so staying further from the centre is not such a big problem.
In the last few years, holiday or short rentals apartments have increased in number and quality, now you can rent (minimum stay is usually 3 nights) a Palazzo on the Grand Canal as a little flat near Rialto.
As of Sept 2021, Venice has 4G from Iliad and TIM, and 5G from Vodafone and Wind Tre.
The city has been steadily building out the municipal Wi-Fi network, which now covers almost the entire area around the Grand Canal and some of the larger squares in the center. You can buy guest access at approximately €5 per day at the same unified Venezia Unica site where the transport and museum passes are sold. However if you only need occasional access, it may not be worth buying this as you can get free wifi at most accommodations and at a lot of the museums in Venice.
Venice has several internet cafes, but they are much more expensive than the rest of Europe with prices for an hour of access around €6. Wi-Fi is only available at some of them. There's a wonderful pub, Cafe Blue in Dorsoduro, which has free (password-protected) wi-fi. Buy a spritz and a panini and go to town.
At the Telecom Italia Future Centre in Campo San Salvatore (San Marco) you can browse for free for one hour, once registered with your ID card.
To use an Internet cafe, buy a mobile SIM card or get a contract for an Internet connection. Personal identification is needed by law in Italy. Internet cafes will not let you use computers without a passport or national ID card.
Calle Delle Botteghe on San Marco 2970 Venezia is a pretty art gallery type internet cafe with a book shop. It is on the expensive side with €3 for 15 min but you can just go in and play chess with a glass of wine.
Venice is considered a safe city. You have to take the habitual travellers' precautions however. Keep your valuable items (like wallet and passport) close to you because there are pickpockets, especially in more crowded parts of the city.
In case of need, you can dial free of charge on any phone 112 (no area code needed) to contact Carabinieri or 113 (no area code needed) to contact the Police.
Sometimes, in the evening and night hours, Campo Bella Vienna and Campo Santa Margherita are places for violence, so be careful if you stay here.
Do not touch or swim in the extremely polluted water in the canals. Some of that water comes from the surrounding Venetian Lagoon, but the rest comes straight from toilets and kitchen sinks. Venice has begun to install septic tanks in buildings, but much of the city has not yet been upgraded and releases untreated sewage directly into the canals. Avoid bathing yourself, touching the water, immersing feet, etc. in the canals looking for refreshment in the hot season. Also, at night there is a risk of falling into the water, as there are many alleys which end in the water but have little or no lighting. In the warmest months, these conditions can sometimes generate foul odors. Choose other times to visit if they might ruin what should be a highly enjoyable stay.
Current regulations forbid certain behaviour, including bathing in the canals and walking around in a swimsuit or bare-chested. Violations are subject to fines up to €500 and being banned from the city for the next 48 hours, even if you have a prepaid hotel room and non-refundable tickets to events. More information is available on #EnjoyRespectVenezia website.
You can reach the emergency medical service dialing free of charge on any phone 118 (no area code needed, conversation will be recorded) to have assistance and an ambulance sent to you.
Chemists' shops (Italian: Farmacie) are all around the town. They are open 24 hr a day, 7 days a week on a rotational basis: outside the shop there's always the list of operating ones with timetables, address and phone number. If you need a special drug you might be asked to book it in advance if it's not in common use. Note that the commercial name or brand of your prescription might differ from your country of origin, and make sure that the medication you want is available in the EU.
Much of Venice's famous architecture is extremely old and showing the effects of being mishandled by the flood of tourists, some small fraction of whom behave as if they were in a modern holiday resort complex instead of an ancient city. To preserve the wonder of this city for future generations, everyone needs to treat the city's infrastructure as if you were in a large, open-air art museum.
The city officials state that it is necessary to enforce rules that preserve the city's urban cleanliness and make sure visitors behave themselves. The following tips will come in handy:
Walk on the right side of the street; especially on narrower streets, you'll contribute to making your and other’s walk faster, safer, and tidier. Do it always, even if the street is empty. Do not block the flow of traffic, especially on bridges.
Do not bathe, dive into, or swim in the canals; it is not only dangerous and unhealthy (the canals are the city's ancient open-air sewage system, not to mention the mud churned up by the motorboat traffic and the risk of being hit by one), but it is also punishable by a fine of €350, and the police can immediately ban you from the area.
Do not sit down or lie down on the ground, on monuments, on steps, on bridges, on buildings (or even lean against them), or sit in public on anything else except chairs and benches made for this purpose, and especially do not sit on the ground to eat. Picnics are banned in all public areas. They are punishable by a fine of €100–200, and the police can immediately ban you from the area. If you need to rest or want to watch the people going by, look for one of Venice's bright red public benches to sit (but not lie down) on.
Do not camp or sleep in public areas; the fine is €200, and the police will immediately ban you from the area.
Do not walk around bare-chested or in swimwear; this is punishable by a fine of up to €250.
Do not feed the birds or other wildlife and do not litter; the fines go up to €500. It may seem strange that feeding the birds has a higher potential fine than disrespectful stunts like climbing on top of a monument, but the city is located inside a fragile wetlands ecosystem, so please exercise more than the usual care.
The municipality of Venice maintains an up-to-date list of rules and regulations in English and several other langues at their official website.
The unfortunate side-effect of the small alleys which make Venice such a delight to visit is that it is remarkably easy to get lost. Even maps provided by hotels are frequently inaccurate, and the maze-like structure of the city can become very confusing. The tight cluster of little islands that comprise Venice is completely surrounded by the Lagoon, so it is not possible, no matter how lost you become, to leave Venice on foot. Sooner or later you will come upon a piazza that you can locate on your map.
One tip: as you cross bridges, note the house numbers before and after. A small change probably means you are on the same island/district and have crossed a "new" canal. A major change means you are now on another island. Most maps clump islands together into their voting districts, there are many more islands than districts.
One piece of assistance is to look for directional signs. These will be marked "Per" and then with the name of a prominent location or bridge in the city, complete with an arrow pointing in the relevant direction. Hence, to get to the Rialto bridge, the signs to follow are marked "Per Rialto". Those to St Mark's Square read "Per S Marco", and those to the train station "Per Ferrovia" (there are some others as well). Having oriented yourself to the nearest landmark, direction-finding can thus become (slightly) easier.
Remember, though, that the signs to read are the official ones. Graffiti will occasionally give other directions, frequently incorrect ones.
That said, some argue that getting lost in Venice is part of the experience of the city. The number of photogenic canals, hidden restaurants and shops where glass blowing is done almost guarantees that there is no such thing as a "dull neighbourhood". Additionally, the public transport means that it is relatively easy to arrive at the intended destination even after one has emerged from the web of alleys in a totally unexpected place.
While Venice may not get more tourists than other famous Italian destinations such as Rome and Florence, the narrowness of streets and open areas may at times make Venice feel uncomfortably crowded during (but not only) the peak seasons, at the San Marco sestiere, the surroundings of the Rialto bridge and the streets leading from Venezia Santa Lucia and Piazzale Roma to San Marco. Walking by itself can be difficult, let alone snapping a good photo, using a public lavatory, or sitting at a decent cafe or restaurant.
To avoid the worst of the crowds, unless it is winter, try to visit the San Marco and Rialto bridge areas during early morning and late evening. During the late morning and afternoon, stay away as far as possible from this area, for instance walking around west Santa Croce, north Cannaregio, eastern Castello and Giudecca. Alternatively, take day trips to places outside central Venice such as Burano, the Lido, Padua or Vicenza, or simply take the opportunity to refresh in your hotel.

Most of the consulates listed here are only honorary consulates, so can only offer limited consular services.

Metropolitan Venice has many interesting destinations far from the Venetian crowds. Around the Venetian lagoon are other smaller islands, which have since been deserted but are worth a visit. There is also the Lido, which is a long narrow island with more modern buildings, hosting a youth hostel and a hotel.
Burano — Island famous for lace, textiles and colorfully painted houses.
Lido — The island of tranquility, a beach district 10 minutes by boat from San Marco, and where the Venice movie festival is held.
Mestre — Town in the mainland, but still a part of Venice.
Murano — Nearby island famous for its glassware.
San Lazzaro — Nearby island with Armenian monastery and impressive art collection, some world class pieces.
Torcello — Nearby island with a 7th-century basilica church and an archeological museum.
Riviera del Brenta — Palladian villas around Brenta River, 20 minutes from Venice by car, or you can get there via biking tours with a local bike hire shop.
Lake Garda — An easy day trip by train, it is Italy's largest lake and stunning in scenery.
Po Delta — Peaceful and scenic marshy area southwest of Venice with bike trails.
Eraclea — Typical for its pinewood and Laguna del Mort, 55 minutes from Venice by car or by boat.
Jesolo — Jesolo is one of the most important beaches in Italy, just 45 minutes from Venice by car or by boat (ferry from Treporti to Venice).
