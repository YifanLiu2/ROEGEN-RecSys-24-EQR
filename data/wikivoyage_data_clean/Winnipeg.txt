Winnipeg is Manitoba's capital and has more people than the rest of Manitoba combined. It stands midway on the Trans-Canada Highway and railway. With nearly 750,000 inhabitants (2021), The Peg is the metropolis for the Canadian Prairies and is as diverse as the majority of Canada.
Winnipeg is a "gateway to the West", and can be visited for its architecture, museums, and its broad retail market. Among major attractions are the Royal Canadian Mint, St Boniface Cathedral, and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. Winnipeg is off the tourist trail for most visitors to Canada, but the visitor will experience an authentic and friendly Canadian Prairie city which leaves many pleasantly surprised.
The name Winnipeg is a transcription of the western Cree word wi-nipe-k meaning "muddy waters"; the general area was populated for thousands of years by First Nations. The confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, nowadays known as The Forks, was a crossroads of canoe routes travelled by Aboriginal peoples prior to European contact. Winnipeg started out at this spot in 1738 as Fort Rouge, a French outpost for the fur trade. After the Seven Years' War, under the Hudson's Bay Company it became Fort Gibraltar and later Fort Garry. Many trails converged on the fort and later became streets, which is evident when you see the city's somewhat haphazard road layout.
In 1869–70, Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from Eastern Canada. This rebellion led to Manitoba's entry into the Canadian Confederation as Canada's fifth province in 1870. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city.
After the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway across Canada, Winnipeg became a major transportation hub and "Gateway to the West". The city experienced a boom during the early 20th century and for a while was Western Canada's major economic centre. Fortunately for the visitor, the economy slowed around the middle of the century, leaving intact a remarkable collection of period architecture, primarily in the city's downtown Exchange District.
Winnipeg is generally a very tolerant city and was the first large city in North America to elect an openly gay mayor. Winnipeg has several LGBT bars and a Pride festival every summer.
Winnipeg is a multicultural city. As of the 2021 census, visible minorities make up 34% of Winnipeg's population and Indigenous people 12%. Despite being only Canada's seventh-largest city, it has the largest populations of both First Nations and Métis (people of mixed European and First Nations ancestry, who form a distinct community within Canada) of any city in the country. Much of Winnipeg's population is of European descent, notably from Germany, Ukraine, France, Scandinavia and Poland. More than a hundred languages are spoken in Winnipeg. In fact, Winnipeg is home to Canada's largest French-speaking population west of Ontario and the Filipino language Tagalog is the second most prevalent mother tongue in Winnipeg. Nevertheless, 99% of the population speaks English fluently. The city celebrates its diversity with the Folklorama festival, the longest running multicultural event of its kind.

Corydon Avenue (Little Italy) Corydon Avenue and its surrounding neighbourhood are one of the city’s hot spots for shopping, dining or an afternoon of people-watching at one of the many sidewalk cafes and restaurants dotting the avenue. Corydon Avenue comes alive during warm summer evenings as crowds of people gather to meet, greet and to have some of the best food, gelati and sushi in the city.
Downtown Downtown Winnipeg is centred around Portage & Main. Portage Ave is the city's busiest thoroughfare. Winnipeg Square, Canada Life Centre (formerly MTS Centre and Bell MTS Place), Portage Place. On Main St are Winnipeg's City Hall, Union Station, the Manitoba Museum, the Planetarium, the Centennial Concert Hall and the Winnipeg Railway Museum.
Exchange District The Exchange District is a National Historic Site in the downtown area. The Exchange District today thrives as one of Winnipeg's commercial and cultural centres. Winnipeg's theatre district is also in the Exchange District, home to the Manitoba Theatre Centre and Centennial Concert Hall. Old Market Square is also in the Exchange which hosts the Jazz Winnipeg Festival and the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival.
The Forks The Forks is a historic site and meeting place in downtown Winnipeg at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, and has played an important role in the city's development. The Forks Market contains many specialty food shops, fresh fruit and vegetables, and many ethnic shops and restaurants. There are often buskers in and around the Forks. Attractions include the Manitoba Theatre for Young People, the International Children's Festival, one of the largest skateparks in Canada, the world's longest skating rink (winter only), a well-maintained expanse of riverside park, and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights which opened in 2014.
Osborne Village Osborne Village has evolved into a neighbourhood filled with characters. It is Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhood, and is home to one of Winnipeg's most vibrant collection of stores and restaurants with over 175 businesses calling Osborne Village home.
St. Boniface Covering the southeast part of the city, it is home to the Franco-Manitoban community. It features such landmarks as the Cathédrale de Saint Boniface (St. Boniface Cathedral), boul Provencher, the Provencher Bridge, Esplanade Riel, St. Boniface Hospital and the Université de Saint-Boniface. Every February Le Festival du Voyageur takes place outdoors at Parc Whittier Park and Fort Gibraltar.
West End A mostly residential area west of Downtown comprised of many small and unique neighbourhoods. The area is very ethnically diverse as is evidenced by the Portuguese, Greek, Vietnamese, Chinese, East Indian and Thai restaurants that line Ellice Ave and Sargent Ave, making it is one of the best areas for real ethnic food. The West End Cultural Centre is a major music venue that is worth a visit. The West End varies widely in wealth, and contains some of the most affluent neighbourhoods, and some of the poorest in the city. The neighbourhood has benefited from major revitalization and urban beautification projects.

Winnipeg is cold in the winter and if you plan on spending any time outside between November and April you should consider packing:
Toque/knit hat (make sure it covers the ears) or earmuffs
Gloves or mittens (or garbage mitts)
Scarf (optional, but recommended)
Ski pants (snow pants)
Boots (depending on what you will be doing)
If you are driving in Winnipeg during the winter, be sure your car is outfitted with a block heater and plug it in if leaving it overnight. Alternatively, ensure your CAA/AAA membership is up-to-date and have the phone number ready for when your car won't start.
Winnipeg has a humid continental climate with extremes of hot and cold. The longest day of the year lasts for over 16 hours, and the shortest day of the year lasts for 8 hours.
Winnipeg is ranked as Canada's second sunniest city year-round and second for clearest skies year-round. Summers are typically warm and often humid, particularly in July, with frequent nighttime thunderstorms. On average, Winnipeg has 45 days a year where the humidex (combined effect of heat and humidity) reaches above 30 °C. Winnipeg is also known for its high mosquito population, particularly during early summer. Dusk and dawn are the most active time for mosquitoes. June, late August and September tend to provide the most pleasant environment for summer visitors.
Spring and fall tend to be rather contracted seasons, each averaging a little over six weeks. In general, the weather during these seasons is highly variable and rapidly changing. It is typical for the day to start off quite cold in the morning, but heat up considerably in the afternoon. It can be difficult to judge how to dress during this time, so layers are the best option.
Winnipeg has the coldest winter temperatures of any city in North America with a population of over 100,000. Winters in Winnipeg are usually dry, and can feel colder due to the often windy conditions. The winters are long and overnight minima average below -15°C with rare extremes going down to near -40°C, though there is still much to enjoy during these months. Be sure to pay attention to the windchill (combined effect of cold and wind) which can drop below -40 °C/F (exposed skin freezes in less than 10 minutes). Snow cover can be expected from mid-November to late March. The city turns on what is arguably Canada's best display of Christmas lights from late November until well into January.

Map of Winnipeg (Edit GPX)
Winnipeg is a large, spread-out city and it can take a while to get around. Unlike most North American cities this size, there is no urban freeway network in the city. Public transportation service is adequate to good in the inner part of the city and on main suburban roads, but only fair to poor in outer suburban areas and some bus routes run only infrequently during the evening or on weekends. Traffic jams, particularly in the downtown area, are common during the rush hour periods which are generally from 7:30–9AM and 3:30–5:30PM Monday to Friday. Much of Winnipeg's downtown real estate is devoted to parking, with ubiquitous and cheap surface lots continuing for multi-block stretches. It is worth considering renting a car, especially if any excursions outside of the city are planned.
Highways: Winnipeg is one of the first Canadian cities of its size to have a ring road (the Perimeter Highway) which provides a by-pass for travellers on the Trans-Canada Highway. Within the city, the Trans-Canada Highway follows regular city streets.
Street names: All streets in Winnipeg have names. Major routes will have both names and route numbers, but will almost always be called by the name. A notable exception is Route 90, which is commonly called Kenaston in the southern half of the city and Route 90 in the northern half. Many streets change names as they wind through the city, which can be extremely confusing, even to locals. The most known example is Route 62, which starts as Salter in the north end of the city, but as it goes south becomes Isabel, Balmoral, Colony, Memorial, Osborne, Dunkirk, and finally Dakota in the south end, with no clear indication when it changes.
One-way streets: Many downtown streets are one-way, which can make navigating downtown quite confusing. One-way streets are rare outside of downtown, except around Polo Park.
No left turns: Many busy streets limit left-hand turns, particularly during rush hour. This is especially prevalent downtown, but is common in the rest of the city as well. In many cases, though, a left turn from a one-way to a one-way is allowed.
Confusion corner: This intersection is mainly where Osborne St and Pembina Hwy (Routes 62 and 42) meet, but other streets connect as well, and there are bus-only lanes. There are many lanes going different directions, and it can be very confusing to know which lane you need to be in, which has given the intersection the name "confusion corner".
North End: The area of the city just north of downtown is known as the North End. This is the poorest part of the city and extra precautions should be taken when travelling through here, especially at night (though most crime is gang-related, rarely involving innocent bystanders). There is a very noticeable drop in the quality of infrastructure when you cross from downtown into the North End, but it is also a very sudden change so it is important to be mindful of your surroundings.
The city operates a bus service with routes running throughout the city, including one bus rapid transit (BRT) line:
Winnipeg Transit, ☏ 311, +1 204-287-7433 (automated schedules through Telebus), toll-free: +1-877-311-4974. Service is generally good on major routes in the inner city but only fair to poor in the outer suburban areas. The Winnipeg Transit's website includes schedules and the helpful Navigo Trip Planner.
Winnipeg Transit Plus, ☏ +1 204-986-5722. Available for disabled persons.
The cash fare is $ for adults, or $ for youth 6–16 and seniors (65 years or older), for which identification is required (as of May 2021). Children 11 and under are free with a fare-paying adult. Drivers will only accept exact change in cash. A transfer can be requested when you pay your fare, which entitles you to ride as many buses as you like within the following 60 minutes. You may also purchase paper passes at a reduced rate of $ ($ for youth and $ for seniors), in strips of 5 or 10, at almost any convenience store. These fares also apply to reloadable electronic peggo card.
There are a variety of passes available, which provide discounts of 22-38%. They can be purchased at any convenience store. The Max 5 pass, available only for adult fares, can be used Monday to Friday, and the Superpass can be used from Monday to Sunday.
Bomber FanFare allows you to ride Transit from the stadium for free by showing your valid game day ticket after Bomber home games. Transit also operates shuttle services to the Bomber stadium.
Bike and Bus offers bike racks on the 60, 160 and 162 buses during the summer free of charge. St. Vital Shopping Centre and Osborne Junction have bike lockers.
DART provides request bus service to residents living in selected areas of South and South East Winnipeg.
Park & Ride allows you to park in designated areas and then catch a Transit bus.
Shuttle services are offered for occasions such as the Folk Festival and the Red River Ex.

By law, fares are non-negotiable and determined by a meter. Smoking and open alcohol are not allowed. The most common taxi model is the smaller Toyota Prius.
Winnipeg Taxicab Tariff: Starting fee (as of May 2021): $ with 100 m, then $ for each additional 100 m + $ for each  seconds of time. Whenever the taxi stops, there's a "waiting time charge" of $ for each  seconds of metered waiting time. A tip of 15–20% is customary, but sales taxes are included. A 10-km ride would cost $ plus tip.

Uber. (updated Jul 2022)
Driving is the easiest way to get around Winnipeg. On-street parking, which ranges from $1–2/hr can usually be found in popular areas if you are willing to search. During rush hour, most of these spaces will turn into no stopping zones in order to facilitate traffic flow. If these are unavailable, there are parkades or parking lots which will provide a variety of hourly rates. These are roughly twice as expensive as street parking, but they are all over the downtown area. If visiting The Forks, there is a large parkade and two lots which provide free parking for visitors.
Auto theft is a serious problem in Winnipeg. Anti-theft devices are strongly recommended, especially immobilizers. Never leave your vehicle running and never leave any objects visible inside, especially aftermarket stereo equipment.
Cyclists must ride on and obey the laws of the road.
From 30 minutes before sunset until 30 minutes after sunrise, bicycles must have a white front light and a red or amber rear light or reflector.
Cyclists must use hand signals to indicate a turn.
Cyclists are prohibited from wearing earphones.
Cyclists are prohibited from riding while intoxicated.
Children riding in a bike-mounted baby seat must wear a helmet.
Helmets are mandatory for children under 18.
Bicycles are allowed on all Winnipeg roads, though drivers encountered may feel differently. The City of Winnipeg provides a cycling map which is available online or at one of many bicycle shops. Some roads have bicycle lanes (shared with buses) and sharrows. Suggested cycling routes are marked by road signs, but may venture into residential areas with many stop signs. Riding on sidewalks is illegal, but this law is rarely enforced. The most problematic areas are typically bridges where no bicycle infrastructure exists, such as the Midtown Bridge and the Louise Bridge. Cyclists may be better off walking their bikes on the sidewalk on these bridges during rush hours. Bicycle theft is common throughout all areas of the city. Seats and wheels should be secured with a sturdy lock.
Some dedicated active transportation paths exist. Many of these will follow along Winnipeg's rivers, making for a very scenic, but meandering, ride. Spring flooding may affect the conditions on routes near the rivers. The Forks makes an excellent starting/stopping point for scenic bike rides—many paths begin and end there, and there are many restaurants and patios to relax in before and after rides. Some suggested scenic routes are:
Along the Assiniboine River, between The Forks and Assiniboine Park (approximately 20 km round-trip). The north side of the river will take cyclists starting from The Forks past the Legislature, through Wolseley, and near Polo Park mall. The south side of the river will take cyclists starting from Assiniboine Park along Wellington Cres (one of the richest areas of the city) and through Osborne Village.
Along the Red River, between The Forks and the Bridge Drive-In (a locally famous ice cream shop) (approximately 15 km round-trip). This path is almost entirely on active transportation paths, going through natural areas and recreation parks in the Riverview area.
From The Forks to Whittier Park (approximately 5 km round-trip). This route will go over Esplanade Riel to Whittier Park in St. Boniface, which contains the reconstructed Fort Gibraltar. This route can be extended by following Tache Ave south to Marion St, which will take cyclists past the St. Boniface Cathedral and the St. Boniface Museum.
The Duff Roblin Parkway Trail (approximately 50 km one-way). Starting in the south of the city, this trail follows the Red River Floodway around the east side of the city to Birds Hill Provincial Park, 24 km north of the city. This trail is a peaceful gravel path through the prairie with no intersections. There are no amenities along this trail until you enter the park.
In January and February, the River Trail is available and can be ridden on bicycle (it has an ice trail for skaters and a packed snow trail for walkers and cyclists).
Many of the paths beside the river will also include "monkey trails"—unofficial trails that offer some challenge to mountain bikers. Due to frequent flooding and erosion, these may include muddy sections, fallen trees, and steep drop-offs into the river.
In the winter, snow and ice on roads can make cycling treacherous. Major routes, especially downtown, will be cleared quickly and will have sand applied, which will help with safety but also make for a messy ride. These conditions will generally last from December to March. Bike paths and lanes may take much longer to be cleared, if they are cleared at all. The right-hand lane is often the iciest, and frostbite is a reality for the poorly equipped rider.
In springtime (March and April), melting snow can create very large puddles and potholes and render off-road trails unusable.
Woodcock Cycleworks, 433 St. Mary's Road, ☏ +1 204-253-5896, toll-free: +1-866-211-5795. M-F 10AM-8PM; Sa 10AM-5PM; Su 11AM-5PM. Rentals can be booked online or in-store. Mountain bikes, road bikes, fat bikes and hybrids available. $30-50.
Winnipeg is generally not a very walkable city. Because municipal law mandates that all new buildings must contain a lot of parking between the sidewalk and the building, pedestrians will be confronted with a morass of cars in all directions. Winnipeg's main arteries all have boulevards and are extremely wide by world standards, with Main St having ten lanes where it meets Portage Ave downtown. However, this pedestrian-unfriendliness is primarily perceived rather than real. Virtually all streets contain sidewalks on both sides running for the street's entire length and stoplight crossings are frequent even on highways.
Walking across Portage & Main is prohibited and physically impeded by concrete barricades. Pedestrians must cross this famous intersection through an underground concourse, which has a variety of entry points in or near the office towers on all four corners.
Walking distance from Portage & Main to:
The Forks: 10–15 minutes.
St. Boniface: 15–20 minutes.
Osborne Village: 20 minutes.
Corydon Ave: 30 minutes.
Interesting walks in central Winnipeg:
Exchange District, all around.
Broadway from Osborne to Main.
Osborne St from River to Pembina.
River Walks along the Red and Assiniboine Rivers (notably from the Legislature to The Forks).
Esplanade Riel from The Forks to St. Boniface.
Tache Ave and Provencher Ave in St. Boniface.
As it can get very cold during Winnipeg's winters, the downtown area has a network of tunnels and skywalks. The Skywalk is a system of 14 skyways and 7 tunnels connecting 38 buildings and allowing for a maximum protected walk of 2 km. As far east as the Fairmont Hotel east of Main St all the way west to One Canada Centre on Portage Ave (across from The Bay), it connects you to all of the buildings around Portage & Main, Winnipeg Square, Cityplace and Portage Place malls, the Millennium Library (Winnipeg's central library branch) and the MTS Centre arena. It has many shops along the way, making travelling during the winter a lot easier.
