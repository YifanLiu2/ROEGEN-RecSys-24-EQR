Montana Hall at Montana State University
Bozeman is a city in Montana's Yellowstone Country. Set in the middle of the Rocky Mountains, this college town is a place for experiencing the great outdoors around the year, and for those days the weather makes you want to stay indoors there are a number of museums and galleries to explore.
Bozeman is a picturesque city in Gallatin County, Montana. It is the largest city in Gallatin County and is the county seat. Bozeman residents are known as Bozemanites.
With a population of 56,000 in 2022, Bozeman is the fourth largest city in the state. The city is named after John M. Bozeman, founder of the Bozeman Trail.
Bozeman is home to Montana State University. The population of the city nearly doubles during school semesters. Lodging may be difficult to find at the beginning of the school year, graduation and any time the Bobcats have a home football game.
Bozeman sees a steady stream of visitors for its outdoor activities—not just hiking, kayaking, and mountain climbing, but also winter sports like skiing and snowboarding, popular among locals and students as well as travellers. In fact, Bozeman once expressed interest in hosting the 2026 Winter Olympics.
One of the inspirations and main themes for the writing of the 1974 best-selling book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a road trip by motorcycle, from Minneapolis to San Francisco with a stopover at Bozeman, described with considerable detail by the author Robert Maynard Pirsig with his son Chris.

The "Barmuda Triangle" consisted of three dive bars arranged around a back lot between Main Street and Babcock at 8th Ave. The Scoop faced Main Street and must have been one of the oldest bars in town with a few pool tables, a few slot machines and TVs for the game. Now there's just The Haufbrau, equally as old - if not older - offering a small stage for locals and even a few out-of-towners to dish out their songcraft with anything from saws to buckets to fiddles or guitars. Great, friendly crowd unless you arrive before the local rednecks get sloshed. And The Molly Brown, the biggest of these three, with a pool hall, poker tables and a couple rows of slot machines. Montana being one of those rare states that allows machine gambling, you might as well try your hand while passing through. A quick fifteen bucks would not be unheard of, but a vanished fifty is far more likely. All three of these bars are of eclectic crowd; college students, Montana hippies, construction workers, out-of-work ranchers, divorcees, and that one guy who operates under the illusion that cowboys still exist.
