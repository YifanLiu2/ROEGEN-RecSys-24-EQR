Being the capital of the country most, if not all major roadways in Algeria begin and end in Algiers. So getting into Algiers is quite easy. However, the infrastructure of Algerian roadways is not highly regarded so arriving by road might not be the most desirable option. There are a number of road projects around the country that are aimed at improving the infrastructure, most notably the east–west highway running from Annaba in the east to Oran in the west, of course coming through Algiers.
Be careful about traffic jams, especially in downtown Algiers. There are almost no traffic lights. Lights are replaced by policemen. There are police and military checkpoints almost in every municipality. Slowing down is highly recommended. Utilization of mobile phones when driving is strictly prohibited. Be sure to have your seat belts on.
La Gare Routière, Algiers's central bus terminus, in the commune of Hussein Dey (7-10 min drive from downtown), offers a plethora of bus services to most major Algerian cities and towns cheaply and efficiently. Most of the coaches used are modern and air-conditioned so the rides are, more often than not, comfortable. However, there are a few old coaches still in service, so try to avoid those, for the ride won't be as pleasant.
For long distances such as Algiers-Tammanrasset or Algiers-Annaba travelling by plane is recommended due the long duration.

Algiers is a large city, so the best way to get around by foot is to plan your route before setting out.

Algiers is a relatively safe place. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and dangers of visiting Algiers, as well as how to stay safe while in the city.
First and foremost, visitors should be aware of the security situation in Algeria, and the political situation in the region. The country has seen its share of violence in the late 2010s/early 2020s, so it is important to stay informed about any potential security threats and to always be aware of your surroundings.
Visitors should also be aware of the local laws and customs. For example, it is important to respect the country's religious beliefs and to dress appropriately when visiting mosques or other places of worship. Additionally, drinking alcohol in public places is not allowed.
Visitors should also be aware of their surroundings and avoid traveling alone, especially at night. The streets of Algiers very quickly empty of women after around 18:00, and of almost all people by 20:00. It may not be unsafe, but it is eerie. It is also important to avoid carrying large amounts of cash or other valuable items, as well as leaving them in plain sight. It is also important to take common precautions such as keeping an eye on your belongings when in public places, as opportunistic bag snatching may occur.
