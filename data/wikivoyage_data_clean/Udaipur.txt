In 1568, the Mughal emperor Akbar captured Chittorgarh, and Udai Singh was forced to flee and establish the city of Udaipur. Udaipur remained the capital of the state of Mewar, which became a princely state of British India in 1818. After India's independence in 1947, Mewar was integrated into the state of Rajasthan.
People in Udaipur usually prefer wearing bright colored clothes. Colourful festivals and fairs depict the cultural prosperity of Udaipur.
