The town of Siem Reap (សៀមរាប), in northern Cambodia, is the primary access point for the Angkor Archaeological Park, just north of the city. It is quite laid-back and a pleasant place to stay while touring the temples. It is a nice compromise between observing Cambodian life and enjoying the amenities of modern services and entertainment, thanks to a large foreign community.
French colonial architecture still dominates the streetscape.
The name "Siem Reap" literally means "Siam Defeated". These days, however, the only rampaging hordes are the tourists heading to the Angkor Archaeological Park. This once quaint village has become the largest boom town and construction site in Cambodia. Since Siem Reap is a major tourist destination, prices in some instances are higher than elsewhere in Cambodia. Expect to receive almost constant offers for motodop and tuk-tuk rides, along with everything else which drivers may be able to offer to you.
Be sure to pick up your free Siem Reap Angkor Visitors Guide and the equally free and useful Siem Reap Pocket Guide from your hotel/guesthouse. It contains lots of info on Siem Reap and the Angkor Archaeological Park, including hotel/bar/restaurant/shop info, travel info, and maps. For the eco-sensitive tourist, check out Stay Another Day: Cambodia, a detailed guide with local spots that support the environment and community. Another address is the ConCERT tourist office, a local NGO committed to raising the standards of responsible tourism and eco-tourism activities and providing information on the causes and effects of poverty in Cambodia, volunteering opportunities and eco-tours.

Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport (SAI IATA). Opened in October 2023, this clean and cool space is the largest airport in Cambodia. Being 50 km out of town, travel to and from this new airport costs more (except for seats on the minibus) and takes much longer than to the old airport, which has closed. It has one terminal and is served by international flights from Bangkok (both airports), Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and various airports in Laos and Vietnam. Flights to Seoul, Kunming, and Shanghai are scheduled to begin by early 2024. Cambodia Angkor Air flies to Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville as well. US$8 per minibus seat, US$40 for private minivan transfer. (updated Oct 2023)
Bus is a common way for getting around Cambodia with a range of bus companies serving Siem Reap, with several daily departures and arrivals (especially from Phnom Penh). Premium operators includes Giant Ibis and VET Air Bus Express, while companies such as Larryta, Seila Angkor Express, E-Booking, Mey Hong and others offer economy options with Air Conditioning. Try to book at least the day before travel. Booking online is easier with BookMeBus and Camboticket1, as you can board with e-ticket with either of their services. Travel agents and guesthouses will do this for a US$1-2 fee per ticket. Buses tend to leave in the morning or early afternoon. There are also night buses on some routes.
Many buses terminate at an out-of-town bus station to the east of Siem Reap, from where travellers will need to take a tuk-tuk into town. This should cost no more than US$2, or maybe US$3 if you're not keen to drive a hard bargain. If arriving from the west, consider getting off the bus as it passes through town on National Road 6, say as it crosses the bridge over the river, before it reaches the bus station. If arriving from the east you have little choice but to face the touts.
Domestic services are frequent — for instance Phnom Penh is served by a dozen companies some of which have a departure every half hour during the day. The bus trip from the capital is 6-8 hours and tickets are around US$10 depending on the company. This is a well traveled route by both locals and tourists, but often an uncomfortable trip as buses will make many stops and go slow. A more expensive, but far more comfortable option is by Wi-Fi-equipped minibus (US$15 from Giant Ibis or US$12 from Mekong Express, 2020). Trip by minibus takes only 4-5 hours.

Other places with services include Kampong Cham, Soung, Battambang (US$6-8), Sisophon, Poipet (for Aranyaprathet, the main route from Thailand), Preah Vihear (US$12) and Anlong Veng (for Ban Pakard in Thailand). Destinations further away include Koh Kong (via Phnom Penh, a long journey), Sihanoukville (US$15-25) by a 10-12 hour overnight sleeping bus or daytime sitting bus that should be booked at least 1 day in advance, Banlung (US$24), Mondulkiri (US$18), Stung Treng (US$20) and Kratie (US$24).
There are buses from Don Det in the 4,000 Islands region (US$25-29), the Lao border (US$25) nearby and Pakse (US$30). Direct buses from Vientiane don't seem to be available as of February 2019.
Buses in general start in the morning, though there are also night buses on this route. The journey takes about 8-11 hr including the time it takes to pass through immigration and customs at the border.
Starting from Bangkok, agents in Khao San Road offer tickets to Siem Reap from 300 baht. In the other direction tickets cost US$11. The ticket is valid for the whole journey but you will change buses in Poipet.
If traveling independently to the Aranyaprathet/Poipet border, see those towns' articles for advice on how to reach the border, survive immigration and avoid the "Government" bus scam.
There are also some more expensive services; the government bus daily direct service from Bangkok (Mo Chit bus station) to Siem Reap and back. The trip is US$28 per direction, but is scam-free and fast. The Cambodian side of the company is named Nattakan. Giant Ibis direct bus to Bangkok: the Cambodian premium transport company Giant Ibis offers daily direct transport for US$32, departure time 07:45. The buses have free WiFi, power supply and generally good service, including free pick-up from partner hotels/ hostels in Siem Reap.
Ho Chi Minh City (US$18-27) 12 hr on a sleeping bus. If you use this in the other direction, have your Vietnam visa ready (if your nationality needs one) and valid before taking this trip. Visas for Vietnam are not available at a land border even if you have visa on arrival.
Phnom Krom Port. The port you arrive at is about 20 minutes south of Siem Reap by tuk-tuk. The drivers will try to charge you US$5 per person but the trip should not cost more than US$5 in total. (updated Jan 2017)
A more expensive and more time consuming option from Battambang (US$20-25, 5 hr) is to take a Soviet-style hydrofoil across Tonle Sap Lake. These can be fantastic trips giving you the opportunity to view life on the lake, floating houses, working fishermen, and to get a suntan if you choose to sit on the roof of the boat. However, the trip can be ruined due to bad weather. Remember to use sunscreen and take a waterproof jacket. You may not be able to access your luggage during the journey (sometimes the baggage is available, sometimes it is not). If you have the time, it is better to visit the floating villages as day trips from Siem Reap rather than see them from the boat.
Ferries from Phnom Penh are suspended since COVID.
The quickest method of getting from the Poipet border to Siem Reap is a shared car. A four-seater car costs US$25-45, depending on your bargaining prowess, and takes 2-3 hr. Even if you're travelling solo, it shouldn't be too hard to find others to share the expense. Walk past the roundabout to negotiate a cheaper taxi fare, otherwise you will pay more by being in the police controlled pricing cartel area. Do not get on the "government approved" tourist bus unless you want to pay more for taxis minibus, etc.
Family or group of tourists can book a private transfer to Siem Reap. It is comfortable, but expensive way. Comfort-class transfer from the Poipet costs US$65-75.
Helicopters can be chartered to go nearly anywhere in the country. They seat 5-6 people. Prices start at US$1,000 for trips to some of the temples north of Angkor Wat. Companies include Helicopters Cambodia and Helistar Cambodia. Helicopter transport is also available from other cities, e.g. from Battambang (US$1,600/helicopter) or Phnom Penh (US$4,700/helicopter).
Travel to and around the Angkor Archaeological Park is extensively covered in its own article. The following is a discussion of travel inside Siem Reap.
The city centre is fairly compact and flat.
Many guesthouses will lend you bicycles either for free or cheaply (US$1-3). Bicycle rental shops in town mostly don't open earlier than 07:00, so if you want to ride to Angkor Wat early in the morning, rent one the day before.
Motodops (motorbike taxi) abound and will make sure you know where they are. Rides within town should only cost US$ or 2,000 riel, although prices can double at night or during bad weather. Agree a price first. Full day can be arranged for ~US$10. Helmets for passengers are rare though may materialize if requested in advance.
Renting motorbikes is not prohibited any longer. There are plenty of options available from the ubiquitous gasoline-driven scooters (starting at ~US$10 per day), small electric scooters for one with a top speed of 25 km/h (~US$10) to larger ones for two people going up to 60 km/h (~US$15). As usual you need to leave either your passport or US$100-300 as a collateral.
Wear a helmet, both for your safety and because the police will stop you at checkpoints and fine you US$15 if you don't. Some restaurants will let you charge the battery.
Tuk tuks wait for customers at Pub Street
Tuk-tuks, like motodops, will call at tourists from nearly any street corner, or you can summon one with PassApp.
A trip within Siem Reap should cost US$ (Feb 2020) regardless of how many people pile on. Most tuk-tuks can convey four people comfortably though the extra weight can make the low-powered bikes laboriously slow. Prices can double at night or during bad weather.
Ensure you and the driver are in crystal clear agreement on the destination and total fare before departure. Payment is made on arrival and doesn't increase if the driver got lost or had to take a circuitous route.
Cars with drivers can be hired for single or multiple days. While all drivers are familiar with the area and happy to suggest good routes, most speak little English and are not actual tour guides. Licensed tour guides charge US$45-50 per day for a driver and English speaking guide. Drivers will likely ask for US$5-10 extra for trips to further temples such as those of the Big Circuit, Banteay Srey and more for remote sites like Beng Mealea.
Siem Reap Transport Service. A private tuk-tuk and car service providing transportation within Siem Reap and around the Angkor Wat temples. Private cars also available to and from Phnom Penh.
Siem Reap Private Driver. This service run by two brothers Sa and Sout with great reviews offer excellent transportation in Siem Reap in luxury cars. They can also arrange for guides with drivers.
The reclining Buddha at Wat Preah Prom Rath
Most people come to visit Angkor Archaeological Park, which is thoroughly covered in its own article. The town has some worthwhile attractions and a number of beautiful modern Buddhist temples.
Angkor National Museum, 968 Charles de Gaulle Blvd (T Galleria department store, beside the museum, runs a free shuttle (a little train) from the Old Market, every 30 min from 10:30 except on W), ☏ +855 63 966 601, info@the-anm.com. Daily 08:30-18:00. A modern museum with exhibits covering the history of the Khmer Empire, and the art, architecture, clothing, and culture of Khmer civilization, with a special focus on the Angkor complex. It is worth spending a couple of hours in the air-conditioned galleries as a break from visiting temples. Lots of pre-Angkorian and Angkorian statues, plus informative videos. Some say the 1,000 Buddhas room is as impressive as it sounds. The gift shop has some lovely souvenirs and fascinating books, but they're very overpriced. Visitors are required to check bags, water, and hats at the entrance (for free). Photography prohibited. US$12; audio guide in many languages US$5 (credit card accepted). (updated Feb 2020)
APOPO, Trapeang Ses Village, Kouk Chauk Commune, Siem Reap Koumai Road, ☏ +855 81599237, visitor.center@apopo.org. Daily tours every half hour 08:30–11:30 and 13:00–16:30. A demining organization that uses trained rats to sniff out land mines, a strategy which is much faster and safer than using metal detectors (if the rats step on a mine, they are too light to set it off). The visitor's center has guided tours including examples of land mines and UXO (unexploded ordnance) and a demonstration of how the rats find mines. The tour takes about 45 minutes and is a fascinating way to learn about the problem of land mines in Cambodia and support demining work. The guide's English may be hard to understand, but the demonstrations are so interesting, the tour is well worth doing anyway. US$10. (updated Mar 2024)
Angkor Eye, Phum Krous (a 15-min drive NW of town on Route 6), ☏ +855 63 210 770. Daily 14:00–18:00. An 85-m-high Ferris wheel with 48 four-person baskets able to accommodate up to 192 people. The trip takes 18 minutes. It is the third highest Ferris wheel in Asia. Adult US$12, child US$6. (updated Feb 2020)
In the main park near the Royal Residence, look in the trees to see bats flying around, even in broad daylight.
Wat Bo, Samdech Tep Vong St and St 22 (east side of the river; follow the road that continues from over Wat Bo Bridge). As one of the oldest temples it makes a nice contrast between the oldest and the glittering new ones, though the rough artwork wouldn't match the craftsmen of Angkor. The architecture of the ramshackle open air hall next to the main building blends French-style arches and balustrades with Thai-influenced Buddhist details. A forest of chedi surround the main hall, in between frangipani trees and some fine topiary.
Wat Damnak (east side of Siem Reap River, just east of Art Night Market, on Wat Damnak Road). A landscaped temple with many stupas, a small decorative pool, and a school on the premises. Within the site of the temple is the Center for Khmer Studies, an open reading library with materials about the art, culture and history of Southeast Asia with specific interests in Cambodia. (updated Feb 2019)
Wat Preah Prom Rath, Pokambor Ave. The glittering modern temple grounds give few hints as to its 500-year history. Though the lotus-themed architecture seems to emulate temples from over the border, the front gate integrates Bayon-style heads and a scene in relief of the Buddha seated under a tree, while armies fire arrows on one side and others are eaten by crocodiles on the other side, that looks like it could have been taken directly from Angkorian mural. Legend is that the site was established around 1500 when a famous monk landed ashore on a piece of his sinking boat. The boat wood was carved into the oddly foreshortened reclining Buddha installed in a swimming pool-like pit behind the imposing, yet despondent looking, seated Buddha in the main hall. Perhaps mimicking the construction materials origins, the reclining Buddha has taken on a sunken slant at the feet end. A pair of small weather worn cannons on either side of the hall are of unknown origin but their style, an embossed crown-like seal and mysterious numbers suggest a European origin.
Wat Thmei Temple & Stupa Memorial to the Killing Fields. A large Buddhist temple. In the grounds is a stupa with glass sides contains bones and skulls of victims of Pol Pot's army. Be wary of people purporting to be guides or asking for donations. Also, several of the photographs on the display boards are actually of the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. Take this attraction with a pinch of salt. Free, donations welcome.
Apsara Theatre, Wat Bo Rd, ☏ +855 63 963 561. Daily 20:00-21:30. A flashy performance of traditional, popular and classical dances.
Phare The Cambodian Circus (Phare Circus Ring Road, just south of the intersection with Sok San Road, 2 km from Old Market & Pub Street). Nightly 20:00 performances year-round. Additional 17:00 performances Nov-Feb: M Th Sa, and nightly 21 Dec – 4 Jan & 25 Jan – 1 Feb. Phare performers use theater, music, dance and modern circus arts to tell uniquely Cambodian stories; historical, folk and modern. Depending what part of town you’re traveling from, it's normally a 10- to 20-minute tuk tuk ride. You may want to arrange with your driver to pick you up after the show, or there are always many tuk tuks available outside the parking area. Ring Road and parts of Sok San Road are unlit. Siem Reap tuk tuk drivers are very familiar with the location. Typical rates from most central Siem Reap locations are US$3-5. Adult US$18-38, child (5-11) US$10-18. (updated Jan 2020)
Smile of Angkor, Smile of Angkor Grand Theatre (Angkor COEX) (northeast outskirts of Siem Reap, direction Angkor; turn right on Apsara Rd), ☏ +855 63 6550168. Nightly 19:15-20:30. A lavish production of Cambodian traditional dances equipped with a large screen featuring Angkor civilization. "Smile of Angkor" is the grand epic show that revives the Angkor dynasty in all aspects; from foundation to prosperity, tale of folk customs, past to present. The performance expresses traditional Cambodian culture with the latest technology. US$38-48.
We Are The Champions, Night Market (back of Night Market adjacent to Island Bar), ☏ +855 12 676826. M-Sa 20:30-21:15. Performances by the local disabled community. A two-act play written and performed by participants who share with great feeling what it is like to be disabled in Cambodia and the challenges of their lives. As many of the performers are in pursuit of education to better their lives they appreciate donations of school materials such pens and writing books. Free, donations encouraged.
Banteay Srey Butterfly Centre, Sanday Village (3 km before the Landmine Museum on the road to Banteay Srey temple), ☏ +855 97 852 7852. 09:00-1700. Banteay Srey Butterfly Centre is a community development project and tourist destination just down the road from the Landmine Museum and Banteay Srey temple. Revenue from admissions is used to pay families in remote villages who are farming butterflies for the exhibit. The project makes a real difference to the farmers' livelihoods and provides a wonderful experience for visitors as they can see spectacular local butterfly species flying close at hand in a beautiful tropical garden. US$4 adults, US$2 children under 12.
Butterfly Paradise, Kantrak Village (5 km from Psar Chas Market on Butterfly Paradise Road), ☏ +855 12558768, butterflyparadisesr@gmail.com. Su-F 09:00-16:30. A park with butterflies amongst many species of plants and flowers, with waterfalls and ponds. US$10 adult, US$7 child, US$4 Khmer adult, US$2 Khmer child.
Kampong Phluk Floating Village (off the Highway to Phnom Penh). This mangrove forest offers a much more authentic floating village experience than the one close to the Tonlé Sap ferry harbour. This fascinating fishing village on stilts can be reached by tuk-tuk, motorcycle, or taxi from Siem Reap - but don't take a tuk-tuk or motorcycle unless you want to get covered in a thin layer of reddish-brown dust from the dirt road. It takes about 1 hour to reach the village, depending on the road conditions and water level. Beware of scams. In addition to the tuk-tuk or taxi fare, the boat to take you around the village costs US$25 per person (which drivers will often conveniently forget to mention until you're almost there). In the dry season the village just has the appearance of a bunch of houses on stilts over the mud, but is still somewhat interesting as you can see the houses' structure. After touring the village you can eat in a floating restaurant with views of the lake. US$25. (updated Feb 2020)
Piles of mines, Landmine Museum
Landmine Museum (6 km south of Banteay Srey Temple, 31 km from Siem Reap), ☏ +855 15 674 163. Daily 08:00–17:00. This tiny museum was set up by local deminer Aki Ra to educate locals and tourists about the dangers of land mines. Piles of defused mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) lie around the site and the guides are mostly teenagers who were orphaned or injured by mines, many of whom live on-site. This is a very worthwhile attraction that brings home the scale of the problem and shows you a slice of real Cambodia. US$5. (updated Mar 2024)
Phnom Bok. The highest hill in the area. Temple ruins similar to those found atop of Phnom Krom and Phnom Bakong can also be found on top of Phnom Bok. It lies 20 km to the north east of Siem Reap. Expect a tiring hike up the stairs. A guard may be able to show you around. Don't forget to check out the old howitzers from the civil war. Admission is free, no pass is needed for the Angkorian ruins.
Phnom Krom. The hill which dominates the view, as you approach the floating village of Chong Kneas from Siem Reap. At the top, temple ruins similar to the other two hills can be found. This particular hill is popular for sunsets, as it can be viewed over the flooded plains during the wet season, and over incredibly vibrant rice fields in the dry season.
War museum (National Hwy 6 heading west, turn right after Cultural village), ☏ +855 97 4578 666. Daily 08:00–17:30. Collection of old (mainly Russian) tanks, artillery, landmines, handguns etc. Also some history background about the Cambodian civil war is displayed.

Armament and explosives availability apparently is only limited by how much you are willing to spend. Listening to the soldiers-turned-used car salesmen put the hard sell on a new machine gun is almost worth the trip. This is a true game of Russian roulette. Fancy pulling the pin of a 30+ year old grenade and possibly getting the faulty one? Make sure that whoever is supervising you is also willing to stand next to you. It can be a little bit difficult to find, and a tuk-tuk driver may know where it is. US$50 per AK-47 or M-16 magazine, M-60 belt (50 rounds) US$80 (Nov 2011). Grenade throwing: US$30.

Angkor Photography Festival: Photography for Change. Annual festival that showcases outdoor projections and various exhibitions around Siem Reap of regional and international photographers. The festival is held during the last week of November every year, consisting of 7 evenings of outdoor projections and more than 10 gallery exhibitions across various venues in the city. The festival is the first of its kind in Southeast Asia and is also the biggest. It aims to highlight the work of Asian photographers and provides free workshops for 30 young photographers from the region every year, led by world renowned professionals, which are showcased during the event. There is a full time office/gallery for the festival located on the East river road near the Bopha Angkor Hotel. As well as the festival, the organisers support a local NGO working with street children, that promotes the arts and runs a photography course with students. Photography from these students is also showcased as part of the festival programme.
The Annual Street Puppet Festival. An exciting pageantry with the concept of sticks and stilts manipulated puppets much like those which debuted in the opening parade of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and also quite similar to the Trinidad & Tobago Carnival.
The Water Festival. This vast festival is probably the most extravagant festival in the calendar. Over three days starting with the last full moon day in October or the beginning of November up to a million people from all walks of life from all over the country flock to the banks of Tonle Sap and Mekong Rivers in Phnom Penh to watch hundreds of brightly coloured boats with over 50 paddlers battle it out. The boat racing dates back to ancient times marking the strengths of the powerful Khmer marine forces during the Khmer empire. In the evening brightly decorated floats cruise along the river prior to and complementing the fireworks displays. there is often a parallel festival at Angkor Wat and although it is smaller in scale it is just as impressive due to the backdrop of Angkor Wat. The festival marks the changing of the flow of the Tonle Sap and is also seen as thanksgiving to the Mekong River for providing the country with fertile land and abundant fish. It is at this time when the river flow reverts to its normal down stream direction. The remarkable phenomenon that is the Tonle Sap sees the river flowing upstream during the rainy season and then change direction as the rains cease and the swollen Tonle Sap Lake empties back into the Mekong River leaving behind vast quantities of fish.
The Khmer believe that Thai massage is derived from Khmer massage and that it is more relaxing as it requires less twisting and turning. The numerous Khmer-style massage shops mostly offer genuine massage and are not a front for sexual services. Contrary to common belief, blind massage services do offer special massages too.
Fish Massage (around the Pub St area). This Thai fad has crossed the border. Dip your feet in a tank of fish and wince as they eat the dead skin off your toes. Trying a tank with feet already inside it will tell you if the fish are hungry. Some claim to have no piranhas while others offer a free beer to subdue any doubts. US$1-2 for 15 min.
Frangipani Spa, 615/617 Hup Guan St (At the ANZ Royal Bank on the corner go a few metres south to the next (small) street and turn right on Hup Guan St. The spa is near the end of the street.), ☏ +855 63 964391, info@frangipanisiemreap.com. Wonderful spa with a nice atmosphere, peaceful rooms, and experienced staff. The massages actually feel like trained people are giving them. No special services or hidden fees. It is a nice place to go as a couple or alone. They have massage tables and air conditioning. Tasteful exterior surrounded by frangipani plants (partly obscuring their tasteful green sign saying "frangipani"). US$35-75.
Lemongrass Garden, 7 Sivatha Blvd, ☏ +855 12 387 385, lemongrassgardenspa@gmail.com. Daily 11:00-23:00.

They also offer oil massages, "spiritual massages," and manicures/pedicures. Treatment rooms have air conditioning, and they provide a cool drink before treatment and warm tea afterwards. They also claim to pay higher wages than most places in Siem Reap, as well as provide other benefits to their workers. US$10-70. (updated Sep 2016)
Children are not tourist attractions, and especially orphaned children. Some visitors feel visiting an orphanage is a good way to make a positive contribution to Cambodia, while others feel that orphanage tours do more harm than good. The largest child protection group in the country has asked that tourists not to visit orphanages. The great majority of Cambodian children in orphanages have living parents, who rent them to the orphanages. Most are scams and have histories with severe child abuse. It is strongly encouraged that you do not support this 'business'.
However, some transparent and genuine, long running orphanages that have a good reputation are:
Cambodian Children's House of Peace (Santepheap Orphanage), No.004 Phum Mondul 3, Sangkat Slorkram (Turn right off of Charles de Gaulle Blvd, just after the SOS School), ☏ +855 92 407077. Sundays, 19:00. The Cambodian Children's House of Peace (aka Santepheap, which means Peace in English) is an orphanage in Siem Reap responsible for over 30 children. The children of the orphanage put on a traditional Khmer Dance show every Sunday night from 19:00-20:15 to highlight traditional Cambodian culture as well as draw attention to the orphanage in general. Free.
International ATMs in Siem Reap are plentiful and most banks will do cash advances from credit cards. Two Sacombank ATMs can be found along Sivutha Boulevard west of the tourist hotspot aka Pub Street — see Cambodia#ATMs.
As elsewhere in Cambodia, besides riel, US dollars, and to a lesser extent, Thai baht are accepted. But generally, using riel is better than using dollars as retailers tend to round up when quoting US dollar prices, and they also take the Riel-advantageous exchange rate of 4,000 riel/USD when you pay in riel.
Most things in Siem Reap are overpriced wherever tourists are frequent, head further away from the center or bargain (at markets).

The majority of bars and pubs of Siem Reap are concentrated in on a strip called Pub Street and its surrounding alleys. Although peaceful during the day, the streets in the Pub Street area which is just a block away from the historic Psah Chas (Old Market), comes alive with lights and music. A range of international tourists start pouring into the bars and pubs and give the streets almost a nightly street party scene.
Started in the late-1990s by a local business called Angkor What? Bar and followed by its rival, Temple Bar, from the across the street, Pub Street is often recommended as a must-see attraction in Siem Reap.
The distinction between eating and drinking establishments is fairly blurry as even the most humble of restaurants can have an extensive cocktail list on their menu. Nonetheless, a vibrant drinking scene concentrated along Street 8, aptly dubbed "Pub Street", is where serious drinkers head for cheap beer, loud music and the sweaty backpacking hubbub scene akin to Bangkok's Khao San Road. The biggest and most well-known Pub St bars, Angkor What?, The Red Piano, Temple Club and Le Tigre du Papier, are easy to find, with Angkor What? and Temple Club engaged in a running battle playing pop music across the street at very loud volumes.
Travelers looking for more subdued place to appreciate a quiet drink can seek out some of the smaller places along "The Alley", "The Lane" and the adjoining streets. A few drinking holes offer a bit more than cheap drunkenness.
Most places have draught Angkor beer for US$ and cans of other beers for US$1-2. Cocktails and spirits go for as little as US$2. Imported red and white wine, generally from the less prestigious wine producing countries, is widely available and cheaper than you would expect. Better quality Australian and French wines are available in more upmarket establishments at a correspondingly premium price.
These are hostess clubs popular with the locals, room charges are about US$5-10 per hour, beer is US$2-4. Most of these places are fronts for prostitution. Many of these places have two menus. One for Cambodians, which has cheaper prices, and one for foreigners, which have higher prices. If you see that the beer is US$4, they probably gave you the foreigner price.
Pub St features two main late night bars, Angkor What? and Temple Club which are directly across from each other. Commonly late night bar-goers will also congregate and drink in the street between the two bars and consume their own alcohol there, which is readily bought at stalls or shops in the immediate area.
Khmer Pub Street Beergarden KTVs (on Khmer Pub Street). close 02:00. There is a strip of local Cambodian bars near the Platinum KTV. If you walk past it, there is a whole 2-3 block street full of local Cambodian bars. Menus are not in English and few employees speak English, but the prices are good. These are restaurant/bars, they have young women sitting at the entrance, and you can have one accompany you for US$. Beers are US$1. US$ for draught beer. (updated Apr 2015)

Miss Wong Cocktail Bar, The Lane, behind Pub St. Tucked away from the rowdy chaos of Pub St, this sophisticated bar serves up delightful refreshing cocktails in a sultry red lounge plucked straight from 1930s Shanghai.
This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:
A seemingly inexhaustible range of sleeping options from upmarket hotels to grubby backpacker hostels, with many guest houses, boutique rooms, bungalows, concrete cells, wood huts and French villas in between, make finding a place to sleep one of the easiest things you will do on your trip.
Hotels are spread over the entire city but most larger hotels line national highway 6 to the west of the city centre, cheap backpacker hostels tend to surround the old market area and stylish boutique hotels a nestled in the trees along Wat Bo Rd. Small Khmer run hotels and guest houses, especially in the low season, can be surprisingly good value if you are willing to do a bit of hunting for one that hasn't been overrun by the guidebook-toting hoards.
Accommodations at every price point generally offer hot showers, cable TV, Internet and airport or bus pickup. Some may include free breakfast, though don't expect much more than an egg on toast and a coffee.

Even if your budget can't swing a night here, dropping by the Elephant Bar for a drink in the colonial surroundings is a worthwhile splurge. US$500+. (updated Jan 2022)
Most locals are decent people just trying to make an honest living, but a few shady characters try every trick to take advantage of travelers' good will. Be alert to deceptive dealers but don't let suspicion ruin your trip.
Convenience stores have been known to give incorrect change and pocket the rest. Check your change before you walk out of the store and point out any short changing. Most likely they will admit to their "mistake" and give you the right change.
Street vendors and beggars in competition for generous travellers' handouts have developed cunning, if underhanded, techniques to get your attention (and money). The "beggar army" of young children will come up to you in the crowd and grab your hands, leading you to a shop where they will then try and have you buy food, baby milk or water for them. Baby milk powder seems to be a popular one. It might sound like a more humanitarian way to help than giving them money, but once you leave the store the goods you bought for them are sold back to the shop owners or to other locals and the cash goes to an adult. Young women with babies cradled in a krama perform a similar trick.
Donation-collectors for orphanages may approach you in the street claiming to be volunteer workers, showing you convincing photos of themselves in the orphanage and a clipboard listing the generous donations made by foreign visitors. Though these young adults may be well groomed and speak excellent English it's possible that your donation will go directly into their pockets. A donation (either of money, or your time) to a recognised charity might be a better way to help.
Dollar bills need to be checked, as you will find out that you won't be able to change bills with any tiny cut. Fake dollar bills are also wide spread, and can even be issued from ATMs.
NGO safari should be avoided. Do not schedule any orphanage visit unless this is the main purpose of your trip.
Obviously, no-one should be having any form of sexual or other inappropriate contact with children. Foreign tourists have been arrested and charged with child sex offences. To avoid suspicion, do not stay alone with young people (room, temple, school, countryside, stadium, car), and do not respond to any favour they ask of you (transport, phone call, help, use your toilet or a glass of water).
