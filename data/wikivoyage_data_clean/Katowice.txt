Katowice is a large city in the Silesian Voivodeship (województwo śląskie) in the south of Poland. In 2021 it had a population of 315,000; it's the central city of Metropolis GZM (population  million) which in turn is part of Upper Silesian-Moravian metropolitan area sprawling across the Czech border. It's not scenic, but has a rich industrial heritage.
A series of medieval villages grew up in the forest clearings of Silesia, working at agriculture and small-scale metal-bashing; Katowice is first documented among these in 1598. They urbanised from the 18th century when coal mines plumbed deeper underground, and better processes were invented for extracting metals such as zinc and for turning iron into steel. Katowice outgrew its neighbours and in 1873 it became the county town. Poland in those centuries was carved up by other nations and Katowice was part of Prussia, later of Germany. It was well-connected by rail to other cities and attracted service industries such as banking. After the First World War the border was re-drawn, based on a plebiscite; Katowice voted to remain German but the district all around it voted to join Poland and it had to follow suit, becoming the regional capital.
The Second World War and Nazi occupation brought a high human cost but only selective damage to city buildings - the synagogue was one obvious target but city industry was wanted for the war effort. Then in 1945 the Red Army "liberated" Katowice by destroying much of it, and post-war communist rulers carried on in that vein. Rynek the central market square was soon ringed by the slabby 1960-70s architecture now mocked as "Early Gierek". Later in the 20th century traditional smokestack industry collapsed, labour unrest grew, and the miners of Katowice were as instrumental in the downfall of "the People's Republic" as the ship-builders of Gdańsk.
The city, region and entire nation of Poland had to re-invent themselves after 1989, developing a western free-market economy with a greater role for service sector, education and IT. Other Polish cities have prettified themselves into romantic budget-flight weekend destinations - that was never realistic for Katowice. It does however have a wealth of heritage, good visitor amenities, and transport links around Silesia and beyond.
In the 2000s, Katowice gained a higher profile by creating a new convention center and hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference (2018) and being designated the European City of Science (2024).
Katowice Airport (KTW IATA), Wolności 90, Pyrzowice (34 km north of city), ☏ +48 32 392 7000. Main airport for the sprawling GZM metropolis. As Katowice is seldom a tourist destination, it mainly serves the Polish diaspora, so you can get bargain seasonal flights against the flow. It has daily flights by Lot from Warsaw, change there for Gdańsk. Flights across west Europe and the Med are mostly by Ryanair, with a few by Wizz. The airport has a single terminal and the usual facilities including car hire. (updated Apr 2024)

Matuszek Bus runs direct to Kraków.
Buses also run direct to Bytom (No 85, 53), Mierzęcice (No 17) and Sosnowiec.
Kraków (KRK IATA) is a major tourist destination so its John-Paul II Airport has excellent connections across Europe. Flixbuses from Warsaw and Gdańsk call here every few hours on their way to Katowice, but it's usually more convenient to take the frequent bus or train into Kraków city centre and change.

From Wrocław the service is every hour or so, taking two hours and continuing to Kraków, Tarnów, Rzeszów, Łańcut and Przemyśl on the Ukraine border.
From the Czech Republic, trains run from Ostrava every hour or two, taking two hours via Bohumin, Wodzislaw Slaski, Rybnik and Tychy. These may start from Prague, Vienna or Budapest.
On cross-border routes, look for split-ticket deals. Reservations are compulsory on all trains from Germany in July and August.

Many sights are within a km or two of Rynek or the main railway station. The pavements are broad and level.
ZTM Metropolia run almost all buses and trams across the 40-some cities of Upper Silesian Metropolis, which straddles the Czech border. They have a unified ticket system.
(PKM Jaworznodead link are an exception. They run blue and yellow buses on some 20 routes, including lines A, E and J from Aleja Korfantego. They have a completely different fare system; but you're unlikely to use them and they're not described further here.)
In 2024 tickets valid for 20 mins are  zł, 40 mins  zł, 90 minutes or for the full route  zł, and a 90 minute group ticket for up to 5 people is 13 zł. A one-day pass valid until midnight is 12 zł. Concessionary fares are 50% of the relevant normal fare. All these tickets are valid for unlimited transfers within the allotted time. You can also buy e-packages of 20, 40 or 80 tickets (which roughly halve the unit journey price but don't allow transfers), and 30-, 90- and 180-day e-passes.
You can buy tickets from kiosks, newsagents, shops, machines at the main stops, or at POP passenger service points: these are within Katowice railway station, at Pocztowa 10 near Rynek, and at the ZTM offices on Barbary 21a. The only ticket you can buy on boarding is the 90 minute  zł (or concessionary  zł) ticket from bus drivers, who don't give change (they don't yet have contactless payment), and are sometimes out of tickets.
You must validate your ticket immediately on boarding. Inspectors prowl, and an unvalidated ticket is as bad as no ticket at all. For outlying sights buy your return ticket along with your outbound in case you find no convenient ticket point or the machine is broken, and with trams you don't have the option of paying the driver.
There are taxi ranks at the airport, north entrance of the railway station at 3 Maja, the bus station, main hotels and city transport nodes. Ask the price beforehand or the taxi driver will use his wildest imagination. Using an app such as Uber ensures an agreed price.
Church of St Michael the Archangel
Rynek. The market place, pedestrianised but criss-crossed by trams. It's frankly drab, though the communist buildings are being replaced by modern structures. They've taken up the Kraków tradition of sounding the Hejnał at noon, a five-note bugle call, which in medieval times was the signal to open the city gates at dawn.
Zachód Słońca - "Sunset" - is a neon installation on Rynek, a red globe low over the Rawa canal.

Goldstein Palace, Plac Wolności 12. M-Sa 07:30-16:00. A cod-Renaissance bling mansion, built in the 1870s by the brothers Abraham and Joseph Goldstein. They made their money from sawmills, but when their Katowice mill burned down in 1892 they left for Wrocław. The building then had various uses and is now a municipal marriage hall; you can usually look in. (updated Apr 2024)

Silesian Insurgents' Monument (Pomnik Powstańców Śląskich). The little park just south of Jerzego Ziętka Roundabout. Much of Silesia remained part of Germany even after World War I and Polish independence, but there were uprisings by ethnic Poles in 1919, 1920 and 1921 - the three wings symbolize these, and the battle sites are etched on the sides. But thus the map remained until World War II, when the German and Polish parts suffered equal horrors, and afterwards the entire region joined Poland. (updated May 2024)
St Michael the Archangel, Kościuszko Park. 24 hours. Charming little wooden church, built in 1510 in Syrynia near the Czech border. It was moved here in 1938 to form the nucleus of a heritage park, which never happened. Somehow it survived the war and was restored to use from 1956. Closed for renovation as of June 2024, without a reopening date. (updated Apr 2024)

Wujek is still an active coal mine, producing sub-bituminous coal. This was suitable for power stations as it contains little sulphur, but it emits disproportionate CO2 so its markets are shrivelling. The mine is best known as the scene of the "Pacification" of Dec 1981, when riot police shot dead nine miners striking against the imposition of martial law. In Sept 2009 an underground explosion killed over 20 miners. The museum depicts the labour uprisings of the 1980s, the nucleus of the Solidarity movement that eventually toppled communism in Poland.

Gallery Szyb Wilson, 1 Oswobodzenia St, ☏ +48 32 730 3220. Daily 09:00-19:00. Vast hall that once held the headworks for a mine shaft (szyb). It's now an art gallery and hosts events, but they're dwarfed by the space. Free. (updated Apr 2024)
Nikiszowiec. Nikiszowiec is a city neighbourhood built 1908-12 to house workers of Giesche (later Wieczorek) coal mine, all in a distinct red-brick style. It has the neo-Baroque Church of St Mary, several galleries, a branch of the Museum of Katowice History, and a modern hotel.
Giszowiec. Giszowiec was similarly built 1907-10 for the Giesche miners. Here the idea was a self-contained "Garden City" so the housing resembled chalets. But more housing was built for later generations of miners, the unity of style was lost, and there are now the same slabby high-rise flats as in other dreary suburbs.
