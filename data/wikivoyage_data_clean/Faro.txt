Faro is a city in the Algarve region of Portugal that is a popular sun destination in the summer, and a base for exploring the surrounding area.
Faro (FAH-roo, /ˈfa.ɾu/) is the southernmost city in mainland Portugal. During summer, Faro is a popular destination for sun-seekers from northern Europe and the UK, especially due to the presence of its international airport. It also enjoys a reputation as being more friendly than many other parts of the region.
Outside of summer, the beach-goers are mostly gone, but it is still a base to explore the more remote areas of the Algarve, a convenient stop between Lisbon and Seville (or Spain in general), and what it loses in partying outside summer, it gains in peacefulness, reverting to a quaint and charming small city.

Faro Airport (FAO IATA Aeroporto Internacional de Faro). A small airport with a few cafes. Many package tour and discount airlines arrive from the UK and Ireland, mainland Europe and Canada; as of Nov 2023 by far the largest share of regular flighs is operated by Ryanair. There is a large group of car hire agencies if you turn right after the main exit. From the airport, you can go to the city by buses 14 or 16 operated by Proximo, departing roughly twice per hour from early till late. The price is €. In the opposite direction, lines 14 and 16 go to the Praia de Faro beach. The airport is also covered by the e-hailing services Bolt and Uber. To the city centre it's about €5-7. (updated Jan 2024)
Other airports around are in Lisbon and Seville.
Faro train station (Estação de Faro) (about 3 minutes walking from the bus station). A small building which contains a ticket office, a small waiting area, and a cafe. There are no luggage lockers inside the train station, but it is possible to store your luggage in tourism agency on 1st platform. The Alfa Pendular, a high-speed train, runs generally twice a day from Lisbon. About 2½ hours, €20-25 one way, €30 on first class. There are three additional Inter City daily trains which take a little longer, with more stops, about 3½ hours. The tickets on the trains to Lisbon and further can sell out. There are also regional trains along the Algarve coast from Lagos to the west and Vila Real de Santo António at the Spanish border to the east. Parts of the line are single-track, causing delays usually up-to 10-20 minutes as the trains wait for the free track. It looks like the connections are preserved in case of delays. (updated Nov 2023)
Faro bus station (Terminal Rodoviario Urbano) (at the edge of the city centre). There is a daily bus service from Lisbon and Porto in the north of Portugal, and from Madrid and Seville in Spain. A fare from Lisbon to Faro costs either €18 (for an "Expresso" connection takes about 4 hours, stopping in Albufeira, Vilamoura and Quarteira) or €19 (for a "Expresso Qualidade" direct connection which takes just over 3 hours and includes a movie projection, a stewardess, and a mini-bar service) and can easily be bought at the bus station just before boarding. This bus station in Lisbon is next to a subway stop called Jardim Zoológico. (updated Sep 2017)

For buses from and to local nearby towns and cities, check out the list of lines and their timetables at the Algarve transport company Vamus Algarve page.
Car hire is an option for visitors. You can arrange car hire at the airport, however, as with many tourist locations it is wise to arrange your vehicle hire prior to arrival - this can save both money (the airport car rental desks can be far more expensive) and disappointment as availability during peak season may be very limited. Organising it from home before you arrive is now a very simple process with numerous companies specialising in pre-booking car hire in Faro.
Roads can be quite busy, but if you want to see a bit more of the city and indeed the Algarve region then driving by car is an easy option. Driving in the Algarve region is far easier than in the rest of Portugal, there are more non-toll roads and road-signs are plentiful and relevant.
Main harbours: Portimão, Faro.
Downtown is small and close to the public transport options: the train and main bus stations being within 250 m of one another few hundred metres from the city centre. Walking is very viable for most visitors.
Regional buses are run by the Vamus Algarve that connects Faro with other cities in Algarve.
Local buses are run by the Proximo company. Buses 14 and 16 go around the city, to the airport and to the beach of Faro. Tickets can be bought from the driver for € (Jan 2024).
Bolt and Uber cover the town.
Faro lies on the Algarve rail line connecting Lagos to V. Real St. Antonio and it's feasible to use the train system for getting to nearby towns especially to the east - Olhao (~10 minutes), Fuseta (~20 minutes), or Tavira (~40 minutes), see Get in - Train section and the train services operator Comboios de Portugal.
It can be difficult to find a parking slot in the center. Most of the parking stations near the restaurants and shopping malls are payable. However, there is a free car park located alongside the bus station which is close to the Hotel Faro and a huge free car park located behind the old town heading in the direction of Olhao.

Several companies offer packages and tours fit to everyone's needs. Ask at the tourist information or at your accommodation. (updated Oct 2020)
Faro beach (Praia de Faro). This beach is several kilometres long and so normally never gets crowded, even in the height of summer. Most of the beach is gently sloping though it can take a sudden dip in places. There are the usual beach-side stalls and a public lavatory, but no showers. Praia de Faro is just past the airport, the airport bus stops there. A lot of people with early check-outs and late flights seem to go there on their last day. (updated Sep 2017)
Faro Jewish Heritage Centre, Rua Leao Penedo (in front of Faro Hospital), ☏ +351 289829525. 09:30-12:30 and 14:00-17:00. Established in 1851, the Faro Jewish Cemetery is the only remaining vestige of the first post-Inquisition Jewish presence in Portugal. It served as a burial place for a thriving 60 family community (also known as "Little Jerusalem"). The Jews of Portugal were expelled by the Inquisition at the end of the 15th century and settled in Gibraltar and North Africa. After the devastating 1755 Lisbon Earthquake, their descendants were invited by the Marquis of Pombal to help rebuild the economy. Although the community is long gone, the Cemetery still remains to remind citizens and travellers of its former glory. The Faro Jewish Heritage Centre features over one hundred graves in Sephardi style, with beautifully engraved slabs instead of headstones. Although the land was purchased by the Jewish community in 1851, the first burial, that of Rabbi Toledano, dates back to 1838. Apart from the Cemetery, there is also a museum, housing many objects linked to the history of the Jews of Faro, like the furniture from one of the two former synagogues of Faro or the facsimile copy of Gacon's 1478 Pentateuch in Hebrew - the first book ever printed in Portugal! Free.

Faro and the Algarve region are reasonably safe year round. Pickpockets are not unheard-of, however, especially near beaches at night, so be on your guard.
Not unlike other Mediterranean tourism hot spots like Alicante or Mallorca, Faro attracts its share of poorly-mannered tourists (especially from the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany) that go to Faro to drink and let loose. Though the police does a great job at maintaining order, do be careful at night.
