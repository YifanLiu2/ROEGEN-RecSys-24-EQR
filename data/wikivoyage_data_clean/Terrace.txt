Terrace is an inland city in the North Coast of British Columbia. The largest city in the region, it has a population of about 12,500 people (2015), a significant portion of which are the Kitselas people, who have lived in the area for thousands of years.
The community is the regional retail and service hub for the northwestern portion of British Columbia.
Terrace was once the cedar pole capital of the world. Over 50,000 poles were manufactured annually to supply many parts of North America with telephone and electric power poles. The world's tallest pole, 50 metres (160 ft) long, was cut in Terrace and stands in New York City. For many years, logging was the region's major industry, but Terrace's economy has been forced to diversify since nearly all wood mills not operated by First Nations groups have closed down. Terrace's largest employers are in the public sector, but there are still some large private employers. Many people in Terrace commute to Kitimat to work at Alcan. The city has continually tried to reinvent itself as a service hub for northwestern British Columbia.
In 2001, the community was significantly affected by problems with and the closure of the largest local employer, the former Skeena Cellulose Inc. sawmill. The mill was bought by Terrace Lumber Co., a group of local owners, and reopened in late August 2005, but did not prosper and closed in mid-2006. By the end of 2006, the remaining equipment was auctioned off and the mill was torn down. The mill's former site is now a vacant lot with its footings covered in graffiti.
The city's economic prospects are linked to tourism, mineral developments to the north and northwest, construction of a power line towards Iskut and energy-related developments in Kitimat. The Prince Rupert container port expansion has resulted in increased rail traffic by CN Rail.

The region is one of the oldest continuously occupied regions of the world and, long before European contact, was one of the most densely populated areas north of Mexico. The flat mountain ranges surrounding Terrace are traditionally called Ganeeks Laxha, which in the Tsimshian language means the "Stairway to Heaven". The Skeena River was known as the K'shian River, meaning "where the mist comes out" — ksi, to come out from; yeen (hian-mist), clouds. The Tsimshian Nation's traditional economy was based on hunting, fishing and social gatherings, for domestic consumption or trade, on their traditional lands. For the Aboriginal people, the Skeena River was used for transportation, communication, war, trade, as a source of food, and at times for protection.
In 1866 the steamer Mumford made it as far as Kitsumkalum with supplies for the Collins Overland Telegraph line. It took an average of three days to travel from Port Essington (at the mouth of the Skeena River, near Prince Rupert) to Hazelton. In 1891 the Hudson's Bay Company sternwheeler Caledonia negotiated the Kitselas Canyon and reached Hazelton. A number of other steamers were built around the turn of the century, in part due to the growing fishing industry and the Klondike Gold Rush. In honour of its steamboat heritage, Terrace celebrates a festival called Riverboat Days each summer.
The riverboats operated on the Skeena for only 22 years; the last boat, the Inlander, finished up in September 1912, when the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway took over its function.
During World War II, military units composed primarily of conscripts from central and eastern Canada were stationed in Terrace. Morale was low due to the poor relationship between the soldiers and the local populace, the isolation, the damp weather, lack of recreation, crowded facilities, and the distance from home. In late 1944, because of declining enlistment and heavy casualties, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was forced to reconsider his promise to not deploy conscripts overseas. Mackenzie King decided to a one-time assignment of conscripts for overseas service. On November 24, 1944, news that conscripts might be sent overseas triggered a mutiny amongst the men stationed in Terrace. It took until November 29 for officers to restore order to the troops. The Terrace Mutiny was the most serious breach of discipline in Canadian military history.
Being close to the Pacific Coast, Terrace has a humid continental climate with wet, cold winters (though much milder than inland places) and drier, warm summers, with an annual normal mean temperature of  °C ( °F) varying between average temperature in January of − °C ( °F) and in July  °C ( °F).
Terrace receives an average annual rainfall of  mm ( in) and snowfall of  cm ( in); totalling 1,322 mm ( in) of precipitation, which is enough to sustain the lush vegetation of the area. October to February are the wettest months.

Kitselas Canyon National Historic Site (on the banks of the Skeena River on Kitselas Indian Reserve Number One, about 20 km NE of Terrace). The site encompasses approximately 5000 years of Aboriginal history and is a place of major significance to the Tsimshian people; in the 19th century, two permanent Tsimshian villages occupied a strategic position on the river, giving the people here control over the gateway between the coast and the interior, and therefore control of trade with the Hudson's Bay Company. The fact that Gitlaxdzok was a fortified village site makes it unique on the north coast; and, the cultural record is especially rich and has allowed detailed archaeological reconstruction of the culture history at Kitselas Canyon, including aspects of social change, the lasting relationship with people on the coast, vast trade networks, and changes in settlement patterns.
