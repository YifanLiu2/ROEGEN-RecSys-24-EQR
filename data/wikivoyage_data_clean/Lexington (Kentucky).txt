View of Lexington taken from a helicopter.
Lexington is the second largest city in Kentucky, located in the Bluegrass Region. Known as the Horse Capital of the World, Lexington has traditionally been dominated by the horse industry and is also heavily influenced by the University of Kentucky, the state's flagship university and the largest employer in the city. The horse industry has greatly influenced Lexington's culture and scenic beauty; the University of Kentucky and Transylvania University contribute to a college town atmosphere with a richer and more diverse culture than some might expect from its size and location. Lexington's compact central downtown district is surrounded by historic neighborhoods. Lexington is in the heart of the Bluegrass region of Kentucky and is still home to hundreds of horse farms.
Founded in 1775, 17 years before Kentucky became a state, the fledgling campsite was named Lexington when settlers received news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord which had opened the Revolutionary War just a few months prior. (Many people today assume it to be the other way around, since Lexington, Kentucky, is much larger and more well-known than the eponymous Lexington, Massachusetts.)
Lexington was one of the first cities in the country to enact urban growth legislation, controlling lot sizes and requiring suburban expansion to be continuous. This has largely protected the Bluegrass Region's picturesque landscapes from suburban encroachment. Lexington's urban development thus has a fairly sharp dividing line between suburb and countryside, and an interconnected metropolitan network of cities has developed with Lexington at its core, surrounded by a ring of smaller picturesque towns that have benefited from Lexington's prosperity and the auxiliary cities of Frankfort and Richmond, both of which are 40 minutes' drive in opposite directions.

Blue Grass Airport (LEX IATA), 4000 Terminal Drive, ☏ +1 859 425-3114. A medium-sized regional airport which has service from Allegiant, American, Delta, and United, with daily non-stop service to more than a dozen cities. It deposits passengers directly adjacent to Keeneland Race Course and just a few miles from downtown. There is express bus service by Lextran, once per hour 6AM-6PM. All major brands of car rental agencies have service here, and taxis and hotel shuttles are plentiful. International facilities including customs are available, but no carriers operate scheduled international flights; most passengers will go through customs in a connecting airport.
Louisville (Standiford Field SDF IATA) and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky (CVG IATA) are larger airports, each about 1½ hours drive from Lexington.
The nearest passenger train service is Amtrak's Cardinal, with stations in Maysville, and in Cincinnati, Ohio (both are about 1½ hours drive); however, there is only service every other day and both trains arrive and depart at night.
Travellers usually access Lexington via one of the two major interstates that arc around the northern and eastern borders of the city. I-64 runs from east to west, connecting Lexington with the largest city in Kentucky, Louisville, to the west. I-75 runs north-south, connecting Lexington with Cincinnati and Knoxville respectively. Neither interstate penetrates into the city. For access to the far side of the city, use New Circle Road (State Route 4), a loop road of which 3/4 is highway-grade, or during non-peak hours you can just take an arterial road through downtown.
The Lexington area is also served by the Martha Layne Collins Bluegrass Parkway, starting near Versailles and ending at I-65 in Elizabethtown, and the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway, which starts just east of Lexington and provides access to the Appalachian region.
The Greyhound station is on New Circle Road on the north side of town, which is ten minutes from the Downtown area.
City names in Kentucky aren't always intuitive. Louisville is pronounced LOOey-vil or LU-vul (never lewis-vil), and Versailles is pronounced ver-SALES (never ver-SAI). Athens is supposed to be pronounced with a long vowel (AY-thens), but many locals pronounce it the same as the Greek capital.
Lexington is a relatively spread out city, though not large. Unless you are mainly visiting the downtown or the university campus (which are within walking distance of each other), you will find that getting around by car is the most convenient method.
Downtown, Main Street divides cross-streets north and south, and Limestone marks east versus west. Addresses downtown usually specify a cardinal direction, which provides a clue to what area of the city it's in.
Bus service is provided by Lextran, which provides service from the downtown Transit Center to many parts of town and the airport. Most mainlines run every 35 minutes during business hours; others run every 35 minutes only during rush hours, every 60 minutes all other times. Buses run M-F 5AM-midnight, Sa 7AM-midnight, Su 7AM-9PM. Fare costs $1. If you need to transfer between routes transfers are free and can be attained when paying fare, transfers are good for an hour and a half but cannot be used for round trips on the same route. Buses can be tracked in realtime on Lextran's MyStop website or from Google Maps.
Downtown Lexington is compact and easily navigated by foot or bicycle, but the most typical way to get around is by car. Cars can be rented at the airport or at several locations in the city. Taxis should be called in advance as they are not easily hailed on the street. There is a taxi stand in front of the airport. From 6PM to 6AM a taxi stand operates at the corner of Main and Upper Streets, next to the old courthouse.
Lexington's roads form a wheel-and-spokes pattern. Arterial roads radiate from downtown, and New Circle Road (KY-4, sometimes called "Circle 4") forms a circle around the inner city. New Circle Road, an early experiment in urban circumferential expressways, was built before current zoning rules, so that about 1/4 of it is developed with commercial usage, while the rest is 55-mph freeway with on/off ramps. The radial roads are mostly named after the neighboring towns they lead to (e.g. Nicholasville, Richmond, Winchester), although as you approach downtown they take on a different name (e.g. Limestone, Main). Directions in Lexington will frequently start with "Take New Circle to ____ Road (one of the arterials), then turn north/south...."
Man o' War Boulevard forms a half-circle further outside from New Circle Road; however its lower speed limit and abundance of traffic lights make it less ideal for circling the city.
Like any city, Lexington's traffic can be challenging during rush hours. Nicholasville Road has reversible lanes to help the flow. Be careful and aware of the lights as they change throughout the day to accommodate traffic and rush hour. A green arrow indicates appropriate lanes for driving; white turn only arrows indicate a center turning lane; a red X indicates lanes in use by oncoming traffic. If possible, try to avoid traveling north on Nicholasville Road during the evening rush hour, as most lanes switch to southbound traffic to allow people to exit downtown. Be aware of driving near the University of Kentucky on basketball or football days. Downtown can be quite congested when UK plays at Rupp Arena, and Tates Creek Road and Nicholasville Road both move very slowly when UK plays at Kroger Field.
Most of the major arterial streets have multiple names, especially as you approach downtown (Nicholasville Road becomes Limestone; Harrodsburg Road becomes Broadway; etc.). This is also true of many smaller city streets (Winslow Avenue becomes Avenue of Champions, which becomes Euclid Avenue, which becomes Fontaine Road). When you ask for directions, many locals may not know exactly what the street is called where you're going, just remember that the same road may be called any of those at your destination.
Almost all of the arterials, and many smaller roads, are also numbered U.S. Highways or Kentucky State Roads, but no one refers to them by number. The sole exception is New Circle Road, which is KY-4 and sometimes called "Circle 4", but more often called "New Circle".

The Central Library is worth a quick look for its art installations. Rose-colored granite covers the facade, and the airy atrium houses a 5-story-tall Foucault pendulum, which tells time using the rotation of the Earth. In front, Phoenix Park offers some nice greenery and fountains, and a small statue of a Bedouin on a camel marks the "zero milestone", the point from which all distances to Lexington are measured. However, the view is hampered somewhat by a building across the street.

Despite the relatively small size of this South-North straddling city, Lexington offers a surprisingly delightful palette of interesting activities.

Founded as HVLS Fan Co., many customers called asking for the company that makes "those big-ass fans". The owner decided to change the name to Big Ass Fans, which stirred up a bit of controversy when he painted the company's name along with a giant donkey's rear end (named "Fanny") on the side of the building. Local residents protested at first, and the airport refused to accept advertising from the company. But eventually people warmed to the new name, and the airport now has a Big Ass Fan installed near the security checkpoint. You can tour their headquarters, R&D facility, and production facility. Free. Reservations required. (updated Jul 2019)

Lexington isn't called the "Horse Capital of the World" for nothing. The horse industry is Lexington's traditional and most famous trade, and many beautiful old farms are worth a look.
Kentucky Horse Park, 4089 Iron Works Pkwy (7 miles north of the city. I-75 exit 120, or take Newtown Pike or Georgetown Rd for a scenic route), toll-free: +1-800-678-8813. 9AM-5PM daily; in winter (Nov-Mar) closed M-Tu and some holidays.

There are various horse shows throughout the day, as well as extra activities including horseback and pony rides. The Park is also the host of some very large horse events. Probably the most high profile annual event is the Rolex Kentucky Three Day, a major eventing competition which takes place every April. The park also hosts the National Horse Show in October/November, and hosted the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games, the first time they were held outside of Europe. These horse trials are also used as Olympic selection trials so you can expect to see some world class horses and riders. Adult $16 summer/$10 winter; children 7-12 $8 summer/$5 winter; children 6 and under free. Parking $3/day, special event parking $5/day.
There are many horse farms clustered north and west of Lexington. Several companies do daily van tours of private farms, either on guided or customized tours (get referrals from the Lexington Visitor's Bureau). Tour itineraries vary daily and seasonally, but a typical tour might include a stop at one or more farms where you can get close enough to touch some horses (if the conditions are right: no petting young horses that aren't calm enough, or ones that are being taken for training or other duties), a stop at Keeneland race track and/or the Kentucky Horse park, and a scenic drive past many other famous and ritzy farms like Calumet. You can also book your own visits directly. However, these are all working farms, so if you're visiting independently, call in advance to check availability and make arrangements.

Enjoy horse racing in a "days-gone-by" setting. The movies Seabiscuit (2003), Dreamer (2005) and Secretariat (2010) have been filmed at Keeneland, which prides itself on maintaining racing traditions in a facility that has changed little over the decades: for example, it didn't install public address speakers until 1997. Keeneland hosts live thoroughbred races only two months a year, with the Spring meet in April and Fall meet in October, but they welcome visitors year round (you can use online or print maps to explore the grounds for free, or book a tour). During races you can choose your level of comfort near the track (general admission, grandstands, or nicer indoor rooms), or tailgate in the free parking lot while watching races on a jumbo TV and wagering. The feature race of the Spring meet is the Toyota Blue Grass Stakes, a prep race for the Kentucky Derby. When its live races are not in session, entry is free; you can explore the stadium and walk right up to the race track, watch other races broadcast from around the world, or attend events like the yearling horse sales, where many young stallions command price tags in the millions. Buyers include local horse farms and bidders from Europe, Saudi Arabia, and Dubai. Year-round tour $10/person, 12 and under free; special tours $30-50. During race meets, general admission $5, grandstands $8-20, indoor rooms $15-65, but if you don't put some money on your favorite horse or jockey, you're missing the point. BETologists are around to explain betting for beginners and experts alike. Cash bets only (ATMs are available); minimum bet $1 (win, place, show, exactas). Parking free-$5. The tradition at Keeneland is to dress-up a bit, so no jeans or T-shirts; most indoor rooms enforce dress codes ranging up to "suit or jacket required". Outdoors, bring a coat and hat, too, as it can be cold and windy in April and October. (updated Dec 2016)
The Keeneland Library, ☏ +1 859 254-3412, toll-free: +1-800-456-3412. M-F 8:30AM-4:30PM; during race meets and sales also Sa 9AM-12:30PM; closed holidays.

Legacy Trail, ☏ +1 859 425-2255. When ultimately completed, this walking and biking trail will extend 12 miles from the east end of downtown to the Kentucky Horse Park. The majority of the trail is complete and begins at the North Lexington YMCA (381 West Loudon Ave). Other trail heads are located at Coldstream Park off of McGrathiana Ave, and the North trail head on Old Ironworks Pike across from the campground at the Kentucky Horse Park.
View from Kentucky River overlook in Raven Run Nature Sanctuary
Raven Run Nature Sanctuary, 3990 Raven Run Way (12 miles southeast of downtown), ☏ +1 859 272-6105, naturalist@lexingtonky.gov. 9AM-5PM, trails close at 4:30PM. A 734-acre park along the Kentucky River Palisades in Fayette County. Great wildflower viewing in the spring.
The Arboretum, 500 Alumni Dr, ☏ +1 859 257-6955. Dawn-dusk. A 100-acre botanical garden located next to the University of Kentucky. This park is jointly owned by the city and university. Two miles of walking paths meander through representations of different areas of the state.
Film actress Ashley Judd is a UK alumna, and a fierce Wildcats fan. She regularly attends basketball games every season, often sitting in the student section.
She also helped start a series of posters for UK's ice hockey club team. Designed as a fundraiser, the poster had the team's 1998-1999 schedule over a photo of Judd wearing nothing but a hockey jersey. (Judd, who had a cousin on the team at the time, provided the photo for free.) The posters sold like hotcakes, the "coolcats"' raucous midnight games became even more popular, and the poster became an annual tradition, each year featuring a different good-looking celebrity Kentuckian.
The UK Wildcats are immensely popular throughout the state (with the partial exception of the immediate Louisville area, where loyalties are divided between UK and its rival University of Louisville) and even more so in Lexington itself. Even if you're not a sports fan, you'll know when it's gameday as the entire town will be dressed to support Big Blue.
UK basketball, Rupp Arena, 430 W Vine St (attached to the Lexington Convention Center downtown). The Kentucky men's basketball team, one of the most storied programs in all of college sports, boasts eight NCAA championships (including in 2012), an undefeated regular season in 2014-15, and leads the NCAA with more than 2,000 all time wins. The team coach (John Calipari since 2009) inevitably enjoys celebrity status around town. Tickets $35–46 face value, but expect to pay illegal scalpers much more, especially for games against quality opponents. (updated May 2017)
UK football, Kroger Field, 1540 University Dr. The football program has enjoyed something of a renaissance, although it continues to struggle to establish itself in one of the country's most competitive football conference. Nonetheless, the team frequently sells out the on-campus Kroger Field (formerly Commonwealth Stadium), at least for SEC home games and the major rivalry game with University of Louisville (hosted by UK in odd-numbered years). Tickets $35–$46 face value, but expect to pay illegal scalpers much more, especially for games against quality opponents. (updated May 2017)
Keep an eye out for merchandise marked "Kentucky Proud", which marks it as a participant in Kentucky's buy-local initiative.
Liquor Barn. The supermarket-sized stores of this local chain make it a good stop for travellers, with gourmet bakery, cheese, and deli items, and a large case of Kentucky Proud foods. Of course, the many aisles of liquor, wine, and beer are also great if you want to take home a special bottle of bourbon or some hard-to-find beers.
There are several major shopping areas in Lexington.
Nicholasville Road, particularly between Man o' War Boulevard and New Circle Road, is a major center for shopping, with several malls and many smaller stores.
Fayette Mall (Nicholasville Rd. & Reynolds Rd., just south of New Circle Road). The largest mall in the state, anchored by Macy's, JCPenney, Dillard's, H&M, and Dick's Sporting Goods.
Adjacent  Lexington Green strip mall features Joseph-Beth Booksellers, 161 Lexington Green Cir #B (in Lexington Green, at Nicholasville Rd & New Circle Rd), ☏ +1 859 273-2911. M-Th 9AM-10PM, F-Sa 9AM-11PM, Su 11AM-9PM. An independent bookstore with an impressive selection of books in their cavernous, sunlit interior.

Whether fashionable or functional, thousands of unique creations of wood, glass, metal, jewelry, and more are waiting for you to discover them.
Hamburg Pavilion (Man o' War Blvd & Sir Barton Way, just off I-75 exit 108). Hamburg is a "power center", an open-air, auto-oriented shopping district with several "big box" anchor stores and many smaller shops like Victoria's Secret and the Black Market. An accompanying residential area sprang up with the shopping complex just at the turn of the millennium. The area continues growing daily; expect plenty of traffic.
The Square (formerly Victorian Square) (Main St & Broadway, across from Triangle Park). A block of renovated Victorian buildings that was re-purposed as an entertainment area. Located in the heart of downtown, it is connected to the adjacent hotels and business complexes by raised pedways. Containing primarily upscale clothing, jewelry, and art boutiques, it is worth a visit as much for the interior design as the shopping opportunities. It also houses the Lexington Visitors Center.
The Square also connects via pedway to the Lexington Shops in the belly of the Lexington Convention Center, with the Kentucky Proud Market, a UK Memorabilia store, and more.
Maxwell/High is streets bordered on the west and north by Maxwell and High streets respectively, containing a myriad of small, primarily youth-oriented independent boutiques as well as several restaurants. Small boutiques includes the Black Market Boutique, Helen's Boutique, Lucia's, Calypso, Mod Boutique, John's Walk Run Shop, and ILO.
South Lime/Campus Area The bordering downtown campus area features many locally owned restaurants and small locally owned stores. Stop by CD Central for used CDs, new albums, DVDs, wall sized posters, T-shirts from major and local artists, and more. Sqecial Media features many unique gifts from magazines, eclectic books, jewelry, candles, incense, trinkets, and journals. ReBelle is a one of a kind shop featuring all kinds of yarn, locally made clothes, and jewelry.
Lexington is home to an astonishing number of independently owned restaurants at all price levels. The city's college town atmosphere and affluent lifestyle contribute to this relatively small metropolitan area's great culinary offerings. Chain restaurants, typical in most American cities and towns, can be found here, as well as a great number of privately owned and operated establishments.
Kentucky cuisine to look for includes the Hot Brown, an open-faced sandwich of turkey, bacon, and cheese sauce; burgoo, a traditional game stew with as many variations as there are people who make it; beer cheese, a spicy spread of cheddar cheese and beer; and bourbon balls, a sort of chocolate and bourbon truffle with pecans.
