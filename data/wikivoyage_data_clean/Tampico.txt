Tampico is a city of 315,000 people (2015) in Tamaulipas. The city is famous for its architecture, which is often compared to that of Venice and New Orleans, as well as for its food.
Tampico sits on the banks of the Pánuco River and among extensive wetlands adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. The locals are informally known as Jaibas (crabs), and the crab emblem is seen in many places, from sports logos to the sides of buses to park benches.
The city does not receive a lot of international tourists. Instead, most tourists are Mexicans, particularly from Monterrey, who arrive by car and head straight to the beach. Therefore, much of the tourist infrastructure in the city tends to cater to the drive-in crowd, and so hotels, restaurants, etc., tend to be spread further away from the city center than in other Mexican cities. This also means that English is not commonly spoken, even by hotel staff. That said, the locals are generally warm and friendly and will do their best to help you, regardless of your Spanish skills.
Tampico is an oil town, and when the oil refinery is running (and as of March 2022, it is) the air in the city is often tinged with the acrid smell of its exhaust. Although the locals are used to it, be aware that you might find it irritating, particularly if you are sensitive to air pollutants. Fortunately, you can usually find some respite the beach, where the fresh on-shore breeze keeps the pollution away.
Once one of the wealthiest cities in Mexico, the drug war took a brutal toll on Tampico in the 2010s. More than 200 hotels, restaurants and bars closed throughout the city and over half the businesses in the city's center were abandoned as residents fled the violence. Late in the decade the government regained control through extreme measures such as disbanding the city's entire police force. Today, Tampico is a city rising from these ashes, with redevelopment projects such as those around the canal zone and the lagoon lending many areas a modern, upscale feel. Yet the scars from the war remain. Although the city is now safe, once grand buildings lie partially collapsed, trees emerging from rooftops and growing out of windows. This contrast – dilapidation and development – gives the city an interesting character both in its physical state and in its people, who are often quite impressed by the presence of a foreigner after so many years. Unlike much of the rest of Mexico, expect shouts of "qué tal?" (how's it going) as you walk along the street, as well as people approaching you out of sheer curiosity to ask how you are and where you're from (in Spanish, of course).
Tampico's weather, though reasonably pleasant in spring and autumn, is hot in the summer; the average high reaches 32 °C (90 °F) in August. Winters are pleasantly cool; the average January high is 23 °C (73 °F) and the average low in January is 13 °C (58 °F). Rainfall is frequent from May through September.
Tampico is an extremely humid city, with summer heat indices reaching 40 °C (104 °F). During autumn and winter, it is affected by cold fronts that pass through the gulf and bring high winds that can reach 50 km/h (37 mph) with gusts of 70 to 80 km/h (43 to 50 mph).
The easiest way to enter Tampico is via the international airport. There is one flight per day from Houston via United Airlines, and several others via Monterrey, Reynosa, or Mexico City.

Alternately, Tampico is a six-hour drive away from Mexico City. Travelling from the United States, the closest border crossings are either McAllen or Brownsville, Texas. In both cases it's a six to eight hours drive.
Buses connect from Mexico City and most cities to the north (including Texas) to  Tampico Central Bus Station. The primary intercity bus companies are ADO, Omnibus de Mexico and Futura. The bus ride from Mexico City through the Sierra Madre Oriental is especially beautiful. Connections from the south are rather sparse, surprisingly. From Veracruz, for example, expect a long and bumpy bus ride – consider splitting your journey in two at Tuxpan or Poza Rica.
Driving is the easiest way to travel around Tampico. Speed limits and red lights are enforced – other laws tend to be rather lax.
Taxis are relatively safe to take in and around Tampico at any time of day or night, but as always, use caution when traveling alone. The ride hailing services Uber and Didi are also available.
Carros de ruta are shared taxis that travel fixed routes around the city, costing around M$10 per ride (as of March 2022). For example, to get from the city to the beach, ask a local where to catch the "Tampico-Playa" carro. You'll stand on the street, give it a wave, get in and go.
Should you want to cross the river, for whatever reason, there are water taxis dotted along the shore to the east of the city center. Just find a road that seems to head towards the river and there's usually a water taxi stand at the end of it.

Tampico was devastated by the Mexican drug war in the 2010s but has since recovered and is now considered one of the safest cities in Mexico. While the same cannot be said for the rest of Tamaulipas, Tampico and its surrounds are secure and there really isn't much to worry about as a tourist (apart from the usual "don't walk down that dark street at night", etc.).
Internet speed is excellent. A phone SIM card can be acquired at the  Telcel store on Francisco I. Madero street, one block south of the Plaza de Armas.
Aldama. A town two hours north of Tampico renown for its cenotes.
