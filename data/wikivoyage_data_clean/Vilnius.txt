Vilnius is the capital and largest city of Lithuania. It has a beautiful baroque Old Town, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and excellent tourist facilities in all price ranges. It stands on the River Neris in the southeast pocket of the country, the Dzūkija region, and in 2023 had a population of 629,000.
Vilnius has been central to the country's life for as long as there has been Lithuania, but that has often been a tragic tale. Its Neolithic people traded in Baltic amber. In the early Middle Ages five petty kingdoms combined into two then one, when Mindaugas in 1253 became Lithuania's first king and noble Christian convert. The country splintered after his assassination but was re-united under Gediminas, who established Vilnius castle — in legend on the site where a wolf in a dream told him to build. But the real wolves were his neighbouring countries, and finding a powerful ally meant adopting their religion. Poland was the best bet and a dynastic marriage in 1486 united the crowns, later the nations, and Lithuania became Roman Catholic. Vilnius Old Town was largely built in the following 150 years.
This united Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth grew almost to the Black Sea, but all the power and money shifted to Poland. Like Hungary in the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Ireland within Britain, Lithuania was the poor country cousin. And then Poland fell, with its territory carved up between Prussia, Austria and Russia, and others snatching what they could. Lithuania became a territory of the Russian Empire. Poland and Lithuania only regained independence after the First World War, and almost at once were at war with each other and with Russia. Vilnius was captured and from 1920 was a Polish exclave, and the Lithuanian capital moved to Kaunas. In the run-up to the Second World War Russia (as the Soviet Union) again seized the territory. This history meant that when Nazi Germany invaded in 1941, they found many local supporters, and the Jewish population of Vilnius was slaughtered.
Postwar the Soviet iron fist clutched Lithuania, until 1991 when civil unrest and the collapse of the USSR enabled the country to seize independence. It looked west for allies, adopting capitalism, joining NATO and the European Union, and — crucially for travellers — welcoming the budget airlines. All this has made Vilnius a friendly, tourist-oriented city, with a wealth of sights reflecting its layers of history.
Tourist information: Go Vilnius have a kiosk at the airport and another in Cathedral Square, both open daily 10:00-19:00. They speak good English and are helpful with maps, brochures, tours and suggestions, but they don't book accommodation

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Far from moderating Atlantic, Vilnius winter is extremely cold and temperatures often stay below freezing day after day. Temperatures often reach -25ºC (-13 °F) in the months of January and February, freezing all the rivers and lakes around the city. Summers are warm to hot, with heat waves that send temperatures to rise above 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is relatively equal throughout the year; there is never a completely dry month, although summer is the wettest time in Vilnius. Early summer and autumn are good times to visit, but Vilnius is a year-round destination, and even overcast and gray days have their compensations, when everyone feels in league united against the weather.

Walking is your only choice in Old Town. The old streets are pedestrianised, and even taxis avoid it.
JUDU is the portal for city buses and trolleybuses, with timetables, route maps and travel planners in English. There are no trams or metro / suburban railways, but see above for the airport train.
A single ticket for bus or trolleybus costs €1 in 2023, purchased from the driver, cash only and no discounts. You stamp it immediately in the little red box by the driver's cab. It's not valid for transfers.
All other tickets involve the use of a smart card, Vilniečio kortelė, for an upfront payment of €. This works out cheaper if you travel over several days, and it allows discounts and transfers. The transport website lists 16 possibilities, times three for the 50% and 80% discounts. For instance a full-fare 24-hour ticket costs €5 and a 72-hour is €8. Validate it by swiping the smart card over the yellow electronic reader on the bus, which starts the clock running. Seniors over 70 years get 50% discount, and European Union students get 80% discount. Show your ISIC or ID card or passport when prepaying the smart card and in case of ticket control during the trip. It's also possible to do all this by mobile phone, but only in Lithuanian, so good luck with that.
Buy or top-up the Vilniečio kortelė smart card from Lietuvos spauda or Narvesen kiosks (for instance at the airport), Maxima grocery stores, PayPost offices, or at the Customer Service Centre at Gedimino pr 9A.
There are two mobile apps available for the purchase of public transportation tickets: m.ticket and Trafi. € for a 30-min single ticket, compared to €1 single ticket purchased with cash from the driver. Trafi is available in English and you can register a foreign debit/credit card. Minimum purchase in Trafi is €5. You can load up on several single tickets in Trafi (e.g., 8 x 30-min single tickets for a total of €) and you can also activate several tickets at the same time. So if you're several people travelling together, only one person needs the Trafi app and can manage everyone's tickets.
Vilnius Pass is a tourist card which may include public transport on its 72-hour pass, but not on the 24 or 48-hour passes. You will struggle to break even on any of these, however many museums you rush around. The 72-hour pass is €66 with transport and €56 without.
There are some 90 standard bus routes (marked in blue), six express buses (in green, and badged G for Greitasis) and 20 trolleybuses (in red). They have their own numbers, so bus 3, express bus 3G and trolleybus 3 run entirely different routes. They run 05:30-23:00; the only night bus is 88N cross-town from the airport to Europa Square.
See above for taxi rates from the airport. There are half a dozen taxi and ride-sharing services, which include Taksi 1820, Uber, Jazzexpress and A2B. Cars are new and have debit / credit card readers.
Smartphone and internet booking systems include Uber, eTAKSI, Bolt and Yandex. Street taxis may charge twice as much as those hired by phone or app: try dialling the number on the vehicle you see, tell the dispatcher the address you're at, and you will likely get the same car for a lower price.
All taxis must have a yellow licence plate starting with the letter T with an additional five numbers and a "Taksi" sign on the roof. A detailed price list alongside the driver's taxi-operator license must be placed on the panel right in front of the passenger seat next to the driver.
A €-1 tip for the driver is customary.
Not in Old Town! The spine of it is traffic-restricted, and parking is scarce and time-limited - not long enough to enjoy any sights. Further out is snarled during rush hour (07:00-09:00 and 16:00-18:30). If you plan to tour the country, see the city by walking or public transport then pick up a rental car later. There's a dozen rental companies including Hertz, Enterprise, Europcar and Sixt.
JUDU details the parking places in the city, and there are Park & Rides around its fringes.
City-Bee is a car-share where you can rent a car by the minute - use your phone to unlock it. There is no contract or monthly fee, you pay for the service only when you use the car (say €8 per hour), and there are no parking fees when you are not using it. There are 13 pick-up points across the city, mostly in the centre.
You might cycle to outlying sites, but this will be on-road, and local motorists don't pay much regard to bike lanes. The only continuous cycle path is north along the River Neris to Verkiai nature park. Other routes are fragmentary.
Cyclocity is a self-service bike-rental scheme. However in Feb 2023 short-term subscriptions are suspended, and they only offer longer deals suitable for regular commuters.
Velotakas have bike rental and lead city tours. They're at Stulginskio 5, tel +370 618 45727, open daily 10:00-18:00.
Vilnius Pass is a tourist discount card which in 2023 costs €37 for 24 hours, €47 for 48 hours and €56 for 72 hours. This excludes public transport and is frankly poor value, you'll struggle to break even.
This starts from the castle and cathedral, and stretches south along Pilies gatve. Halfway down the main street becomes Didžioji, and this area is described below as Old Town south. In 1994 the entire Old Town was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

You can ascend the cobbled lane and enter the courtyard free for views of the city, and the Three Crosses on the hill east. The ducal palace east side of the courtyard is just a shell, converted into a performance space. West side is the three storey red brick tower, now a museum. Tower adult €8, conc or child €4.

The first cathedral was built here in 1251, reverting to pagan worship in 1263. Fire destroyed a second in 1419, a third in 1530 and a fourth in 1610. Many parts of the fifth survive, notably the baroque chapel of St Casimir, but much was lost when the south tower collapsed in 1769 — did those pagans have a friend on high? What you see now is mostly the neo-classical structure completed in 1801. The crypt has a display of Vilnius through the ages, and you can also tour the catacombs and free-standing 57-m high belfry. Nearby in the square, a tile inscribed Stebuklas ("miracle") marks the end of the Vilnius-Tallinn human chain in the 1989 protest against the Soviet Union. Free. (updated Feb 2023)

This is a modern replica: the original was built in the 15th century, ruined in the 17th and demolished in 1801. A merchant's house was then built, which became part of the Arsenal. In the 1990s after independence the palace was rebuilt to the original plan, somehow without deciding what it would be used for, and to outcry as it blocked the vista from Cathedral Square. It's become part of the National Museum, with displays of palace history and reconstructions of the ceremonial halls. Adults €, conc or child €. (updated Feb 2023)
Toy Museum (Žaislų muziejus), Šiltadaržio 2 (foot of castle lane), ☏ +370 604 00449. Th F 14:00-18:00, Sa Su 11:00-16:00. Interactive museum of toys down the ages, chid-friendly of course. Adult €7, child €5. (updated Feb 2023)

Adult €4, child or conc €2. (updated Feb 2023)
Literatu gatve ("Literature Street") at its junction with Rusų gatve has small artworks and dedications mounted on the walls, to those whose literature is linked to Lithuania (however obliquely, so a dedication to Wikivoyage seems overdue). The street west is a ratty alley and east is nothing special.
Church Heritage Museum, Šv Mykolo 9 (east end of Literature St opposite St Anne's). Displays religious art. (updated Apr 2023)
Pilies gatve is the attractive main thoroughfare leading south from Cathedral Square past the university, to become Didžioji continuing past Town Hall to the Gate of Dawn. Saint Parasceve is a shocking pink Orthodox church at the changeover point. Most buildings along here are worth admiring, though the concrete modern block opposite the church could do with a visit by the Teutonic Knights' wrecking crew. The Šlapelių House Museum has exhibitions and events.
From Saint Parasceve past Town Hall square down to Gate of Dawn

Gate of Dawn (Aušros vartai). Chapel daily 07:00-19:00. The last survivor of the walled city's nine gates, various called Medininkai Gate as the street led south to that village, Sharp Gate, and now Gate of Dawn.

"Užupis" means beyond the river - it's in a loop of the small River Vilnia, which flows north to join the bigger Neris. It developed from the 16th century as a Jewish ghetto, most of whose inhabitants were murdered in the Holocaust. Post-war it was a squalid neighbourhood, then from independence it gentrified as property values climbed. In 1997 the residents declared it to be an independent republic, with its own president, anthem, flag, and constitution. They picked April Fool's Day to celebrate independence, and the first article of their constitution sets the tone: "Everyone has the right to live by the River Vilnia, and the River Vilnia has the right to flow by everyone." Its envoys, which have yet to be accredited by any other nation, include an "ambassador for whistling in the streets".
Kalnų Park stretches north to the River Neris, and northeast is the district of Antakalnis. Attractions there and further east are also described in this section.
St Anne's Church (Šv Onos bažnyčia), Maironio 8. Tu-Su 11:00-18:00. Small flamboyant church in Gothic style, built by 1500 and little altered since. There is a legend that when Napoleon's campaigns brought him to Vilnius, he declared that he'd like to lift the church on his palm and carry it back to Paris. (Obviously untrue, since given the horrors of his retreat, he'd have been forced to eat it before he reached Warsaw.) St Anne's is not within Užupis but backs onto the river boundary by an entrance bridge. (updated Feb 2023)
Church of St Francis and St Bernard. Also known as the Bernadine Church, it is next to St Anne's on the riverbank. It's a sturdy Gothic building from the 16th century, incorporated into the city walls, with loopholes toshoot at the Cossacks. (updated Apr 2023)
Cathedral of the Theotokos (Dievo Motinos Ėmimo į Dangų katedra), Maironio gatve 14. Like St Anne's, this stands by an entrance bridge to Užupis. It was first built in the 1340s by Grand Duke Algirdas before the country became Christian. It's been destroyed, rebuilt and changed use several times - in the 1820s it was the university anatomy department. The present building is from the 1860s in sort-of neoclassical meets the Byzantine style of Georgia. It's Eastern Orthodox (which calls the Virgin Mary Theotokos, god-bearer) and so is the senior church for Russians and Belarusians in Vilnius. (updated Feb 2023)
Angel of Uzupis. In the main square is a statue unveiled on 1 April 2002 of Gabriel blowing a trumpet. He's probably blowing a raspberry. (updated Apr 2023)
Tartle, Užupio 40, ☏ +370 5 247 7724. Gallery of modern art, visit only by pre-booked guided tour. (updated Feb 2023)
Bernadine Cemetery. Established in 1810 by the Bernardine monks of the Church of St Francis in Užupis. It became the main city cemetery, with some 14,000 burial plots, but fell into disrepair from 1945. It was restored from 2010. (updated Apr 2023)
Interior of Saints Peter and Paul Church
Three Crosses Hill. A monument to seven Franciscan friars supposedly beheaded here by pagans, while seven more were crucified then thrown in the river. The story is nonsense, but Lithuania was the last European country to convert to Christianity, and there was indeed conflict. King Mindaugas was baptised in 1250 but the country as whole didn't convert until 1485 when the Duchy united with Poland. Wooden crosses have been erected on the hill since the early 17th century. They needed periodic replacement, until the Tsarists stamped out the practice in 1869. Concrete crosses were built in 1916, got rid of by the Soviets in 1950, and re-built in 1989. (updated Apr 2023)
Old Jewish Cemetery. In use from 1828 to the 1940s - though it was called "New Cemetery" as the first (north of River Neris) was established in the 15th century. The Soviets made sure to destroy both plus the synagogue, so what remains here is a memorial made of old tombstones. A new-new cemetery is now in the northwest district of Šeškinė. (updated Apr 2023)
Church of Saints Peter and Paul, Antakalnio 1 (trolleybus #2 or #20 from the bus & railway station). Daily 07:00-18:30. The first church from around 1500 was wooden and burned down, and its successor was wrecked in the 1650s in the war with Russia. The present building was commissioned by Michał Kazimierz Pac (1624-82), begun in 1668 but only completed in 1704 after his death. The exterior is fairly plain, but inside is baroque run riot.

As of Aug 2023, Vilnius and its approach highways have 4G from Bite, and 5G from Tele2 and Telia.
Wi-fi is widely available in public places in the city.
Vilnius is a relatively safe city, but use standard common sense: safeguard valuables and don't get drunk. The railway and bus station area is safe enough in daylight but it is not recommended to remain in this area at night.
Rough areas where you have no reason to wander include the southern districts of Naujininkai and Kirtimai, and Šnipiškės beyond the business district.
Always check with your accommodation: they'll know which pharmacies are open late, and which number to call for medical care. This is likely to be the Centro Poliklinika (+370 5 244 2244 / 265 8564), which is open 24/7.
