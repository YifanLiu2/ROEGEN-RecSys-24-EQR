Lovers' Road, Gongbei, with Jida visible past the hills
Zhuhaidead link (珠海; Zhūhǎi in Mandarin, Jyūhói in Cantonese) is a city in Guangdong Province, China. The name means Pearl Sea; Zhuhai is where the Pearl River (珠江; Zhūjiāng) flows into the South China Sea (南中国海 Nánzhōngguóhǎi or simply 南海 Nánhǎi).
Zhuhai is known for its beautiful long coastline, waving palm trees, open spaces, low population density, and its many islands; Zhuhai's nicknames are the city of romance (浪漫之城) and the city of a hundred islands (百岛之市). Zhuhai serves as the gateway to the former Portuguese colony of Macau, as a tourist destination for Chinese, and as a playground for hedonistic Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan visitors who come for Zhuhai's very colorful nightlife.
Guangdong province, Zhuhai in yellow
The Zhuhai area has been inhabited for thousands of years. Until the 1970s, Zhuhai was a group of fishing villages with a population of around 100,000. Since 1980, when it was designated a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) by the central government, Zhuhai has expanded to include nearby areas and is now a fast-growing modern city with about  million inhabitants as of the 2010 census. However, it is still not as large and developed as neighboring cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Zhuhai's northern districts of Jinding and Tangjia, as well as the western district of Doumen, are less developed factory-driven areas that retain a deeper working-man, salt-of-the-earth quality.
Located in the Pearl River Delta, Zhuhai borders Jiangmen to the northwest, Zhongshan to the north, and former Portuguese colony Macau to the south. By sea, former British colony Hong Kong and Chinese boomtown Shenzhen are just across the Pearl estuary to the east. The provincial capital Guangzhou is about 150 km to the north.
Zhuhai is one of China's cleanest and prettiest cities, and received numerous accolades for its excellent ecological development efforts. In 1998, it was awarded the International Award for Best Practices in Improving Living Environment by the United Nations Center for Human Settlements. It is also commonly agreed to be one of the best cities in China to retire in. With a low population density compared to other cities in China, Zhuhai is unsurprisingly greener. Parks and open spaces dot the cityscape, and waving palm trees line the extensive coastline and many of the major streets.
The weather in Zhuhai is sub-tropical. Temperature varies between 10 °C (50 °F) in winter (Dec to Feb) to a hot and humid 35 °C (95 °F) in summer (Jun to Sep). Typhoons are also a possibility in summer. The best times to visit are during spring and Autumn.
The city of Zhuhai itself is composed of Xiangzhou, Jida, Gongbei, Qianshan and New Xiangzhou. The other areas mentioned are districts within the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone.
North to South along the coast, the main districts are:
Jinding (金鼎; Jīndǐng) – Zhuhai's northernmost district is a factory town whose main attraction is a very large and lively nighttime outdoor BBQ; see the Eat Section for details. Jinding definitely has a working class edge, and is worth visiting for the BBQ alone, but wandering around may give you a different perspective to the ones you have previously experienced elsewhere in Guangdong Province. Visit Jinding to experience the real China before heading back to your more affluent Guangdong stomping grounds. Jinding can be reached via bus 3 or 10, or via sightseeing bus 2.
Main commercial area of Tangjia at night.
Tangjia (唐家; Tángjiā) – Both Tangjia and Jinding are parts of the nowadays subdivision named Tangjiawan. However, Tangjia, the centre of Tangjiawan, is somehow different from Jinding, so the local usually regard them as two places. Tangjia is a moderate sized town between Jinding and Xiangzhou. Like Jinding, Tangjia's salt-of-the-earth qualities are more evident than its southern neighbours. Best known for the large Dragon Union Opera House (located inside the Dragon Union Hotel) which, as the name suggests, puts on live variety shows semi-regularly, its primary function is serving as a gigantic karaoke house that mixes karaoke with all-inclusive adult entertainment.
Xiangzhou skyline seen from Jinshan Park
Xiangzhou (香洲; Xiāngzhōu) – Government offices, big department stores (including AEON), and some bars and restaurants are scattered throughout this district. This is the area where the locals mainly go shopping.
On the inland side is New Xiangzhou (新香洲; Xīnxiāngzhōu), an area that has undergone extensive development over the last few decades, especially midrange or upmarket residential buildings but with commercial and business buildings as well. It is often excluded when mentioning Xiangzhou only. Xiangzhou may be referred to as Old Xiangzhou (老香洲; Lǎoxiāngzhōu) in order to distinguish it from both New Xiangzhou and Xiangzhou District (香洲区; Xiāngzhōu Qū), a major administrative division which covers a much larger area and includes not only Xiangzhou and New Xiangzhou but also Jida, Gongbei, Qianshan, Tangjiawan, Wanzai and several other neighbourhoods. Both (Old) Xiangzhou and New Xiangzhou are informal names, which you won't necessarily find on city maps.
Jida, with Mao's personal jet
Jida (吉大; Jídà) is along the coast between Xiangzhou and Gongbei. This district has a lot of offices, high-end hotels and shopping complexes. This is not a particularly useful district to mention for directions, except for the fact that a Jida location assures you that the location is fairly near to the water and that a taxi driver will likely take the road right along the coast until you get there.
Gongbei (拱北; Gǒngběi) is the main tourist area with a wide variety of inexpensive hotels, clothing, electronics, souvenirs, food, drink, and colorful entertainment in relatively close proximity to the Macau border crossing. Lianhua Lu (Lotus Road; 莲花路; Liánhuālù; sometimes called Walking Street; 步行街; Bùxíngjiē) while interesting any time of day, is truly a must-see spectacle at night, with dozens of small outdoor-bar stalls which are always packed at night. Here you can see people drinking, playing dice with bar girls, and watching (or interacting with) working girls and passers-by on the crowded pedestrian-only street that is filled with shops and street-food vendors (see the Drink Section for more details). There is also the more upscale Bar Street (酒吧街; Jiǔbājiē), a modern strip of nicer upscale bars with indoor and outdoor seating, some featuring live music (many blasting loud music inside). Most of these cater to Chinese businessmen and moneyed tourists. At the southern edge of Gongbei is an underground shopping center and the Macau border crossing (see Buy Section for more details).
Going West from Gongbei are other districts:
Wanzai (湾仔; Wānzǎi) has a ferry terminal to Macau and a Seafood Street where you get to select your own live seafood before they are prepared for your dining pleasure.
Doumen (斗门; Dǒumén) is in the Norththwest. It is a bit out of the way, in that most of Zhuhai spreads north along the coast. The very scenic Jintai Buddhist Temple, built at the end of the Song Dynasty is over 1,000 years old and is well worth a visit if you are in the area. Get the full treatment at the Imperial Hot Springs Resort or Yu Wenquan in Doumen, the first Japanese outdoor garden-style hot springs resort in China, with over 20 kinds of hot springs. Linguistically distinct from the rest of Zhuhai.
One of Zhuhai's nicknames is the city of a hundred islands (146 to be exact), and it has a number of islands that are accessible from ports by ferries. An often overlooked aspect is the fact that each of the islands has a unique character. Some have decent beaches, and some are eerily quiet fishing islands. Each trip is a noticeable escape from the hustle and bustle of living in Chinese cities. A trip to the islands is arguably comparable to leaving the country. High-quality seafood abounds. Information about where to go or what to do can be difficult to come by because most locals do not visit due to cost of transportation. As a result, most tourists do not get a chance to explore these beautiful places at all, and most of the information available on the internet regarding Zhuhai focuses on the urban areas. Nonetheless, the curious expat or adventurous traveler will be generously rewarded. From the Xiangzhou Port (香洲港; Xiāngzhōugǎng), formerly Xiangzhou Northern Wharf (香洲北堤码头; Xiāngzhōu Běidīmǎtóu), you can get to the Wanshan Islands (万山群岛; Wànshānqúndǎo):
Dong'ao Island (东澳岛; Dōng'àodǎo) has diving facilities, clear waters, and a nice beach.
Outer Lingding Island or Wailingding Island (外伶仃岛; Wàilíngdīngdǎo) is also a nice getaway with clear waters and nice beaches.
Hebao Island (荷包岛; Hébāodǎo) is less developed and visited, and is a good spot for those who like wilderness.
Guishan Island (桂山岛; Guìshāndǎo) has a sleepy fishing island town feel with exceptional seafood.
While not as distant and not part of the Wanshan Islands, Yeli Island (野狸岛; Yělídǎo), Hengqin Island (横琴岛, Héngqíndǎo), Qi'ao Island (淇澳岛; Qí'àodǎo), and Gaolan Island (高栏岛; Gāolándǎo) can all be reached by bus via a bridge or dam.
Remember to take plenty of cash with you on these island excursions because some islands might not have ATMs.
Entrance to Zhuhai from the Macau border
Cantonese is the main local language of Zhuhai, it being a part of the Pearl River Delta. However, due to the massive influx of immigrants from other parts of China over the last three decades, Mandarin is now the lingua franca. That said, Cantonese is more commonly heard here than in Shenzhen. The local dialect in the Doumen district is similar to Taishanese, and has limited mutual intelligibility with standard Cantonese.
English is not widely spoken, but some people, especially the young, speak it.
Zhuhai is one of the most popular cities for foreigners in China, and because of that, you can find some speakers of European languages here.
Most visitors to China will require an advance visa, which can be obtained in Hong Kong or Macau. See Visas for details.
Zhuhai is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) which means that if you are only visiting the Zhuhai area directly from Hong Kong or Macau, a special SEZ visa can be obtained upon arrival. This allows you to visit Zhuhai only for up to 3 days, and travelling beyond the city limits is strictly forbidden. This visa is available at the Gongbei land entry point from Macau, as well as at the Hengqin and Jiuzhou ferry terminals. This costs ¥160 for most nationalities and ¥450 (December 2008) for UK citizens. It is reported that US citizens must pay ¥950 (January 2011), or else that they cannot use the service at all. Hong Kong dollars are not accepted. Currency can be converted at the China Tourist Services office back downstairs in the main immigration hall, but usually at an awful rate. Once the visa has been issued, proceed to the immigration hall to complete the immigration process.
Zhuhai Sanzao Airport (ZUH IATA). This is a moderately sized, modern airport that connects the area with many Chinese cities, but no international destinations. It is in west of the centre of the Jinwan District.
The Airport Express Bus departs from the airport to Xiangzhou and Gongbei districts for ¥25 (March 2018) per passenger, and follows the schedule of arriving flights. The first bus departs around 11:00 and the last bus departs about 21:30. A taxi from the airport to Gongbei or Jiuzhou in downtown Zhuhai is around ¥130 (October 2011) when traffic is free flowing. You may also take public bus number 207, which goes right to the Gongbei border crossing, and costs ¥6. However the journey time is between 1 hour 45 mins and 2 hours. This bus does not have a luggage storage area on board.
To reach Zhuhai from outside China, one would usually fly to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Macau or Guangzhou. All four cities have large, modern airports with many international connections and all are within an hour or two of Zhuhai; Macau is closest. Foshan is another airport available nearby, but it has few connections.
From the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN IATA), a frequent express bus service that goes to Zhuhai is available. It costs ¥80 and takes approximately 2½ hours with one stop in the northern part of Zhuhai before going on to the Gongbei border gate to Macau. There is a check in for the airport at Gongbei bus station, located near the KFC.
From Macau International Airport (MFM IATA), the best way to get to Zhuhai is via the Express Link service, skipping the Macau immigration and customs altogether. Once you alight from the plane, instead of going through immigration, look for the Express Link (China) sign and follow it. This will lead you past a transit security scan station where you must pick up an Express Link card, and upstairs into the departure hall. Go to the ticket counter at Gate 8, present your card and buy a ticket for the coach that goes to the Gongbei Port of Entry. The coach fare is ¥52 and the ride takes only 15 minutes. Coach departure times are 11:00, 11:30, 12:00, 12:30, 13:00, 14:45, 17:00, 17:30, and 18:00. If you need to check in any bags for your flight, remember to have them blue tagged during your flight check-in procedure for this Express Link service. The blue tag is not a necessity, merely a convenience. Present your luggage tags at the above-mentioned coach ticket counter and pick up your bags at the bus bay later.
The option to skip the Macau immigration is not available on the return. Allow at least three hours to get from Gongbei to the Macau airport. Immigration formalities can be very time-consuming, particularly on the Chinese side during the weekends. Once out of the Chinese customs (before entering Macau), there is a little ticket booth to the left where you can get a shuttle bus ticket to the airport for ¥35. The buses will be waiting on the left once you leave the Macau immigration hall. They run at 10 minutes intervals.
Should you decide to go through the Macau immigration at the airport and use the Taxi service to get to Zhuhai, the ride takes only about 15 minutes. It costs about ¥60-80 for the short ride. But it is reasonable priced for those (>2 persons) who wish to share the taxi cab fees. The charges are inclusive of surcharge of ¥5 at the airport, ¥5 per piece of luggage. Taxi payment can be in patacas, Hong Kong dollars or renminbi. They are all treated equally in value (even though Macau pataca has the lowest value of the three currencies). Taxi cabs queue at the curve outside of the airport.
From Hong Kong International Airport (HKG IATA), one option is to take the Airport Express to Kowloon Station (at the cost of HK$90), then hop on the free Airport Express transit bus K2 to the China-Hong Kong Ferry Terminal (中港城码头; Zhōnggǎng Chéngmǎtóu) to take a ferry to Zhuhai. See below for ferry timetable.
Another option from Hong Kong is to catch a ferry from the HKIA Skypier to Macau and then cross into Zhuhai via the Gongbei border gate. To catch the ferry from the airport, go directly to the ticket counter without passing through Hong Kong immigration or customs; see Hong Kong International Airport#By ferry for details. Full instructions can be found here. The ferry journey takes about 50 minutes and runs hourly (usually).
A third option from HKIA is now available in the form of long-distance buses that go overland to Gongbei. The journey takes 3½ hours and costs HK$200. Departure times are 07:00, 08:00, 16:00, 17:00, and 19:00.
A new ferry service was introduced that brings travelers directly from HKIA to the Jiuzhou Port in Zhuhai. The ferry leaves at 12:15, 14:15, 17:00, and 20:10. The one from Zhuhai to HKIA leaves at 9:30, 12:40, 15:25, and 18:35. The trip takes approximately 70 minutes and costs ¥290.
HZMBus shuttle buses between Hong Kong and Zhuhai/Macao
From Hong Kong, frequent HZMBus shuttle buses departing up to every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day are available to cross the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge (HZMB). They take around 40 minutes, and tickets can be purchased with Octopus or AliPay from ticket machines, as well as cash and credit cards at the ticket desk at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. The Hong Kong Port can be reached by taxis or various buses including CityFlyer airport (A number) routes, or the B5 shuttle bus from Sunny Bay MTR station, or the B6 bus from Tung Chung. Once arriving at the  HZMB Zhuhai Port (Gǎng Zhū Ào Dàqiáo Zhūhǎi Kŏu'ān 港珠澳大桥珠海口岸), you can take taxis or the L1 bus which uses historic tourist vehicles, or the 12, 23 or 25 buses to continue your journey in the mainland.
Hundreds of buses also come from Guangzhou every day, usually via the Jingzhu Motorway. You can catch one at:
South Campus of Sun Yat-Sen University (中山大学南校园) just next to the South Gate.
East Campus of Sun Yat-Sen University (中山大学东校园).
Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (广州白云机场) just inside the Arrival Hall
Shipai Campus of Jinan University (暨南大学石牌校区).
Exit A2 of Zhujiang New Town Metro Station (珠江新城地铁站A2出口).
Exit B of Wanshengwei Metro Station (万胜围地铁站B出口).
Be cautious when leaving for Jizhu!
Both pinyin of abbreviations of "Zhuhai Campus of Jinan University" (暨珠) and "Zhuhai College of Jilin University" (吉珠) are Jizhu. Check twice you didn't make mistakes when buying tickets!
From any of these locations, the trip will cost ¥35-88 and take about 2 hours. Buses leave every 40 minutes (from Guangzhou Airport) or 1 hour (from SYSU Campuses) or  hours (from other places in Guangzhou) and go to Gongbei, Xiangzhou, Zhuhai Campus of Sun Yat-Sen University (中山大学珠海校区 or simply 中珠), Zhuhai Campus of Jinan University (暨南大学珠海校区 or simply 暨珠), Zhuhai College of Beijing Normal University (北京师范大学珠海学院 or simply 北师珠), Zhuhai Colledge of Beijing Institute of Technology (北京理工大学珠海学院 or simply 北理珠), Huxin Raod Crossing (湖心路口), Zhuhai College of Jilin University (吉林大学珠海学院 or simply 吉珠) or Tangjia depending on the bus you take.

From Hong Kong and Shenzhen: There are several ferries per day from Hong Kong International Airport, HK-Macau Ferry Terminal (港澳码头; Gǎng'ào Mǎtóu; Hong Kong Island), China Ferry Terminal (中港城码头; Zhōnggǎng Chéngmǎtóu Kowloon) in Hong Kong and Shekou Ferry Terminal (蛇口港; Shékǒugǎng; Shekou) in Shenzhen arriving at the Jiuzhou Ferry Terminal (九洲港码头; Jiǔzhōugǎng Mǎtóu). There is a taxi rank and bus stops directly outside. You can take a free bus ride to Gongbei by showing your ferry ticket. Visas can be purchased here for most nationalities (not American citizens). Payment is in RMB only and the ATMs are through immigration so plan ahead.
The HKIA-Zhuhai ferry is operated by Chu Kongdead link, who charge HK$260/¥280 one-way to/from Zhuhai.
Getting to Zhuhai Airport from the Jiuzhou Ferry port that connects Zhuhai with Hong Kong, an Airport bus can be taken for about ¥30 and the last bus departs at 20:00. The journey takes about 2 hours.
From Macau: There is a ferry service operating from Macau's Inner Harbour's Pier 14 (澳门粤通码头; Àomén Yuètōng Mǎtóu) to Wanzai. Daily departures roughly hourly from 08:00-16:00.
From Macau: It is possible to drive across the border from Macau via Lotus Bridge or Port of Entry. Unlike Macau, Mainland China drives on the right.
Only vehicles with dual plates are allowed to drive across the border.
From Mainland China: The road connections from other parts of mainland China have been improved. The G4w Motorway (Jinggangao Motorway or Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau Motorway, 京港澳高速), also formerly Jingzhu Motorway (Beijing-Zhuhai Mortorway, 京珠高速), which connects Guangzhou, is always the main and the most crowded solution to arrive. The S43 Motorway or Guangzhu West Line (广珠西线高速), is another option. Highways like G105, S111 are also available.
From Jiangmen, there are S32 Motorway, (Western Coastal Motorway 西部沿海高速), S47 Mortorway (Jiangzhu Motorway or Jiangmen-Zhuhai Mortorway, 江珠高速), S365 and S272 to choose. However, the S272 is of rough surface.
From Hong Kong: The 50-km Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau link, a bridge and tunnel opened on 24 October 2018, is likely one of the largest construction projects in the world. The link makes it possible to travel quickly across the Pearl River Delta without taking the ferry. There are restrictions on driving across, and drivers must apply for special permits, so taking a shuttle bus is probably a better choice.
The border, seen from Gongbei; the red building is the Port of Entry (customs and immigration). Beyond it is Macau
You can walk across the border from Macau at Gongbei. The border is open from 07:00-24:00. It typically takes 20 minutes of walking time, but be prepared for long queues, which can easily add over an hour to your total border crossing time.
Port of Entry (called Portas do Cerco (barrier gate) in Macao).
An alternative crossing is via the Lotus Bridge in Macau's Cotai area to the island of Hengqin. This border crossing point is open 08:00-20:00. After crossing the Macau side, take a shuttle bus across the bridge to the China side (fare ¥3, no change given so carry the exact amount). From the Hengqin side of the border take bus number 14 to Xiangzhou, or catch one of the Kee Kwan air-conditioned minibuses to Wanzai or Gongbei (¥5).
For foreigners entering China, you will need to produce a valid visa. Follow the immigration line that says "Foreigner". Once you clear immigration, you enter the duty-free zone. Consider picking up some Western chocolate or liquor, especially if you need gifts for Chinese. Jameson's at HK$70 a bottle is a good buy, as are some of the wines and single malt whiskeys. Do not bother with common brands of whiskey or cognac; those a readily available in China. Cigarettes are generally cheaper in downtown Zhuhai than at the duty-free (do not buy cigarettes in duty-free, most are fake).
When you exit the Gongbei immigration building, you have reached the Zhuhai border. If you need to purchase a pre-paid cellphone card, please proceed to exit the immigration building, then walk downstairs to the underground mall. There are many telephone services stalls here. You may purchase a pre-paid sim-card here for ¥100. It comes with a loaded value of ¥50. You will need a GSM phone to get it to work. Always keep your belongings zipped inside your pocket here as pickpockets are very common at the border check point.
On the return trip from China to Macau, here are the border crossing tips from Zhuhai China to Macau via Gongbei port. The Gongbei immigration building opens at 07:00. If you arrived at the Zhuhai Gongbei port via Taxi cab, you either arrive in front of the Gongbei immigration building or via the underground tunnel, linked to the underground mall below the Gongbei immigration building. Proceed to queue up at the entrance of building. It is rather cold in the morning so bring enough warm clothing with you if you decided to queue up in the morning before 07:00.
When the building opens, proceed inside the building. Look for the line that says "Foreigner" (usually line# 15). If you are already late for your connecting flight, go to the express line (no queuing required) and show them your air ticket for immediate attention. Once you clear the Chinese immigration, you enter the duty-free zone. Proceed to the immigration hall. Foreigners are required to fill in a blue-colored slip in this hall, declaring your place of stay in Macau and your departure details. Proceed to queue at the line that says "Foreigner". Once you clear the Macau immigration, proceed to exit the building. If you carry any luggage with you, the immigration officer may request that your luggage be scanned by the X-ray machine before you are allowed to exit the immigration building. The whole border crossing process takes about 20–25 minutes, excluding waiting time in the long queues.
You can get to the airport by taxi or bus. The journey is about 15 minutes by taxi from Gongbei port. There is a surcharge of MOP5 to get to the airport and $6 per item of luggage. It costs about MOP70 to get to the airport by taxi (inclusive of surcharges). Taxis accept Macau patacas, Hong Kong dollars or Chinese yuan for payment. These currencies are treated equally (With yuan being the most expensive) during payment. You can still use a Chinese SIM card up to the mid-span of the Friendship Bridge in Macau. After that, the signal drops off.
The Guangzhou-Zhuhai Intercity Railway (Guangzhu ICR) was fully opened in 2012. There are five stations in Zhuhai:

The journey from Guangzhou South station to Zhuhai takes around 53–78 minutes and costs ¥390 for luxury sleeper, ¥350 for standard sleeper, ¥205 for luxury class, ¥90 for first class and ¥56– for second class or no-seat ticket. Trains will stop at either Zhuhai North (珠海北, called as "Zhuhaibei" formally in ticket system), Tangjiawan (唐家湾), Mingzhu (明珠) or Qianshan (前山, temporarily closed) (or any combination of the four) before terminating at Zhuhai Station: different trains stop at different stations, so if you intend to alight at an intermediate station, be sure to check first if your train will stop there. The first train departs Guangzhou South for Zhuhai at 06:10, while the last train departs Zhuhai for Guangzhou at 22:57.
Guangzhu ICR stations are served by several bus routes. Bus routes 3A (to Jiuzhou ferry port) and 65 (to Zhulinpu in Tangjiawan), as well as a minivan service to Beijing Normal University, serve Zhuhai North station, while bus 207 (to the airport) stops outside of Zhuhai station. There are also taxi ranks outside all stations.
The Guangzhu ICR has been merged into the railway system of China, so the train destinations increased. Trains departing from Beijing, Shanghai, Guiyang, Kunming, Chengdu, Zhanjiang, Zhengzhou, Huaihua, Guilin, Meizhou directions can reach Zhuhai now. For example, as of 2018, the Beijing-Zhuhai train (D923) leaves Beijing at 20:35, arriving to Zhuhai at 07:49 the next morning. The second-class seat fare is ¥779, a sleeper (动卧) is ¥1430. From Chengdu, it's a day train (via Chongqing, Guiyang, and Guilin),
D1841, leaving Chengdu at 06:39 and arriving to Zhuhai at 16:52.
Zhuhai is quite spread out. The terrain is coastal plain broken up by mountains or, seen from the sea, a series of bays and headlands. There are many clumps of development separated by hills, often parkland.
You can walk or take a taxi from ¥10 (the first 3-kilometre); these are good options for moving within a single district.
Zhuhai has an extensive bus system. The fare for a ride is ¥1 regardless of distance; pay in the box in front of the driver, or by Alipay or transit card (see below). Bus 10 will cross all of the Zhuhai SEZ north to south or south to north. By taking bus 10 it is possible to conveniently move between Gongbei, Xiangzhou, Tangjia, and Jinding. Bus 10 terminates in the south near the Macau border in Gongbei and terminates in the north on the main street of Jinding. Bus 4 will allow you to reach Jiuzhou ferry port for trips to Hong Kong or Shenzhen.
Avoid bus 2, bus K10 at rush hour, and buses 16 and 26 when the classes of boarding schools end on Friday or Saturday because of heavy crowds.
Zhuhai transit cards give you a 10% discount on the buses. Buying a card requires a ¥15 deposit. Zhongshan transit cards and Ling Nan Tong (岭南通) cards (used in Guangzhou and other cities in the province) are also accepted.
The double decker sightseeing bus bus goes to most areas between Gongbei and Jinding for ¥3. Padded seats and good air conditioning make it a lot more comfortable than city buses for long trips. The last sightseeing bus is at about 19:00.
It is possible to move around districts using the Guangzhu ICR, although as trains don't stop at all stations, options for moving around Zhuhai are more limited than with buses. Fares start at ¥6 for second class, and ¥7 for first class: the journey from Zhuhai North to Zhuhai, for example, is ¥15.
Taking the tram from Haitianyi Zhan (海天驿站) to Shangzhong Xiaozhen (上冲小镇) may be also a special experience.
Zhuhai's streets are mostly flat and the city has extensive bike lanes. Combine that with the attractive views and the fact that the city's attractions are pretty spread out, and you have a very good city for biking. Several competing bikeshare systems operate in Zhuhai; at least the blue ones are usable by foreigners if you have Alipay. In the denser areas of the city the bikes can be found all over, so unless you're going off the beaten path you're sure to find one if you walk for a few minutes.

Fisher Girl Statue, symbol of Zhuhai
Fisher Girl statue, Lovers' Road (Bus 9 or 99 or the sightseeing bus). Legend has it that an angel descended to earth one day and fell in love with the beauty of the land. Reluctant to return, she turned herself into a fisher girl, weaving nets and searching for precious pearls to earn a living. In addition, she unselfishly used her knowledge and powers to heal villagers who were ill, and so was well loved by one and all. Soon she met a young fisherman named Hai Peng and they fell in love. Not long after, however, Hai Peng heard and believed malicious accusations, and demanded the fisher girl to give him her magical bracelets as proof of her affection. The fisher girl tearfully explained the origin of the bracelets. While she was still the daughter of the South Sea Dragon King, the eight bracelets were given to her by the eight palace mistresses, to guard her against the thought of abandoning immortality. She would die if she even removed one. Tragically, Hai Peng did not believe her story and turned to leave. The fisher girl, to prove her love for Hai Peng, removed her bracelets and died in his arms instantly. Hai Peng was filled with remorse and grief. His great sorrow moved the Jiu Zhou Huan Elder, who taught him the way to bring the fisher girl back to life. For this he had to travel to the Jiu Zhou Island to find the Resurrection Grass, which must then be fed with man's blood. After much difficulty, Hai Peng found the grass and grew it with his own blood. Days turned to years, and the grass was finally ready and used to revive the fisher girl. Henceforth, the fisher girl became a true mortal. On the day of their wedding, all the girls together found a gigantic, magical pearl at the seashore. In gratitude, the fisher girl presented this to the reverent Elder.

Zhuhai is known for its nightlife due to its status as a tourist destination for Chinese nationals, and as a playground for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan businessmen looking for female company. Whether it's enjoying Chinese street life, mixing it up with all walks of life on Walking Street, sipping cocktails on Bar Street, or hitting the wild electronic discos, Zhuhai has what you're looking for!
For a truly unique experience, have a beer or coffee at one of the couple dozen open-air bar booths along Linhua Road (莲花路; Liánhuālù; lit. Lotus Road; also known as Walking Street (步行街; Bùxíngjiē)). It is parallel to Yingbin Road and a block east of it, starting on the western side of Gongbei Bus Station, opposite the northeast exit from the underground shopping complex at the Macau border. By day, it is a busy pedestrians-only shopping street with numerous shops.
It transforms into a spectacular must-see atmosphere at night. There are many small outdoor bars, 3 or 4 meters square with a few stools on each side. In the middle is an open area for the bar girls. These girls earn commission on the drinks so their goal is to get you to buy as much beer as possible, partly by helping you put it back and often by winning at various games where the loser must drink. They are experts; do not expect to win. Also, do not expect to take one of them home; they are professional flirts, not prostitutes.
There are many streetwalkers in the area and offers from them are common, although prostitution is illegal in China. There are also beggars who offer to sing or shine your shoes, or present their pet monkey or simply point to their baby sadly.
There are two groups of outdoor bars with the one further south nearer the border emphasizing food (nothing special) and the one a little further north emphasizing drinks. There is a stretch of shops in between the two areas. Drinks are cheap (¥18 for a bottle of beer, fresh fruit juice or cup of coffee), and you get to meet all sorts of travelers, expats, Hong Kong and Macau residents coming over for shopping or cheaper entertainment, local wannabes, and working girls. Hanging out here is by far one of the most interesting things to do in Zhuhai. Use common sense late at night, as things can get pretty wild. Most stalls are open till 03:00 and a few stay open later for enthusiastic customers.
Bar Street (酒吧街; Jiǔbājiē), at around 300 meters long, is a well-established, modern strip of more upscale bars, some featuring live music. It is easily the first place newcomers to Zhuhai go to experience the energy and liveliness of life in Zhuhai after dark. This strip primarily caters to Chinese businessmen, Chinese yuppies, and moneyed or uninformed tourists. It is one block inland and a 20-minute walk from the Gongbei border. Follow the street with the clock tower until it becomes Bar Street.
No. 88 Bar (蚂蚁捌捌 Mayi Baba), First Bar on Bar Street. 203-209 Shuiwan Road, Xiangzhou District (香洲区水湾路203-209号) (At the Corner of Bar Street (Shuiwan Road) and Lian'an Road.

It's on the corner and the first bar you see when you approach bar street. It's ¥380 for a dozen beers or ¥500 for a bottle of whiskey like Jack Daniel's or Chivas Regal. Beware of the bottle service though, you might get counterfeit alcohol and feel like crap afterwards.

Zhuhai is heavily infested with pickpockets and bar street is among their favorite areas. Beware of pairs of well-dressed young men who quietly follow groups of revelers; typically they have razor blades for cutting open pockets,
Your best bet is to hit your bar of choice first and then inquire and explore. The discos tend to be large, intense, heavily into generic Chinese imitation euro-trance music, and popular with the young and rebellious. Cover charges may or may not apply, drinks are expensive by Chinese standards (generally ¥30 or more). Be careful with your possessions as these places are notorious for pickpockets.
There are numerous discos in Zhuhai that will allow you to continue your night into the morning. There are several in Gongbei within a short cab ride of either Bar Street or Walking Street:
(On Walking Street near the food stands closer to the Macau border, look for the escalator going down from the street). Open until 06:00. Disco with lots of action.

Come here if you want to experience where real salt-of-the-earth working class Chinese people go to get their drinks and howl at high decibel levels into a microphone. It is not easily reached by walking if you do not know where you are going, but it is easy to flag down any of the locals and get a ride on their motorcycle (takes about 3 minutes and costs ¥5) or take any of the taxi vans parked all around the middle of the main street. Just motion that you want to drink and sing and point in an eastward direction from the center of the main street to convey the message.

Hotels in Zhuhai are reasonably priced. Travelers on tight budgets can opt for budget or midrange hotels. Most people choose to stay in Gongbei due to its proximity to attractions, nightlife, the Macau border, and its variety of conveniently located and reasonable hotels. Jida has primarily upscale hotels that business travelers sometimes opt for, which are usually conveniently located. Some are further away and require taking taxis or the bus. Further out, Xiangzhou also has a variety of options at different price ranges. The Northern districts of Tangjia and Jinding are further removed from the action of Zhuhai and offer very cheap hotels.
Most budget travelers opt for low end hotels, and there are a number of legitimate cheaper hotels in Gongbei with low prices between ¥160 and ¥230. Talking your way into Chinese only hotels may land you prices in the ¥120 to ¥150 range. Some hotels in Xiangzhou can be had for as little as ¥100 to ¥120, and in the Northern districts of Tangjia or Jinding hotels can be had for as low as ¥80 if you look around. However, for those who truly want rock bottom prices somewhere other than a hotel, there is budget lodging in the form of hostels, and private rooms offered by individuals or families.
On the Walking Street in Gongbei there are at least three massage parlours. If you arrive after 21:00 you may pay ¥60 to ¥88 (depending on the room type) for two hours of traditional Chinese massage and they will let you sleep until mid-day without additional payment. In one establishment you may have the room to yourself. It has television and air-conditioning. In the others you share a room with four other guests.

There are at least a dozen hotels within short walking distance of the Gongbei border, mostly either cheap or mid-range (¥150-400) ones. You can bargain the prices down and normally they have special prices, around half the listed price. On the other hand, it is not uncommon to see a low price on the sign, but find when you go in that only more expensive rooms are available, sometimes this is true, sometimes it is an effort to coax you into a more expensive room. Adventurous single male travelers can scout around for rock bottom prices, and may be able to find a room for as little as ¥120-130 if they can talk these Chinese only hotels into accepting them, which is not always possible. Single female travelers, those with young families, or those fearing excessive street noise or noise from other guests should have no trouble landing a room for ¥175-275 (with an elevator, bellhop, restaurant, etc.), which anyone would feel more than comfortable staying in. Most of the hotels located around the border fall into this category. The available options are plentiful so looking around for a hotel that suits you may be the best plan.

Most higher end hotels are located in Jida or Gongbei. Gongbei situated hotels are more convenient for accessing the Macau border crossing, colorful nightlife and walking around and exploring.

Be sure to thoroughly wash your fruit and vegetables as chemicals can cause illness
In general, Zhuhai is a safe and friendly city. However, it is heavily infested with pickpockets, especially in the crowded shopping areas in Gongbei and on buses. Using a razor to get a wallet out of a hip pocket on a bus is a favorite tactic.
In residential and collegial areas, street crimes are extremely rare. However, the police are also rarely seen patrolling at night. Go to the police station or police room to seek help in emergency.
Zhuhai is well known for its sex trade, but it is not Thailand. Prostitution is illegal in China, and if you are caught with a prostitute by the police, you may be sentenced to up to 15 days of security detention (administrative imprisonment without trial).
As is true everywhere in China, do not drink the tap water, avoid undercooked meats and watch out for counterfeit bills (especially 50s).
Unlike most cities in China, cars usually give way to pedestrians, even this may cause traffic jams, because drivers not yielding to pedestrians may be fined.
It's illegal to drive motorcycles in Xiangzhou District.
Some tour guides will take you to shops that pay them commissions. Those shops are often overpriced, and the usual advice is to never let any local except a trusted friend take you to any tourist shop. One Zhuhai variant involves outrageously priced herbs from a Chinese medicine company called Bai Cao Tang (百草堂).
The bus to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, costs ¥60 to ¥65, runs every half hour and takes 2½ hours from Gongbei or 1 hour 45 minutes from Tangjia. Allow an extra hour for the inevitable Guangzhou traffic jam. You can board one at the underground station in Gongbei to reach Garden Hotel in Guangzhou (花园酒店), or one from near the Gongbei border to get to the Provincial bus station (省汽车站) or Tianhe Dasha bus station (天河大厦). Additionally, it is possible to take the bus from Tangjia in northern Zhuhai to get to the Guangzhou airport, or Guangzhou proper.
Between Zhuhai and Guangzhou is the city of Zhongshan, the hometown of Sun Yat-sen, leader of the Xinhai Revolution and founder of China's first republic. There are frequent buses to Zhongshan from Zhuhai, particularly from bus stations in Gongbei. Moreover, trains on the Guangzhou-Zhuhai Intercity Railway usually include several stops in Zhongshan, though they sometimes bypass Zhongshan's main stations (Zhongshan Station and Zhongshan North Station) and stop only at suburban stations. If you plan on doing a day-trip just to see Sun Yat-sen's former residence, you should take the train to Nanlang Station (南朗站), then either take a taxi or catch a no. 12 bus. Sun Yat-sen's former residence is about 7 km south of Nanlang Station.
Neighbouring Macau can be reached on foot or by car through the Gongbei border crossing, by ferry from Wanzai area (temporarily closed), or on foot or by car through the Lotus Bridge from Hengqin.
Hong Kong can be reached by a 1-hour ferry boat trip from Jiuzhou Port (九洲港). Bus #3 will take you to the ferry terminal. Ferries run regularly all day, with the last boat to Hong Kong leaving at 21:30.
Shenzhen can be reached by a 1-hour ferry boat trip from Jiuzhou Port (九洲港). You can also reach Shenzhen by high-speed train, which takes about 2 hours because the train must go via Guangzhou. The train terminates at Shenzhen North Station, whereas the ferry will take you to Shekou in the city's far southwest.
There are also buses to most nearby cities including Shenzhen (cheaper than the ferry), and overnight buses to Guilin, Xiamen, Zhanjiang and Beihai.
The Xiangzhou and Gongbei bus stations have overnight buses to Guilin or Yangshuo. These are fairly uncomfortable. Unlike most overnight buses, they have no on-board toilets, but they do make several stops during the 12-hour trip. A quicker and more comfortable option would be to take a high-speed train. The train from Zhuhai to Guilin takes just under 4 hours. You can also take the train to Yangshuo County, but keep in mind that Yangshuo Station is over 30 km from Yangshuo Town.
Flying can either be accomplished by using Zhuhai Airport in the western Doumen district of the city, or taking the bus to Guangzhou Airport. Times vary for transportation depending on how far south in Zhuhai you are departing from. If leaving from Xiangzhou, Tangjia, or Jinding it is nearly as fast, and more perhaps more convenient, to go to Guangzhou Airport. If leaving from Gongbei or Jida, Zhuhai airport would be nearer.
There are remote check-ins for nearby airports in Zhuhai. For Guangzhou airport, the check-in is at Gongbei bus station, near the KFC. For Hong Kong and Shenzhen airports, you can check in at the ferry terminal, Jiuzhou Port.
