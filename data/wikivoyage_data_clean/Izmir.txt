İzmir is a port on the Central Aegean coast of Turkey, known in antiquity as Smyrna. It's the country's third-largest city, with a population of  million in 2024.
There are lots of little coves and harbours along Turkey's Aegean coast, but ancient Smyrna stood at the head of a broad inlet sheltered from winter storms, with a fertile hinterland and good inland trade routes. It suffered earthquakes and warfare, but didn't silt up and could accommodate large vessels. Thus it outgrew other ports and is now the modern bustling city of Izmir.
This Smyrna was 5 km north of the present centre, in what is now the suburb of Bayraklı, and founded about 3000 BC by the Trojans. In folklore it was the birthplace of Homer, the 8th century BC author of the Odyssey, which describes a war between Greeks and Trojans 500 years earlier. No-one really knows where Homer lived, but a major harbour city is as good a guess as any. By his day Smyrna was settled by the Aeolians from mainland Greece, who were superseded by another Greek tribe the Ionians. The Lydians destroyed the city around 600 BC before a recovery under Alexander the Great from 334 BC.
Alexander’s successors re-built Smyrna on and below Mount Pagos, nowadays Kadifekale, and the city then prospered under the Romans. It was wrecked by an earthquake in 178 AD but again rebuilt into a major commercial port. After the Byzantines, the city had a turbulent time under the Arabs, Seljuks, Crusaders and Mongols, until Mehmet I incorporated it into the Ottoman Empire in 1415. Under Suleyman the Magnificent, Smyrna became a thriving city and a huge trading centre, in spite of frequent earthquakes. It was cosmopolitan, with a majority of Greek Orthodox plus many Jews, Armenians, Muslims, Italians and French, each injecting their own culture, language and cuisine.
The battlefronts of World War I lay elsewhere in Turkey, and the city remained multicultural. This was not for want of trying by the Ottoman rulers, who in 1915 set about a systematic extermination of the Armenians, and the word "genocide" was first coined to describe this. Meanwhile the Allies promised control over Smyrna both to Italy and to Greece as a reward for joining their side. When the guns fell silent and the Ottomans were defeated, it was Greece that had control over a large swathe of territory along the Aegean coast. But Greece aspired to much more, and marched on Ankara; they got within 100 km before being checked then repulsed by the Turks under Kemal Atatürk, in what became the War of Turkish Independence. His forces took Izmir on 9 September 1922 and this is celebrated as the date of the city's independence, but liberation soon degenerated into massacre of non-Turks. Ethnic minority property was torched, and on the 13th this escalated into a huge fire that claimed over 100,000 lives and destroyed much of the city.
The new reality on the ground necessitated a new peace deal, and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne restored the mainland including Smyrna to Turkey, while Greece retained most of the islands. There was compulsory re-settlement of minorities, so the Greeks were deported to Greece, while Turks in Greece (especially around Thessaloniki, Atatürk's own birthplace) were deported to Turkey. Surviving Armenians fled to Beirut and Egypt. This ended the multicultural nature of the city and of the whole country.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Izmir has a subtropical Mediterranean climate. Summers are hot and rainless yet humid, so July and August highs of 30-35°C feel more like 40°C.
Winters are mild to cool, around 14-18°C with occasional downpours. Freezing snaps occur on clear, windless nights but without snowfall, and occasional snow flurries don't linger.
Spring and fall are warm and pleasant and generally the best time to visit. Beach holidays are best in fall, as the sea temperature lags a month or so behind the land, and is a balmy 20°C in September and October.

Izmir Adnan Menderes Airport (ADB IATA) (off D550, 16 km south of city centre), ☏ +90 232 455 0000. This has frequent flights from Istanbul IST and SAW, Ankara and Antalya, and daily from several other Turkish cities plus Ercan in Northern Cyprus. There are also flights from Athens, Frankfurt and across Europe. Operators include Turkish Airlines, Pegasus, Ajet (formerly known as Anadolujet) and SunExpress (which has a hub here) so this competition keeps fares low. The airport has the usual facilities including car hire. (updated Apr 2024)
İzban suburban trains run every 10 mins to Alsancak Station north of city centre. Change at Hilal for the metro downtown - this station and its surroundings are messy and not easy to navigate. You need an İzmirimkart (below) for the train and subway.
ESHOT bus 202 runs hourly round the clock to Republic Square, taking most of an hour. You need the İzmirimkart to ride it.
Bus 200 runs north to Mavişehir, Bus 204 runs to Bornova metro station, and Bus 206 goes to Şirinyer Aktarma in the southern district of Buca.
HAVAŞ buses here are similar to the other airports they serve: their website oozes corporate guff about transport solutions, and is too cool to publish timetables or fares.
Izmir is not yet on Turkey's high-speed YHT network, so trains are a ponderous overnight affair, when daytime buses cover the distance in half the time. A high-speed railway is under construction and might open by 2027, though 2207 seems just as likely. Until then, the main services (all daily) are:
İzmir Mavi ("Izmir Blue Train"), 14 hrs overnight from Ankara via Eskişehir (which has YHT trains, but not at night) and Kütahya, departing around 18:00.
Konya Mavi ("Konya Blue Train"), 12 hrs overnight from Konya (which has YHT trains, and connections for Adana and Antalya), via Afyon and Manisa, departing around 19:30. Most coaches have seats only and sleepers may be out of supply for the nearest dates.
Ege Ekspressi, 9½ hours daily from Kutahya via Tavsanli, Balıkesir, Soma, Akhisar and Manisa, departing around 09:30 and returning north at 06:30.
Göller Ekspresi ("Lakes Express"), 8 hrs overnight from Isparta via Denizli (for Pamukkale), Nazilli, Aydin and Selcuk (for Ephesus and Kuşadası), departing around 22:00. No sleepers available.
6 Eylül Ekspresi ("6th of September Express"), 6½ hr daily from Bandırma (with ferries from Istanbul) via Balıkesir and Soma, departing around 08:00.
Buy tickets at the station, or in theory online, but the TCDD website has been broken for many months.
Basmane railway station (Basmane Garı), Anafartalar Cd. Terminus for all long-distance trains. Few facilities here, but there are eating places just outside. It's on the Metro. (updated Apr 2024)
"We then sailed on up the narrow strait with wailing. For on one side lay Scylla and on the other divine Charybdis terribly sucked down the salt water of the sea."
- Homer's Odyssey Book 12 Line 234
- Sail close to Scylla, she devours six of your crew for sure but the rest get through. Charybdis may let you through or suck down the entire ship. Which do you choose?
As of 2024 there are no ferries to Izmir beyond local services round the bay; no blame attaches to Scylla or Charybdis. See Çeşme#By boat for the ferry from Chios.

City trains, metro and trams
IZBAN railway (shown in green) runs north-south:
South Line runs from Tepeköy (for Torbali) in the south via the airport and Menderes town to Hilal (for Metro) and Alsancak (for trams, city ferries and the North Line).
South Line Extension runs from Tepeköy to Selçuk, for Ephesus.
North Line runs from Alsancak to Turan, Mavişehir (for trams), Çiğli, Menemen and Aliağa (for connections to Foça and Bergama).
Alsancak railway station on Şehitler Cd is terminus for the IZBAN railway, and has trams. No Metro or mainline trains run here.
Metro (shown in blue) runs east-west, from Bornova to the east via Halkapinar interchange (for trams and North Line), Hilal (for South Line), Basmane (for mainline trains) and Konak to Fahrettin Altay (for Göztepe and Balçova town).
Trams (shown in red) have two separate loops:
City centre and south shore: from Halkapinar interchange to Alsancak, Konak, Göztepe and Fahrettin Altay.
North shore: from Alaybay to Bostanli, Atakent and Mavişehir.
All three rail systems have extensions under construction or in planning.
Izdeniz Ferries criss-cross the city inlet, a cheap, fast and pleasant form of transport.
There are many taxis with reasonable prices and no night rate. Turkish taxis are not allowed to go outside province they are registered at. Meaning an Izmir-registered taxi (registration starting in 35) cannot go beyond Izmir provincial boundaries.
Konak Square is the city's main square and gives its name to the central district. Konak means a mansion, and the provincial governor's mansion stood here. The clocktower (Saat Kulesi), erected in 1901, was one of dozens across the country marking 25 years of the reign of Abdul Hamid II (1842-1918). Neither clocktower nor Hamid fared well in later years, but at least the clocktower has been repeatedly restored, while the Ottoman Empire decayed into "the sick man of Europe". Hamid was deposed in 1909 to spent his last years under house arrest, with no escape from the recriminations of his wives and consorts, who numbered almost as many as his commemorative clocktowers.
Konak Mosque is a dinky little mosque within the square. It's octagonal, built in 1755 and decorated with Kütahya tiles, with a single entrance for both men and women.
Salepçioğlu Mosque was built in 1905. It's named for the fellow who endowed it, an Islamic judge.

It has two cars each taking about ten people on a 58 m lift, and originally was water-powered; from 1985 both are electric. The restaurant at the top has a bird-eye view of Izmir. The street at its base is also known as Darío Moreno Sk for the singer who once lived there, David Arugete (1921-1968). It's tragic that, having dwelt so long by a free lift, he died young in a strop when he came late to an airport boarding gate and was denied boarding. Free. (updated Apr 2024)

İleri!" are his stirring words on the base: “Armies, your first target is the Mediterranean Sea. Forward!”. With only 60 m further to go, this is an easier objective than when he uttered those words in 1922, with the Greeks at the zenith of their advance and the backs of the Turks against the threshold of Ankara.
