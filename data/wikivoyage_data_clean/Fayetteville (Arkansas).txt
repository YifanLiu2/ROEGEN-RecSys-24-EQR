Fayetteville is a city of 87,000 people (2018) in the Ozarks and the Ozarks Region of Arkansas.
It is home for the main campus of the University of Arkansas, and has many characteristics of a college town, including many bars, restaurants and specialty stores. It serves as a regional hub for live music and performances, with several venues. Fayetteville is also part of the booming Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers-Bentonville metropolitan area in Northwest Arkansas, and has experienced dramatic growth since the 1990s.
Fayetteville's core area of interest centers around the historic downtown square and Dickson Street, which runs between Highway 71B (also known as College Avenue) and the University of Arkansas campus, and is the "main drag" for restaurants and bars. This area can be flooded with people during the very popular Razorbacks college sports games, or during a number of festivals, the biggest of which is the Bikes, Blues, and BBQ Festival. This downtown area, along with the UofA campus and a few historic neighborhoods on either side, is quite walkable. The rest of town, including several strip-mall shopping districts that extend along the highway and residential neighborhoods, is less accessible except by car; bus service is available, but is limited.
