Kingston is one of the most historic cities in Canada with many churches, old buildings, picturesque neighbourhoods, and 19th-century fortifications. The city provides venues for nightlife such as clubbing and pubbing, and provides weekend escapes for people living in the neighbouring cities of Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto. There are ample historic sites and museums to visit, and many lively summer events.
Kingston is a city of 133,000 people (2021) in Eastern Ontario. It is on the north shore of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence, halfway between Montréal and Toronto.
Kingston is the home of two universities (Queen's University and Royal Military College) and one community college (St. Lawrence College). Along with tourism, these educational institutes and the students they attract provide much to the city's local economy. Kingston is also the home to a number of prisons.
Kingston is nicknamed the "Limestone City" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone.
The group that first occupied the area before the arrival of the French was probably the Wyandot people (Hurons), who were later displaced by Iroquoian groups.
At the time the French arrived in the Kingston area, Five Nations Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) had settled along the north shore of Lake Ontario. Although the area around the south end of the Cataraqui River was often visited by Iroquois and other groups, Iroquois settlement at this location only began after the French established their outpost. By 1700, the north shore Iroquois had moved south, and the area once occupied by the Iroquois (which includes Kingston) became occupied by the Mississaugas who had moved south from the Lake Huron and Lake Simcoe regions.
Growing European exploration in the 17th century and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Aboriginal occupants to control trade led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as "Cataraqui" (generally pronounced "kah-tah-ROCK-way") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later Fort Frontenac, became a focus for settlement. Cataraqui was renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s.
In 1783, the British governor of the Province of Quebec established a settlement for displaced British colonists, or "Loyalists", who were fleeing north because of the American Revolutionary War. The British Crown entered into an agreement with the Mississaugas in October 1783 to purchase land east of the Bay of Quinte.
During the War of 1812, Kingston (with a population of 2250) was a major military centre. It was the base for the Lake Ontario division of the Great Lakes British naval fleet, whose aim was to control Lake Ontario. Fort Henry was built on Point Henry in 1813. The present limestone citadel, constructed between 1832 and 1836, was intended to defend the Rideau Canal at the Lake Ontario end, the harbour and the naval dockyard.
Kingston became an important port for commodities shipped along the lake from the west. Wheat, flour, meat, and potash were unloaded and stored at Kingston to await transfer to vessels that could navigate the risky St. Lawrence.
Queen's University, originally Queen's College, one of the first liberal arts universities, first held classes in March 1842; established by the Presbyterian Church, it later became a national institution. The Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) was founded in 1876.
Kingston Penitentiary, Canada's first large federal penitentiary, was established in 1835 and operated until 2013. Several more prisons were established later in the greater Kingston area.
Kingston was chosen as the first capital of the united Canadas and it served in that role from 1841 to 1844. The city was considered too small and lacking in amenities, however, and its location near the border made it vulnerable to American attack. Kingston's growth then slowed considerably and its national importance declined.

Kingston is fully accessible by road, air and water. There are no scheduled connections by bus, train or air to any point on the US side from Kingston, despite its proximity (50 km) to Interstate 81. However, ferry by car from the United States is possible by taking Horne's Ferry (May–October) from Cape Vincent, New York state to Wolfe Island (Ontario). By driving the short distance across Wolfe Island, you can get to downtown Kingston via the free Wolfe Island Ferry.
Driving into the Kingston area is usually done on Highway 401, although this highway does not go downtown.
Times from major cities are:
Ottawa, 2 hours to the northeast via Ontario Highway 416 to 401 exit 721, or via Hwy 7 and Hwy 15 for a more direct route.
Montreal, 3 hours to the east on Ontario Highway 401 (Québec Autoroute 20)
Toronto, 3 hours to the west on Highway 401
Syracuse, 2½ hours to the south on Interstate 81
The 401 is easily reachable from Interstate 81 (Watertown, Syracuse, Binghamton) at exit 661.
Kingston may be reached in an hour or less from:
Napanee and Belleville to the west on former Highway 2 or the 401
Prince Edward County to the southwest on Highway 33 (the Loyalist Parkway)
Smiths Falls to the northeast on Highway 15
Sharbot Lake and the southern branch of the Trans-Canada Highway via former Highway 38
The Thousand Islands. A year-round ferry to Wolfe Island and a group of seasonal tour boats leave directly from downtown Kingston.

The Poparide carpool service facilitates share a ride with another driver going the same way. It is often cheaper than taking the train or bus, but one gets to travel in a private vehicle, which is often more comfortable. There are usually plenty of rides from Toronto or Ottawa, often used by Queen's University students. Rides from Toronto range from $30-40, from Ottawa range from $25-35.
Megabus Service from Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Cornwall, and Brockville. Also a daily bus from Pearson International Airport. This carrier services  Kingston Bus Terminal, 1175 John Counter Blvd, ☏ +1 613-547-4916. Daily 8:30AM-8PM. . Travellers can get downtown by taxi, or by local transit (a taxi and bus stand can be found on the bus station property, across from the Tim Horton's). By bus, the #2 Division Street travels to the downtown core every half-hour (every hour evenings and weekends); the routes serving the train station (#7, #16, #18) also all stop at the bus station. Travel time to Kingston from Toronto is -3 hours and from Montreal is 3 hours.
Rider Express is another service in competition to Megabus. It runs a Toronto-Belleville-Kingston-Ottawa route, often at prices lower than Megabus. (Toronto-Kingston is usually $40, as opposed to Megabus's $70). However, it runs fewer services compared to Megabus. It also drops passengers off at a gas station, which is an unpleasant 20-minute walk to the Kingston Bus Terminal where one can connect to Kingston Transit services. However, if you're lucky with the schedules, you might be able to catch the #7 bus to get you to the Bus Terminal for further connections. Travel time to Kingston from Toronto is 3 hours and from Ottawa is 2 hours.

Ottawa Uplands (YOW IATA, 175 km/110 mi) is closest by road.
Montréal-Dorval (YUL IATA, 275 km) has both an easy shuttlebus connection to VIA's passenger rail service (which runs Montréal-Kingston-Toronto) and connecting flights which reach Kingston (on Pascan Aviation).
Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ IATA, 275 km) has direct scheduled bus (Megabus), or can be reached by transferring from downtown Toronto's Union Station Bus Terminal to the UP Express train. It has the largest selection of flights.
Syracuse NY USA (SYR IATA, 215 km/130 mi) has a seven-seat shuttle van (+1-800-731-6335), but at more than $200 (one way) its cost wipes out anything US travellers might have saved by flying domestic.

Note: The Lasalle Causeway, a historic bascule bridge which carried Ontario Highway 2 across the Cataraqui River from downtown Kingston to the military base, Fort Henry and the Royal Military College, was damaged during maintenance in late March 2024. For motorists, this leaves three options - cross at the Waaban Crossing bridge (two lanes from John Counter Boulevard in the west to Gore Road in the east, opened Dec 2022), take the 401 (six lanes, built 1956 as the main bypass road from Toronto-Montréal) or cross at one of the Rideau Canal locks (one lane at Kingston Mills, two at Brewers Mills). For "tour train" passengers, expect any stops on the east side of the bridge (including Fort Henry) to be omitted from the tour, which is still running on the west (downtown) bank. As the bascule bridge must lift to let large boats through, there are also disruptions to boat tours. The Island Belle, Island Star and Canadian Empress are (as of April 2024) stranded on the "wrong" (north) side of the bridge, unable to reach the St. Lawrence River. The Island Queen is on the "correct" (south) side, with no clear timeline for when the issue will be resolved. Any Kingston Transit routes which served the army base, Fort Henry or Barriefield village have been rerouted to the Waaban Crossing (the name means "dawn" or "tomorrow" in Ojibwe, as the bridge leads east). 1

Kingston is separated from Barriefield (Fort Henry, military base and Royal Military College) by the Cataraqui River, part of the Rideau Canal system. Most of the popular Kingston attractions, including the downtown core, are west of the bridge; most travellers, therefore, seek lodgings in or west of downtown.
There are also some franchise chains (food, fuel, lodging) near the freeway (401 exit 617, Division St.) which serve highway travellers; if it's near the 401, it's not near the main attractions (museums, universities, the downtown waterfront, tour boats, ferries or points of historic interest) as 401 is a bypass road.
The area near the downtown waterfront is the most favourable location (as many but not all activities are within walking distance) but also the most expensive. Accommodations range from large chain hotels with full facilities to smaller historic properties, to a niche market of small but upscale bed-and-breakfast style inns. There is plenty of good accommodation to be had in the downtown and waterfront area if one is willing to pay top dollar.

There are two limited-service hotels (a Motel 6 and a Quality Inn) near the factory park on exit 611, Hwy 38/Gardiners Road.
A few moderately-priced chains (Courtyard by Marriott, Holiday Inn Express, Days Inn, Comfort Inn, FirstCanada Inns) sit among the fast-food emporiums, highway services and outlet stores at Division & 401 (exit 617). These primarily serve motorway traffic.

As most of the attractions (except for Old Fort Henry and the military base) are on the west side of the Cataraqui River, the east end has relatively little to offer in travel accommodation. There are a few low-end motels on old Highway 2 near the base and a couple of independent motels at the Hwy 15/401 crossroads.
There are additional options across the county line into Gananoque, a population-5500 town where properties ranging from small B&Bs to hotel/motel chains serve visitors to the Thousand Islands region. Leeds and the Thousand Islands has a number of campgrounds available during the warmer months.
For those cruising on small craft, sleeping on a boat docked at one of the 1000 Islands National Park islands may also be an option.
Wi-fi and public access computers are available at all Kingston Frontenac Public Library branches. The hotspots are shut down when the library branch is closed.

Postal service is available from the main post office (120 Clarence St, downtown) until 4:30PM weekdays. Some drugstores operate retail postal outlets with extended hours. The UPS Store (427 Princess St downtown, 829 Norwest Road in the west end) provides commercial parcel receiving services and photocopies.
The four main domestic mobile telephone companies (Bell, Telus, Rogers, Freedom Mobile) are readily available. Kingston is not close enough to the border to directly receive US-domestic cellular signals (Sprint, Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile) as it's separated from the US mainland by Wolfe Island.
Rideau Canal - Canada's historic scenic waterway, that connects Kingston to Ottawa through Smiths Falls, passing through peaceful lakes and villages of Eastern Ontario.
