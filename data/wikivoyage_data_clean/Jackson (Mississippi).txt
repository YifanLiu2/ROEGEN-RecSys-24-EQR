Jackson is the capital of the state of Mississippi. While it may not offer much in terms of tourism today, Jackson can be used as a stopover for getting to other parts of the state or further.
Before Jackson became Jackson, a village sprang up around a trading post on the Pearl River called LeFleur's Bluff. Even while the Choctaw Nation called this area home, Mississippi was created in 1817 and early government officials from Natchez selected this site for a new capital in 1821.
Jackson was slow to take off, but the Confederacy used it as a manufacturing center and military hospital during the war. General Tecumseh Sherman noted its significance and burned it once on his way to the military campaign in Vicksburg and then once again to completion after Confederate troops from the city had blundered a sort of revenge attack. Thus a lot of antebellum architecture went up in flames, sparing pretty much only the original capitol building and governor's home.
Thereafter Jackson eventually became the major metropolitan area in the state after wresting that status from Meridian. But, as elsewhere in the South, racial inequality permeated society, and Jackson became a significant site for Civil Rights movement activity from Freedom Riders demonstrations to marches.
