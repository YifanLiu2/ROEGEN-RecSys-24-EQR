Changzhou has two railway stations that are adjacent to one another. The new station faces north and serves the high speed G-trains and some of the slightly slower D-trains that run between Shanghai and Nanjing. The older south facing station handles the long distance T and K trains and the odd D train. The two stations are connected by an underground walkway. You can also take a metro train between the two stations.

All BRT bus numbers are prefixed with a B, followed by the route number. Service frequency is almost excessive, to the point where it's not uncommon to see two or three same numbered buses following each other caterpillar style with only a few passengers on each.
The services start and terminate near the train station. Fares for all buses are ¥1, regardless of distance.
B11 - Runs down Heping Lu and past the main shopping district.

The salty has a thin layer of preserved vegetable while the sweet has a globular core of sugar syrup.
