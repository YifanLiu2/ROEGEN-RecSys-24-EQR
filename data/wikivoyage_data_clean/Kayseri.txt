Kayseri is a city in Central Anatolia, 350 km southeast of Ankara. In 2021 the population was  million. Kayseri is a sprawling industrial city, with a mixture of trades such as furniture, and has a university. It governs Kayseri Province, which borders the very touristy Cappadocia, so many visitors pass through but don't linger.
"Kayseri" refers to Caesar Augustus (Octavian, 63 BCE-14 AD, the first Roman Emperor), and similar names were given to several towns across his growing empire. It had previously been called Mazaka (Մաժաք in Armenian) and sat on a ridge outcrop of Mount Argaeus, the volcano now known as Erciyes. The town was astride the trade routes east-west and north-south, and along these also came a succession of conquering armies. The Seljuks only held it from 1178 to 1243 but left the greatest legacy, in the citadel and several mosque-medrese complexes. The later Ottomans kept these in good repair, so they are the principal tourist sights in Kayseri.

The juice is acidic and works as a palate-cleanser, but is mildly toxic - larger draughts cause stomach cramps and diarrhoea.
