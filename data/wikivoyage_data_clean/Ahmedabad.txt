Ahmedabad is a huge city with several district articles that contain information about specific sights, restaurants, and accommodation.
Ahmedabad (Gujarati: અમદાવાદ Amdāvād) is the fifth largest city in India with a population of  million. Although it is the commercial hub of one of the most prosperous states of India, Gujarat, it's not the state capital, which is its twin city of Gandhinagar, 30 km (19 mi) to the north.
Ahmedabad is a good example of contrast between the materialistic attitude and the spirituality of self-renunciation. One of the fastest growing cities in India, Ahmedabad is a centre for information technology, education and industries. Bhadra Fort, Shaking Minarets and Tran Darwaja are the foremost historical sites of the city. Kankaria Lake and Vastrapur Lake are places which let you feel the pleasure of nature. If you want to enjoy the colourful side of this area, then pay a visit during the major festivals of Ahmedabad: Uttarayan and Navratri are two festivals that are celebrated with great zeal and gusto. Winter is considered the best time to visit the city.
The classification below is according to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The West Zone and New West Zone are on the west side of the Sabarmati River while all other zones are on the east side. Locals rarely refer to these zones, but rather to one of dozens of neighbourhoods of which the city is made up.

Bodakdev and Vastrapur are well-known for commercial centres. Sarkhej is the Ahmedabad end of SG Highway that connects to Gandhinagar on the Western side.
The city was founded by King Karandev (Karna) in the 11th century and originally called "Karnavati". The Hindu kingdom of Karnavati retained its importance until 1411 when Sultan Ahmed Shah conquered Gujarat and created a new city nearby, naming it Ahmedabad, after himself.
The city was built in an open and spacious plain to the east of the Sabarmati River. It included a smaller known fort as Bhadra Fort. The city wall had twelve gates. The city gradually expanded in every direction, with well laid out beautiful buildings, lakes and mosques on both sides of the river.
In 1753 the combined armies of Raghunath Rao and Damaji Gaekwad took the fort, ending Mughal rule in Ahmedabad. During the 64 years of rule by Gaekwad and Peshwa, the city became cleaner. In 1818 the British annexed Ahmedabad. During this period the municipality committee was founded and a railway link was established.
The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in Vastrapur, Ahmedabad
The British restricted themselves to the cantonment area and didn't take much interest in the city. Nor did they get around to colonising Ahmedabad culturally; they didn't set up schools, churches and clubs all over the city as they did in other cities they integrated to their way of life.
Ahmedabad was a cradle of the non-violent movement for India's independence, being host to the Sabarmati ashram of Mahatma Gandhi. Ahmedabad poses a mixture of rich tradition and modern feel.
The Gujarati community is known for its hospitality and for being shrewd businessmen. Ahmedabad is a big industrial city long reputed for its textile industry, and today more so for its chemical, petroleum, international trade & IT industries. It is also known for its financial services industry, and as the modern hub of the Jain Religion. The city has institutions such as the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad, National Institute of Design, Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU), Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information & Communication Technology, IHM, MICA, EDI, Nirma University, Swaminarayan Gurukul, CEPT (Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology) University and NIFT.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (AMD IATA) (It is in the area of Hansol, just 15 km ( mi) north-east from the city-centre). The airport is expanding with permissions for many international air lines being given and development of new terminals.
International flight connections include Muscat, London Heathrow (Air India), Kuwait (Kuwait Airways), Dubai (Emirates), Doha (Qatar Airways), Sharjah (Air Arabia) and Singapore (Singapore Airlines).
Domestic destinations with daily flights include Mumbai, Delhi, Indore, Chennai, Bangalore, Goa, Kolkata, Jaipur, Pune, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Kandla and Surat. Most domestic airlines have a flight in and out of Ahmedabad.
Passengers arriving in the morning are advised that the international terminal is not open 24 hours, and may not open until the late afternoon. As at other Indian airports, you will likely be denied entry until approximately three hours before your scheduled flight even if the terminal is open. Therefore, connecting between a domestic and an international flight will often involve waiting outside for hours with the throngs of touts and hustlers.
There are several options for getting from the airport to the city:
By car: The Hansol area where the airport is lies near the river banks, between the areas of Shahibaug and Naroda that give access to Ahmedabad. For travelling to most of the main areas of Ahmedabad, head in the direction of Shahibaug. To the opposite of the river banks is the area of Motera - Chandkheda which are the northern ends of Ahmedabad and are better accessible through Koteshwar - Bhat Road (enters Motera through Koteshwar) or Ring Road (leading to Visat, turning left at Tapovan Circle); both these roads branch at different points on the road from Airport Circle (in direction of Naroda from the airport) to Koba Circle (take left from Airport Circle onto Indira Bridge). Also the SG Highway can be accessed by heading straight on the Ring Road, instead of turning left for Visat.
An auto rickshaw or a taxi should cost roughly ₹ 200 or 300 respectively. Save yourself considerable hassle by using the prepaid booth, or preferably arrange a pickup in advance with your hotel.
AMTS buses serve the airport directly. These buses have an extensive network all over the city.
BRTS bus no 1000 runs between the airport and Karnavati club with 29 stops. The maximum fare is ₹50. The buses have AC and arrive every 30 minutes.
Indian Railways has a very wide network all over India. There are multiple stations in Ahmedabad. The website of Indian Railways will show you trains from a particular station to your destination along with days, timings, fares and availability. This will help you find trains from individual stations of Ahmedabad (separate searches) as not all trains stop at all stations except of course, Ahmedabad Junction (ADI) where each train halts (and for longer durations than any other station). Booking can be done through the website of IRCTC, a subsidiary of Indian Railways or through any of the railway reservation centres throughout India.

From South Gujarat, and Maharashtra
Driving to Ahmedabad from Mumbai on the new highway (NH-8) takes around 8 hours (without traffic) to travel 550 km. You'll pass Vapi, Valsad, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Anand, and Nadiad on your way. Driving on the NH-8 is an energy sapper and no fun as there is a huge amount of truck traffic. Broken down trucks on the highway regularly cause traffic jams for hours on end. The journey from Vadodara to Ahmedabad can also be done via the dedicated express way (NE-1) which does not pass through any towns, rather than NH-8.
The expressway from Vadodara (South Gujarat) to Ahmedabad ends at C.T.M. (South Zone).
Turning right at C.T.M. is the Narol - Naroda Road leading you to Naroda in North East Ahmedabad, while passing through the areas of Vastral, Odhav, Nikol, etc. on the right side of the road and the areas of Maninagar, Shastri Nagar, Hansol (Airport Area) on the left side of the road. For the northern areas of Sabarmati, Motera, Chandkheda, etc.rcle, where the Narol - Naroda Road ends, head straight on NH-8 and turn left at Ranasan Circle onto Ring Road. Turn left at Tapovan Circle, after a few km, Motera will be on the left side of the highway, Chandkheda on the right. The highway ends at Visat, from where turning left will lead you to Sabarmati.
Turning left at C.T.M. is the Narol - Sarkhej Road which passes through Nehrunagar, Narol, Vatwa, Ghodasar, etc. ending at a T-junction on Vasna Road (or Jawaharlal Nehru Road). From here turn left, pass through the areas of Juhapura, Makarba, etc. till a Y-junction arrives. The right arm will lead you to Sarkhej Cross Roads, from where you turn right onto the S G Highway. The left arm at the Y-junction will lead you via Sarkhej, at Santhal Circle, turn right onto the Ring Road.
Ring Road is preferable if your destination is far (near Northern Ahmedabad) otherwise use Sarkhej–Gandhinagar Highway (S G Highway). Also for Bopal, use only Ring Road.
The major entry points from S G Highway are the areas of Prahladnagar, Shilaj, Vastrapur, Satellite, Bodakdev, Thaltej, Sola, Ognaj, Gota, etc.
From Gandhinagar, North Gujarat, and Rajasthan
The Delhi–Mumbai section of the National Highway 48, passing through Ahmedabad
You can enter Ahmedabad by passing through Gandhinagar. The intercity highway starts at Indroda Circle (CH 0) (South Gandhinagar), passing through Koba Circle and Tapovan Circle and ends at Visat (Northern West Zone), the junction to the suburbs of Sabarmati, Motera and Chandkheda. Rather than going to Visat, you can also choose to join Ring Road: From Koba Circle head on the road to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (SVP) International Airport, but turn left at Rajasthan Hospital Circle and you're on Ring Road. From here you can connect to the areas of East Ahmedabad such as Nikol, Odhav, Vastral, etc. Also the southern areas of Ahmedabad, such as Ramol, CTM, Ahmedabad - Vadodara Expressway, Narol, Vatwa, etc. are accessible through Ring Road.
Another option is to bypass Gandhinagar using Mahatma Mandir Road, then turning right at Sargasan Circle onto S G Highway. You may stay on the S G Highway or turn right at SGVP Circle (also known as Vaishnodevi Circle) onto Ring Road. There are several entry points along the border of extreme Western Ahmedabad, such as Gota, Ognaj, Sola, Thaltej, Bodakdev, Satellite, Vastrapur, Shilaj, Bopal, Prahladnagar, Sarkhej (where S G Highway ends) and Juhapura. For getting to Bopal, use Ring Road rather than S G Highway. Also if you've to go to Southern Ahmedabad, choose Ring Road as it'll be a much faster option than S G Highway.
The services of AMTS and BRTS run from 6AM to 11PM.
The local city buses are run by Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS). since 1947, forming a wide network covering almost all the points of Ahmedabad. Any destination in the city can be reached from anywhere in the city by AMTS.UTTAR PRADESH
New AMTS buses employed under JnNURM
To identify them and distinguish them from the state transport GSRTC buses or the private luxury buses here is the key: The older buses in this service are painted in red and white or in red and yellow, whereas new bright red ones put up under JnNURM are having electronic display boards. You may easily ask around the people esp. those waiting at one of the AMTS stops about the route, time, etc. as the information displayed is in Gujarati. Also, Public Transit option on Google Maps will show you the nearest AMTS stop while searching directions from your location to the destination and it also gives information about the bus numbers, transfer points, etc. though timings might not be reliable. Also you may install an unofficial app named 'Ahmedabad AMTS Info', available on Google Play Store for Android devices, which guides you regarding travel routes, transfers, etc.
AMTS Central Bus Terminus (Lal Darwaja) (at Lal Darwaja in Central Zone).
There are other terminals at Kalupur, Sarangpur, Old Vadaj (Juna Vadaj), Maninagar, Akhbarnagar (Nava Vadaj), Vasna and Naroda and the depots at Jamalpur, Memco (Naroda Patiya) and Memnagar. In total, AMTS has around 1200 stops with 210 routes.
It is mandatory to board the bus from the rear end door and alight from the front end one. The conductor on the bus will issue you a ticket according to your destination stop. Keep handy some notes of ₹ 10/20/50 denominations rather than the higher ones as the fares are very low (these buses are the cheapest means to travel in the city). A pay - per - ride fare will cost you a minimum fare of ₹ 3, while the maximum fare is only ₹ 25). You may also opt to buy a Man Pasand ticket worth ₹ 45 (available from the bus conductor) which entitles you to unlimited rides for a single day, though it is not preferable to purchase the ₹ 45 ticket as you can complete the journey of going around 4-5 places in just ₹ 30–35. As buses are the most common transport facility for many in the city they are often overcrowded.
During the journey you may request your co-passengers or the conductor to inform you when the destination arrives/is about to arrive so that you don't miss getting off at your stop and then have to take a reverse trip. Also keep moving towards the front end door as the bus will be crowded with people standing in the corridor between seats and it might be difficult to quickly rush to the door and get off, when your destination arrives (the bus won't halt at a stop more than 10-12 sec, unless it's the AMTS Central Terminus at Lal Darwaja or the last stop of the journey).

BRTS Network Map (August 2015)
Nehru Nagar - Shivranjani Crossroad BRTS Corridor (on Line nos. 2 and 8)
A BRTS bus during halt at a station, at night
Ahmedabad BRTS. (bus rapid transit system) has silver and blue-coloured buses running on dedicated corridors in the centre of the roads. BRTS does not cover the entire city, but wherever available it is the best way to commute as it is remarkably faster than other modes (as no other vehicle can ply on BRTS corridor) and all the stations are marked well, in both English and Hindi. One can also travel using a combination of BRTS, AMTS and/or auto rickshaw. The ticket systems of BRTS and AMTS are not integrated. The fares are only slightly higher than AMTS (min. fare ₹ 4, max. fare ₹ 36)
The BRTS stations are elevated shelters in the dedicated central corridor of the city roads, from where you can purchase your ticket. Keep the ticket with you until you get off at your destination, where you show the ticket to the checker and then leave the station on to the road. Buses are equipped with central automatic doors that open up automatically when the bus halts at a station. While the bus is about to arrive at a station, there are announcements with name of the station along with display on the electronic board inside the bus. Inside the stations, there are boards displaying real-time information about arrivals or upcoming buses, along with the routes and estimated time remaining for the arrivals. The name of the station will be printed in white letters on blue strips on the sides (horizontal) and on the roof of the station (vertical).
All BRTS buses and stations are wheelchair accessible except those of RTO Circle and Kalupur Railway Station, which are roadside shelters unlike the standard BRTS stations.
For information on all the BRTS stations, visit the above-linked website, which shows them according to the line, or install an unofficial Android app, which provides information such as travel options, routes, fare, time, station names, etc. (The Public Transit option on Google Maps doesn't show BRTS services, only the AMTS ones)
There are 12 BRTS lines and 126 stations, with more under construction. The current lines are:
Line 1 RTO Circle - Maninagar
Line 2 Anjali (Vasna) - Naroda
Line 3 RTO Circle - Naroda
Line 4 RTO Circle - Sarkari Litho Press (Delhi Darwaja)

Ahmedabad Metro. Metro is probably the most convenient way to get around the areas it serves. It operates on north-south and east-west corridors. Ticket of ₹5 up to a ride of km, ₹10 from  to km, ₹15 from  km to  km, ₹20 from km to km, ₹25 from  to km.
An autorickshaw in New Delhi similar to the ones in Ahmedabad
These yellow and green three-wheeled noise machines, known as auto-rickshaws or simply rickshaws, are always cheaper than taxis, and much costlier than AMTS or BRTS when distance is longer than 3 km. They are not very comfortable and spacious. The drivers might ride very roughly, in which case you might request him to drive smoothly and slowly.
Shouting 'auto' or 'rickshaw' at a passing rickshaw should be enough to catch the drivers attention. In most cases, the drivers will be able to understand Hindi and maybe even a few words of English. They are normally quite helpful, but some will try to cheat tourists. As always, agree on a fare before getting in. Day and night fares are different. If you look an out-of-the-town person, you may end up getting overcharged. For example, he might insist on a fare based on meter and take you to your destination through a longer route. Having some understanding about the distances can be helpful.
Since auto rickshaws are the dominant travel mode apart from BRTS and AMTS, there are few taxis in Ahmedabad. So you will hardly find a taxi on the roads to hail whenever needed, though you may either book a taxi from a hotel or directly book one outside the railway station. There is a government authorized taxi stand. ₹ 950 per day for 12 hours. It may be more costly to book through hotels, and it is better to negotiate with the driver directly. Online bookings are also possible at various websites.
Ahmedabad has several floridly carved historic monuments including the Stepwell at Adalaj and the Rani Mosques (dedicated to Rani Sipri and Rani Rupmati). There are some museums and art galleries. Modern office buildings and malls dot the more recently developed areas.

Ahmedabad is known for its textile industries including traditional hand embroidered and tie-dyed clothes. If you buy from the roadside shops, be prepared to haggle. It would not be advisable to try these without a local guide. The city's main market area is situated at Teen Darwaja, Dhalgarwad, Ratan Pole, Manek Chowk(old areas)near Lal Darwaja and newer markets such as CG Road and Sarkhej - Gandhinagar highway near Vastrapur & Gurukul. It is generally a crowded area, and very crowded during festival seasons, although with a wide variety of clothes. The street side shops near Law Garden also offers good choices. Some shops such as Bandhej and Sanskruti offer these traditional items at fixed (and maybe overpriced) rates. But now the big shopping malls are offering almost all the things at a very cheap rate. Local sweet shops, where traditional Gujarati sweets will catch your attention: some the more famous are Bhogilal Mulchand Kandoi, Jai Hind and Ras Ranjan.
Lunch in Ahamedabad means roti, puri, vegetables, mango sweets, gulab jamun and butter milk.
Ahmedabad is a gastronomic paradise, and there are many restaurants. Gujaratis are fond of eating and the food generally tends to be on the sweeter side. Gujaratis are mostly vegetarians hence most local dishes are vegetarian. However, with the recent advent of international and domestic food chains non-vegetarian food has become popular. Ahmedabad is famous for its ice-creams because of abundance of dairy products in the state and Gujaratis' penchant for sweets. Local specialities include Dhokla, Khandvi, Srikhand, Haandvo, Bhajiya amongst others.
A famous food from Ahmedabad and/or Gujarat is the 'Cheese and Pineapple Jam sandwich which is sold by most sandwich vendors in Gujarat, especially in Ahmedabad, despite this dish being famous in Gujarat, the other parts of India find this dish to be disgusting, wait till you actually try the sandwich!

'Khaman', the popular Gujarati breakfast
Mirch Masala (Area: Chimanlal Girdharlal Road, SG Road) Serves North-Indian food in a typical highway "dhaba" setting. Excellent food but more interesting for its decor.
Other than these that are several other restaurants that serve excellent food for example (Swati Snacks, House of MG both famous for Gujarati food in chic setting, Bawarchi for Punjabi food, etc.) For western palates, a good way to find new restaurants is to ask a local, especially someone young who would certainly know about such places. International chains like Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Subway are present throughout the city.
Gujarat is one of the few Indian states where alcohol is prohibited. But this applies only to Indians. If you have a non-Indian passport / green card holder/ PR status, you can get an alcohol permit valid for one month by going to an alcohol shop in a large hotel and purchasing one. Hotels that have alcohol shops include: Cama Hotel in Khanpur, Hotel Inder Residency, Opp. to Gujarat College, Comfort Inn President Hotel at CG Road among others open Monday to Saturday noon-8PM, ph no. +91 79 26467575.

Booze is strictly a private affair and don't expect to order a drink at a restaurant, and there are no pubs or bars, and you will have to drink in your hotel room or at someone's home. If someone invites you to a party, there is a good chance you will be offered a drink there. Under a new amendment to the law prohibiting alcohol, you cannot be arrested or detained for consuming alcohol illegally unless you misbehave under influence or are bootlegging. However, it is best to consume alcohol at your hotel room or at a very close friends place. Consumption of alcohol in hotel rooms has implied consent from the hotel who will serve you ice, glasses and mixers.

The lake attracts a large variety of birds like plovers, sandpipers, stints, cormorants, grebes and openbill storks among others. The best season to visit the sanctuary is November to February.
Thol Bird Sanctuary This sanctuary is about 30 km west of the city centre. Just as Nal Sarovar, this lake attracts a large variety of bird species. It has become more preferable for the amdavadis to take an early morning trip. Although it does not have any facilities like boating, it has turned out more favourable as this is a lesser known place. It will be best to rent a taxi for a morning as there is no public transport available here. November to March is the best time to visit.
