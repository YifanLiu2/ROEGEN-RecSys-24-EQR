Des Moines, capital of Iowa, is in the western region of the American Midwest. Des Moines is the largest city in Iowa and the annual site of the Iowa State Fair.
Because of Iowa's early presidential caucus date, the city is also a hotbed of political dreams and discourse every four years when presidential candidates tour the state and have multiple debates within the city.
The meaning of 'Des Moines' is not clear as local Native Americans, the Moingona, had already been using a term (which meant 'river of the mounds') due to the number of burial mounds which were popular in the area. French Trappist Monks (Moines de la Trappe) called their settlement areas at the mouth of the Des Moines River 'La Rivière des Moines' which, in English, translates to 'the river of the monks.' "De Moyn," which means "middle," may have been used on the map of explorer Jacques Marquette to help others locate the Des Moines River-area (equidistant between the larger Mississippi and Missouri rivers). "Des Moines," today pronounced "duh MOIN," is at the junction of the Des Moines River and the Raccoon River.
Fort Des Moines was settled in 1843 by a group of dragoons from the Sac and Fox Agency (Fort Sanford) led by Captain James Allen. Allen was going to name the area Fort Raccoon, but was instructed by the War Department to use the name Fort Des Moines. In 1846, the fort was dissolved and the city was created.
The city's population was just under 215,000 in 2020, and the metro area had about 700,000 residents.

Due in part to the moist and rich soils that make Iowa an agricultural powerhouse, summers are filled with very humid air. Coupled with heat, this can result in a very high heat index. This can make outdoor life very uncomfortable (and sometimes dangerous) for those unaccustomed to such conditions, even visitors from hot climates, such as the Southwest, where the heat lacks the coupling of humidity. Rain and thunderstorms are common in the spring and summer; occasionally severe, with tornadoes of varying intensities (though rarely very destructive) sometimes a possibility.
During the winter, it is not at all unusual to have road closures due to snowfall or ice. Iowa is no stranger to heavy snowfall and frigid temperatures in this season either, which can be just as much of a concern to those unaccustomed as the summer heat. Fall is pleasantly cool, and typically more dry than wet.
Most travelers to Des Moines are likely to come via interstate, on either I-80 (from the east or west) or I-35 (from the north or south). Travelers will not have to worry about encountering any tollways or major traffic jams. Once in the area, those wishing to enter the city will use I-235 to get into Des Moines proper.
The majority of area residents get around by use of their automobiles, so bringing or renting one is a good idea. The roads are in good shape and most drivers would not be classified as aggressive.
The main thoroughfare, I-235, runs through the downtown area and is free of tolls. Semi-trailers passing through are advised to avoid I-235 as the traffic is usually heavier, particularly during the morning and evening rush hours (7AM-8AM and 4:30PM-6PM) as people travel to and from work. Additionally, the speed limit on I-235 is 5–10 mph less than on I-80/I-35.
The city has two interstates surrounding it, I-80 (running east/west) and I-35 (north/south). Chicago is roughly 330 mi (539 km) east of Des Moines while Omaha is about 135 mi (215 km) west of the city. Popular destinations along I-35 include Kansas City, just under 200 mi (320 km) to the south and Minneapolis/Saint Paul to the north, nearly 250 mi (500 km) away.
Safe-driving tips, road closures due to weather and construction, and other pieces of information, are available from the Iowa Department of Transportation. Wi-fi is available throughout the state at public rest areas.
Des Moines International Airport (DSM IATA), 5800 Fleur Dr, ☏ +1 515-256-5050. Des Moines' airport is fairly small for a major airport, consisting of only a single terminal. Although the airport has had a reputation of being expensive in the past, many flights are now more affordable and travelers have noticed, breaking usage records year-in and year-out. Most hotels offer free shuttle service and rental cars are also available. Long-term parking varies in price from $5-12/day. The following airlines have services to Des Moines: Allegiant Air, American, Delta, Frontier, Southwest, and United, all of which operate non-stop flights between Des Moines and their respective major hubs.
The  Burlington Trailways-Jefferson Lines Bus Terminal is at 1501 2nd Ave. Greyhound doesn't serve Des Moines directly but they do offer through-ticketing with both bus lines.
Jefferson Lines, 1501 2nd Ave, ☏ +1 515-283-0074. Regional transport, primarily the Midwest but also the South, Great Plains, Rocky Mountains and parts of Canada.
Burlington Trailways, 1501 2nd Ave, ☏ +1 515-243-5283, toll-free: +1-800-992-4618, fax: +1 515-243-0670, bustrails@trailways.com.
Amtrak (Amtrak code OSC) (I-35 S to US-34 E exit, turn right at S Ridge Rd), toll-free: +1-800-USA-RAIL (872-7245). Nearest Amtrak station is 45 mi (72 km) south in Osceola at Main and E Clay Sts. In the town there are not many traveler services, although there is a casino to help pass the time, so it's best to do any extensive overnight stays in Des Moines. It is also possible to reach Des Moines from Osceola (or vice-versa) by Jefferson Lines bus which leaves from Osceola Amtrak station and arrives at Greyhound bus station in Des Moines.
The colder weather months (Nov-Feb) often bring snow and ice to area roads. Visitors who park their cars should be prepared in case their car is "snowed in" by snow removal trucks. Also, strict attention to parking rules and snow emergencies is recommended to avoid being towed away at the car owner's expense. During the winter months, a snow brush, ice scraper, and plenty of windshield washer fluid is essential, and many natives opt to carry a shovel, some sand, and a bag of ice melt/road salt in the trunk just in case.
Gasoline is reasonably cheap in the Des Moines area, partially from subsidies afforded to ethanol which is widely available at most gas stations to travelers. The most popular mixture, 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, is generally considered safe for newer autos (not to be confused with 85% ethanol/15% gasoline blend). Ethanol and its usage can stir up quite a debate even in the corn-loving state of Iowa.
The Des Moines River serves as the marker for street names having the prefix "East" or not (and occasionally "West" when on the western side). This is especially important for streets running north-south. "1st Ave" would be on the west side of the river, E 1st Ave the eastern side and are thus completely different streets. Streets running east-west and which exist on both sides of the river typically have an "East" prefix if east of the river. There are some "West" prefixes for those on the other side of the river but this is less common. Perhaps more confusing, there are streets which lie on both sides of the river, such as Grand Ave, which is "E Grand Ave" east of the river but simply "Grand Ave" west of the river. Unlike the north-south streets, it is possible to arrive at your destination by simply continuing east or west—depending on your final destination. The demarcation for "SE" and "SW" prefixes is a bit more ambiguous but would certainly refer to a street south of Grand Ave/E Grand Ave and either the western or eastern side of the river. For most part, "NW" refers to streets west of the river and "NE" east of it, but not always so. Additionally, there is no standard reference point for determining when a street gains a "NW" or "NE" prefix.
Downtown has several one-way streets to ease traffic flow during rush hours. Turning left is allowed unless otherwise designated.
The airport is a popular place to get a rental car and has the following rental companies present next to the baggage claim area: Alamo, Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, and National. There are other locations throughout the city to rent.

What to eat in Des Moines? Iowa is a meat-and-potatoes kind of place, with generous servings, and the possibility of a piece of pie afterwards.

Des Moines is an extremely safe city during all parts of the day. One can take the evening air without feeling nervous. Just like in all other cities with a sizable number of people, there are areas and neighborhoods that may be more troublesome for some groups of people than others. Visitors are likely to avoid these small pockets, however.
Pickpockets and grand ripoff schemes that plague other cities in the U.S. and around the globe are not pervasive in the area. Still, the best thing to do is use your judgment—if you don't want attention, don't do things to draw people's attention.
In any emergency which requires medical assistance, call 911.
All hospitals—not clinics—have 24-hour emergency services available.
The local area code is "515." The area code must be included when dialing all numbers.
