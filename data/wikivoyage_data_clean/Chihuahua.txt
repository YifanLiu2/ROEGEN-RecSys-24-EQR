Chihuahua is the capital of the state of Chihuahua in Northern Mexico. The colonial center of Chihuahua is beautiful and pedestrian friendly. The centro has museums dedicated to Pancho Villa (a major folk hero in the north of Mexico), another museum about the national mint, government palaces, and historic churches as well as luxurious mansions and villas.
Chihuahua is famous for Norteño food (a form of Mexican cuisine), a delicious if not particularly heart healthy cuisine that makes liberal use of beef, flour, cheese, and chiles. There are also good dining and lodging options for the visitor and a lot of fun cantinas for male travelers (women usually aren't welcome in them).

Northern Mexico, especially the state of Chihuahua, has experienced a sharp increase in violent drug-related crime since 2007. Chihuahua is much safer than Ciudad Juárez but still has had its share of cartel killings in the last two years. Most killings have specifically targeted drug dealers and their families, and tourists have rarely been affected by violent crime. Avoid bars and nightclubs that cater to a criminal element. Military checkpoints may be set up in the city and the roads around the city. Always stop at these checkpoints.
