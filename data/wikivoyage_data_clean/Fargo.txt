Fargo is a modern city of just over 100,000 in the Red River Valley of North Dakota. Many people relate Fargo to the eponymous 1996 Coen Brothers movie starring Oscar-winner Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, though none of the movie was filmed in Fargo. Neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota is across the river from Fargo and the area is generally referred to as Fargo-Moorhead. Fargo is the seat of Cass County.

Fargo is a safe city, with little violent crime, however, use common sense especially when it comes to personal property, just as you would anywhere else. The only area in which a person would need to be on the look-out is downtown on the weekends, especially during the school year. With the many colleges and bars it makes for an unpredictable experience.
Occasionally, crimes such as carjackings and assault happen around the NDSU campus, but these events are few and far between. Be wary of your surroundings like anywhere else.
The region is known for bitterly cold winters. Be sure to have appropriate attire, and know the forecast ahead of time for the day. If you need to drive, learn how to drive in snowy and icy road conditions, and follow weather warnings. It will save you a lot of headaches.
There is free wireless internet access in the food court at the West Acres Shopping Center.
Most coffee shops and even a few bars also offer free wireless internet access.
High Plains Reader The source for what is happening in the city, an alternative newspaper that from the start was doomed to fail due to the small population of the city, but has since lasted over 10 years and remains as strong as ever. Free.
KNDS Radio for Everyone. A collaborative university and community radio station, that thanks to the extreme flatness of Fargo can broadcast about the whole metro area on a Low Power FM Dial.
