Tashkent (Uzbek: Toshkent or Тошкент; Russian: Ташкент) is the capital, and largest city of Uzbekistan. It is an ancient city on the Great Silk Road from China to Europe. Once the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union, Tashkent was rebuilt in a Soviet style after the devastating 1966 earthquake, and little remains from its ancient Central Asian past. Since the start of the millennium the Uzbek government has embarked on a major reconstruction program in the centre of the city. Roads, government buildings and parks have all been reconstructed (many historical buildings and sites were bulldozed in the process). To the visitor, the new city looks very impressive with its wide avenues, parks and modern buildings, although many of the local residents have yet to see any improvement in their residential areas.
The city has a mixture of modern new office buildings, hotels, parks, and crumbling Soviet-style apartment blocks. The streets are generally clean and there are not too many potholes in the city centre. Further out, the infrastructure is not so good.
Tashkent has a population of  million people (2020).
Tashkent has a typical continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. The best seasons for travel to Tashkent are Apr-May and Sep-Oct.

Although Uzbek is now the official language, Russian is the native language for most Tashkent dwellers, although most also speak Uzbek. Most businesses use Russian in their signs, menus, and other printed material. Only government institutions use Uzbek as the first language, and even then, many government forms and reports are in Russian, rather than Uzbek. Uzbek now uses the Latin alphabet rather than the Cyrillic that was used during the Soviet Union. This is a source of some confusion for many Uzbeks, especially those of the older generation. Shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union and Uzbek independence in 1991, the written Uzbek language was converted back into Latin characters. Many older Uzbeks have difficulty reading the Latin characters. Uzbek is a Turkic-based language, and while Uzbeks and Turks cannot completely communicate directly, the better educated on both sides can usually find some common understanding.
Many of the signs in Tashkent are in Cyrillic. A significant number of Russian words are similar to their English counterparts. Learning the Cyrillic alphabet, not as difficult as one might think, will help a traveller to read signs and in restaurants. It is very useful for the casual visitor to Tashkent to learn a few basic Russian or Uzbek words and phrases. If you need to speak English, young people are your best bet, and even then there is no guarantee that they will speak more than basic English.
The name Tashkent is usually attributed to the Turkish word "tash" ("stone") and the Persian word "kent" ("city"), meaning "city of stones". Another opinion refers to the Sogdian word "tschatsch", meaning "place on a hill".
Tashkent International Airport (Yuzhniy (TAS IATA), Uzbek: Toshkent Xalqaro Aeroporti), Sergeli District (Located: just a few kilometres south from the city centre.), ☏ +998 71 1402801, +998 71 1402802, +998 71 1402803, +998 71 1402804, info@uzairways.com. The airport has two terminals, domestic (Terminal 3) and international (Terminal 2) on opposite sides of the airfield. The only way to get from one to the other is by road, a 10-minute taxi ride. Unusually for an international airport serving a capital city, as of July 2020 the airport has no official website.

A new/upgraded airport terminal was opened in 2018 and with that, many of the past problems disappeared. Arrival and departure procedures now are more close to what you would find in any other capital city.
A short and inexpensive (US$2–3) taxi journey is the easiest way to get to the city centre. You will be approached by numerous people offering "taxi" services both inside and outside the airport. For the most part, these are not "official" taxis. "Taxi" drivers will attempt to charge whatever they believe the market will bear. For those without Russian or Uzbek language skills, it is best to arrange to have someone meet you at the airport. Fair fares are usually only obtainable by those who understand the system and speak at least some Russian or Uzbek. It is better to walk 50 m from the exit towards the taxi stand where taxis are waiting on the road and negotiate. Generally prevailing fare is minimum US$2-3 for 5 km (20 cents per each additional km). Always negotiate. Taxi drivers will rarely accept small bills (dollars, euros, or pounds), and cannot be counted upon to give change (in any currency).
To catch a bus from the international terminal, walk straight out, past the parking lot and veer left. The bus stops are just before the main road. Buses run from 6am until midnight. Buses 62 and 95 head for the city. Bus 40 goes to the train station. Bus 67 goes to Oybek metro and then on to the central square. Fares are 1400 Som; sometimes you pay the driver when exiting, sometimes a collector comes around for your money.
The central hub for trains in Uzbekistan with most domestic trains ending or start in Tashkent. The most attractive connections are to Samarkand with the super fast Afrosiob train and the Sharq which continues to Bukhara. For Khiva and Termez there are night trains with comfortable sleeping berths. Make sure that you buy ticket a few days in advance or arrive at least 1 hour before train departure, as the queue for ticket office is often long and chaotic with people jumping the queue. For domestic departure times see the Uzbekistan#Get around section.
Tashkent is also a key stopping point for rail services from Central Asia. It is possible to travel from Dushanbe in Tajikistan, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, Almaty in Kazakhstan, and Moscow. It is possible to travel from China through Almaty and from Iran. Ticket prices are cheap by Western standards, but will need to be paid for in cash, preferably in US dollars. There are many warnings about thefts of personal belongings on the trains.

There are two train stations in Tashkent. 'Vokzal' is the name in Russian for station.
The  Tashkent Railway Station (Toshkent Vokzal) (Severny Vokzal, ТАШКЕНТ, ТАШКЕНТ Ц, ТАШКЕНТ ПАСС ЦЕНТР), Kichik Xalqa Yo'li (Metro station "Toshkent"). Formerly the Severnay Vokzal or Severny Vokzal (North station), it is located south of the centre at the end of Shevchenko street. For many years it was the main station for all services to or from Tashkent. It is now used for the Afrosiyob service to Samarkand and Bukhara. It is a grand, blue-windowed structure dating to the early 1980s. You’ll need photo ID to pass through the two security checkpoints to get into the grounds and then into the station. There are a few snack bars inside once you're through. It is served by Tashkent metro station on the blue Uzbekistan Line. Attempting to buy the ticket is likely to be the most stressful part of your rail journey, but it’s always busy: try to get it elsewhere if you can. There are two ticket booths: one inside the main station to the right as you enter, and a second in the foreigners' ticket office behind the station. Sadly, the latter is often closed. You will need your passport to buy a train ticket and it is helpful if you write down both your destination and the six-digit date you wish to travel so as to avoid confusion.
To be on the safe side, you should try and get there 30 min before departure; sometimes a big queue forms at the different security checks.
There are no banking services inside the railway station; the nearest bank is either across from the station on the corner with Shevshenko street, or on Amir Timur street, just past the bridge.
You can find some stolovaya food upstairs in the train station if you are desperate. 24/7 luggage storage is available.
To get to/from the train station, you can take the metro, a city bus from the big bus stop to one side of the train station, or a taxi.
The  South Station (Janubiy Vokzal) (ТАШКЕНТ ЮЖНЫЙ, ТАШКЕНТ ЮЖ) (Metro station "Chilonzor"). This station which is often written as 'Yuzhnyy' or 'Yuzhniy' is located southwest of the city centre on Isman Nasir Street. Disused for 25 years it reopened in April 2018 after being refurbished and is now used for the sleeper services from Samarkand, Bukhara, Urgench and Khiva.
From/to the station there are quite a number of bus lines running either to the city or to the closest metro station. Be careful that the nearest metro station "Chilonzor" is still a  km walk from the station - if you come by metro you will need to then hop on one of the frequent buses with Janubiy Vokzal displayed on the front. (updated Jun 2023)
Until late 2018, international buses to and from Uzbekistan were unpredictable and unreliable. However, the easing of travel restrictions in 2019 appears to have brought with it more tourist-friendly updates to the bus network and it is now possible to take buses directly from Uzbek cities to cities in neighbouring countries, (rather than having to switch buses at border control) on certain routes, such as Tashkent-Shymkent. Others are still only served by shared taxis and marshrutkas; these tend to be slower as the vehicles aren't licenced and consequently border checks take longer.
Tashkent Bus Station (Avtovokzal), Bunyodkor shoh kochasi and Gavhar kochasi corner (Metro station "Sobir Raximov"). Buses usually are very full and advance purchase of tickets is recommended. Tickets are sold to foreigners at Movarunahr Kochasi 51, daily from 08:00-17:00. Buses arrive here to Bokhara (11 hr, US$8), Samarkand (6 hr, US$5), and Urgench/Khiva (20 hr, US$12) (2009).
A marshrutka is a small bus or van which follows a fixed route and stops on demand to take on or drop off passengers. As of 2009, marshrutkas from: Andijan (6 hr, US$5), Bokhara (8 hr, US$6), to Ferghana (6 hr US$4), to Kokand (3 hr, US$3), Samarkand (4 hr, US$4), and Termez (10 hr US$8). Timetable formerly dead link
Stand for Shared taxis to Samarkand and south (big highway junction close to Metro station Olmazar (Алмазар), right next to Tashkent Bus Station). Lines to: Samarkand (3 hr, US$8), Bokhara (7 hr, US$13), Termez (10 hr, US$15), Urgench or Khiva (14 hr, US$25).
Stand for Taxis to Fergana Valley (Kuyluk Bazar). Taxis to Fergana Valley leave from here and from the Northern Station. To Andijan (5 hr, US$8) also for Osh, Ferghana (4 hr, US$8), Kokand (3 hr, US$6).
There are road routes from surrounding countries but the borders may not be open and there have been security problems. The border from Afghanistan is sometimes closed or not open to Uzbek nationals. You have to walk at least 4 km to cross the border on foot from the Uzbek checkpoint to the Afghan checkpoint.
The Cherniaevka crossing from Kazakhstan near Saryagash. Allow 1-2 hours to get through, especially from the Uzbek side. OK, but long, long queues. Take the left line at Uzbek customs. They want you to declare any mobile phones as communications devices.
From Kyrgyzstan, the Dostlik post 30km from Andijan is open from 09:00-18:00. From Tajikistan Oiybek Post, 80 km from Tashkent, is open for foreigners from 09:00-18:00. Tursanzade Post, 60 km from Dushanbe Tajikistan, is open for foreigners and locals 180 km from Termez. Chorzhu Post on the border of Turkmenistan, 30 km from Bukhara, is also open to foreigners and locals.
Distances from Tashkent by road: Almaty in Kazakhstan 810 km, Ashgabat in Turkmenistan 1,290 km, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan 570 km, Kashgar in China 880 km, Andijan 392 km, Bokhara 600 km, Ferghana 325 km, Karshi 430 km, Khiva 1,045 km, Kokand 236 km, Nukus 1,115 km, Samarkand 295 km, Termez 705 km, Urgench 1,020 km.
The city has a good public transport system which is cheap. The metro/underground system is typical of the old Soviet-style with large and impressive stations and is quite modern. Stations are richly themed. For example, Kosmonavtlar is a lavish monument to Uzbekistan's contribution to the Soviet space programme.
Since June 2018 the metro is not considered as military installations and therefore it is now permitted to take photographs in the metro stations.
In all cases do have documents while you are taking the metro (or anywhere in the city), for you can be checked any time by the police.
Tashkent Metro has four lines:
Chilonzor (Red line) from Janubiy to Turkistan.
Uzbekistan (Blue line) from Beruniy to Chkalov.
Yunus-Obod (Green line) from Sabir Rakhimov to Buyuk Ipak Yuli.
Circle Line from Tekhnopark to Quruvchilar.
Trains depart ever 3-10 minutes. A paper ticket with a QR-code is 2000 som from the cashier at the stations. You can also pay your fare by tapping your Visa or Mastercard on the turnstile. Atto-cards are available for purchase from the cashier for frequent travelers, valid on the Metro and buses. The fare if you use your credit card or the Atto-card, is 1700 som, as of 2023.
There are also modern buses (green). The tram service was closed down in 2016, with the lines being converted to wider roads. The fare on the bus, if paid by cash is 2000 som. You may also tap your Visa/Mastercard/Atto-card on a card reader near any door. In this case, the fare is 1700 som. Contrary to many western cities, you are not required to tap your card immediately after boarding. If there is a conductor, he will ask you to tap the card in front of him, or tap the card for you. If there is no conductor, tap the card when you exit the bus. In case you feel uncomfortable "riding without a ticket", you can alternatively tap when entering and indicate that you already tapped if a conductor carries out checks. This might seem strange to foreigners, but it's based on the Uzbek culture of honesty and trust, so please don't abuse it.
Marshrutkas also operate around the city but are more expensive, around 2500-3000 som is a normal fare. Routes and schedules can be found from Easyway journey planner.
Official taxis should be ordered in advance at the hotel reception, they are metered and issue receipts from a machine. As of March 2018, the rate was 6,000 som per km.
While there are official, authorized taxis (with the appropriate sign on the roof of the car), in reality almost any driver in Tashkent can double as a taxi driver. The local custom is to simply stand by the side of the road with your arm extended downward and slightly away from the body. A driver will pull over and then you will state your destination and ask the fare in advance. There is a common agreement on the prices, so real negotiation will be rarely be necessary or successful, only at night some drivers ask twice the usual fare. Getting from the center to the airport should be around 15,000 som, a city trip of 3 km or more around 8,000 som (March 2018).
At least some Russian or Uzbek language skills are needed to accomplish this without difficulty. It is usually safe to use this procedure, although virtually every foreign embassy recommends against it. Directions are rarely given here using an address. Most often, a landmark is used, such as "near Hotel Russia". Moreover, many streets and hotels have been renamed in the past few years and often drivers will not recognize the current name of the street or hotel, still knowing them by their old names. Asking to be taken to the Grand Mir Hotel, for instance, will often result in a blank look. Tell the driver you want to go to the Gastinitsa Rossiya (Hotel Russia), however, and they will know exactly where you want to go. For those who speak neither Russian nor Uzbek, it is helpful to have someone draw a rudimentary map or write out directions in Russian. Few drivers will know English and most have troubles reading the maps on smartphones.
Downloading an offline Google or OSM map of the city in advance is a good idea. There are various apps available for phones. You can show it to the driver and guide him provided you know a few Russian words: nalieva - left, priama - straight, naprava - right.
Looking for landmarks, addresses or hotels on Google maps is not easy because of the multiple languages and spelling. Search in advance and bookmark your destinations.
Do not expect Western-style taxi services. Taxi drivers will often smoke while you are in the car and asking them not to will most often result in nothing more than a look of disapproval. You may be paying, but you are in their car. There are many taxi services operating in the city with fixed rates and a person can order the taxi from their hotel room. There are some web sites offering complete lists of taxi services and taxi charges.
An Uber style service is available from Yandex. Download the YandexGo app to use this. It supports English language. Uber itself does not operate in Tashkent.
Taxis within the city can be reserved by calling Taxi Express, Tel 1399999 or 16360272.
Hardly any international car hire companies operate in Tashkent. Some are based near the airport and a smaller car will cost $30 per day typically. Sixt and Hertz do now operate in Uzbekistan.
If you come from Western Europe, where cities can be visited walking and metro stations are everywhere, be warned that Tashkent proportions are truly monumental. Many streets have ten lanes and buildings are huge, with plenty of space around. Plan your visit ahead and check the distances.
The "Old Town" has retained much of its charm. Here you will find low adobe houses with shady courtyards, narrow winding streets and many ancient mosques and madrassas.

Tashkent is generally a very safe place to visit. However, visitors should refrain from political activities or doing anything that could be regarded as undermining the state. As anywhere, remember to watch your personal belongings. There have been incidents of robbery, including some violent assaults but they are very rare. Visitors should use the same caution they would use in any large city, especially at night. It is not advisable for foreigners to walk around alone at night, especially in areas where few people are about and/or lighting is poor. Police sometimes levy small on-the-spot fines for minor offences such as appearing to be slightly intoxicated.
