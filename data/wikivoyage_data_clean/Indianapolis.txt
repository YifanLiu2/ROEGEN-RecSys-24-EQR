Indianapolis began a project of downtown beautification in the 1990s—the skyline is seen here in 2010
Indianapolis is the capital of Indiana and also the state’s largest city. The population is roughly 882,000 (2022), making it the 16th largest city in the United States, and the metro area has about 2 million (#34). Efforts to beautify and modernize the city have brought Indianapolis into the 21st century as a world-class destination for everything from business meetings and trade conventions to backpackers making their way across the States.
Indianapolis is widely hailed as the "Racing Capital of the World" because of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the Indy 500 and Brickyard 400 at the Brickyard, and as the "Amateur Sports Capital of America" for hosting the NCAA Hall of Champions. The city has several attractions outside of sports including museums, a large zoo, over 100 ethnic restaurants, several arts and historic districts, and a revitalized downtown. Although Indy has been mocked with the epithet "India-noplace", Indianapolis has several attractions for visitors, with a mix of a large metropolitan city and a simple Midwestern community. You will find beautiful architecture, monuments, and pristine cornfields in the Circle City.
Indianapolis' downtown is cut through by the non-navigable waters of the White River
When Indianapolis was founded, it was expected to be a "Great Inland Port", but the White River is non-navigable most of the year. The pay-off is that this desire for a port left the city with a gorgeous canal district, though the canal itself is only useful for recreational kayaks and paddleboats.
Today, Indianapolis is known as the "Crossroads of America" due to its centrality in America's Interstate Highway System. Indy is warm in the summer, with average highs around 85 °F (29 °C; 303 K) in June, July, and August. This is paired with a typical mid-western winter—January is the coldest month, with an average high of 34 °F (1 °C; 274 K). Every few years, the winter gets sharp with significant snowfall and once a generation or so there is an ice storm or otherwise impassible winter weather event. Indianapolis exists within a tornado region but has never been impacted by major twisters. Travelers really only need to beware the occasional nasty winter and sometimes overly hot summer. The city has had two droughts since 1980, neither of which was disastrous.
In general, travel in and through Indianapolis is safe, clean, and logical. Visitors can always find something to do without becoming overwhelmed at a sprawling metropolis. In a few minutes, you can go from a sleepy and peaceful cornfield to a vibrant downtown. City planning is intelligible to outsiders with a grid system broken up by a few major diagonal streets, a large beltway loop (I-465), and a general lack of gridlock and traffic.

A visitor's center next to the Circle Centre retail mall in the city center. The visitor's center opens earlier than the Artsgarden.

Indianapolis International Airport is home to one of the largest FedEx hubs and was rebuilt in 2008
Indianapolis is known as the "Crossroads of America" for a good reason. Interstates 65, 69, 70, and 74 meet here. The city's outer belt is I-465. Travel directly through the city on I-70 (east and west) or I-65 (north and south). Direct travel using I-74 or I-69 is not possible; I-74 is routed around the center of the city on I-465, and I-69 ends at its intersection with I-465 to the city's north (though it resumes to the southwest near Martinsville, with a segment now open to Evansville).
Interstates 65 and 70 intersect at a region known as "the split" south of downtown. There is also a ramp onto Washington Street, which is the main east–west artery in the city. Traffic here can be extremely busy and construction is routine. It's possible that you'll have situations where you want to cut across five lanes of traffic going 70 mph (110 km/h) in a distance of less than 1 mi ( km)!
Motorists wanting to experience a bit of history may wish to take a trip along Washington St. which forms part of the National Road (a.k.a. Cumberland Road). This route was the first federal highway in America that stretched from the Atlantic Ocean through most of Illinois. It has been extended into Interstates 40 and 80, so travelers can take a trip from Baltimore to San Francisco along it today. Small milestones mark all of the major cities along this All-American Road.
Indianapolis International Airport (IND IATA), 7800 Col. H. Weir Cook Memorial Dr, ☏ +1 317-487-9594. Indianapolis International Airport is in the southwest corner of the city, about 15 minutes from downtown without traffic. While the airport has existed in this location for decades, the current terminal was constructed in 2008, at a different location within the airport grounds, and is accessed via different roads (from the SW, rather than NE). A number of hotels are nearby, some providing free shuttles to the terminal. The airport is served by public bus (route No. 8), Express Shuttle ($12 to downtown, as of 2018), as well as shuttle buses to a few other nearby cities. (updated Jan 2024)
There are several private jet companies operating near the old terminal location, at the north side of the airport, such as Jet Linx and Million Air.
The following are of interest to private pilots:

39°46′6″N 86°9′29″WIndianapolis and Marion County. There are several "included cities" within this area that retain some independence, but for purposes of travel the only noticeable difference might be speed limits.
Outside of the walkable Downtown and some Cultural Districts, you'll need a vehicle to navigate the urban sprawl. The public bus system is fairly clean and efficient but routes are sometimes complex, and substantial portions of the metro area are inaccessible. Outside of peak hours, waits can be prohibitively long. Bike lanes alongside major roads have been constructed in the early 2010s, so cyclists will be sharing the road.
On highways, the general speed limit is 55–70 mph (89–113 km/h). On city streets, if no speed limit is posted, assume that it is 35 mph (56 km/h). Indianapolis generally lacks the aggressive driving, bad roads, and congestion associated with major U.S. cities. The city planning is largely logical and follows a grid pattern with some exceptions. A handful of streets cut across the city north–south and only a few (10th, 38th, 82nd/86th, and 96th) go across east–west. Washington Street is the main east–west through street, which bends to the south on the westside and Meridian runs north–south far past the boundaries of the city. Due to the flat terrain of central Indiana, you can see downtown from most spots in the city. If you are desperately lost, you can at least get your bearings by looking for the handful of skyscrapers.
Starting in the 2000s, Indianapolis and the surrounding areas—especially Avon in the west and Carmel in the north—have added several roundabouts. American motorists may not be familiar with them but they are safe (and have reduced collisions in the areas where they have been installed). Local drivers are accustomed to them. In 2013, a Michigan left was installed at 96th and Allisonville, the extreme north of the city.
Parking meters are found downtown. The city sold control of these to a private company in 2011–2012 and parking tickets are handed out aggressively. Meters accept cards, coins, and small bills and parking is free in late hours and on weekends.
Indy Go buses will take you to any neighborhood in Indianapolis
The public bus system is Indy Go. It travels through much of the city and into some suburbs. Single fares are $, day passes are $4, and if you think you will be staying longer, you can get a week-long card for $20 or a 31 days for $60; purchase them at the station downtown or online. All buses are equipped with two bike racks in front. Although the city has slowly increased funding for transport, outside of rush hour routes, you may still find yourself with a half-hour wait or longer. Most routes travel from a locality in the outskirts of the city to the centrally-located bus stops downtown and back out; there are also a handful of smaller circulators and loops. Consequently, if you want to go across town, you will likely have to catch two buses.
One of the handiest routes for visitors is #11 East 16th Street, which runs many of the city's most popular dining and nightlife spots, including the Mass Ave strip. #18 Broad Ripple heads from Downtown up Broad Ripple Ave. Runs roughly M–F 5AM–9:30PM, Sa 6AM–9:30PM, Su 7PM–9PM.
#8 Washington is a helpful path to travel quickly west through Downtown to the Zoo and the Canal. It runs west through downtown on Ohio, then down West St by the Canal, and then on old US-40/Washington St past the Zoo, and then all the way out to the Airport, passing by a Latino district and along the old US-36 route. The #8 route also heads east from downtown and can be used to access the quaint neighborhood of Irvington. M–F 9AM–11PM, Sa 6AM–10PM, Su 7AM–7PM.
#18 Nora will take you north on Meridian St past the Children's Museum and near a large shopping district on the northside. M–F 6AM–9:15PM, Sa 8AM–9:15PM, Su limited.
The Purple Line also goes by the Children's Museum but then heads west on 38th past Newfields (formerly the Indianapolis Museum of Art) and Crown Hill Cemetery. M–F 7AM–9PM, Sa 8AM–9PM, Su 9:30AM–7:30PM.
JAGLINE provides free shuttle service from Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus to Riverside and University Park in downtown.
Biking is easy due to the smooth topography. There are a variety of bike paths throughout the city, including the Monon Trail and the Central Canal. The Indianapolis Cultural Trail was built through several years in the early 21st century and takes riders through downtown providing signs with Indianapolis history; public art dots many stops and you will be guided past several restaurants and local businesses. This world-class bike and pedestrian path marks an interconnectivity that no other city of Indianapolis' size can achieve, connecting the city's seven Cultural Districts, neighborhoods, and entertainment amenities, and serving as the downtown hub for the entire central Indiana greenway system. Starting in 2008, Mayor Greg Ballard announced a plan to make Indianapolis a bike-friendly city for those venturing out on open, and often busy, roads. The plan includes constructing 200 miles (322 km) of additional bike lanes throughout the next 15 years, many of which are already constructed.
Motorists in Indianapolis are not known for being aggressive but it is still novel for many of them to share major roads with cyclists. Bike lanes are clearly marked but some drivers may encroach upon them. Also, while the Monon is a beautiful and well-traveled path, it is frequently unsafe at night—particularly north of Downtown. Solo biking along the trail at night is best avoided.
IndyGo buses include two bike racks in the front for storing your cycle but if they are full, then you'll be out of luck.

The Colonel Eli Lilly Civil War museum is located in the basement, and visitors can ride the tower to the top for a view of the city.

Indianapolis and the majority of the state of Indiana are on Eastern Time and observes Daylight Saving Time in the summer. Locals are accustomed to it now but as always, there may be some clocks that don't spring forward or fall back.
Indianapolis is a generally safe city, but some areas of the city are prone to crime. The downtown center of the city is very safe, but the inner-loop (inside I-465) suburbs can be dangerous in certain areas. The biggest exceptions to this are Northern Indianapolis (directly north of downtown) and much of the Eastside, particularly the Far Eastside. The Near Eastside is made up of a patchwork of neighborhoods which are generally safe and have historic buildings interspersed with some urban blight as a product of White Flight. The Near Eastside has been recovering in the 21st century and the break-up of some organized crime rings in the 2010s has had an uneven effect on crime.
