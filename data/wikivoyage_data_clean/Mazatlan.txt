Mazatlán is a city in Sinaloa state, Mexico, known for its fine beaches. It is a popular vacation and retirement destination for Canadians and Americans. While many of Mexico's original Pacific coast resorts are showing their age, Mazatlán still has some spring in its step, along with a big carnival, lively arts scene and a beautiful historical center to boot.
Mazatlán is a Nahuatl word for "place of deer". The area was colonized by the Spanish in 1531. During the mid-19th century, a large group of immigrants arrived from Germany. Over time, Mazatlán developed into a commercial seaport, importing equipment for the nearby gold and silver mines, and it served as the capital of Sinaloa from 1859 to 1873. The German settlers influenced the local music, banda, with some genres being an alteration of Bavarian folk music. The settlers established the Pacifico Brewery in 1900.
In the latter half of the 20th century, Mazatlán became a tourist destination. The hotels along Olas Altas flourished during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and Mazatlán was well regarded by Hollywood stars such as John Wayne, Gary Cooper, John Huston and others of their generation as a sport fishing mecca. In the 1970s, tourism in the historical center declined as newer venues catering to foreign tourists opened on the expanses of beach to the north of the city. As the 21st century began, the historical center was rediscovered, spurring a renaissance of restoration and entrepreneurial endeavors, and many once-fine buildings that had fallen into ruin were restored to their former glory as family homes and boutique businesses.
Today, Mazatlán is a socially and economically diverse city, with more than 500,000 people (2017) of all races. It has several distinct inner city districts, as well as outlying suburbs that are mainly inhabited by working-class Mexicans. There are two primary areas of interest to visitors: the Golden Zone (Zona Dorada) where the resort-seeking tourists go and the historical center (Centro Historico) with several lovely plazas and many renovated 18th-century commercial buildings and private residences. The city is more affordable than many of Mexico's other Pacific resorts and still maintains an authentic character. Many Americans and Canadians retire in Mazatlan.
Mazatlán has a tropical savanna climate bordering a hot semi-arid climate, with a marked and rather long dry season from November to June and an average annual temperature of 25 °C (77 °F). During the summer months, with the humidity factor, temperatures usually feel well above what the thermometer shows. Winter can be a little cool and may not make for the best beach days, particularly during a cold snap.
General Rafael Buelna International Airport (MZT IATA also known as Mazatlán International Airport). It receives international travelers from: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Houston, Dallas, South Shore Harbor, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Denver, Minneapolis, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon, Toronto-Pearson, Vancouver, and Winnipeg. You can reach Mazatlán from many other international origins via Mexico City.
Mazatlán is approximately an 18-hour drive from Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States. There are many considerations when bringing a car into Mexico.
Mexico has an extremely well developed bus route system and one can easily find a bus to wherever one needs to go. Mazatlán is about 12 hours away from Mexico City (~US$90 one way), 6 hours from Guadalajara (~US$40 one way), 15 hours from Nogales (~US$50 one way), and only about 2 hours from Culiacán. For whatever reason, the bus companies crank up the air-conditioning, so bring a sweater!

Baja Ferries runs a ferry between Mazatlan and Pichilinque, La Paz in Baja California Sur. The trip takes 12 hours or more and leaves Mazatlan almost daily (check for weekend departures). Also, Mazatlán has a busy port which accommodates a number of cruise ships that sail up and down the western coast of the Americas. From the port, it's a five-minute taxi ride to the southernmost hotels or fifteen minutes to the more modern (and more expensive) places to the north.
The Mexican Navy operates an every-other-Friday ferry between Mazatlan and Islas Marias, a former offshore penal colony that has been turned into a tourist destination with a Pueblo Magico, a UNESCO Biosphere Reservation, nature watching and sky watching opportunities and an eerie prison tour. If you're looking an off-beat weekend adventure, Islas Marias is one-of-a-kind. Reservations and details are on the official Islas Marias website.

In-town transportation is mainly motorized, except for the Centro Histórico, which is a very nice walking district.
Besides normal taxis, the tourist areas (Zona Dorada and Centro Historico) always have many small white open-topped taxis called pulmonías that look like bumper cars, many of them old Volkswagens. These are unique to Mazatlan. Although you'll never have to wait long for one (they're always whizzing back and forth) ask the price before you get in and then bargain. The correct price will usually be about 30% less than the original quote. Don't overdo the haggling, though. It'll cost you less than US$4 to go between downtown and the tourist district. You may want to give the driver a little tip as appreciation for a safe and enjoyable journey.
Uber is in Mazatlán and is about half the price of a pulmonía.
There are two different types of public transport buses that run in Mazatlán. The larger green ones run along the main tourist strip right along the water and either turn off at Rafael Buelna Anvenue or continue on along the Malecon to downtown. These are the equivalent of coach buses, they are very well air-conditioned and in great shape. They cost around M$9 (pesos) per trip. The city is also served by regular local buses which are cheaper and only cost M$5-6. Be sure to check the windshield of the bus as the bus route is typically written on it. These buses serve the entire city well but can be confusing without a thorough knowledge of the system. The buses that go along the Malecon between downtown and the tourist district are the "Sabalo-Centro" buses.
The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
Beautiful architecture lines the Plaza Machado
Lighthouse of Mazatlan (El Faro de Mazatlán) (Look for the signs that say "Faro" around town). 06:00-17:45. It is now the highest natural lighthouse in the world. (Gibraltar was the highest, but now not in operation.) The building itself is quite low, but sits on a cliff, so the light is 155 m (515 feet) above sea level. You will have the best view in Mazatlan if you hike up. Don't attempt the hike up unless you're in shape. M$30. (updated Feb 2024)
Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. This lovely building was finished in 1899 and is being gently restored to its original beauty, although to a visitor it is already beautiful to behold. Its exterior displays a beauty that needs no extras or frills, its inner beauty is juxtaposed to its outside. With all interior light coming through stained glass, it takes on a lovely color, and its reflection off gold statues and other images is quite something. A unique detail is that, at the time of the construction, there was a Jewish family living in Mazatlan, and they donated money towards the construction. People were so happy that they decided to set the Star of David in the top windows of this cathedral. One of the only Catholic churches with this Jewish symbol.
Cliff divers (El Clavadista). These daredevils do something similar as in Acapulco, but it is lower and more shallow. The rock formation that they climb up is about 13 m (45 feet) high and it is only 2-3 m (5-6 ft) deep. They wait for the right wave to make the dive. They are there all day long, but the best time to see them is in the morning. (updated Feb 2024)
Gran Acuario Mazatlán (Great Mazatlan Aquarium), Av. de los Deportes Tellería (Adjacent to the Parque de la Ciudad and Parque Infantil. Between Del Mar and Internacional, north of Deportes.). Has bird, seal, and diving shows.
Plaza Machado (Machado Square). The jewel of the restored Centro Histórico. The west side of the square is flanked by the Teatro Ángela Peralta. Adjacent to the Teatro is a Spanish-language exhibit explaining the history of Mazatlán. The north side has Pedro y Lola's restaurant, a favorite among locals and tourists. On the south side is a hotel restored to its original beauty. A decent (Spanish-language) bookstore is only a couple of blocks away near the Universidad Politécnica de Sinaloa on Constitución. Keep your eyes open for shops with interesting (high-end) local art. The restaurants on the Plazuela have great food, some a little nicer and pricier than others. El Patio and Café Pacífico line the northeast corner of the plaza, and regularly have a fantastic acoustic guitarist playing at night for the diners and the square. Along the north side are three great spots for lunch or dinner. With offers of cheap, ice-cold beer all day, it isn't hard to be lured in to try a little of their food. All these restaurants have both indoor and outdoor, on the sidewalk, seating.
Teatro Ángela Peralta (Ángela Peralta Theater) (on the Plaza Machado), ☏ +52 669 982 4446. Built in the 1800s, a beautifully restored building (1987 to 1992) which regularly offers many types of drama and music. (updated Feb 2024)

Panteón Municipal No.2 (cemetery), Av Gabriel Leyva, Montuosa. There is a cemetery on Barragan, a block north of Najera. Beautiful and interesting.
Miramar Condominium (Condominios Miramar). Although an otherwise unremarkable building, the beachfront condominium tower where infamous drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán was arrested in 2014 (he later escaped) has become somewhat of a tourist attraction, or at least a mildly-popular photo opportunity. You cannot enter the building. (updated Feb 2024)
A float in the Mazatlán Carnaval
The miles of beach have plenty to keep most people occupied. Jet skiing, waterskiing, and parascending are all available, but always haggle on price.
Playa Norte (just north of downtown). Along the boardwalk you'll find the Fishermen's Memorial, better known as monkeys bichis; a bronze replica of a pulmonia taxi and a monument to the Pacific Brewery. This is great swimming and has a number of palm-roofed fish restaurants right on the beach. The southern end of this beach is dedicated to fishermen and their boats. (updated Feb 2024)

Playa Isla De La Piedra (in the southern part of the city). Not a phenomenal beach but a nice break from the bustle of Mazatlán proper. To get to the island there are two docks from which you can catch a ferry:  Embarcadero Isla de Piedra and  Embarcadero Playa Sur. (updated Feb 2024)
Surfing. Mazatlán has several prime locations where you can try out your surfing skills. The most popular spot is a beach called  Playa Bruja to the north of the city. The waves easily reach heights of -3 m (8-10 ft) and there is almost always a vendor from whom you can rent surfboards. This is a remote beach that is usually fairly empty. Not only is the surf great, but the lack of annoying vendors makes it even better. Another surfing location is right next to Valentino's (this is the largest landmark in the city). There are several places to rent surfboards right on the beach, but the waves are not nearly as good as Playa Bruja.
Take a boat cruise. Visit the islands, go whale watching, bird watching, deep sea fishing, or simply get obliterated drunk on a party cruise. There should be something that strikes your fancy. Cruises can be booked almost almost anywhere: online, at your hotel, bumping into random touts in the tourist zone, etc.
Sport fishing. Mazatlán is a far more affordable game fishing destination than world-renown Los Cabos, despite being quite close geographically. Popular year-round species include marlin, sailfish, dorado, wahoo, swordfish, bonito, tuna and shark.
Carnaval de Mazatlán. A five-day festival held in Febuary which is purported to be one of the largest in the world. A large portion of the street in Old Mazatlán is closed down and live bands and vendors fill the streets. (updated Feb 2024)
During the week of Semana Santa (Easter week), Mazatlán is flooded with Mexican tourists from all around the country who are escaping the heat to come to the beach. The miles of beach are literally jam-packed for the entire week. The atmosphere is wild, and you can have a lot of fun, but be very careful.

There are three main shopping zones in Mazatlán:
Centro Histórico. Most of the shops and vendors down here are trying to make a living selling their wares. You can get fantastic product, at far cheaper prices than if you go to the "Golden District" or to the Mall. It's also a great district to walk through, giving you more to do than just spend money all day.
Mercado Pino Suárez. A large marketplace located in the historic center of town where they sell everything from t-shirts to traditional Mexican handcrafts. In its center is the meat and fruit market that serves the local residents. It was finished in 1899.
Ley Centro. 07:00-22:00 daily. The largest grocery store in the centro. (updated Feb 2024)
Golden Zone. The name says it all. High class, high prices.
La Gran Plaza Mall. You'll find the Mall largely empty but for a few middle class kids milling around looking for somewhere to spend their money. High prices in almost all the stores, bland food, and absolutely no culture or feeling like you're anywhere but somewhere to waste money. The one bright spot?

Mazatlán has the problems that all large Mexican cities do. It's wise to walk in groups or with someone else in any city after dark. Some places in the Centro Histórico and Golden Zone are well lit and occasionally busy at night. Don't let this deceive you into believing it is safe to walk around after dark. Don't be afraid to walk around the Cathedral, Malecon or Plaza Machado during the day. In most areas of the city there's almost no activity at night, and it would be unsafe to be anywhere after dark. Incidents of chain-snatching and robbery at knife point have been reported as occurring directly in front of Valentinos Disco in the Golden Zone even when it is very busy and several hundred people are standing outside. Avoid having any jewelry whatsoever, or wearing nice clothes so you are not targeted by the thugs in this large city. Outside of Mazatlán and its vicinity, the state of Sinaloa is heavily impacted by the drug trade; small towns and rural areas are not particularly safe for travel.
Lifeguard stand are on all main beaches, although lifeguards are rarely present. You'll usually know if jellyfish are in the water by looking at the flags (white) on the beach. You may want to bring a small container of vinegar to apply in case of a sting from jellyfish. They will also warn you of other dangerous conditions (red flags), so be sure to look for them and heed their warnings.
Mazatlan has mobile coverage from AT&T/Unefon, Telcel, and Movistar. Telcel provides 5G coverage although it's surprisingly spotty given the enormous telecommunications towers perched atop the Cerro de la Nevería and visible from almost everywhere in the city.
