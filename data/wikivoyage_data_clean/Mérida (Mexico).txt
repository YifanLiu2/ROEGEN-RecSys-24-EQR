A short distance — yet seemingly a world away — from the rowdy, touristy beach resorts of Cancún and Cozumel that make up the Yucatán of cliché, Mérida is the cultural center of southern Mexico, boasting a panoply of excellent museums and attractions, a vibrant street life, and a wealth of historic colonial-era architecture (centered on the Plaza de la Independencia in the center of town) that's second only to Mexico City on the national scene.
The Zócalo, aka Plaza de la Independencia, with the cathedral in the distance
The capital and largest city of Yucatán state with a population of just under 900,000 (2015), Mérida is a city of contrasts. You will find elegant hotels, restaurants and malls in the northern part of the city. Downtown, there are hotels and restaurants to suit every budget. A large central market and numerous small shops are found all around the main plaza. Mérida has a rich cultural life which also reflects its diversity. Many free concerts, performances and other events are held daily.
The city was founded by the Spanish conquistadors in the 1540s on top of a centuries-old Maya city called T'ho. The palatial home of the family of conquistador leader Montejo can still be seen on the south side of the Zócalo or main square. Here and there bits of ancient Maya stonework can be seen reused in Spanish Colonial era buildings in the old part of town.
From the later 1800s to the 1920s, Mérida enjoyed prosperous boom times fueled by the henequen or sisal plant harvest, which made Yucatán the rope maker to the world. Progressive Mérida had electric trams and street lights before Mexico City. The wealthy constructed the grand Pasejo Montejo avenue north of the old town, inspired by the Champs-Élysées in Paris. With the development of artificial twines the sisal boom ended, and Mérida slowed to a more sleepy provincial capital until development picked back up in the late 20th century.
The city's ambiance is colonial and the climate is tropical. The daytime temperature varies; in January, it is about 24°C (75°F) and in June, about 35°C (95°F). To beat the heat, most people are busiest in the mornings. They have lunch and siesta, then go back to work for a few hours in the late afternoon. The cool breezes from the Gulf of Mexico drift into Mérida in the evenings and this is when many of the residents spend their time outdoors. You can see them visiting and talking as they stroll along the streets, sit in the plazas or dine in the many sidewalk restaurants.
From Mérida, it is easy to take day trips to a vast array of destinations: archaeological sites, ecological parks, typical villages, caves, beaches, colonial missions and more. Take your time and really explore the Maya sites, walk for miles along the Gulf of Mexico, attend a village festival, photograph the wildlife, crawl through a cave or swim in a cenote.

If staying in the older central part of town, many attractions and restaurants are within walking distance for those who don't much mind walking in the tropical climate.
Uber, Cabify and Didi cover the city.
Uber may be difficult to use if you pay by credit card, drivers do not like this payment method. If you switch to cash payment you'll be picked up a lot sooner.
Didi does not show the payment method up front for the driver, so it is easier to get a ride. But, be aware that you may more easily get bad ratings if you don't tip/have paid well for the ride.
The Yucatán government established a modern public bus system in Mérida in the early 2020s, Va y Ven (Come and Go), and the city is now served by both public Va y Ven and private buses. To find a ride to your destination, both Moovit and Google Maps cover the city.
Va y Ven operates a network of traditional (though quite modern) buses as well as electric buses (which look like trams without the rails) called the IE-TRAM. Route maps for the buses and the IE-TRAMs are available online. Va y Ven buses do not take cash. Instead, you must purchase a rechargeable Va-y-Ven Card for M$25 at one of these locations:
Va y Ven vending machines – located at the Palacio de la Musica
Oxxo stores (good luck – they're almost always out of them)
You can also recharge your card at any of these locations. The standard (non-IE-TRAM) Va y Ven bus fare is M$12 per ride (as of 2024) with transfers allowed, while the IE-TRAM fare is M$14.
Many privately-operated buses service the outlying suburbs. Most routes radiate outward from a 4-block area east of the Zócalo, on Calles 56 and 58 between Calles 59 and 63. Destinations of routes are painted on the windshields; if in doubt you can always ask the bus driver. For visitors the most useful routes will be those heading up Paseo de Montejo from the centro – these depart from  Calle 56, and will have 'Paseo de Montejo' and/or 'Altabrisa' marked on their windshields.
Most bus stops are not marked, but many buses can be hailed from points along the route. To get off, simply say (or yell) 'baja!', and the driver will pull over at the next opportunity. A single ride costs M$8 (Jan 2022, no transfers); pay the bus driver directly on entering. Buses generally operate between 05:00-21:30 during the week, with less frequency on Sundays and holidays.
Taxis are numerous and reasonably priced. Most taxis do not use a meter, and it's best to agree on a fare before getting in. Taxis marked 'taximetro' use a meter and tend to cost a bit more – make sure that the driver does not switch the meter to the night ('noche') rate if you are traveling during the day.
Mérida is surprisingly bicycle-friendly outside of the centro. Bicycles can be rented from a number of shops.
On Sunday mornings the city holds the weekly Bici Ruta (literally Bicycle Route), when from 08:00-12:00 the entire lengths of Paseo de Montejo and Calle 60 are closed to motor vehicles. This popular event is open not only to cyclists, but to rollerbladers, skateboarders, runners, and those who simply want to enjoy a pleasant stroll with no noisy traffic. For those who don't own their own bicycles, they can be rented from a temporary  bicycle stand (open Sundays only) near the Monumento a la Patria on Paseo de Monteo, as well as from  Bici Merida (also on Paseo de Montejo, ☏ +52 999 287 3538, M-Sa 09:00-22:00, Su 08:00-15:00).
Calesas, horse-drawn carriages, waiting for customers near the Zócalo
An especially note-worthy type of transport in Mérida is the calesa, a traditional horse-drawn carriage used continuously since colonial times. Carriages can be picked up along Calle 61 by 58 and 60 (on the north side of the cathedral), and head up Calle 60 and return down Paseo de Montejo. A typical tour lasts about 45 minutes and includes narration, costing about M$350.
Turibus, Av Colón s/n x 62 (Centro), ☏ +52 920 7636 (main), +52 999 277 0021 (mobile), rcaamala@grupoado.com.mx. Daily 09:00-21:00.

Day pass: M$120 (adults), M$100 (seniors), M$50 (children 3-12). (updated Apr 2016)
Most major car rental companies maintain counters at the airport, and also have offices on the ground floor of the Hotel Fiesta Americana and/or in the centro. All rentals include mandatory liability insurance, but this may not always be included in quotes and may lead to confusion if you are shopping around.
Mexico Rent A Car, Calle 57A No 12, between 58 and 60 (Centro), ☏ +52 999 923 3637, +52 999 127 8556, mexicorentacar@hotmail.com. Daily 08:00-12:30, 18:00-20:00. A family-owned operation.

Many street corners in the Centro Histórico have, in addition to the standard street signs, whimsical plaques illustrating such diverse subjects as fruits, animals, musical instruments, etc. These signs served as a navigation aid in an era when the majority of the city's residents were illiterate, and frequently reference businesses or buildings which were (and in some cases still are) located there. Most plaques now on display are replicas, but still provide an unusual glimpse into an earlier age.
Street corner in the Centro Histórico
The streets in most of the parts of interest to visitors are in a rough grid with numbers for street names. Even numbered streets run from north to south, with the numbers increasing as you go further west; odd numbered streets run from east to west, with the numbers increasing as you go further south. This makes it easy to tell how many blocks away from something you are (just remember to divide by two when counting blocks in the same direction). Addresses are commonly given as either intersections of two streets, or stated as on a street between two cross streets. For orientation in the old part of town, remember the Cathedral and Zócalo (main square) are at the corner of 60 and 61 ("Calle 60 x 61").
There is much to see in Mérida, a city of a million inhabitants that is over 400 years old. Besides the Centro Histórico, where most tourist attractions are located, there are many charming neighborhoods, shopping malls and parks. Progreso and the Yucatán Gulf Coast are only thirty minutes away to the north.
The city tourist office offer two excellent free walking tours in English and Spanish departing from the tourist office modules listed above at am and pm respectively. A tip of M$100-200 per person is appropriate. More details here
Facade details of the Casa de Montejo
Plaza Grande (Zócalo, Plaza de la Independencia). In pre-Hispanic times the center of the Mayan city of T'Hó, the central square is at the heart of the historic center of the city. It is surrounded by impressive buildings, most of them built from stones from the Mayan temples which originally stood here.

Construction began in 1561 and was completed in 1599, except for the bell tower, which was finished 200 years later in 1774. The building is rather austere in style, partly due to its Franciscan design, and partly due to looting during the Mexican revolution.The stations of the cross in the interior on the side naves are particularly noteworthy, as is the painting above a door depicting the baptism of the Mayan ruler of Maní.An additional item of interest on the left side is the so-called El Cristo de las Ampollas ('The Christ of the Blisters') located in a side chapel. In 1645 this wood carving was brought from the village of Ichmul, after it miraculously survived a fire which had destroyed the village church. The original was destroyed during the revolution, but the devout still come to pray at the replica. Free. (updated May 2015)

Traditional dance performed every Sunday in the Zócalo
The ayuntamiento (city hall) sponsors many cultural events during the week, free of charge. Almost every night visitors and residents alike can enjoy outdoor concerts or dances in one of the many downtown parks and squares. Sunday afternoons at the Plaza Grande (at and around the main square) are a particular treat, and perhaps the most charming time in Mérida. The streets around the square are closed to vehicles, and the locals dress up to go for strolls to see and be seen. Brass bands and dance orchestras hold free concerts, and couples dance – if you're not shy, consider joining in, or ask a local to teach you the steps to a local dance like the jarana. Street vendors sell a variety of refreshments.

Several important archaeological sites are close to Mérida. Many moderate sized sites, such as Dzibilchaltun and Mayapán, are an easy day trip. The largest, Chichen Itza, is somewhat further and much more extensive – while a day trip visit from Mérida can be (and often is) done, if you want to see the whole site without being rushed, Chichen is better visited in two days with an overnight stay. Fans of ancient Maya architecture can also find staying overnight at Uxmal worthwhile, since it has a night-time light & sound show, and the following day one can visit the nearby smaller ruined cities of  Kabah,  Sayil and  Labna.
Chichen Itza is a large pre-Columbian archaeological site built by the Maya civilization, located in the northern center of the Yucatán Peninsula, present-day Mexico. The main edifice, the Castillo or Pyramid of Kukulcan, was voted one of the new Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.
Cuzamá is one of the interesting sites on the Ruta de los Cenotes itinerary, with prominent cenotes (sinkholes leading to significant caves). Buses to Cuzamá depart from Terminal Noreste (Calle 67 btw 50 and 52, listed above under 'Get in'). Buses from this station also head to Mayapán, Izamal, and Rio Lagartos.

Its most famous structure is the Temple Of The Seven Dolls (El Templo de las Siete Muñecas), so named because of seven small effigies found at the site when the temple was discovered under the ruins of a later temple pyramid by archaeologists in the 1950s. On the spring equinox the sun rises so that it shines directly through one window of the temple and out the other. The temple is connected to the rest of the site by a long sacbé. The other major feature of Dzibilchaltún is its cenote, which is used as a swimming hole by local residents year round; it is the first stop on the Ruta de los Cenotes. Also on the site are the ruins of a 16th-century Spanish church, as well as a museum displaying Mayan artifacts from the site and the region. M$68 (adults), M$39 Mexican adults, non-Mexican children under 12). (updated Jun 2015)
Mayapan (about 40km SE of Mérida and 100km W of Chichen Itza), ☏ +52 999 944 0033, direccion.yuc@inah.gob.mx. Daily 08:00-17:00. A compact, well-preserved pre-Columbian site, Mayapán was the political capital of the Maya in the Yucatán Peninsula from about the late 1220s until 1440s. Unlike at other Mayan sites, climbing of pyramids is permitted, and worth the effort. Hourly buses to Mayapán can be picked up at Terminal Noreste (listed above).

If you don't want to spend your whole day at the beach, you can combine a visit to the ruins of Dzibilchaltun in your day trip, since it's just off the highway between Mérida and Progreso. Buses to Progreso depart from the Terminal Auto-Progreso (Calle 62 No 524 between 65 and 67, listed above under 'Get in') daily every 10 minutes from 05:15-21:00, with a journey lasting 55 minutes.

The industry crumbled after about 30 years for various reasons, leaving many haciendas in ruin. Today many of those haciendas have been restored, and Sotuta de Peón is an example of one which can be visited without spending the night.

There are hundreds of stores in downtown Mérida. In and around the Plaza Grande, the large plaza in the Centro directly across from the cathedral, it is common for street salesmen to engage passersby in friendly small talk, by telling them some historical facts about the surroundings. The conversation will quickly turn to recommendations of shops selling hammocks, guayaberas, handcrafts, jewelry, etc. The items sold in stores that use street salesmen to find customers tend to be highly overpriced. While there are honest and hardworking street salesmen, as a general rule, the best shopping strategy is to browse stores without the assistance of any street salesmen and to never allow a street salesman to bring you to a store. Since street salesmen work on commission, tourists are usually charged higher prices if they are brought into a store by a street salesman or other street guide.
A wide range of outstanding artesanias can be found here. Mérida is a great place to pick up a good quality hammock. However, be aware that many people selling hammocks in and around Mérida will try to get the highest price they can from a tourist. A good hammock costs between 300 and 800 pesos, not dollars. The tighter the weave, the better the hammock. You should always insist on unfolding and viewing a hammock before buying it.
There are plenty of hand-crafted things to buy in the shops along Calle 56A.

Huipils and textiles for sale at the weekly Sunday market in the Zócalo
The Yucatán is also famous for its guayaberas, to the point that the shirts are also known as the camisa de Yucatán (the shirt of the Yucatán). Locally-made huipils, the traditional garment worn by Yucatecan women, and jipijapa hats (aka Panama hats) are also popular items for sale. As with hammocks, quality varies widely.
The street salesmen who offer to bring tourists to stores that sell traditional clothing almost always accompany or direct people to stores that offer the double whammy of low-quality guayaberas and huipils at high prices. (Most such salesmen work on commission, which explains their aggressiveness.)

Cuban cigars are also a common item being sold by street vendors, but beware: many 'Cuban' cigars sold on the streets of Mérida are excellent fakes that are manufactured elsewhere. True Cuban cigars can be found in Mérida, but they are sold mostly in established tobacco shops with solid local reputations.

Mérida has one of the best hospital networks in Mexico, and receives patients not only from Mexico but from neighboring Guatemala and Belize as well as from the United States. Cooperation with the medical establishment in cities like Houston has helped to develop a comprehensive network for medical care, with many private clinics meeting and even exceeding standards in Europe and the US.
Public hospitals can provide urgent care, but facilities are basic and staff are unlikely to speak English. For visitors who are not confident with their Spanish, private hospitals and clinics offer a good alternative. Many doctors can speak some English, but nursing staff and receptionists will likely not.
