Montana is huge: most residents think nothing of driving in what most of the world consider long distances, so with that in mind like most of Montana, you're going to need a car.

Bar S, 5100 North Star Blvd, ☏ +1 406 761-9550. Simple decor, mind-blowing prime rib. If you're lucky, the waitress will show you a picture of the 6'6" gentleman who orders the "Double Bar-S cut," Which if the picture tells the story, stands about four full inches tall. $20-50.
Big Mouth BBQ, 2600 10th Ave S (inside HiHo store). Easily the best BBQ in town. All of the meat is Pit Smoked and comes out fall off the bone tender and incredibly flavorful. Several choices of sauce that should suit everyone in your party. You have your standard fare, ribs, brisquette, chicken, sausage, etc. But you could also try one of Big Mouth's specialty items Try the Cowboy Cocktail: pulled pork, beans, coleslaw and sauce in a cup.

Portage Supper Club, 3725 2nd Ave. N., ☏ +1 406-952-0335. Eddies is a coffeeshop and steakhouse established in 1944 and not redecorated since. The place has fabulous steaks and cheap liquor. A great place to go for an old time steakhouse experience.
Taco Treat/Amigo Lounge, 1200 7th Street S. A good Mexican place if you're looking for that option in Great Falls. Keep in mind you're in Montana, so if you're looking for fully authentic Mexican food, you might want to wait until you get home. What you will get is outsanding American syle Mexican food with a local twist. The food is satisfying, the portions large, and the prices good. What more could you ask for?
The MacKenzie River Pizza Company. A franchise restaurant with locations all around Montana. The Great Falls location is next to the Missouri River, and it's very child-friendly. Specializes in gourmet pizzas, but does have more conventional options for those with unadventrous pallets or small children. Be wanrned, this restaurant is extremely popular and gets crowded quickly most every night. So if it looks packed, it is, but there's a reason for that. Don't worry about a wait, service is quick and friendly and you shouldn't have to wait that long to be seated. (updated Jun 2017)
Borries, 1800 Smelter Ave NE, Black Eagle, ☏ +1 406 761-0300. Located in the adjoining town of Black Eagle, Borries has been a Great Falls Establishment since 1938. Probably the best Italian food in town, although there aren't all that many options on the menu Italian wise. Fantastic steaks, Tuesday is Prime Rib Night (Get an early reservation or it will be gone), and quite arguably some of the best Minestrone in existence. A local favorite, definitely one of the higher end restaurants in Great Falls, so be prepared, it gets crowded and service can be a bit slow on especially busy nights. Don't let that scare you away, absolutely fantastic food.
Montana Sub Shop, 701 9th St S (take the 10th Ave South Exit, follow 10th Ave South to 9th St S, make a left onto 9th St S, Montana Sub Shop is three blocks down on the right), ☏ +1 406 454-0651. This little locally-owned sandwich shop is known for its large portions, high-quality ingredients, and just plain old awesome subs. Quick, friendly service even when it's busy; there isn't a large dining area so it can get a little crowded. Even if you're just passing through Great Falls around lunch time, definitely one of your best healthy grab and go options. $.
Cattleman's Cut Supper Club, 1400 Market Pl Dr, ☏ +1 406 452-0702. Cattleman's cut is pretty unapologetic for what it is. As you pull into the gravel parking lot full of pick up trucks and approach a building that looks more like a prefabricated barn as opposed to what it is, a local favorite and one of the best restaurants in the city, you may be wondering what you're getting yourself into. Take a second and remind yourself that you're in Great Falls, Montana. Cattleman's Cut is a restaurant where you go for a good steak. An extensive selection of cuts of beef, all cooked to order, a fairly extensive selection of seafood (remember the being in Great Falls Montana thing, though), and probably the best salad bar in the city await you. Call ahead, it really doesn't matter what day of the week it is, this place gets packed.
Howard's Pizza, multiple locations in Great falls. Specializes in thin-crust pizza. A local favorite. (updated Apr 2016)

Smelter Avenue/The Northwest Bypass possesses many options for those visiting the Northern portion of Great Falls. For those located out towards Malmstrom Air Force Base 57th St, River Road, and the Eastern End of 10th Avenue South provide your best options to find some libations with friends. Suffice it to say, no matter where you are in Great Falls a frosty cold one is never far away.
The Beacon Ice House, 1349 13th Avenue Southwest, ☏ +1 406 727-1449. Out of the way, but worth the trouble of finding. Has theme nights most nights of the week with a live DJ, pool, firendly staff, and cheap booze.

Glacier National Park - Widely considered one of the most beautiful areas in the world. It's approximately 3 hours northwest of Great Falls. Glacier is at the very least an absolute must do day trip. See incredible mountain peaks, dramatic valleys carved by glaciers, isolated alpine lakes, raging waterfalls, active glaciers, and more wild life than you ever imagined. Camp at one of the many campgrounds and spend some time just soaking in the natural beauty of one of North America's Crown Jewels.
Yellowstone National Park and Grand Tetons National Park - Approximately 4½ hours south on US 89, Yellowstone is the most famous national park in the US. See thermodynamics at work in nature! Visit Old Faithful, hike to breath taking Yellowstone Falls, see wolves, bear, and bison in their natural habitat, see the spectacular vistas of the Grand Tetons. Yellowstone pretty much explains itself. While it would be a difficult day trip, there's doubt that anyone would only want to spend a single day in one of the most incredible places in the world. Warning, Yellowstone gets incredibly crowded during the summer months as it is a world wide tourist destination.
Fort Benton - Approximately 45 miles north of Great Falls on Highway 87. A Nationally Registered Historic Landmark. Fort Benton's claim to fame is that it was as far west as Steam Ships could go on the Missouri River and thus became a vitally important to the expansion of the United States into the western territories. Once gold was discovered in Montana, Fort Benton became a primary destination for goldminers as they expanded into the western US and Canada in search of gold. Visit the still intact actual Fort. Walk along the levee and see an actual steam-ship. Visit the museums and learn about the history of one of the Wild West's Wildest towns.
The Highwood Mountains - From Great Falls, go east on US 89 6 miles, east 13 miles on MT-228, 16 miles east on County Road 121, then 2 miles east on Forest Road 8840. The latter are dirt & gravel. Want to get out of the city and into the Montana wilderness? The Highwood Mountains are a mountain range located approximately 40 miles from Great Falls. Get out, hike some trails, camp out at Thain Creek Campground and get away from it all. Always remember safety, know where you're going, let people know where you're going, dress appropriately, take plenty of food and water as you can become isolated, never leave food out in the open as you may attract wild life, if you're staying over night make sure to take shelter with you, and take a sleeping bag as it can get chilly at night, especially in the spring and fall. Camping in the winter in Montana is not recommended for the inexperienced as conditions can become extremely harsh.
