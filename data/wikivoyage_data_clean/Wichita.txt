Wichita is the largest city in Kansas — since Kansas City is divided between the states of Kansas and Missouri. It is not the biggest or flashiest city in the US, but it is a medium-sized city with a small-town feel. It offers much to tourists from both near and far with its variety of attractions.
Wichita is a city in the heart of the great plains in Central Kansas. The city is home to large aircraft manufacturers which make up a large portion of the local economy. In 2021, it had almost 400,000 residents.
Wichita is at the junction of Interstates 135 and 35 (Kansas Turnpike) and approximately 3 hours' drive from Kansas City or Oklahoma City. It's 1½ hours from I-70.

City Bus. As the only form of public transit serving the city, bus service may cover the areas near some sights you'd want to see, but not nearly all. Routes are long and the wait for the next bus can stretch to an hour. In general, this is not a good way to get around.
Taxi Hailable only at the airport, they don't even queue at downtown hotels. Points of interest are far enough apart that a rental car quickly becomes cost-effective. Unlike other cities of its size, you can't even find any at the bus station.
Rental car If you didn't drive to Wichita, you'll likely want to rent a car when you arrive.
