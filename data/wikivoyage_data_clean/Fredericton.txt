Fredericton is the capital of New Brunswick, Canada. It is located along the St. John River. Fredericton is the cultural, artistic and educational centre of the province. Fredericton is home to two universities - the University of New Brunswick and the liberal arts-focused St. Thomas University.
Fredericton is also home to cultural institutions such as the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Fredericton Region Museum and the Playhouse, the latter which serves as a venue for local talent/writers. Adding to the city's rich cultural milieu, Fredericton is the annual Harvest and Jazz and Blues Festival every fall which attracts regional and international jazz and blues artists. The city's IT and commercial sectors are growing, and it has the highest percentage of residents with a post-secondary education in the province and one of the highest per-capita incomes.
The population of Fredericton proper was 58,000 in 2016, with a metropolitan area population of 102,000.
Fredericton is located along a river bank which splits the city in two parts which the locals call the "North Side" and "South Side". The majority of hotels and tourist destinations are located on the South Side, while you can find some hidden gem restaurants in the North Side. The City of Fredericton comprises Fredericton proper, and the boroughs of Silverwood, Nashwaaksis, Devon, Barker's Point and Marysville, which were incorporated into the city in 1973.
The city is situated in the west-central portion of the province and, along with Moncton and Saint John, is one of the main urban centres in Southern New Brunswick. The St. John River flows in a west-east direction, bisecting the city and providing the dominant natural feature for the municipality.
As the capital city of New Brunswick, Fredericton benefits from the presence of the Provincial Legislature, and many organizations operating at a provincial level. Although New Brunswick is officially bilingual, a rule which also applies to City services, the vast majority of Fredericton residents are Anglophone (native English speakers), and the availability of tourist services in French varies considerably.
