Rajkot is a city in the state of Gujarat in Western India. Rajkot rather appeals to spiritual tastes. As in Ahmedabad, many ashrams, that offers the teachings of yoga and meditative retreat, are located in the city and its surroundings, amidst forested hills and beautiful lakes. These traditions are not apparent to foreign visitors, especially to those in a hurry.
Sacred Heart Syro-Malabar Cathedral (also called Prem Mandir)
Rajkot is most famous as the place where Mahatma Gandhi pursued his early education. The city is also famous for traditional sweets and dandiya/garba raas dances. Founded in 1620 by a member of Jadeja clan, whose descendants ruled the city until 1947, Rajkot gained economic importance in the early 19th century, under British protectorate. Farmers' and traders' councils were encouraged to grow under British Rule. Later the city plunged into the industrial Age with the first years dominated by casting industries. Even today Rajkot is a wealthy city that ranks the 22nd-fastest-growing city in the world. It's also one of the cleanest cities of India.
Rajkot lies in the middle of Kathiawar peninsula, halfway between Ahmedabad and Porbandar. It's well worth one or two days stop although it's not a monumental city.
Gujarati is the main language. Hindi is next most popular. A good number of people will have a working knowledge of English too.
Being one of the major cities of Gujarat, Rajkot is well connected to other cities by air and land transport. For tourists, it's usual to either board a flight from Mumbai (for international arrivals) to Rajkot. For others who are already in India, it's advisable to reach Ahmadabad (either by train or by flight), and then take a quick bus ride to Rajkot.
Rajkot Airport (RAJ IATA). Has several Air India flights to Mumbai and Delhi everyday, which in turn are well connected with the rest of the world. IndiGo flies from Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Delhi, North Goa, Mumbai and Pune.
Rajkot Junction. The main railway station. There are several direct trains from all parts of India to Rajkot. Some of them include longer routes trains from Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Jammu, Kochi, Secunderabad, Thiruvananthapuram and Bhopal. In common with the rest of India it is advisable to book train tickets as early as possible because they are generally not available (i.e., in waiting) after the booking slot opens. Booking the tickets 2-3 months prior to the journey is recommended. For those who take long distance trains, it is even more advisable.
Rajkot is quite well connected to the entire region of Saurashtra and rest of Gujarat by buses.
GSRTC Bus Station (located in Karanpara area, just south of the Town Hall.).
If you will be flying out of Ahmedabad, there are some buses that leave from Rajkot and drop you to the Ahmedabad airport. They drop you just outside the airport, so be ready to walk about 10 minutes to get to the entrance, but its paved and many people are walking that way. A lot of private bus companies have a very well established network around the state with comfortable bus options (e.g. Patel Tours and travels, Eagle travels, Neeta travels.)
As Rajkot lies in the middle of the Saurashtra region, it is very easy to visit many famous places from here, whose relatives distances from Rajkot are small.
Commuting inside the city can be done via BRTSdead link which covers the roads around the city, but the most favorite is using Auto-richshaws (best to negotiate the rate of travel before sitting inside).
