A car is probably the best way to get around Syracuse, especially if you are going to places away from downtown. Thanks to its many Interstate highways (I-90, I-81, I-481, and I-690), nearly everywhere in the Syracuse area can be reached within a 20-minute drive. Make sure you have a map and pay attention to the street signs. There are some streets in the downtown area that go from being two-way to one-way, which is not always clear on a map.
You can walk to most of the destinations in downtown Syracuse from a parking lot or the Centro bus terminal.
Most of the downtown area is relatively flat, but keep in mind that the Syracuse University area has many steep hills and the residential areas surrounding downtown have quite a few hills as well. What some people will do is catch a ride on the bus downtown, placing their bike on the bike rack on the front of the bus and then use their bike once they reach downtown, thus avoiding the steep hills. E-bike rentals are available throughout the downtown area via Sync Bike Sharedead link.
The Centro Bus System provides a fair alternative to driving to most locations, with a fare of $2 within Syracuse and additional fares to outlying suburbs, such as to Auburn for $4 and to Oswego for $5. Buses can come sporadically, especially if you plan to ride the bus outside of Downtown Syracuse, so check the bus schedule online in advance. If you have to transfer to another bus, be sure to ask the bus driver for a transfer card so that you don't get stuck paying double fares for the same trip. Centro offers discounts for senior citizens, persons with disabilities and children. The buses are accessible to people with disabilities and the bus drivers are instructed to let a person with a physical disability on before letting other passengers on.
Centro Transit Hub, 599 S. Salina St. Information booth open M–F 6AM–6PM, Sa 8AM–5PM, closed Su. The central hub for all Centro bus routes, located right in Downtown Syracuse. Offers public restrooms, bicycle racks, and an information booth. (updated Aug 2019)
There are several taxi services listed in the Syracuse phone book that you can choose from. It will usually take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes for a taxi to come pick you up but it can be useful if you missed the last bus of the day. At the airport there is usually no wait, as there is a well-frequented taxi stand at the end of Terminal A. Ride-hailing services including Lyft and Uber are also available.
