Bremer Rathaus (Bremen town hall)
The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen is a city in northern Germany with a major port on the River Weser. The population is 567,000 (2020). It is also the name of one of the states of Germany which consists of two separated enclaves on the River Weser; the other enclave, Bremerhaven, is covered by its own article.
Bremen was once a member of the medieval Hanseatic League and is still one of the most important cities in northern Germany. Together with the city of Bremerhaven on the North Sea it forms Germany's smallest state.
Bremen has more than 1200 years of history, and was, for most of its existence, an independent city-state.
Bremen Town Musicians by Gerhard Marcks
The Bremer Stadtmusikanten (Town Musicians of Bremen) perhaps the most well known figures associated with Bremen are characters from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the same name. Their image adorns many of the souvenirs in the city. Next to the Town Hall is a much photographed statue of them.
Bremen is a rather long and narrow city, lining both sides of the river Weser. Along the north-west/south-east axis it stretches about 10 km, but across only 2 km. The entire city is located on flat plains.
Bremen airport (BRE IATA) (in the south-west of the town). Mostly caters to low-fare and holiday flights. The low-fare carrier Ryanair offers by far the most connections, spread all over Europe but with stronger focus on the Mediterranean (especially holiday destinations) and countries around the Baltic Sea. Apart from Ryanair and holiday specialists, there are a few high-fare business-oriented flights to specific destinations (like Toulouse, serving Airbus Group which has facilities in both cities), and feeder flights to major hub airports operated by flag carriers. While Ryanair has reduced its offer at BRE, Sundair offers flights to some holiday destinations
If you want a smooth intercontinental connection to Bremen, your best bet is to fly with Star Alliance or SkyTeam. Star Alliance founder Lufthansa flies from Bremen to their hubs in Frankfurt and Munich, sister airline Eurowings to Stuttgart, while other alliance member Scandinavian Airlines flies to Copenhagen and Turkish Airlines to Istanbul. SkyTeam's founders Air France-KLM fly to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Amsterdam-Schiphol. You can connect to the alliances' vast networks of intercontinental - and European - connections there. If you are cost conscious, it might work out cheaper to forgo the domestic flight on the last leg and use an air rail alliance such as rail&fly instead. Though thanks to the quirky nature of airline pricing, the exact opposite may be the case.
Getting from the airport into town is quick, smooth and painless. Tram (Straßenbahn) 6 leaves right outside the main terminal building and takes you into downtown every 10 minutes during the day. Travel time is 10 minutes to downtown (Domsheide) and 16 minutes to the Main Railway Station (Hauptbahnhof).
Further afield, you can fly to Hamburg and Hannover. Both cities have frequent train connections with Bremen.
Hauptbahnhof portal (central station)
Regular and frequent services connect  Bremen Hauptbahnhof. with the rest of Germany. There are two trains every hour from Hamburg (1 hour) in the north, and Osnabrück (1 hour), Münster (1 hr 20 min), the Ruhr Area in the south, and from Hanover (1 hr 20 min). Flixtrain serves the city.
Train tickets can be quite expensive (unless bought in advance), and the cheapest way to travel can be to share a group ticket with other people. However, group tickets are not as cheap as they once were and often an early bird fare (starting from €19 for short routes) on a high-speed connection is cheaper and less stressful than dealing with group tickets which are almost always only valid on regional trains. For more on that issue see rail travel in Germany.

Note that on trains, tickets must be purchased before you board. Public transportation timetables and ticket fares are available in English.
