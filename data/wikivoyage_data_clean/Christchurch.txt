This article is about the city in New Zealand. For the town in the United Kingdom, see Christchurch (England)
Christchurch (Māori: Ōtautahi) is the largest city in the South Island of New Zealand, and the second most-populous urban area in the country. As well as having the most attractions of any place in the South Island, it's the major international entry point for visiting the rest of the island. It is on the east coast of the South Island, and is the centre of the Canterbury region.
Christchurch is rebuilding after an earthquake in February 2011 that severely damaged it. The city is back in business and open to visitors; you will encounter construction sites, roadworks and vacant land (often used as temporary car parks) as you travel around.
Christchurch is located on the Canterbury plains on the eastern coast of the South Island, just north of Banks Peninsula. The city has a population of 385,000 (2023), increasing to 520,000 people when including its communing zone. Whether Christchurch or Wellington is New Zealand's the second-largest urban area is debatable and depends on where people draw the boundaries; However, the boundaries as used by Statistics New Zealand clearly gives Chistchurch the title in all measures.
Christchurch has a rich English heritage. This especially shows in the older buildings, especially in the cultural precinct along Worcester Boulevard (which is open from the Avon River towards the west), where most heritage buildings remain. The Avon River flows through the central city and disrupts the regular rectangular layout of the city streets.
Christchurch is known as the Garden City, a well-deserved name. Looking from a few floors up, one is struck by the number of trees that grow like a forest throughout the suburbs.
The quake-damaged ChristChurch Cathedral in 2015
The Canterbury Association was established in London in 1848, with the intent of settling English emigrants in what was to become Christchurch and the Canterbury region. The city's name was chosen on 27 March 1848, named after the Christ Church college at the University of Oxford. The first settlers arrived in the future Christchurch in December 1850. Christchurch was declared a city in 1856, New Zealand's first. Construction began on the landmark ChristChurch Cathedral in 1864; the cathedral was completed and consecrated in 1881.
The Port Hills, which separated Christchuch from the deepwater port of Lyttelton, proved to be an obstacle in the early days, with goods requiring transshipment onto smaller ships that could use the shallow port at Ferrymead, or carried on horseback across the hills. The separation was the impetus for New Zealand's first railway, opening in 1863 from central Christchurch to Ferrymead in 1863 and then to Lyttelton once the -km Lyttelton Rail Tunnel under the Port Hills was completed in 1867. Nearly a century later in 1964, the rail tunnel was supplemented by the -km Lyttelton Road Tunnel, which held the title of New Zealand's longest road tunnel until the Waterview tunnels in Auckland opened in 2017.
At 4:35AM on Saturday, 4 September 2010, the city and region was hit by a magnitude  earthquake, located 10 km deep and 40 km west of the city centre. Parts of the city were damaged, but there were no fatalities. However, 5½ months later, at 12:51PM on Tuesday, 22 February 2011, a magnitude  aftershock struck 10 km south of the city centre at 5 km deep. Already damaged buildings collapsed, killing 185 people, 115 of which resulted from the six-storey Canterbury Television building collapsing and catching fire. Many other central city buildings, old and new, were damaged beyond repair and were subsequently demolished. The landmark ChristChurch Cathedral lost its spire tower and most of its western facade. Liquefaction severely affected the eastern suburbs, resulting in 10,000 homes having to be abandoned due to land damage (the "residential red zone"). Some residents moved out of the city after the quake – many moved out to the Waimakariri and Selwyn Districts north and south of the city respectively, and some moved to other areas in Canterbury and further afield.
A very hip scene has developed in some of the suburbs close to the centre, and many 'gapfiller' projects (as part of the earthquake recovery) are stunning. In 2013, Lonely Planet declared post-earthquake Christchurch as one of the top 10 travel destinations in the world.
In March 2019, an Australian man with white-supremacist views carried out a terrorist attack on two mosques in the city, killing 51 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern New Zealand history. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. The attacks resulted in a significant tightening of gun laws in New Zealand.

Like the rest of New Zealand, Christchurch has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, mild to warm summers, cool winters, and rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year. The city is the driest of New Zealand's major cities with only 630 mm of rain per year, half of what Auckland and Wellington receive. This is due to the city being in the lee of the Southern Alps, which blocks the moist westerly winds off the Tasman Sea and causes the moisture to fall back as rain on the West Coast. The Southern Alps also causes a hot and strong foehn wind, locally known as the "Nor'wester", to blow across Christchurch and the Canterbury plains. The Nor'wester is most pronounced in summer and can cause temperatures in Christchurch to soar over 35 °C (95 °F). Christchurch occasionally receives snow during winter; on average one significant snowfall occurs in the city every 1 to 3 years.
Christchurch International Airport (CHC IATA). It's 12 km northwest of the city centre, and has regular international services from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Fiji, Singapore and Dubai (via Sydney), and seasonal services from Guangzhou, Hong Kong and San Francisco. There are frequent flights each day from most New Zealand airports, with direct flights to and from Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Nelson, Queenstown, Rotorua, Wellington and many more places, provided by Air New Zealand and Jetstar Airways. There is a single terminal building that serves international and domestic flights. (updated Jun 2017)
There are two regular public bus services from the airport to the city centre. The number 29 bus travels via Fendalton, while the number 3 bus travels via the University of Canterbury and Riccarton. The 30-min trip costs $ (or $ with a Metrocard) and between the two routes buses operate every 15-30 minutes during the day, 7 days a week. A door-to-door shuttle service to all parts of Christchurch is available; the price to the city centre is $24 for the first person and $5 for each additional person travelling to the same destination. Taxi stands (about $45-65 to the city centre) and rental car parks are close to the terminal building.
If you have a few hours to spare and no heavy luggage, you can walk to the airport. There is a footpath alongside Fendalton Road/Memorial Avenue all the way to the airport and the 8 km walk through residential neighbourhoods is quite pleasant.
Christchurch lies at the intersection of State Highways 1 and 73. State Highways 1, 74 and 76 form a ring road through the outer suburbs of the city.
From the Upper South Island, follow State Highway 1 southbound through Waipara, Amberley, Woodend and Kaiapoi to approach Christchurch from the north.
From the West Coast, follow State Highway 73 over Arthur's Pass and via Darfield and West Melton to approach Christchurch from the west. Alternatively, you can follow State Highway 7 over the Lewis Pass, meeting State Highway 1 at Waipara and approaching Christchurch from the north.
From the Lower South Island, follow State Highway 1 northbound through Ashburton and Rolleston to approach Christchurch from the south-west.
Typical distances and non-stop travel times to Christchurch are:

Coastal Pacific train at Christchurch station
Christchurch railway station, Troup Drive, Addington (adjacent to Tower Junction shopping centre). Shuttles from the station are chargeable, or you can walk into town along the edge of Hagley Park in about 45 minutes. The station has limited facilities. (updated Jun 2017)
The TranzAlpine can take you coast-to-coast between Christchurch and Greymouth, a town on the West Coast. This scenic train journey can be done as a day trip. The train departs from Christchurch daily at 8:15AM, arriving at Greymouth at 12:45PM, then leaves Greymouth at 1:45PM, getting back to Christchurch at 6:05PM. During the trip you’ll see the fields of the Canterbury Plains, followed by spectacular gorges and river valleys of the Waimakariri River. The train then climbs into the Southern Alps before descending through lush beech rain forest to Greymouth.
The Coastal Pacific runs between Picton and Christchurch. At Picton the Coastal Pacific connects with the Cook Strait ferries from Wellington in the North Island. The train departs Christchurch at 7AM and arrives in Picton at 1:15PM, connecting with the 2PM ferry to Wellington. The 9AM ferry from Wellington connects with the train departing Picton at 2:15PM and arriving in Christchurch at 8:30PM. Canterbury Shuttles pick-ups for the Coastal Pacific are 6-6:30AM.
Christchurch is mostly flat with a grid-pattern layout, so navigation by road is generally simple. The central city is contained by the "four avenues": Bealey Ave in the north, Fitzgerald Ave in the east, Deans Ave in the west, and Moorhouse Ave in the south. Watch out for one-way streets and bus-and-taxi-only intersections in the central city.
Many people get around on bicycles, and special-purpose bicycle lanes have been added to many streets to help promote cycling. The city is more bike-friendly than many other New Zealand cities and almost all Australian cities. The Central City also has a uniform 30 km/h limit on all streets, which means that it is mostly safe to cycle even on the main street. Drivers in general are also a bit friendlier toward cyclists compared to other cities in the region.
Parking in the city uses a pay and display system and costs $/hour. You can pay with coins, credit card (Visa, MasterCard or AmEx) or with a mobile phone text message (the latter two attract a 50c surcharge) then display the ticket with the expiry time visible on the kerbside dash. Rental cars are available. Most depots are on the airport side of town, with just a few near the CBD.
The city has a small heritage tram loop, best regarded as an attraction rather than a transport system due to its small size of coverage, high price ($35 day pass for adults, free for children), limited hours, and odd choice of route (it is faster to walk in most instances).
The city bus service is called Metro. Buses interconnect through the  Bus Interchange on Lichfield St, just east of Colombo St. A standard cash bus fare within the city is $4 or $2 with a Metrocard. The Metrocard costs $5 and needs to be topped up with a minimum of $5, its purchase will then cost you $10. By using the card you will travel for free the same day after paying two trips, and a maximum cost of $16 per week. Services cover the whole city and areas of interest for a visitor that lie outside the central city, such as Sumner and New Brighton beaches, Lyttelton, and the Gondola.
The core bus network has four cross-city routes and a circular route through the inner suburbs. Buses on these routes run every 15 minutes during the day, seven days a week. The four cross-city routes converge at the Bus Interchange.

Backpackers are safe, clean, cheap and cheerful. The cheapest option is a share/dorm room usually costing around $30 per night. Most offer single rooms, twin and double rooms and shared rooms. The standard of backpackers is very good in New Zealand.

Christchurch has a problem with smog during the winter, but only at night. Although conditions have improved over the years due to the intervention of the city council, take care venturing out on calm frosty evenings if you have a breathing-related medical condition.
While violent crime is relatively rare, some people do have a tendency towards aggression when drunk, as in most cities. Linwood is one of the lower socio-economic area of Christchurch, and is rougher than some other neighborhoods, but is still considered safe. As in any city, take care late at night, especially on Friday and Saturdays, as levels of intoxication can lead to unwanted attention or unprovoked violence. Avoid dark alleyways and confrontations and, if in doubt, make haste to a populated area and call the police (dial 111).
Aftershocks from the 2010-11 earthquakes have long since subsided. There is still a risk of another major earthquake rocking Christchurch, but the chances are comparable to any other New Zealand city.

As a major gateway to the South Island, Christchurch is often the starting or finishing point for touring the rest of the island.
The Greater Christchurch area covers the Banks Peninsula southeast of Christchurch and the lowland areas of the Waimakariri and Selywn district, approximately in a 50 km radius of central Christchurch.
Lyttelton, the port town just over the Port Hills from the city, is accessible by car/bus through the tunnel, or by the scenic Port Hills route via the seaside suburb of Sumner. (The road from Sumner over Evans Pass to Lyttelton is closed because of earthquake damage; the epicenter of the 2011 earthquake was close to the surface here.) Although only 15 km (9 mi) from the central city, Lyttelton feels like another world entirely, with its cafes, bars, shops and locals, its ever-busy port, its stunning hilly backdrop and beautiful harbour. But because of the 2011 earthquake damage, Lyttelton is no longer the port of call for cruise ships visiting Christchurch; it has been shifted to Akaroa.
Banks Peninsula is on the edge of the city, and offers a quieter beauty than the Alps, but quite lovely. At its southern end of the peninsula is Akaroa – beautiful, quaint and packed with good eateries. Try out the "Swim with the Dolphins in the sea" trip.
