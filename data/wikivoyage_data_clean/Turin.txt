Turin (Italian: Torino, Piedmontese: Turin) is a city in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy, with a population of about 844,000 in 2023, and another  million across its metropolitan area. For many visitors it's simply the place where their budget flight lands then they jump on the coach to the Val d'Aosta ski resorts. It is however an outstanding destination in its own right, with its old-world aristocratic ambiance, grand boulevards and palaces, arcade streets, and cultural and artistic heritage.

"Taurini" first appears in history in 218 BC, when the tribe of that name was subdued by Hannibal. Over the centuries it grew into a sizeable city but was repeatedly attacked or occupied by foreign troops, and Italy was a patchwork of warring principalities. One powerful faction was the Savoy dynasty, relocating from their original Alpine home to re-base in Turin, and they embellished it in the 18th century with baroque palaces (not all of these for their mistresses), elegant boulevards and grand piazzas. Napoleon captured Turin and the Piedmont region in 1802, but after his downfall the Savoyards were re-instated and the city (now a royal capital) was further enhanced. The Savoyards just-about stayed on the right side of history during the revolutionary era of 1840-60 and the struggle to unify Italy, and Turin was for four years the country's first capital.
The city became an industrial powerhouse in the 19th century, especially through the automobile industry: "FIAT" stands for Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino, founded here in 1899, and Lancia set up in 1906. These sucked in labour from the poor south, and were subsidised by Mussolini. Turin was heavily bombed by the Allies during World War II but afterwards was restored to its former grandeur as a second Paris.
Car manufacture and other traditional industries withered in the late 20th century, as elsewhere in Europe, and the city became run-down, hollowed out and de-populated. It re-invented itself with new industry, design and services — not least to tourists — and in 2006 hosted the Winter Olympic Games.
The climate of Turin is continental, with cold winters and warm summers. Snow is common in winter and summer thunderstorms are not uncommon either. The wealth of indoor attractions and open spaces make the city a year-round destination.
Tourist information centres are on Piazza Castello (corner with Via Garibaldi, daily 09:00-18:00) and on Piazza Carlo Felice (front of Porta Nuova station, likewise daily 09:00-18:00).
Mole Antonelliana is the city landmark
Turin Airport (TRN IATA) (15 km north of the city). There are international flights to Turin from Amsterdam, Bacau, Barcelona, Berlin (SXF), Birmingham, Bristol, Brussels (BRU & CRL), Bucharest, Casablanca, Chisinau, Copenhagen, Dublin, Edinburgh, Fez, Frankfurt, Gothenburg, Iasi, Ibiza, Kyiv (KBP), Leeds, London (LGW, LTN & STN), Madrid, Malta, Manchester, Marrakesh, Menorca, Moscow (DME), Munich, Mykonos, Palma de Mallorca, Paris (CDG), Skiathos, Seville, Stockholm (ARN), Tirana, Valencia, & Warsaw (WAW). Domestic destinations are Alghero, Bari, Brindisi, Cagliari, Catania, Comiso, Lamezia Terme, Lampedusa, Naples, Olbia, Palermo, Pantelleria, Reggio Calabria, Rome (FCO), and Trapani. Some of these are seasonal, and the airport is especially busy in ski season with travellers to the resorts in Valle d'Aosta and the western Italian Alps. Most flights are with budget airlines such as Ryanair and Blue Air, even for domestic flights, or with ski package operators. There's just a single terminal, easy to navigate, with the usual range of shops airside after security: Heinemann run the duty-free franchise. Departure gates 1-13 are domestic and Schengen, gates 14-22 beyond passport control are non-Schengen. There's a back-up passport control point for gates 19-22, to give the airport flexibility in the allocation of areas, but it's normally empty and you can stroll through to the toilets by gate 22. But there's otherwise no facilities in the non-Schengen area, so don't go through passport control until an hour before your flight. (updated Jan 2024)
To the city: Arriva Bus 268 runs every 15-30 min from the airport to Caselle town, and Turin Porta Susa and Porta Nuova railway stations, taking 40-55 min; some buses extend to Lingotto. Buy your ticket from a kiosk or machine in the arrivals area, for (in 2024) € single or €11 return. If the machines broken, buy on board by bank card; paying by cash costs an extra €1. If you buy a Turin + Piemonte Card (as in "See"), the ride is only €. The bus into the city runs 06:00 to 00:30, and out to the airport at 05:00 to 23:30.
Flibco is a competing bus line, running every 30 min 03:30-23:00. It takes 25 min from the airport via Caselle to Corso Vittorio Emanuele II outside Porta Susa station (stop 5), for a fare of € each way, or 11€ return. Pay by bank card on boarding or at the counter in the terminal building.
Trains run hourly from Caselle-Aeroporto station (west side of the terminal), taking 35 min via Caselle town, Borgaro, Veneria Real, Grosseto and Rebaudengo Fossata to Turin Porta Susa main station. This service no longer runs to Dora. The train fare is €.
By taxi to the city centre is around €40, and a private car transfer €100. There are car hire desks in arrivals: you don't want a car in the city, but do need one to explore the mountains.
Other airports for reaching Turin are Milan Malpensa MXP, Milan Linate LIN, and Bergamo BGY. Of these, Malpensa has the best range of flights, and best onward transport: the SADEM bus runs direct from MXP Terminals 1 & 2 to Turin Porta Susa, hourly 08:00-22:00 and at midnight. The ride lasts 2 hours and costs €22, buy tickets in Malpensa arrival hall or online.
Porta Nuova is the primary train station of Turin and closest station to the center of the city. The station contains 20 platforms and is a terminus station so through-trains will reverse direction. Lots of shops and cafés here, and a left-luggage office open daily 08:00-20:00, charge €6 per bag for five hours. There's even a piano. Porta Nuova is on the Metro, with lots of buses (including the airport bus) stopping outside.
All international and long-distance trains call here, with direct services from Paris Gare de Lyon via Lyon, from Milan (50 min), Aosta (90 min), Genoa (90 min), Bologna (2 hr), Florence (2 hr 45 min), Venice (3 hr 30 min), Rome (4 hr), Naples (6 hr), Bari (8 hr) and by sleeper from Reggio DC (18 hr) for Sicily. From Switzerland, Germany and Austria, change in Milan. Frecciarossa trains rush between Turin and Milan in 50 min for a fare in 2024 of €28, reservations compulsory and they do sell out. If you're not in a hurry, regional trains via Chivasso and Novara take 1 hr 45 min and the fare is only €13.
(Trains from Paris normally take six hours, but the route is blocked by a landslide at Modane in French Savoy. Replacement and workaround routes, e.g., via Annecy, take much longer. This is expected to drag on to summer 2024.)
Porta Susa is Turin's second most important railway station with nine platforms. Generally, all trains destined for Porta Nuova will stop at Porta Susa.
The old Porta Susa station at Piazza XVIII Dicembre is shut and empty, and horse-drawn buses ply there no more. The new station, adjacent south, opened in 2013, a long low steel hangar that looks like it wants to be a garden centre. There are ticket offices and machines, toilets, a café and a convenience store; there's no left luggage facility. There's limited seating and if you have an extended wait, you might be better in one of the nearby bars and cafés. Find these by exiting west onto Corso Inghilterra or going a little north (past the old station) onto Corso San Martino. Porta Susa station is on the Metro line, with a bus terminus (including for the airport bus) outside east on Corso Bolzano.
Lingotto is Turin's third most used train station with 13 platforms, situated well south of the center of the city. The station is located near the Eataly and is a stop for trains heading into the city from Alba, Asti, Chivasso, Chieri, Ciriè, Cuneo, Fossano, Genoa, Pinerolo, Rivarolo and Savona.
You're unlikely to use the outlying stations of Rebaudengo Fossata, Stura, and Grosseto as a tourist, however they do offer service options if you stay in these areas.
Stura is a nine platform station north of the city connected to tram line four.
Rebaudengo Fossata is a five platform station north of the city centre with service solely by local trains of the city.
Grosseto is a two platform station in the north west of the city with service solely by local trains connecting to Ceres.
The principal routes, on toll motorways, are:
A4 from Trieste, Venice, Padua, Verona, Milan and Novara.
From Geneva and northern France via the Mont Blanc Tunnel, then A5 down past Courmayeur, Aosta and Ivrea.
A7 from Genoa to Tortona, then A21 past Alessandria and Asti.
From Lyon and Grenoble in France via the Frejus Tunnel then A32.
Flixbus have direct buses to Turin from Paris (10 hr), Lyon (5 hr), Geneva (4 hr 30), Zürich (6 hr), Munich (9 hr), Ljubljana (10 hr), Zagreb (12 hr) and Budapest (16 hr). Services within Italy are from Genoa (2 hr 30), Bologna (6 hr), Florence (7 hr), Venice (6 hr 30), Trieste (8 hr), Rome (10 hr), Naples (11 hr) and Catania (22 hr). Buses from Milan are about every hour, taking 2 hours, and advance online fares can be as low as 4 euro. Many other destinations can be reached by a single change of bus.
Marinobus have a direct bus from Paris (25 hr) via Frankfurt and Stuttgart.
There's no bus station: long-distance buses pick up and drop off on Corso Vittorio Emanuelle II near the intersection of Corso Inghilterra and Porta Susa railway station. Look out for other travellers clutching their luggage and looking hopeful or anxious.
Turin has an efficient, integrated system of buses, trams and metro all operated by GTT. These run 06:00-00:30, and out of hours there are night buses fanning out from Piazza Vittorio Veneto. Their website has a journey planner and network map.
You must buy your ticket before you get on and validate it as soon as you board. All tabaccherie (tobacconists) sell transport tickets as do some bars and kiosks at stations. There are also vending machines at Metro stations. The standard ticket is the "City + Suburban 100", valid for 100 mins for unlimited bus rides plus one journey on the Metro. In 2024 this costs €2; daily, 48-hr and 72-hr tickets are available for €, € and € respectively. Longer season tickets will need photo ID. The spot fine for travelling with an unvalidated ticket, or without one, is €25.
Bus and tram stops are clearly marked with yellow signs, and display maps of the city routes. There may be electronic indicators at the stop and on board.
Turin Metro, opened in 2006, is a single line, Linea 1, with driverless trains. The south terminus is Bengasi. The line runs north to Lingotto, near the mainline Lingotto train station, the Lingotto Conference, Exhibition & Trade Centre, Eataly and the Automobile Museum. The line continues north under Via Nizza stopping at Spezia, Carducci, Dante, Fermata 8226 and Marconi to Porta Nuova railway station. It there turns west beneath Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II stopping at Re Umberto and Vinzaglio, then north again to Porta Susa railway station and Piazza XVIII Dicembre. It then runs west under Corso Francia into the suburbs, stopping at Principi d'Acaja, Bernini, Racconigi, Rivoli, Monte Grappa, Pozzo Strada, Massaua, Marche, and Paradiso to end at Fermi. Fares are the same as for buses, eg a 100-min single journey including bus transfers is €2, it's automatically validated by passing the platform entrance gates.
As of 2024, a westward extension of Linea 1 and a new Linea 2 are under construction, and Linea 3 is in planning.
Out-of-town: the GTT network and ticket includes the suburbs, but further out it's mostly the blue buses run by Arriva or Sadem. Again, try to buy your ticket before boarding, eg at a tobacconist, café or news stand. Consider also buying the return if you're going to a quiet spot that may lack ticket facilities. You can probably buy your ticket on the bus, but this will cost maybe an extra euro, and the driver will grind his gums if he has to give change.
Metro Rail operates service between Turin and many of the outlying communities. If your destination is one of these towns (which include such sights as the royal estate at Venaria and the mountain town of Bardonecchia), one option is SFM, the metro rail service of Turin. SFM tickets can be bought at the station or through Trenitalia. For more information, check out the Servizio Ferroviario Metropolitano website.
The city has a network of bicycle paths, though they're not all in good condition, and pedestrians will try to claim right of way. On the roads, cars, motor scooters and trams will scythe across your path.
Bike share services are run by Lime and RideMovi; use their Android or iPhone apps to register.
You don't need a car in town, and driving here is not for the faint-hearted. You need to beware the many restricted-entry streets, trams, and other motorists who may regard red lights and speed limits as merely advisory.
A good central parking garage is beneath Piazza Vittorio Veneto is Parcheggio Vittorio Park.
Car rentals: as well as the airport rental kiosks, there are down-town rental offices, e.g., Hertz, just outside Porta Susa train station.
There are three car sharing services in Turin, ShareNow, Enjoy and LeasysGOdead link (which uses 100% electric cars). An electric scooter sharing service is run by MiMotodead link.
Taxis in Torino start the meter the moment your call is received. It is not customary to hail a taxi on the street, but there are taxi ranks at the main railway stations, at the corner of Via Sacchi and Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, and elsewhere. You can also book via the WeTaxi app.
Turin's main attractions include important baroque palaces and churches, an attractive arcade-lined street grid, an extensive network of arcades, famous coffee shops and a several renowned museums. Five palaces in Turin and nine more in the region served as residences for the Savoy royalty and are now inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list.

"The road to Memphis and Thebes passes through Turin" said Egyptologist Jean-François Champollion about Museo Egizio in Turin, second only in order of importance to the one in Cairo. Many artifacts were collected by Bernardino Drovetti (1776 - 1852) when he was consul of France in Egypt. In 1824, King Carlo Felice di Savoia purchased the diplomat's entire collection and housed it in the palace built in the 17th century by design of architect Michelangelo Garove (which was firstly Collegio dei Nobili, then seat of Accademia delle Scienze and still houses the museum).

The Mole, Turin's landmark building built in 1888, was intended as a synagogue but the size and cost got out of hand and the Jewish community never used it. The -metre tower is the highest work of masonry in Europe and you can ride a lift to the cupola at the top. Within it, the National Cinema Museum is a vast exhibition space spiralling up five floors. The themes of the floors are the archaeology of cinema, the video camera, a collection of cinema posters, video installations (with side rooms screening clips), and the Great Temple where you recline in comfy red chairs and watch — or is it worship? — Italian film classics projected on giant screens overhead.

Museum of Criminal Anthropology, Via Pietro Giuria 15, ☏ +39 011 6708195. M-Sa 10:00-18:00. Cesar Lombroso (1835-1909) was convinced that criminality was inherited, little influenced by environment and that criminals could be distinguished by their ugly atavistic features. It therefore followed that any ethnic group that didn't fit Italian concepts of beauty was inferior and should be subjugated. And women should be subjugated by men, as their much lower rate of criminal offending proved that, um, well anyway because they should. When Lombroso met Tolstoy, he rather spoiled the occasion by trying to measure Tolstoy's skull for signs of Slav atavism. His theories greatly suited the far right in Europe but were discredited after the fall of Mussolini. This museum displays his dingbat collection, but perhaps his legacy best lives on in the portrayal of film baddies. (updated Jan 2024)

Museum of the Shroud (Museo della Sindone), Via San Domenico 28, ☏ +39 011 436 5832. Daily 15:00-18:00. The original Sindone or Turin Shroud is in safekeeping in the Cathedral and rarely displayed. This small museum displays a copy and studies the Shroud. It's a remarkable object whatever it is, a  x  m winding sheet charred by fire and appearing to bear the likeness of a man, matching the Gospel description of the crucifixion of Jesus. Multiple tests have produced contradictory results, or at least contradictory interpretations. It's only reliably known to have existed since 1390 when it was denounced as a forgery, and radio-carbon dating matches that. But no deliberate attempt to reproduce it has managed to capture all its qualities, especially the 3D effect of its photo negative, and neither natural nor artificial processes convincingly explain it. So just look and wonder. Adult €8, conc €6. (updated Jan 2024)

In 1706 the French besieged Turin for four months as part of the War of Spanish Succession, which embroiled all major European powers and their colonies. The defending Savoyards had dug 15 km of counter-sapping tunnels, to prevent the French burrowing in. That meant the French could only attack ineffectively from a distance. Pietro Micca sacrificed himself in detonating a tunnel that they were breaking into; a few days later the siege was broken by arriving reinforcements. Nine km of preserved galleries can be visited. Adult €5, conc €3. (updated Jan 2024)

Turin has some 150 churches, so only the most notable are described here. But almost all of them are worth looking into, if you happen to be passing and find them open.
Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Duomo; Cattedrale di San Giovanni Battista), Piazza San Giovanni, ☏ +39 011 436 1540. Daily 09:00-13:00 & 15:00-19:00.

A jewel of baroque architecture and sacred art built from 1680 by businessmen anxious to sanctify their dealings - they were, let's stress, "The Pious Congregation of Bankers, Shopkeepers and Merchants of Turin." One theme of the decor is the Magi, bearing the trade valuables without which the Christian church couldn't exist. The chapel was created within Chiesa dei Santi Martiri, a 16th-century Jesuit church. Its best-known artefact is the "calendario perpetuo" made by Giovanni Amedeo Plana in 1831. This predicts lunar phases, tides, days of the week and Christian holy days for 4000 years from Year Zero (1 BC in the Gregorian calendar); thereafter it's askew as it misses an extra leap-day tweak. It ranks among the world's earliest computers, though pipped by Babbage's "difference engine" of 1822. (updated Jan 2024)
Santa Maria di Monte dei Cappuccini, Piazzale Monte dei Cappuccini (next to Museo Nazionale della Montagna), ☏ +39 011 660 4414. Daily 07:30-19:30. A late-Renaissance-style church on a hill overlooking the River Po. It was built 1583 to 1656 for the Capuchin Friars; the delay was through plague and the occasional war. A miracle supposedly occurred in 1640 during the French assault on Turin, when troops seizing the church were repulsed by a sheet of holy flame from the tabernacle. They slew all the defenders anyhow, no doubt in a faith-affirming sort of way. Cannonballs stuck in the walls recall the assaults of 1706 and 1799. Free. (updated Jan 2024)

Rosa Vercellana (1833-1885) became the mistress of the future Victor Emmanuel II and had two children by him before she was 16. She was made a countess when his legitimate wife and queen died in 1855, and in 1869 when the king thought he himself might die, he hurriedly married Rosa. It was a morganatic marriage, so it conferred no crown or right of succession on her or her children. He survived to do the same thing over in 1877, likewise morganatic, then died. His Savoy dynasty wouldn't let this upstart floozie be buried next to him, so here lies La Bela. The neoclassical building was handed over to the city in 1970 but vandalised and fell derelict; it was restored in 2005 and now houses a public library. Free. (updated Jan 2024)

Casa Scaccabarozzi is an odd building at Via Giulia di Barolo 9, corner with Coro San Maurizio, nicknamed Fetta di Polenta for its resemblance to a thin yellow slice of polenta. It was built from 1840 when the Vanchiglia district was laid out, designed by Alessandro Antonelli the architect of Mole Antonelliana. It narrows to a pinch of 54 cm, little more than a street facade, even a flatiron building has a plumper tip. It's now a private residence so you can't go in, and be grateful you don't have to live here.

Built as a royal hunting lodge from 1675, this grew and grew into a humonguous bling palace, trying to outshine Versailles.

Restoration was piecemeal until 1996, then a ten-year project brought it back to its former baroque opulence.

The "hunting lodge" grew into such a vast palace that what was needed was a new hunting lodge.

Wild boar, deer and rare breeds of horse roam the park, which has multiple access points. In the 20th century it acquired a golf course and a motor-racing track.

The hilltop castle was built around 900 AD but from the 17th century had so many incomplete extensions, abandoned or wrecked by the French, that owners and architects risked being driven mad. One who did go mad was King Victor Amadeus II (1666-1732), who horrified noble society by publicly marrying his mistress here; he was deposed and incarcerated within the castle to stop him declaring war on Milan or Poland or heaven knows where. The building later became a barracks but fell derelict until restored in the 1980s. It's now a museum of contemporary art. Adult €10, conc €. (updated Jan 2024)

Pickpocket warning sign in Porta Nuova train station
Turin is generally safe. But the top end of Via Nizza, flanking Porta Nuova railway station, can be seedy or even dangerous in the small hours. The nearby San Salvario area (Via Nizza to Parco del Valentino) is lively, going on raucous, but attracts drug peddlers and similar low-life. The areas between Porta Palazzo and the Dora River can be dangerous at night.
As in other European cities, beware pickpockets in any busy place, especially if you have luggage or backpacks.
Don't wear a football shirt or other club colours, unless you've come mob-handed with thousands of fellow supporters. Any Italian or major European club colours will be a red rag to the young bulls of either Juventus (black and white) or Torino (brownish red) or both. In particular, avoid wearing the jersey of Milanese club Internazionale, as they have a very heated rivalry with local club Juventus, and violent confrontations have been known to occur between the supporters of both clubs.
Always contact your main embassy first - something serious like a stolen passport will be handled there not in Turin.
