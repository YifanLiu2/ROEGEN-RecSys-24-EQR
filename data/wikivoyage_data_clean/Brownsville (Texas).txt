Located at the southernmost tip of Texas, Brownsvilledead link is a popular location for Mexican and American beach tourists. It is part of the Rio Grande Valley, a four-county region known for its abundance in citrus fruit production and Winter Texan population. The city features a combination of different climate regimes: Gulf Coast plains and the Great Plains. There is a lot to do in this city: historical museums, art galleries, beaches, birding locations and natural wildlife refuges. As Brownsville is a border town, its culture is predominantly Hispanic.
Birdwatching is a very popular leisure activity in Brownsville.
Brownsville sits in the southernmost tip of Texas, is a border town and is also bordered by the Gulf Coast. These qualities make Brownsville a thriving city in the manufacturing industry. For this reason, Brownsville adopted the motto, "On the Border, By the Sea" in 1966. Since the early 1990s, the city has experienced a steel boom, leading to fast population growth. The area had around 98,000 residents in 1990, and has grown to 183,000 as of 2016.
Despite being in Texas, Brownsville doesn't live up to the common stereotypes of most Texas cities (western, rural). Instead, it has its own distinct culture. One common thing to notice about Brownsville is that it is influenced by the behavior of South Padre Island residents (laid-back, casual). The presence of an island so near to Brownsville has rubbed off on the locals.
Culturally, Brownsville's residents are predominantly Hispanic. It's common to hear people mix Spanish and English in their speech given the presence of Mexico being so close to Brownsville. For this reason, the city holds many festivals and parades celebrating the traditions from Mexico that have been integrated into American culture.
As you make the drive from Kingsville, you will start to see an abundance in palm trees. The area is known to tourists as "The Green City" for having more lush, green vegetation and plants than other cities in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas. Sabal palms are dotted all around the city. The city has a strong focus on greener resources. Wind turbines, bike trails and solar panels are becoming more common in the Brownsville area.
The sunrises and sunsets in Brownsville are quite exquisite. Be sure to grab your camera and snap photos of these events. The area is known colloquially as the "Sunrise Capital of South Texas".
What many do not know about Brownsville is how rich in history the city actually is. It has been named the second-most historic city in the state of Texas, after San Antonio. Brownsville was part of many significant battles during the Mexican-American and Civil War. The Siege of Fort Texas and the Battle of Palo Alto were both fought between Brownsville and Matamoros. Major Jacob Brown (not to be confused with hero Jacob Brown in the War of 1812) has many sites and buildings dedicated to his name. For this reason, you will find many streets in the Mitte Cultural District named after important figures in American history.
Major Zachary Taylor (who later became the 12th president of the United States), played a crucial role in the Battle of Palo Alto. This marked the first major battle that started the Mexican-American War. Taylor's army successful defeated the Mexican forces on May 8th, 1846, with American troops suffering few casualties, compared to the Mexican side.
The city was also the site of the First Cortina Troubles, a war between Mexican rancher Juan Nepomuceno Cortina and American forces. Fighting emerged after a Brownsville marshal shot a former ranch hand of Cortina's. Cortina then took control of Brownsville for more than two months after many residents in Matamoros urged Cortina to evacuate the whole town. The fighting extended all the way to Starr County, in what is referred to as the Battle of Rio Grande City.
Things were relatively quiet in the city until troops took control of Brownsville, this time by Confederates after they found out the city was smuggling their goods into Mexico. This led to the Battle of Brownsville, during which the Confederates blew up more than 8,000 lbs of explosives. A month later, the Battle of Palmito Ranch was fought and won by Confederates.
Several decades later, the Brownsville Affair occurred. This was a racial conflict between black infantrymen stationed at Fort Brown and white townsfolk. After several white police officers and a bartender were shot, president Theodore Roosevelt discharged the regiment for "conspiracy of silence." During the 1970s, an investigation led by the Nixon Administration found that the black infantrymen were not guilty of the crime and had any dishonorable discharge reversed.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
The weather in Brownsville can get very hot during the summer months. Temperatures in the low to mid 90s are not uncommon to see. While the city rarely sees temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C), the humidity makes heat indices go up to 105 °F (41 °C). Temperatures will rise above 90 from May through September. Winters are usually not felt with the exception of a short cold snap or cold front that comes by. Usually, these events don't last too long.
As in most of South Texas, snow is a rare event. The previous snowfall that didn't melt right away happened in 2004, which coincidentally occurred during Christmas Eve, making it the first White Christmas in the city, and a similar snow event happened in 2017. Brownsville had not witnessed such a snow event since the late 1800s. The number of days with temperatures below freezing varies from year to year. Some years will lack a freeze event while others will bring several days of ice to the area. Make sure you bring a thin sweater when visiting during January or February, when the temperatures tend to drop more frequently.
While hurricanes tend to be a threat to Brownsville, most come in weaker categories than those that hit other nearby states. This is due to the Yucatan Peninsula acting as a barrier for storms that travel from the south to north. A 'major' hurricane to make landfall in the area was Hurricane Dolly in 2008, which left mostly moderate damage to weak structures and flooding.

With the addition of two hypermarkets at close proximity from each other, several chain restaurants and retail stores have moved into the area.
Pablo Kisel Blvd/Morrison Rd is the new commercial hot spot in Brownsville. Many national eateries and retailers have either moved from previous locations or have set up shop for the first time here. There are also many hotels in a short walking distance. Much of the success of both streets is owed to the proximity of the mall and the expressway.
Boca Chica Blvd is known regionally as "Four Corners" for its wide street lanes meeting with another major artery in the city. The intersection has shaped all four sides to look like corners.

Brownsville's local restaurant scene has become more exciting, with La Southmost in particular receiving statewide and even national media attention for the quality and diversity of its tacos. Most of the eateries mentioned are newly constructed or have operated for a couple of years. Mexican is the most popular, as is Tex-Mex and seafood but different options have been introduced such as Italian and Thai cuisines. Coordinate points are approximate, not exact. The bold names divide each section based on highly commercial areas in Brownsville.
For tourists in the mood for authentic Mexican food, it is best to locate a restaurant in the Mitte Cultural District or La Southmost. Since those parts of town are closer to Mexico, there is a stronger chance of finding these kinds of eateries, not to mention the countless number of taquerias (or taco stands) in the city. Just be aware that the restaurant staff may not speak much English, and same for the menus. As Boca Chica is the main road leading to Boca Chica Beach, more seafood restaurants tend to be found here. Ruben M. Torres is a central part of the city, which has built several restaurants along its resacas, giving locals and tourists the option to dine by these water bodies. The northern portion of Brownsville, referred to as Pablo Kisel/Morrison, features more fine-dining restaurants, since it happens to be the wealthier part of town.

Despite Brownsville's reputation as a border town, the city is relatively safe. According to an FBI report conducted in early 2015, the Brownsville-Harlingen metropolitan area ranked last in a list of most dangerous cities. This makes Brownsville the safest metro area in Texas.
As long as you stay in the more commercial side of town and take precautions you will be safe. It is advised not to travel to Downtown around midnight. Most of the area is quiet and lonely around this time, raising the chances of theft or robberies. You should also lock your car when shopping, especially at night. While the city rarely experiences any major crimes, petty crimes like attempted robbery or vandalism are quite common.
If you are a victim of a crime or see one, please report it by calling the Brownsville Police Department at ☏ +1 956 548-7000 or 911. Their main building is at 600 E Jackson St.
It is important to understand how close Brownsville is to Mexico. When making a call or walking or driving around Downtown Brownsville or near the international bridges, expect your phone to change cell provider. Several Mexican cellphone providers that end up appearing in American phones include Telcel and Movistar. Locals have observed their phone changing cell phone provider throughout many parts of the city. If this happens to you, do not panic. It is very common for this to occur. A change in cell provider does not indicate Roaming is activated and it will not lead to overcharges in your account. This goes for any cell phone provider that operates in the United States.
Several hotels listed here provide free Wi-Fi service, as do many local and chain restaurants.
