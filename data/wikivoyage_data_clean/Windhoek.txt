Windhoek is Namibia's capital and largest city (population 430,000 in 2020). It is in the geographic centre of the country at an elevation of 1,600m. This is the city where most safaris travelling through Namibia begin, and also the first point of entry in Namibia should you arrive by airplane.

The city was spelled Windhuk during the German colonial time and is sometimes still referred to as such in German. The name is pronounced wind-hook, as "oe" in Dutch and Afrikaans is pronounced like "u" in German.
English is spoken throughout Namibia (it is the country's official language and is also the medium of instruction in most schools), although in many urban areas Afrikaans (similar to Dutch) is used as a lingua franca, as 50% of the Namibian population speak Afrikaans. German is widely used in tourism. Oshiwambo is spoken by 50% of Namibians as a mother tongue.
Radio and television are also predominantly in English.
Other languages include Otjiherero, Damara/Nama, Setswana, SiLozi, and Rukwangali.

The B1, which runs from the north to the south and the B2 (Trans-Kalahari) which runs from the east to the west through Namibia are the primary land routes into Windhoek. Northern towns served by the B1 include Oshakati, Otjiwarongo, and Okahanja. Southern towns include Rehoboth, Keetmanshoop and Lüderitz. From the west the B2 connects Swakopmund and from the east it connects Gobabis.
This is the easiest way to get to Windhoek for people without a car. Minibuses run from everywhere in Namibia, and through some combination of different routes, one can always find their way to Windhoek. The Engen petrol station north of downtown (Rhino Park) is the rank for southern and western destinations such as Mariental, Swakopmund, Keetmanshoop. For northern destinations such as Otjiwarongo, Oshakati and Rundu go to Hakahana Service Station, Katutura. However, it is easier to arrange for a minibus to take you (check opposite SAA in Independence Avenue).
If you're arriving in Namibia by airplane, this is most likely to be via Hosea Kutako International Airport. It's a relatively small airport, with a handful of gates and no aerobridges. Airside there are a few souvenir shops, and a bistro with fairly average food in a large common waiting hall for all flights. Landside there is a nice cafe outside of departures with good coffee, burgers, toasties and at reasonable prices. There is an official taxi booth landside in arrivals. Even though the airport is small, the queues can still be fairly long for security and immigration clearance - both incoming and outgoing. Car hire is available at the airport with all the majors. The airport is approximately 45 km (28 mi) out of town, so give yourself plenty of time to travel to the city centre. A taxi to the city will be about N$300 per person and will drop you at your doorstep. If you are travelling in a group you can negotiate a bulk price. For a similar price you can probably book a transfer through your hotel to be met at the arrivals. The road between the city and the airport is tarred, but there are no services. Fuel is available at the airport and in the city - there is not much between. Watch for baboons and other wildlife if you are driving in Namibia for the first time.

Travelling between international and domestic airport will take about half a day, due to customs, passport control, road time, and another check-in. Luggage will not be routed from one airport to another!
TransNamib, via their StarLine passenger service, operates trains from Windhoek to a few destinations in Namibia. All trains depart in the late afternoon or early evening (between 16:00 and 20:00) at a time when the ticket office is already closed. You cannot buy a ticket on the train; in fact, you cannot enter the platform without a ticket. Trains are scheduled 2-5 times per week, depending on destination and season, on the following routes:
Windhoek-Keetmanshoop; this train used to split and continue on to Upington in South Africa and Lüderitz on the Atlantic coast, but no longer does so.
These are not dedicated passenger trains but convey passengers via special coaches hooked on the back of freight trains. They are therefore a relatively slow method of transport, as the train will stop at every tree to hook and unhook freight wagons. The trip Windhoek-Swakopmund (360 kilometres (220 mi) by road) takes a scheduled 9 hours, the 500 kilometres (310 mi) trip to Keetmanshoop takes almost a day. Tickets are cheap, even in business class, and the passenger coaches are comfortable and have an airline-style seating. Their air-conditioning, video entertainment, and vending machines are not often operational. Most trains travel at night; bring a sleeping bag against the cold.
The Desert Express is a luxury tourist train that traverses Namibia regularly, taking tourists to such destinations as Walvis Bay, Swakopmund and Etosha National Park. Buses are used to transport visitors from train stations to the various sights.

Book a few days in advance at least to be sure that you have a seat.
Most hotels and hostels are close to the city centre, so you can easily walk to most shops, restaurants, clubs and sights. After dark it is not safe to walk, though.
Traffic in Windhoek generally flows freely, and driving is generally well ordered. Parking garages are located in the shopping centres and some street parking is available too.
There are a number of car rental agencies operating in Windhoek:

There is no scheduled public transport in Windhoek but there is a system of shared taxis that do not have fixed routes. Everybody in the taxi is driven to their intended destination, in the order the driver thinks is best. Taxis have their registration number, a letter and up to three digits, prominently displayed. Taxis looking for passengers will hoot. To catch a taxi, point your hand into the direction you want to travel. Once the driver stops, tell him your destination. If it is not en route to his other passengers' destinations, he might refuse. Just wave down the next taxi.
As these taxis primarily run between the townships and the main industrial/commercial areas of the city, it can be difficult to find one in posh suburbs at night; during the day domestic workers take a taxi there. The standard fare for destinations that are on the "route" or close to the route is N$12, destinations more "out of the way" are charged double. After midnight every tour costs double, and people recognisable as tourists will generally not travel for the normal fee. If the driver says nothing about the price, give N$12.
Shared taxis are generally in bad condition, and their operators' aggressive driving is legendary. If you feel uncomfortable with that, there are radio taxis (on-demand) that do not pick up other passengers while they drive you. Most of these taxis have to be pre-booked via telephone; they'll come and get you wherever you are. They tend to gather at popular restaurants and nightspots. Make sure you agree on the price before taking them; most will ask for at least N$80 to go anywhere around Windhoek. These taxis also can take you out of Windhoek and to the airport.

Dictator street names Although Namibia isn't a dictatorship, there are a few dictators with whom Namibia's first president was quite friendly during the days of the struggle for independence (and still is). There are two in Windhoek, both downtown: Fidel Castro St. and Robert Mugabe Ave.

The circular stained-glass window in the facade and all the other stained-glass windows in the church were donated by Kaiser Wilhelm II, as a gift to the colony.

Due to its high elevation of about 1,600 m you can be sunburnt easily, even on the (few) cloudy days. Wear a hat and sunscreen.
Windhoek is not within the endemic malaria area. The mosquitoes can still be a pest during rainy season (Nov-April). Repellents are available at every supermarket.
Windhoek is generally safe for tourists but the usual precautions should be taken. Do not walk around displaying jewellery or electronics. Take a radio taxi at night. Do not visit the townships unaccompanied, or after dark. The city centre is not very big and newly arriving tourists are quickly spotted by aggressive beggars who like to start conversions like "Kommen Sie aus Deutschland?", thereby targeting, and taking by surprise, the many German visitors. Just ignore them.
Be careful with the traffic. Many drivers ignore red lights, zebra crossings, and a lot more. For a car that wants to turn, a green pedestrian traffic light means nothing, and generally people in cars are deemed to be more important than people on foot, and therefore have the right of way.
