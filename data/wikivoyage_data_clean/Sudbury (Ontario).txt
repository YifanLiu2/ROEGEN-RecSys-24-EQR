Sudbury (official name Greater Sudbury) is a city of approximately 166,000 people, in Northern Ontario, Canada. It is Northern Ontario's largest city in both area and population, and a major retail and service centre for the region.
Sudbury, officially "Greater Sudbury" (or Grand Sudbury in French), is an amalgamated city of smaller cities and towns spread over a large region. By land area, Sudbury is the largest city in Ontario and the fifth largest in Canada. The name Sudbury can refer to both the greater area encompassing urban communities, rural countryside and wilderness as well as the former city which includes the City's downtown. More than half of the region's population lives in the former city; the remaining residents call smaller communities home. The city is now the economic and service hub for the eastern half of Northern Ontario.
International visitors to Sudbury will feel right at home with vibrant Italian, Finnish, Ukrainian, French, Polish and Aboriginal communities. You can expect to hear many of these languages spoken regularly, though almost all residents speak English as well, and all city services are available in French and English. Road signs and street names are also posted in both official languages. The city celebrates its multicultural heritage on the  Bridge of Nations, a downtown structure featuring the flags of every nation represented among the city's population.
The rough landscape was long considered inhospitable. For thousands of years, this was the territory of the Atikameksheng Anishnawbek (descendants of the Ojibway, Algonquin and Odawa Nations). Unlike the Ojibway territory further south, shorter growing seasons north of the great lakes forced families to adapt to the resources available in each season, fishing the many lakes and rivers in the summer months, and hunting deer and moose through the winter. The wigwam was the typical dwelling used in this area, and constructed using birch bark which made the structures lightweight and easy to disassemble and relocate as necessary.
Many early settlers in the area were of French descent, and the Jesuits founded Sainte-Anne-des Pins in 1883 to serve missionaries travelling further west and new communities along the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway corridor under construction at the time. The church was influential as Francophone immigrants arrived to the area in the following years, and Sudbury remains an important city for Franco-Ontarian culture.
Few people likely expected the area to change drastically once construction of the railway was complete; crews would move their camps to the next site, and leave the communities to grow at the same pace as other railway towns on the Canadian Shield, perhaps taking advantage of the new railway to serve the timber industry. However, blasting during railway construction revealed significant concentrations of ore. The first mine,  Murray Mine , extracted nickel and copper starting in 1889. The town was established in 1894 and named after Sudbury, Suffolk, England. By the 1900s, mining dominated the region's economy, and the town grew according to the boom-and-bust demand for nickel.
Most ore resources are found around the rim of the "Sudbury Basin"(locally, "The Valley"). It wasn't until the 1970's that geologists confirmed these uniquely rich mineral resources are the result of a meteorite impact  billion years ago. The Valley is actually the world's third largest impact crater; more recent evidence suggests that it may have been created by an asteroid or comet up to 15 km ( mi) wide.
Sudbury was known as "the Nickel capital of the world" for most of the twentieth century, but the economy began to diversify starting in the 1980s. The majority of residents are now employed in the service sectors, by local universities, or the local and provincial governments. The city has a somewhat outdated reputation as an environmental wasteland, due to lasting environmental damage from the mining industry, but various reclamation projects since the 1970s have given many parts of the city a rugged natural beauty that capitalizes on the region's many lakes, forests and rocky hills.
Sudbury's weather is typical of locations on the Canadian Shield, with hot summers and cold winters. The city is particularly renowned for its outdoor recreation opportunities, with both summer and winter activities being quite popular.

Fun in the Sun: Sudbury is a city of lakes, in fact holding over 300 lakes within its borders, including Lake Wanapitei, the largest city-contained lake in the world, and Lake Ramsey, the central lake within the city. No matter where in town you happen to be, it's never more than a short walk to a beach. The City of Greater Sudbury has five supervised beaches with professional lifeguards during the summer, but there are uncountable smaller beaches with nothing but sand and water.
Watersports: Fishing is a popular activity in the summer. Species of trout, splake, pike, pickerel, muskie and bass can be found in most of Sudbury's lakes. Be sure to inquire about seasons and licenses before heading out on the water. Some lakes (especially the urban lakes) have strict guidelines for operating watercraft. Be sure to ask about them before launching a boat.
Snowmobiling: Sudbury has one of the largest systems of groomed trails in the world. The Sudbury Trail Plan connects to the trail systems of other communities, creating a network of 1300 km of trails. Contact the Sudbury Trail Plan Association for more information (☏ +1 705-693-7669), as they are considered the authority on trail closures, maintenance, and the monitoring of lake ice.
Hiking: The Trans-Canada Trail runs through Sudbury. The trail twists along the shores of Junction Creek through much of the city. Put on some good shoes and stroll through Sudbury's "urban wilderness".
Enjoy the View: Huge rocky hills cut through Sudbury, dividing the city into its boroughs. These hills remain largely undeveloped to this day. One can hike to the top of these "mountains" and enjoy a panoramic view of the city. Geology buffs can scour the black bedrock for shatter cones: the remnants of a meteorite impact millions of years ago which created the Sudbury Basin.
Golfing: Greater Sudbury offers a wide selection of 9- and 18-hole golf courses including Blackstone Golf Course +1-800-440-2887, Buck Ridge Golf Course +1 705-853-2825, Lively Golf and Country Club +1 705-692-5502, Pine Grove Golf Course +1 705-560-1090, Timberwolf Golf Club +1-877-689-8853 and Twin Stacks Golf Course +1 705-694-2131.
Winter Sports: Winters are very long in Sudbury, but they certainly aren't boring. Be sure to try some of the following winter activities:
Skiing: There are two downhill skiing facilities in Sudbury; the Adanac Ski Hill and Lively Ski Hill. Ski rentals are available at both locations. If cross-country is more your style, the 23 km Naughton Ski Trails run through a quiet forest. The tracks are groomed regularly and the trail is illuminated at night. Call the Walden Ski Club for passes. There are numerous other groomed ski trails in and around town as well.
Ice Fishing: Fishing is not limited to the summer. All you need is a hook, some fishing line and an ice auger to enjoy this popular winter pastime. There is usually enough ice on Sudbury lakes to support a truck, so don't worry about falling through the ice! Be sure to enquire about licenses before heading out. Local bait shops can issue temporary fishing permits. Ice fishing huts must be off of the ice by March 1st.
Skating: Science North has cleared and polished an ice skating surface from their grounds to the Bell Park beach area (about  km). Use of this ice surface is free of charge. There are numerous hockey rinks and skating ovals in and around town, so grab your hockey sticks and try to join a game!
Also, have fun at the local rink at Carol Richard Park, in Val Caron! Join up with other locals to play some good, old-fashioned rink hockey, or if no one is playing, feel free to skate around. There is a small kids rink outside of the boards of the main rink, meant for toddlers and pre-teens (or for those inexperienced at skating, or who may not want to play hockey on the larger rink), and there is also a playground area, too. As well, there is a shack to get changed (and warm up), and it is surrounded by the beautiful wilderness, of snow-covered trees and a nice neighbourhood
Sliding: Sudbury's rocky terrain is excellent for sliding. If you have small children, this is a great activity that the whole family can enjoy. Hills range from small hills to near-suicidal mountains complete with jumps. Sliding areas are not well advertised, so the best way to find them is to befriend a local, or look for a place on the side of the highway where cars are parked for no apparent reason. Another great place to go sliding is Queen's Athletic Field in downtown Sudbury. It has a large oval skating surface, and a medium-sized sliding hill, appropriate for both younger and older kids. There's also a nice warm hut for putting skates on.
Hockey: Sudbury Wolves-A member of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), a junior league that supplies players for the NHL and minor league teams. The Wolves play at the downtown arena during the months of October to April.
