Manaus is a metropolis of Brazil with about  million inhabitants in the center of the Amazon rainforest. Traveling to Manaus means taking a trip to the Amazon: there are countless jungle hotels that offer a huge variety of tours, from more adventurous to more relaxing, such as walking in the jungle, fishing, visiting riverside communities, alligator spotting, tree climbing, rappelling, and bototherapy. In the center of Manaus there are several monuments, historic buildings, churches, a large number of museums, and numerous Belle Époque buildings still preserved and spread throughout the region.
Its name means Mother of Gods in the indigenous language. Two rivers run side by side for many miles of different colors, running together: the "Meeting of Waters". Legend has it that they never mix.
The wealth of the primeval forest becomes visible first of all in the architecture of the city. The city enriched and the rubber barons afforded big European luxury such as the Amazonas Opera House. Other monuments from this epoch are the Mercado Municipal, and the arts center Palacio Rio Negro, located among fascinating Portuguese façades. Today Manaus is a foreign trade zone. Foreign enterprises pay no import duties here, guaranteeing a certain income for the city and the region. Electronics, wood industry and oil refineries have settled in the outskirts in industrial areas. The harbour is the most important trading center for the care of the city with regional, national and international products.
The city is pleasant and friendly, although quite hot, and is still a major port, and a good starting point for river tours.
The Rio Negro (northern) branch of the Amazon is the color of strong tea, peaty brown and its comparative acidity means few mosquitoes. At Manaus the Amazon rises and falls almost twenty meters between seasons. In May and June it's at its peak, full and very wide, spreading way out into the trees. In November and December it's low; still massive but with sandbars.
Of all cities you can reach when voyaging along the Amazon River, Manaus is by far the most expensive.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
In the heart of one of the most humid tropical forests in the world, expect a lot of heat and humidity in Manaus. Average temperatures in Manaus tend to exceed 30º C (86º F), but with a greater thermal sensation, due to humidity. In September, temperatures often reach 40º C (104º F).
Manaus does not have winter, summer, spring or autumn; there are only two seasons in the city: a rainy season (from December to May), with long periods of continuous rain and frequent thunderstorms that fill the rivers, forming igapós (forests flooded by rivers, similar to swamps), and a season drought (from June to November), when it still rains, but to a lesser extent. At that time, the rivers lower the waters and begin to form beaches on the banks.
Regardless of the time you visit, it is recommended to wear light clothes and an umbrella to protect yourself from showers and high temperatures.
Manaus International Airport / Eduardo Gomes (MAO IATA) (The airport is some 15 km by road from the city centre). The airport is modern and clean, and the airside has many 24h shops. Flights on the wee hours are common at this airport, and some passengers overnight there. (updated Nov 2019)
Manaus is over  km from São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro which takes about four hours by air. Coming from North America or Europe, if you can't get a direct flight, the best option price- and route-wise is probably to connect in Fortaleza FOR IATA, the international hub of Northern Brazil (and it might be considerably cheaper to buy an international ticket to Fortaleza and independent domestic one from Fortaleza to Manaus).
Miami: daily with American Airlines and once a week with Latam
Orlando: once a week with Gol Linhas Aéreas
Panama City: 4 days a week with Copa Airlines
Brazil flagship airlines Latam, Gol and Azul have frequent direct flights to major Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Brasília, as well as regional capitals, and Azul also flies to the triple border town of Tabatinga. Regional airline Mapoperates a turboprop fleet to towns such as Tefé, Parintins, Altamira and Porto Trombetas.
From the airport to the region of the Amazonas Theater, city bus line 306 costs R$ 3,80 and line 813 with aircon costs R$ 4,20 (the latter are similar to minivans and you'll feel cramped if carrying big luggage). A similar ride costs around R$ 20 on mobile hailing car apps when no surge factor is in place, and R$ 52 by conventional taxis (as at April 2019).
Manaus is a major destination for boats on the Amazon River. From Belém on the Atlantic Coast, it takes about five days. Boats go to Porto Velho two-three times per week. Tabatinga on the border with Colombia can also be reached by boat from Manaus, with connections further on to Iquitos in Peru. For finding boat connections between Tabatinga and Manaus Navegam covers this route. If you want to save a few hours on your way to Colombia or Peru, ask the according boat company if they stop in Manacapuru, so you can take the boat from there.
Due to road conditions, there is very little (if any) long-distance bus service originating from major cities in Brazil. There are daily buses to Boa Vista in the north and to destinations in Venezuela. The bus from Caracas in Venezuela takes about 36 hours, but it is air-conditioned, has comfortable reclining seats and a toilet.
Manaus is very big in area, its urban part sprawling some 400 km2 (150 sq mi) (versus 100 km2 (39 sq mi) for Paris or 200 km2 (77 sq mi) for Buenos Aires). If you plan to move around the city independently, it's important to find accommodation either downtown or close to the main axis of Av. Constantino Neves and Av. Djalma Batista.
The main city transit option is buses, and the fare is R$  (April/2019). One can change buses free of charge at the city terminals T1, T2, T3 and T4, or use a city bus card to board a second bus within  hr free of charge. To get a card, visit one of SINETRAM offices - the first card for each person is free, then R$ 15.
There is a system of city bikes called MANÔbike, but it's only available downtown where distances are walkable. Besides, Manaus is somewhat hilly and inconvenient for most uncommitted riders.

You can book a dedicated tour for this, but when you enter/leave Manaus by boat towards Santarém/Belém, you will see it much better from the upper deck of that boat. It's about 30 to 60 minutes downstream from Manaus on a slow boat and you can easily spot it in advance due to the water being much brighter. Also in this area is a community of floating houses called Catalão that some tour operators may include as a cultural part of a package.

Capela de Santo Antônio, Av. Borba, 450.

There are a number of companies operating jungle adventure trips from Manaus, but only a few seem to be more established and reputable. First you need to check if the Tour Operator has a valid Embratur (Brazilian Tourism Board) registry. Then you make up your mind what you really want.
You need to travel at least 100 km from Manaus to see virgin rain forest and the wild life you are looking for.
There are basically two main areas which you can explore: the Rio Negro basin and the South of Rio Amazonas. Both of these regions are (sparsely) inhabited, so you will not be completely isolated from civilization. If you want to make a trip to a reserve or a remote area, ask for a special expedition package and plan to pay much more and spend a few days for the transfer to and from the reserve. Rio Negro is an area that is great for the jungle vegetation and for the lack of mosquitoes (due to the acidity of the river). Unfortunately, the lack of mosquitoes means there are a lot fewer animals that live there. The South of Rio Amazonas is a network of rivers, lakes and channels. There are mosquitoes and wildlife, however, there are quite a lot of houses and farms—and thus civilization is a lot more visible. Most tours go to or through lake Mamori. There are quite a lot of jungle things to see around the lake, but do not expect pristine nature due to all the farming going on around the lake. There is a reserve nearby called Jurara. It also seems to be inhabited and there is not much difference between the reserve and lake Mamori. A better option may be a trip to lake Juma which is a special protected area.
There are two seasons in the Amazon basin: wet season and dry season. During the dry season it's very hot (that means 40 °C plus the humidity) and thus may be unbearable for some. As well, many channels and rivers dry out. On the other hand, fishing is much easier since all fish concentrates in the remaining water basins. During the wet season, it rains almost every day. When there is a storm, the amount of rain may be overwhelming. Thus, if traveling in wet season, be prepared to get wet and not dry out until the end of your trip. During the season the rivers and lakes rise several meters and many new channels are formed in the flooded jungle. Temperature-wise, the weather is more bearable and only the humidity will be a problem. The wet season lasts roughly January to July, with the best time to visit the jungle May to August.
If you travel during the wet season, keep your important things like documents in (tested) waterproof bags/containers. Cotton clothes let your skin breathe but there is no chance that they will ever get dry. Some people find nylon/synthetic clothes to work well. Long sleeves and long pants are not 100% necessary but you will not regret wearing them. A flashlight is necessary for the night, as the jungle is pitch-black. A machete most probably will not be required on short/casual trips but is essential for longer expeditions. A lighter and a pocket knife are a good idea. The pocket knife is especially important since
it can provide the only defense against the boa and the anaconda (indeed, attacks do occur). A mosquito repellent is most probably a very smart idea. It keeps other bugs away too and it reduces the risk of being infected by a disease-carrying insect. However, the number of mosquitoes in the jungle is not completely overwhelming, so for longer expeditions you may consider getting used to them. Additionally, a good guide can show you some natural repellents available in the jungle. Sun block is needed especially during the dry season. Otherwise, keep your luggage to the minimum. Do not take things you do not really need.
native people - people who live in the region. Most of the time that means of Portuguese descent. These are not aboriginal inhabitants.
native guide - a guide who is a native (see native people). If at all, usually speaks only marginal English.
Do not buy tours from people at the airport or on the street in Manaus. The best guides are hired by the best companies; the best shysters don’t work for the best companies. If you don’t want to book a tour before arriving and want to book a tour in Manaus use a reputable published guidebook first or just look for the official tourist information center (CAT), they'll help you out and even make free calls if required. Tour companies are relatively easy to find in downtown Manaus and many will meet you at no charge.
The tour companies (even the ones in Lonely Planet) tend to trick the tourists sometimes, they ask you "may I do the reservation?" if you say yes and later cancel they will want to charge you 25%. It is not legal unless they let you know about it and make you sign something, so remain alert. Ask other tour operators to check prices.
If you take a river tour, go up the Rio Negro. From a three-night river boat trip from Manaus up the Rio Negro with a guide, you can expect to see some wildlife and visit some of the forest remnants, but two weeks or more are needed to reach untouched areas. Small two-story river boats carry five to ten people, sleeping in hammocks on the upper deck. Large boats carrying hundreds ply the river too, but the big boats don't stop between ports. The most popular place for jungle tours is Lake Mamori/Lake Juma about 100 km south of Manaus. Other recommended areas are Rio Urubu about 200 km east of and Novo Airão about 100 km northwest of Manaus.
Make sure that your travel agency has a valid Embratur (Brazilian Tourism Board) registration.

Porao do Alemao, Estrada da Ponta Negra 1986, São Jorge. Mostly rock, excellent snacks. Entry fee.
Tuesdays(!) and Fridays have hundreds and hundreds of people gather at a string of drinking shacks known as Calçadão da Suframa. Some have live music, often forró. One spot is Casa do Terror, a cobwebbed hole-in-the-wall where a shirtless Cearense in a cowboy hat spins old LPs of boleros and bregas.
Crocodillo (Centro) is a dance club with decent music and reasonable drink prices.
Festivals Festivals are usually held in the Sambódromo, a huge stadium on Rua Constantino Nery. Carnaval is held here as well as many other festivals, including Manaus’s popular Boi.
Gay: The two main clubs are Humps and A2, both located in the city centre.

The climate is very hot and humid. Packing thin, light-colored clothing will help you suffer the least during the day. Locals are often seen using umbrellas as sun-protection while walking the streets, and you should consider doing the same.
Do take yellow fever vaccination at least 10 days before landing in the Amazon region. One shot of this vaccine offers lifelong protection.
Manaus and the nearby jungle regions most tourists visit on 2- to 5-day tours are relatively malaria-free, so one should ponder carefully if the benefit of malaria drugs offset the many inconveniences. Malaria drugs are known to cause lack of energy and belly discomfort in a number of people, and the frequent need to visit the toilet might spoil boat rides and longer tours. Also, some doctors, following a more modern line, have been recommending tourists to carry the drugs but to only take them if symptoms arise, as this is efficient enough. Do your own research and decide on the best approach for yourself. Mosquitos that are malaria carriers are more active from dusk to dawn.
To avoid mosquito bites, apply insect repellent often, wear pants and long sleeves, and consider treating your clothes with permethrin.
