Accra is the capital city of Ghana. Accra has a mix of 19th-century colonial architecture, modern skyscrapers and apartment blocks, and dusty shanty towns.
Accra has an estimated population of 4—5 million in the metropolitan area. Since an administration reform in 2018 the city itself comprises only of the historic quarters and houses around 280,000 people. However, the surrounding municipal districts are tightly connected to the Accra Metropolitan District. Usually the whole metropolitan area is referred to as "Accra". The local language is Ga; other widely spoken languages are English, Twi (pron. 'ch-wee'), Ewe (pron. ayvay), and Hausa.
Accra was founded in the 17th century by the Ga people. It became the capital of the British Gold Coast in 1877 and the capital of Ghana on the formation of the country as an independent state in 1957.

There is an official taxi stand. Make sure you find it if you want a regulated fare. Otherwise, expect to be taken for a very expensive ride. On the upside, though, the expensive car touts usually put you in a nicer car with a professional driver, and you get to skip any potential taxi confusion—you decide! Better yet, walk out to the main road and get a taxi for a real price.
Although rehabilitation of the rail network is a priority of the government there's just one line operating. Regional commuter trains ply the route from the nearby industrial city of Tema, of limited interest to the tourist, several times a day. Ghana Railway Company publishes timetables at their webpage.
Accra Central station, Kwame Nkrumah Ave. (updated Nov 2020)
Accra's best attractions are scattered across a relatively wide area, so if you can afford the modest prices the best thing to do is hire a car and driver to take you around. Travel companies offer drivers who double as well-informed guides, which helps as interpretive exhibits and brochures (if you can find them) leave much to be desired.
If you need an SUV or a sedan there are plenty of affordable options because even the best drivers earn only about US$15 a day in Accra. You can book directly from Avis and local rental companies at the larger hotels, such as the Golden Tulip, La Palm, or La Badi Beach. Cars are available on short notice but if you want a van or SUV it is best to book ahead. Rates for car and driver are about US$9 an hour. For a US$75 you can book a 10-hour day, but fuel is extra. Rates increase if you leave metro Accra, which is fair because poor roads add to the wear and tear on the vehicle. Toyota Land Cruisers are a popular choice and are widely available.
Though the city is fairly spread out, Accra is relatively safe to walk around during the day (and night, in many areas). Watch out for open sewers, automobiles, (even in the city) when walking the streets.
To flag a taxi wave your arm with your finger pointed down to the ground. On a busy street you will have many taxis driving past trying to offer you their service by honking at you. There are very few Ghanaian cabs with meters. You must negotiate how much you are willing to pay before you start the trip. It is generally US$3 within the centre of town and US$10 to the airport or Accra Mall from the centre. A rough mileage rate would be US$  per mile. Try to ask someone local how much a trip to a certain location usually costs. Also make sure to haggle hard, as most taxi drivers will often try to charge three times (or more) the going rate to foreigners. Relax, and don't show urgency. If the first taxi won't come down on his price, wait for another as they are plentiful. Do have an idea of your route: taxi drivers navigate by landmarks, e. g. traffic circles, traffic lights, petrol stations – not street names – and make sure you have a local SIM in your phone so you can ring someone at your destination and pass the phone to the taxi driver.
Taxis do not have to be so private, though, and it's exceedingly rare for Ghanaians to hire one privately (although they will assume that foreigners want a private one). The rate is in theory one fourth of a private ride, but, again, foreigners taking a private ride tend to get taken for a little extra. It's more confusing, to be sure, but chances are they are going in the direction they are already headed, and you can just ask if they're going towards a major landmark, especially a market.
The problem with taxis, aside from the constant honking at foreigners, is that they don't know their way around Accra. No really, they won't have any idea where you want to go. They can't figure out maps either. The landmarks used by locals and cab drivers in no way align with those that are relevant to outsiders. Even worse, the cab drivers usually live kind of far outside the city centre, and usually aren't even familiar with basic neighbourhood names or the biggest attractions like Independence Square! Some useful landmarks that they will know are the major markets, Osu Castle, the Stadium, the financial centre (Cedi Tower), the major traffic circles along Ring Rd, and major street names, from which you can try and direct them to where you want to go. Now, if you don't already know your way around, it's tough.
There are some taxis with meters in them. These are generally more expensive, but you can be a little more sure about how much they will cost.

Uber also works in Accra.
Bolt which is very popular.
TroTros are usually very crowded and dilapidated minivans ad minibuses that act as the city's public transit system. TroTros travel along a well known routes in the city, and stop at various points along the way (some stops have signs, others don't). As a TroTro approaches a stop, a "mate" (the driver's assistant) will usually yell out the side of the window where the TroTro is going. Many people die in TroTro accidents every year, however typically on highways in rural areas. Accidents causing death in Accra are relatively rare, in part due to traffic congestion.
National Museum, Barnes Rd. Daily 09:00-16:30. Having recently undergone a renovation, the National Museum offers visitors a look at Ghanaian history and culture from prehistory to the present.

There are also exhibits on traditional metalworking and cultural rites of passage. The focus on history is lesser, but the second floor includes displays of historical Ghanaian currencies, postage stamps, and football uniforms. A guided tour, which differs from the text in a few places, is available on request, but be sure to tip your guide at the end. 80GHS for a foreign adult. (updated Aug 2023)
Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park. The park was created to honour Kwame Nkrumah, who led Ghana to its independence from Great Britain and became the nation's first president. Voted as Africa's "Man of the Millennium", he is a highly important figure of the 20th century. In the park you can see a monument dedicated to him, as well as his mausoleum, where he is buried.
Independence Square. Also known as Black Star Square for the large black star located atop Independence Arch. The square celebrates Ghanaian independence from the British in 1957 and features an eternal flame first lit by Nkrumah in 1961.
W.E.B. DuBois Memorial Centre, Fifth Link Road, ☏ +233 30 277 6502. W.E.B. DuBois was an American civil rights activist and author who moved to Ghana near the end of his life, feeling his efforts to create equality were all in vain and that America would never accept black people. DuBois' home has been turned into a museum and library. The museum is quite small, but there are informative guided tours available on request. The centre also houses his grave and several memorials. 20 GH₵ per foreign adult. (updated Aug 2023)

Ghana's Central Library. (updated Jan 2024) Osu Castle
Osu Castle (Christiansborg Castle), 2 Barnes Road, Adabraka, ☏ +233-302 221633. Built by the Danes in the 17th century for Sweden, it changed hands under many rulers before the Danes were finally able to stake claim to the area and the castle. Before it was claimed by Denmark, it was used for trading precious metals, but once the Danes took power, it became a place to store slaves before shipping them. Later it became the headquarters of the Danish Gold Coast. Since then, it was used as a government building; when Ghana gained independence in 1957, it became the Presidential House. It remains the seat of government today, though there is controversy because of its ties to the slave trade. It is not open to walk-in visitors. Armed guards stand outside and they typically don't allow photos to be taken. Rules about pictures change sporadically, but it's best (safest) not to try. The lighthouse in Jamestown
Jamestown. (updated Jan 2024)
The oldest part of Accra, which remains an active fishing centre. It is similar in many ways to Zanzibar's Stone Town, though it has not yet been restored, so it is not typically highlighted on tourist itineraries. Despite this, for many visitors, it is one of the most memorable sights in the city. Jamestown is a short distance west from Independence Square; from the busy street the only real sights are the lighthouse, a prison building housed inside an old colonial fort, and the old Customs House. From the lighthouse there is a road which takes you to the otherwise hidden delight: one of the largest working fishing harbours in Ghana. Go early in the morning and see dozens of small boats bring in the day's catch. It's best to find a friendly local guide so you don't miss the hidden alleys, old stone houses, and fantastic cliff-top harbour vistas.
Ussher Fort. 09:00-18:00 daily. Not Usher's place but a Dutch-built fort that was then turned into a prison.

Accra Central Mosque, Abose-Okai Rd, ☏ +233 275838632. This is kind of a diminutive mosque compared to some of the great ones out there, but, if you are interested in religious sites, this may interest you. It is close to the Agbogbloshie borough though, so try not to get lost. (updated Aug 2020)
Achimota Forest, Achimota College Rd, Accra, Ghana (in the same direction as the University of Ghana), ☏ +233 245896987. 08:00-17:00 M-F. This is Accra's version of a city zoo for now. Has a fairly representative sampling of African animals, and habitats are fresher and cleaner than a lot of other zoos, maybe because it's in an open area. (updated Aug 2020)
University of Ghana. Ghana's largest university is in Legon and is accessible by Tro-Tros to Madina. It's a very charming and quiet place with old trees, a botanical garden (although you should be aware there have been reports of muggings and violent crime taking place in the gardens) and many small buildings surrounded by green grass. The cafeterias are open to anybody and serve typical Ghanaian dishes. (updated Aug 2020)

Labadi Beach (net to La Palm Royal Beach Resort southwest of airport). One of the most popular beaches in Accra for tourists, and a relatively clean one at that, just an itinerant plastic bag here or there. Located between two of Accra's most expensive hotels—La Palm and La Badi Beach—this short stretch of the Atlantic Coast features several makeshift cafe-restaurants, lots of souvenir vendors, and if you are lucky (i.e. on good weather weekends) an amazing cast of characters who will entertain you with drumming, dancing, pony rides, and acrobatic performances.

The biggest entertainment precinct in town is the Oxford Street area, in Osu. Home to over a dozen different night venues (most of them tucked up side-streets), there is no shortage of variety. Taxi drivers generally know the location of the following, but if not, just ask a young-looking person on Oxford Street.
Tantra: A late-night (best from midnight to 05:00) club, with a 50:50 mix of expats and locals. Plays western style electronic and R&B music. Entry GH₵20, small beers GH₵5. You can usually negotiate for a discount on the entry charge.

Duncans: A chilled but popular outdoor spot.
Ryan's Irish Pub: One of the few places in the area where you can order a pint. An option if you want a rest from Africa, but pretty uneventful otherwise.
La Pleasure Beach: Located at Labadi Beach (about 4 km from Osu), an outdoor reggae night happens every Wednesday on the beach from 9PM. GH₵5 entry, GH₵4 large beers. 80% locals, foreigners get hassled a little by jewellery and t-shirt sellers, but it's safe, and worth a look on a Wednesday.
FireFly: A nice classy cocktail lounge in Osu near Citizen Kofi. Entry is free and drinks are GH₵4–5 for a single shot and GH₵10–15 for cocktails. Local and expat crowd. Plays electronic and pop music here you see a lot of foreign (white) young ladies gyrating with public displaying of affection with the local Ghanaian gentlemen.
The Republic Bar & Grill: a retro-styled afrocentric hangouts for creatives (bloggers, photographers, fashion designers), expats and just anybody else who can't be bothered with high heels or a formal shirt. You can sit in or outside and enjoy chilled fermented flavoured sugar cane juice whilst listening to World Music or very old school Ghanaian Highlife.

Jerry Rawlings, who gets credit for the hotel's best feature, an authentic, Ghananian-inspired design theme. Somewhat sterile with a great location on the beach. 5 restaurants producing good food only in the hotel's flagship outdoor 'African Village' which is a charming breezy and architecturally distinctive venue.

La Badi Beach Hotel, ☏ +233-30-277-2501. Good atmosphere, especially if you yearn for a Graham Greene-inspired fantasy British Colonial-era experience. The lobby is all dark wood, leather sofa, campaign furniture and ceiling fans. Queen Elizabeth II slept here; and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. More recent guests include quite a few airline flight crews, and far-too many US government/military contractors who spend long hours at the bar each night boring other guests with their "thoughts" about Africa which are predictably a bit naïve, if not downright creepy. The pool and gardens are nice, the Western-style buffet is excellent, and the rooms are small but well-appointed, most with balconies. Best feature: it is on the beach at La Badi, so there is always something happening just footsteps away. It is a long drive from the centre of town or the airport. Unless you are in Ghana for a vacation, this isn't the best location. From US$180. (updated Jan 2018)
