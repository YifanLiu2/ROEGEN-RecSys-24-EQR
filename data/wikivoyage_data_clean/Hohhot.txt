Hohhot (Chinese: 呼和浩特 Hūhéhàotè; Mongolian: ᠬᠥᠬᠡᠬᠣᠲᠠ Höh hot) is the capital of Inner Mongolia and serves as the region's administrative, economic, and cultural capital.
Hohhot is a combination of two Mongolian words: Hoh ('blue') and Hot ('city'). Thus, Hohhot means "blue city".
Hohhot has only been the capital of Inner Mongolia since 1947 but is rapidly growing and challenging Baotou as the region's industrial and economic powerhouse. Although only around 11% of the city's population are indigenous Mongols, Mongolian Buddhism (an offshoot of Tibetan Buddhism) continues to thrive and Mongolian culture is actively preserved. As a new capital, the city lacks an abundance of historical and tourist sites. However, it is still definitely worth visiting if in the area. The city is at its greenest and most pleasant in spring and early summer.
Because of the large Hui Muslim population, restaurants with a green or yellow sign are generally Halal and will not serve pork.
One of China's largest industrial cities, Hohhot accounts for more than 60% of Inner Mongolia's total industrial output and is home to many of China's largest companies.
Hohhot is home to two of China's largest dairy companies: Yili and Mengniu. For this reason, Hohhot is often dubbed as the "Dairy Capital" of China.
Hohhot Baita International Airport (HET IATA). Inner Mongolia's main airport. It is one hour outside of Hohhot; regular flights are available to Beijing, Chifeng, Guangzhou, Hailar, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin,Wuhan, Xi'an, and Xilinhot. International flights are available to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
There are two train stations in Hohhot: Hohhot (Huhehaote), and the newer Hohhot East (Huhehaotedong).
Hohhot is connected by high speed or conventional rail to the following regional cities: Baotou (1 hr), Beijing ( hr), Datong ( hr), Erenhot ( hr), Yinchuan (8-9 hr).
There are also overnight trains. Beijing to Hohhot overnight train is K89. K89 departs at 21:00 and arrives at 07:20 (9 hr). The K90 from Hohhot to Beijing departs at 21:23 and arrives at 07:20 (cost is ~US$24 for a hard sleeper). Trains 4652 and 4653 run between Hohhot and Erlian. The train leaving from Hohhot departs at 22:00 and arrives at 06:08 (cost is about US$11 for a hard sleeper). International service to destinations include Moscow and Ulaanbaatar.
In 2020, the Hohhot to Zhangjiakou high-speed rail line was completed, connecting to the Beijing to Zhangjiakou line & cutting travel time from Beijing to Hohhot down to  hours.
The long-distance bus station is located next to main train station. Facing the station, it is on the left side of the square.
There are regular bus services to the following cities: Baotou (2 hr), Beijing (8-11 hr), Datong (4 hr), Erlian (6-7 hr, ¥88) and Dongsheng (3 hr).
Hohhot Metro has two lines. Line 1 runs from east to west between Hohhot Baita Airport in Saihan District & Yili Health Valley in Tumed Left Banner. Line 2 runs from north to south and connect with Line 1 at Xinhua Square Station. Hohhot and Hohhot East railway stations are both connected to the metro but Hohhot East is more seamlessly integrated. Signs and announcements in the Metro are trilingual in Mandarin, Mongolian and English. In 2024, the addition of the No. 2 subway line goes through the entire city and is also very convenient.
Taxis start at ¥8 during the day (¥ at night?) and are highly available throughout the day. Taxis are difficult to flag 14:00-15:00 as people go back to work as well as during early evening, or with foul weather. Many streets have regular traffic jams so be prepared to sit and watch the meter. There are lots of cabs at night, too.
Buses run until 20:30 during the winter. English schedules are difficult to find.
Bicycles are by far the most convenient and common in the city. Be careful with the new/foreign traffic patterns. Left turns occur after straight traffic, typically bicycles turn left from the bicycle lane with auto traffic through intersections. Following local traffic is often the safest way to ride and will orient you to traffic patterns, customs, and flow. During peak hours, traffic police will dictate crossing times. Parking your bicycle is easy and convenient in the 'corral' spaces. Attendants will issue you and your bicycle matching 'sticks' and your bicycle will be generally safe while you shop or go to work. Rates are ¥-2/day. Hours may vary.
There are now several apps for smart phones that can be used to hire bicycles, in particular (once linked to a bank card) the social media app Wechat or the wallet app Alipay can be used to hire many public bicycles.
Depending on construction levels, walking the city is very easy and common and is perhaps the best way to interact with locals. During peak hours, traffic police will dictate crossing times. Theft and molestation is generally not high in the city, however prudence should always be practiced. As a city spectacle, a smile will often turn obvious bewilderment of the passing people into delight. Try it out! ¥-1 is a reasonable amount to offer beggars and the homeless, as are empty plastic bottles.
