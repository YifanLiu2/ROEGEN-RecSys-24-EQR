Evansville is the largest city in Southern Indiana and the third-largest city in the state. It is the county seat of Vanderburgh County and the regional hub for the Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois tri-state area. In 2010, the city had a population of 117,000. In 2008 the Evansville metropolitan area was home to 350,000 people.
Unlike most of Indiana, Evansville is in the Central Time Zone (same as Chicago.)
The River City is known for its southern-style hospitality, economic vitality, and proud German heritage. Evansville's culture is a combination of Midwestern charms and Southern family values, and fairly distinct from the culture of Indiana's other major cities (South Bend, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne) likely as a result of being isolated from them geographically without a major highway to connect them. The strong economic base provided by giant Toyota and AK Steel plants has allowed the city to thrive in the face of the nationwide recession. Additionally, the vibrant growth of the University of Southern Indiana (established in 1965) has resulted in a strong youth presence and an active and enjoyable nightlife.
The broad economic base of the region has helped to build an economy which is known for its stability, diversity, and vitality. In 2004 Evansville was named an "All-America City" by the National Civic League. In 2008 it was voted the best city in the country in which "to live, work, and play" by the readers of Kiplinger, and in 2009 the 11th best.
Paleo Indians left the Angel Mounds in the area as evidence of their distant civilization, and French explorers performed obeisance in calling the area La Belle Rivière.
Settled in 1812, the city sits on a gentle horseshoe bend on the Ohio River and is often referred to as "River City." One of the most popular attractions in the region is Bally's Evansville (formerly Tropicana and Casino Aztar, the first riverboat casino in the state of Indiana). Evansville is also home to the University of Evansville and to the University of Southern Indiana.

Most telephone numbers in Evansville consist of +1 812 plus a seven-digit number, but the entire 812 area is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with 930 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call). The same holds true on the other side of the Ohio River; the western third of Kentucky, including Henderson, is served by its own overlay complex (270 and 364).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 812 before these if no area code is indicated (or, if on the Kentucky side, 270).
Evansville is a safe town with very few areas that are unsafe even at night. The southern areas of the town are seen as the most rough but are just low-income residential.
