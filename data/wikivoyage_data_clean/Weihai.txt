Weihai's total population in 2022 was 2,906,500.
The city of Weihai has a long history:it has been populated since the middle of the Neolithic Age. During the Xia, Shang and Zhou Dynasties, the city was the land of the Oriental barbarians and was inhabited by the Laiyi. In the fourth year of Tiantong of the Northern Qi Dynasty (568), Wendeng County was set up in the city, to which all of the city's present territory belongs. In 1398, the Ming Dynasty set up a garrison here, taking the meaning of "Megatron Haijiang", and began to call it "Weihaiwei". Weihai is the birthplace of Beiyang Navy, China's first navy in modern times, and the place where the Sino-Japanese Naval Battle took place. After the Sino-Japanese War, Weihai was one of the "Seven Sons" who were occupied by foreign powers and later returned to China.
Weihai City is at the easternmost point of Shandong Peninsula, near the bisector line between North and South China, and is the nearest Chinese city to South Korea. Weihai has jurisdiction over Huancui District, Wendeng District, Rongcheng City, Rushan City, is a beautiful coastal city, but also a famous historical and cultural city. Weihai has mountains known as the "Oriental mountain Buddhist holy land", the Shidao red mountain, the Rushan mountain silver beach, and numerous other tourist attractions.
Bus is by far the cheapest option but could involve many hours of travel depending on your starting point. It takes roughly six and a half hours hours by bus from Jinan, capital of Shandong, to the bus station in Weihai. There are many companies serving Weihai with many destinations possible at good frequencies.

Weihai Dashuibo International Airport (威海大水泊国际机场), Dashuibo Town, Wendeng District (文登区大水泊镇), ☏ +86 631 8641172 (general enquiries), +86 631 5317915 (ticket sales), +86 631 8641172 (lost property). (updated Jul 2020)
The airport is approx 45 km from the city centre. The rather new toll highway somewhat reduces the travel time to or from the city centre yet adds slightly to your overall fare. Via tollway or not, expect to pay about ¥100-130 each way if travelling by taxi. The bus fare to the city is ¥20. For the most direct route, take the No. 1 Airport Bus (威海机场巴士1号线). Alternatively, you might consider taking the Airport Bus Western Route (威海机场巴士西线), which charges the same fare.
A backup option is nearby Yantai with a taxi into Weihai. However, the journey can take an hour, and the taxi fare could be about double, sometimes involving two taxis depending on the driver. The first taxi may take you only as far as the beginning of the toll road where you'll easily find a second taxi to your destination. The rationale is the Yantai driver is unlikely to find a customer for the return.
Another option is Incheon to Weihai or Yantai. It's a one-hour hop but has the amenities of an international flight. Attempt timing your international arrival into Incheon with the least amount of layover. Transit through Incheon is a breeze. Korea is 1 hour ahead of China, so keep timezones in mind when organizing your flights. The flights to Weihai depart about 09:00, and 12:00 for Yantai. Asiana and Korean Air serve Weihai although China Eastern code shares with KE.
Incheon is a good option if schedules align as this routing may sometimes yield significant savings even with an overnight stay. There is not much to see near Incheon, but usually a shower and a bed are about the only wants after long haul travel anyway. From the US, late night flights from Los Angeles, Chicago and New York to Incheon run on certain days which coordinate nicely with the onward 09:00 Weihai departure.
If you overnight in Incheon, there is a nice Hyatt among other hotels just beyond the airport parking lot. The hotels have free shuttles about every 20 minutes at the customer exit # 14, the furthest exit to your right as you clear international arrivals. The Hyatt would be walking distance if not for luggage or jet lag. Your luggage may be checked on through to China and not offloaded. Check with your carrier's policy and pack a carry-on, as appropriate. Luggage checked through to destination removes baggage claim and simplifies customs in Incheon.
You can drive in by yourself.
You can ride an electric bike around the beach and see the view.
The bus routes are easy to use as they are conveniently and clearly marked on the English/Chinese map sold around town. It costs ¥1 for the bus.
It runs from May 1 to October 30 every year. The face value of the tourist bus ticket is ¥10 per ticket, which is only available for a single ride from the departure station to the terminal station, one ticket per person. Children under  meters can ride for free under the guidance of an adult. There is no discount for other passengers. The one-way length of the route is 26 kilometers.
Taxi fares in Weihai start at ¥8.
In Weihai, early summer is the best season for cycling. The roads in Weihai are relatively flat and suitable for cycling. Riding a bicycle is a healthy and natural way of sports tourism, which can fully enjoy the beauty of the travel process. A bicycle and a backpack can travel, simple and environmentally friendly. It's nice to breathe in the fresh air between the green mountains and the sea, and feel the cool breeze under the shade.
In Weihai, there are many beautiful places that you need to have a visit, such as Liugong island (inside Weihai city), Chengshantou (in Rongcheng district), and Shengjingshan Mountain (in Wengdeng city, here you can experience the culture of the traditional Chinese religion Dao). Also you need to experience the life in Weihai as a fisherman.
"Weihaiwei" was leased by the United Kingdom from 1898 until October 1, 1930. It was a summer station for the British naval China Station.

Town Hall in the city centre are the municipal buildings in front of which is a large and stately promenade. It is here where ancestry has an enduring processional into modern Chinese life. In the warmer months from spring through autumn, you will find droves of local families gathered in the early evening: parents line-dancing and waving over-sized fans to pounding traditional drums, grandparents dancing elegantly to what can be described as a form of Chinese waltz, and the kids playing badminton or hacky-sack with expert precision. Sometimes there may even be a stage performance. A sense of community thrives. The offerings vary nightly, but Town Hall is invariably fun. The people are warm, inclusive and welcoming of foreigners. Don't be surprised if you are suddenly motioned to join a waltz.
For the early birds, Town Hall is also the gathering spot for a morning ritual of Chinese meditative exercises at 07:00. Join the locals in this tradition for maintaining good health and alignment of chi. Be forewarned: many elderly out-spry the young.

Chinese food: it's obviously everywhere; however, some consider the local cuisine to be tasteless.
To others, the traditional and simple steaming of fresh seafood along with locally grown varieties of fresh vegetables make for healthful, delicately tasty food, remarkable merely in its simple, unadulterated purity. The local delicacy is sea cucumber for which Weihai is very well known. Fresh scallops are readily available and are extremely affordable by western standards. In the summer months, fresh fruits abound. Rice is less prevalent than noodles in this region of China, for wheat is grown in the area. Be sure to try the local jiaozi or baozi, tender dumplings, particularly those filled with local fresh shrimp and chive.
One local restaurant that has very unique offerings is called Yi Kuai Dou Fu (一块豆腐), their specialty is a one piece tofu dish. They also have other great dishes such as tang su liji and gong bao rou.
Korean Food: you can't miss. Given the proximity of Korea, the food has made a strong presence. During the warm summer months, seek out the tasty soup called mool naeng myun, an ice-cold, bold beef broth that is laden with buckwheat noodles and laced with bits of cucumber, chive, sliced beef and leafy coriander (British) or cilantro (North Americans refer to coriander as the seed, not the leaf, of the same plant). Top it off with kim chee. It's more refreshing than a cold shower after a hot, sultry day at the beach.
There are many Korean places in the city (市里), in the Economic Development Zone, there is a Korean Food street called "Han guo mei shi jie" (韩国美食街). There is an excellent Korean restaurant located in the Jusco (佳士客), in the Economic Zone (经济开发区).
There is a Korean coffee shop called "BREAD'N BAKERY & COFFEE", which is located on Tong Yi Road (统一路) just north of Kuming Road (昆明路), next to the Adidas shop (and two more shops in other areas in Weihai). It is a wonderful place to hang out. Coffee is really delicious and starts at ¥15 and they have delicious breads as well and free Wifi.

No.9 - Top floor of Weihai Gate
There is a Western/Chinese breakfast buffet at the Golden Bay Hotel on the NE end of the International beach for about USD10. They'll expect a room number, but will seat visitors.
the local major grocers usually have a small international selection where one may find Dove chocolates, pasta and sauces, and pantry staples that have a long shelf life. If you look hard, some stores even carry New Zealand butter or French Brie and aged English cheddar cheese and a decent selection of biscuits/crackers. An occasional parcel of familiar can be intensely appreciated by an unadjusted western palate.
Japanese food: Haibin Lu close to the RT Market (大润发)
The famous American junk fillings such as KFC and McDonald's have infiltrated the local offerings.
Tomato Bar. Downtown close to Da shi jie, 大世界, with live music on the weekends, including a Cuban conga player!

There are plenty of places to choose from so shop around. The rates are posted at the front desk, usually in English, and that's the "rack" rate. You should expect a lower rate and they usually quote one. You can bargain for even lower rates, but since I don't speak Chinese, it's hard to do and the rates seemed fair anyway - about $30 for a nice room with a/c, tv, phone, and up-to-date/clean at a normal looking hotel with a nice lobby, probably a restaurant, and usually a little spa of some kind. There are some very cheap places to stay.
You need to decide first where you want to stay as Weihai has a number of areas that could suit you depending on what you are in Weihai for.
Downtown is nice if you want to be near the ferry terminals, the main parks and shopping, and have easy access to most transport.
You could stay near the bus/train station, but that's a little remote and not much around.
The last option is the beaches. You have 3 main ones to choose from with hotels ranging from almost normal to way-too-swank. Some of these are like self-contained resorts and can be isolated to themselves. The International Bathing Beach area is popular, but really any of the beaches is just fine.
