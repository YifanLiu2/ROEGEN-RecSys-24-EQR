Amritsar (Punjabi: ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤਸਰ Hindi: अमृतसर) is a city in the state of Punjab, India. It is the holiest city in the Sikh religion. Amritsar is one of the largest cities in the Indian state of Punjab and is the spiritual and cultural centre of the Sikh religion. Sikhs are rightfully very proud of the city and their very beautiful and unique Gurdwara (place of worship), the Golden Temple. Amritsar is today a major pilgrimage centre for Sikhs and a tourism centre for anyone.
The name Amritsar name derives from the pool around the Golden Temple (aka Harmandir Sahib) and means "holy pool of nectar" (Amrit elixir; Sar, short for sarovar which means "lake").
No visit to Amritsar is complete without a visit of the Golden Temple, including a community meal, a bath in the pool, potentially a night in the temple and if you are keen a volunteering session in the community kitchen, as well as the participation in the Flag lowering ceremony at the Wagah (Attari) border.

Amritsar is known mainly for its Golden Temple which was initiated by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru and the founder of the city, and completed in 1601 by his successor Guru Arjan Dev Ji.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre or Amritsar massacre occurred in 1919. The area where this occurred was a large, open square but walled in on all sides. British troops opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators, and a large number were killed — the British said 370 dead and 1,200 wounded but Indian sources say the total was well over 1,000 dead. Some of the victims were, in fact, demonstrating, protesting against the arrest of two political activists, while others were gathered to celebrate the traditional festival of Baisakhi. Not all died directly due to British fire; many were trampled in the stampede to escape and others died diving down a well to avoid the bullets. Today the well is a rather grisly tourist attraction and bullet holes are still visible on walls around the area.
The massacre news spread quickly all over the country caused widespread outrage and additional demonstrations as it stunned the entire sub-continent. Eventually, the public lost faith in the British colonial government and subsequently, this massacre initiated the "Non-cooperation movement" led by the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi. It is considered a significant phase of the Indian independence movement from British rule.Sikh pilgrim at the Golden Temple
It also had a tremendous effect in the UK, with many of the more liberal British appalled by it while others thought it necessary. A commission investigated and concluded that "General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir Michael O'Dwyer was of the same view, ... (but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed." Dyer was in command on the spot and O'Dwyer the provincial governor.
During the partition of the Indian Subcontinent in 1947, the Punjab region was divided between India and Pakistan near Amritsar. Pakistan wanted to annex Amritsar due to its close proximity with Lahore and 50% Muslim population; however, the city remained inside Indian territory. Similarly, India wanted to annex Lahore. Both of the cities experienced some of the worst communal riots during the partition. Mass evacuations were made both in Amritsar and in Lahore. Hence, the demographics of both the cities were changed following the partition, significantly altering the culture and affecting the political, economic and social environment of the cities.

In June 1984, an Indian military operation ordered by then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, was launched in the city to remove a few hundred Sikh militants who had taken control of the Golden Temple compound. After a few hundred people were killed during the 5-day siege, thousands of civilians were killed throughout the country in the aftermath.

Qatar Airways now flies from/to Doha
FlyScoot flies from/to Singapore with possible budget connections all around Southeast Asia and beyond
Air-India Express, SpiceJet and IndiGo fly from/to Dubai and Sharjah with cheap connections into Europe from there
There are also a surprising number of flights to Central Asia (Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).
By bus – The cheapest way to and from the airport is by local bus. Take the bus to Ajnala (stand 19 in the city bus stand) and tell the conductor that you go to the airport. The bus costs ₹15 (December 2018). The bus will drop you in the main road, about 1 km away from the airport. You could walk this in about 15 minutes or take a rickshaw or auto from there. The way back should be the same, just walk to the main road and hail down any bus going into the city.
By free shuttle – The Golden Temple is running a free shuttle bus generally twice a day. It is leaving from the airport around 09:00 and 15:00 (as of F July 2023), generally shortly after a couple of flights arrived. So check ahead for the flights—he might go a little earlier or a little later. From the roundabout northeast of the Golden Temple in the center, the roundabout where also rickshaws go to the border, the bus should leave towards the airport about 1 hr before these times, but best to inquire with the Golden Temple staff beforehand.
By rickshaw – If you just head to the highway, or even just outside of the airport, there should be rickshaws waiting for potential customers—say ₹100-200. On the way back they will go as far as they are allowed. If you don't have much large luggage, that can also be a convenient option.
By taxi – Taxi drivers wait outside the arrivals gate for visitors. For a trip into town, even the prepaid taxi can be bargained down with the drivers to ₹300 from initially ridiculous prices of ₹550 a person (as of March 2014; became ₹850 as of May 2023) before you pay, but there is a significant dearth of official taxis or even auto-rickshaws, so prepare for a hard time. Uber and OLA are available. Both Uber and OLA charges around ₹550 (May 2023) with OLA slapping an additional ₹100 charge for parking which is not apparent while booking. This charge is applied both during airport pickup and drop off.
