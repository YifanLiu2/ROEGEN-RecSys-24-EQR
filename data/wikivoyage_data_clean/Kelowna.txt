Kelowna is a city in the Okanagan region of British Columbia. Kelowna is the largest inland city in British Columbia, in the heart of BC's wine country. Okanagan Lake is the main draw in the summer.
Kelowna is the largest city in the tourist-oriented Okanagan Valley with a population of about 142,000 in the city, and 215,000 in the metropolitan area (2020). During the summer, Okanagan Lake is the main draw, this 135 km-long (84 mi) jewel is a big draw for boaters (power and sail), swimmers and kite-boarders; in addition, golf, hiking and biking are popular summer activities. In winter thousands of tourists come from all parts of the world to ski at Big White resort, which is 55 km (34 mi) from the city.
Kelowna produces wines that have received international recognition. Vineyards are common around and south of the city where the climate is ideal for the many wineries. Tourists also come in the Sep-Nov (mostly) to experience and taste the Okanagan's world-class wines from wineries throughout the valley.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Kelowna is classified as a humid continental climate or an inland oceanic climate, with dry, hot, sunny summers and cool, cloudy winters, and four seasons. Summers in Kelowna are hot (sometimes extremely hot) and sunny. Not unusually, heat waves occur in July, August, and even June and September on occasion, where temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) persist for weeks. During summer, clear, dry air allows night-time temperatures to fall rapidly. Kelowna has the second mildest winter of any non-coastal city in Canada, after neighboring Penticton, caused by the moderating effects of Okanagan Lake combined with mountains separating most of BC from the prairies.
Weather conditions during December and January are characterized by persistent valley cloud as Okanagan Lake hardly ever freezes.
British Columbia roads have been vulnerable to natural disasters such as major flooding in November 2021 and wildfires in August 2023. You can check with DriveBC for up-to-date road conditions and road restrictions after clicking the Major Events tab.

Kelowna is a growing city and therefore has its growing pains, with these come the following recommendations; avoid Leon & Lawrence Avenues between Water and Ellis during night time. City Park at night is patrolled, however can be somewhat dodgy after hours too. Be cautious when visiting the other local parks and beaches during the evening as well as they are known for transients and illegal activity.
As long as you keep yourself aware of your surroundings, you will be fine.
In summer, the city is also prone to forest fires, having suffered large fires in 2003, 2009, and 2023. Depending on the season, there may be campfire bans or parks may be closed.
