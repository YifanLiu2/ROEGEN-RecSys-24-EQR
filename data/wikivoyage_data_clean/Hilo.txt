Hilo is a town on the Big Island of Hawaii. The county seat and largest city in Hawaii County, Hilo is the one of the best starting points to explore the eastern half of the island, including Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
Although the largest city on the Big Island, Hilo has a small population (44,186 in the 2020 Census) and a relaxed pace of life. It is on the rainier, less touristy east side of the island, and the city itself is not a huge draw for tourists, although there is an excellent farmers' and craftsmen's market on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. In addition to the attractions within city limits, there is good snorkeling nearby, extremely lush botanic gardens in the area and Volcanoes National Park is a splendid day trip.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Hilo has a warm, somewhat muggy tropical climate with over 100 inches of rain a year, making it the rainiest town in the United States outside of Alaska. January and February are the only months with fewer than 20 rainy days on average.
Most of the visitors bound for Hilo will arrive via one of the inter island airlines (Hawaiian), or as a day stop from one of the frequent cruise ship visits. Unless you're sailing your own craft, this is only way of getting in by sea, as inter-island boat services were suspended in 2009.
Hilo International Airport (ITO IATA). Is the main airport serving Hilo and the eastern side of the Big Island. The majority of flights to Hilo originate from Honolulu via Hawaiian Airlines. There is also one flight from Kahului daily, and one non-stop flight from LAX daily, operated by United Airlines. The airport terminal is rather small, with a relaxed atmosphere. Long lines for security are unlikely.
From elsewhere on the Big Island: for visitors, this would mean taking the Mamalahoa Highway (HI-190), the Daniel K. Inouye Highway (via a right turn) and the Saddle Road (HI-200, but without signposted route numbers on the road) across the interior of the island from Kailua-Kona at the western end, where the other commercial airport is located. Allow at least 2 hours for that trip, which goes through some curvy, hilly terrain.
Alternatively, you can take the Hawaii Belt Road (HI-19) around much of the northern shore of the island, going inland through Waimea. You may find this an easier drive, and possibly a more pleasant one if you'd like to go through more villages and see fewer starkly beautiful views of Mauna Kea and other hilly inland scenery. To be on the safe side, you should allow at least  hours for the northern route, though you may want to stop in one or more towns along the way.
Direction signs are fairly good on the Big Island, though not always with much advance notice for the driver. Traffic drives slowly (usually 25-35 miles per hour), and it's ordinary for unobstructed traffic to go slower than posted speed limits.
If you don't have a car, hitching a ride is very easy on the Big Island.
Hele-On Bus system. Most buses on the island are designed for commuters and run a couple times in the early morning and a couple times in the evening. Almost all routes in Hilo connect and depart from the hub near downtown in Moʻoheau Park. $2. (updated Mar 2019)
Intra-Hilo Keaukaha route. M-Sa, no holidays. Service from Moʻoheau Bus Terminal to the Hilo airport is provided by Route 101, Intra-Hilo Keaukaha. It operates with headways of approximately 80 minutes between buses. $2. (updated May 2021)
Hilo-Kona route. M-Sa, no holidays. There is only one bus that connects Hilo directly to Kona. There are 2 runs in the early morning from Kona to Hilo and 1 run in the afternoon back to Kona. $2. (updated Mar 2019)

Many of Hilo's points of interest are concentrated in quite a small area in the western end of Kamehameha Avenue. There you can get around by foot easily. However, some natural attractions, beaches and shops are a mile or more away from there.
The county's Hele-On Bus systemdead link ($2 fare) serve Hilo International Airport eight times per day (except on Sunday). However, virtually all visitors rent a vehicle from one of the many rental agencies upon arriving at Hilo International Airport. It's a good idea to make car reservations in advance, as special events or active conditions at the Volcanoes National Park can quickly deplete the supply of available vehicles. If you do plan on taking the buses, look up the schedules ahead of time and keep in mind that they will leave on time from the beginning of their routes (usually the Mo'oheau Bus Terminal in downtown Hilo) but will possibly be delayed for subsequent stops depending on traffic, weather and stops.
As an alternative, taxis are also available at the airport though renting a car is almost always more practical.
There are also a few bicycle shops on and around Kamehameha Avenue, if you would like to rent or buy a bicycle.

Rainbow Falls. If you don't have time to make it up to Akaka Falls, or you don't like hiking, Rainbow Falls is worth a visit. Try to visit early in the day.

Very wheelchair accessible, but the Boiling Pots will require some hiking. (updated Apr 2015)
King Kamehameha Statue (in Wailoa State Park off Kamehameha Ave). Erected in 1997 at Wailoa State Park, the statue of King Kamehameha is perhaps the most impressive of the four found throughout the state.

The brackish water is colder, a mix of the ocean and fresh water springs. (updated Apr 2015)
Paradise Copters. Flights over macadamia nut plantations to the lava flows at Kilauea. Because Kona is twice as far from the volcano as Hilo, tours that leave from Kona are generally 2 hours long and accordingly more expensive.

At the Tsunami Museum you can learn about the disastrous one that hit Hilo in 1960
Hilo is generally quite safe. There are usually homeless people loitering around public parks and sometimes they can be a little eccentric, so keep your distance.
If an earthquake were to strike and a tsunami warning were issued, if you are at the beach, there would be tsunami evacuation signs to guide you to a safe distance.
Haole = White person: Though many think that "haole" just means white person, it refers more to an attitude than anything else. Hilo is a workaday town that sees few tourists. Locals aren't as accustomed to tourists as they are in the resort areas, so respecting the local people and culture is very important. Treat the locals with respect, and the same respect will be returned to you. There are a few Native Hawaiians who have a generally negative attitude to Haoles, and may express this attitude through looks or comments. You are best to simply ignore comments to avoid provocation. You may also find that other Native Hawaiians are quite friendly and warm if you take the time to speak with them and be friendly, yourself.
Locals refrain from wearing aloha outfits, either full body attire or partial outfits. Clothes are very casual to resort casual at best.

Many people can spend several days exploring all that the park has to offer. There are a number of excellent hikes, showcasing most of the flavors of Hawaiian geological activity. Of course, the thing that most people come to see is the active flow zone of Kilauea. Entrance fees are consistent with other U.S. National Parks.
Mauna Kea (28 mi (45 km) west of Hilo on Hawaii Route 200, then north on the access road to the visitor center), ☏ +1 808-961-2180. 9AM-10PM daily. The largest mountain in the world (measured from its base), this dormant volcano has become an international center for astronomy, with multiple observatories located on its summit. The austere Mars-like landscape is dotted with technological marvels, and on a clear day you might be able to see other Hawaiian islands in the distance as well as the other mountains of the Big Island. The elevation is high, and there are few tourist support facilities so hiking and exploring are discouraged. The Visitor Center offers free star gazing parties every night of the year from 6PM-10PM, with staff and volunteers giving verbal star tours and setting up a various array of telescopes for you to look at the skies through. An optimal view of the night sky can be seen there after sunset, enhanced by large telescopes set up for free viewing. Four-wheel drive is required to reach the summit (check with your car rental company before driving to the summit), but the visitor center, which is at approximately 9,300 feet, is reachable by a good 2-wheel drive car with excellent brakes (for the descent — the road up Mauna Kea is very steep). Make sure to bring warm clothing with several layers; temperatures in the 40s or lower are common at night, even in the summer, and a stiff wind is almost guaranteed. Free. (updated Feb 2016)
