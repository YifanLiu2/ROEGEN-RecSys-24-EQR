Billings is the largest city in Montana in Yellowstone County, with an estimated 110,000 people (2019). As a destination, Billings does a significant amount of convention business and is also the host to various regional events such as music festivals, athletic contests, rodeos, and outdoor activities. Billings hosts the largest hospitals in a 500-mile radius, as such the medical profession is a major source of employment in the area. Billings also is a frequent overnight or meal stop for westbound visitors to Yellowstone National Park, as it is the last major city for visitors going to the park via the Beartooth Highway.
Billings visitors will find residents referring to different sections of town. The most common ones are:
Lockwood (east of I-90 and north of Yellowstone River) — most businesses around Johnson Lane exit on the old highway
The Heights (northern part of town, past MetraPark) — most businesses on Main St
Downtown (roughly 26th St. to 30th St. and 1st Ave to 6th Ave) — typical downtown area
The Rims (sandstone cliffs north of town) — airport, walking/biking trails, a few neighborhoods
Southside (south of the railroad tracks) - businesses scattered throughout
Westend (large stretch of town, 1st St N to 32nd St N) — major streets are Grand, Broadwater, Central, and King
Shiloh Crossing (Zoo Drive Exit to King Ave, along Shiloh Rd) — newest commercial area of town
There are also a few outlying towns with a variety of businesses, though no hotels. These are Acton, Ballantine, Broadview, Huntley, Pompey's Pillar, Shepherd, and Worden. Though some people may refer to Laurel, about 10 miles west, as a suburb, it is its own separate town with a vibe of its own.
Billings has the nickname "Magic City" because the city seemed to appear overnight with rapid growth from the newly built railroad route in the late 1800s.
There are no passenger rail services to Billings, and despite its location along the river, there are no ferry services to other cities.

Billings is generally a safe city, but crimes do occur. Stay away from portions of the city south of Montana Ave., otherwise known as South Side, at night.
Portions of the city east of N. 27th St., north of Montana Ave. and west of Main St., otherwise known as the North Park area, may not be safe at night. However, the area is mainly residential and offers little for tourists in any case.
Rock slides, sometimes involving big boulders, have happened along the Rims, therefore, it is advisable to keep a reasonable distance between yourself and the edge of the Rims.
Due to swift currents, do not get into the city's canals. People have had to be rescued from the canals.
Roads conditions can be treacherous during and after winter snowstorms. The city has a so-called "Slick Streets" policy, meaning if the city's emergency dispatch center receives too many calls on accidents due to snowy or icy road conditions, emergency crews will only respond to accidents involving injuries. The city's media outlets may make an announcement when the Slick Streets policy is in effect.
If Billings is too crowded for you, try its "suburbs" of Huntley and Shepherd, roughly 10 miles east.
Two National Monuments are within a reasonable distance: Pompey's Pillar, 32 miles east on I-94, and Little Bighorn Battlefield, 67 miles southeast on I-90. Other than those, you're at the last city of any significant size before rolling out into the vast Eastern Montana prairie. The greatest attraction may be the scenery of the drive to your next destination.
