It has been restored to provide the most unique accommodations in the Capital District. Voted "Best in the Capital/Saratoga Region", The Morgan State House is an inn in the European tradition. It is centrally located in downtown Albany, on a quiet, tree-lined residential street overlooking Washington Park and was the longtime home of the artist and suffragette Alice Morgan Wright (1881—1975), who lived here from 1888 (when she was 7 years old) until her death. The house was designed by R.W. Gibson, the architect of the Cathedral of All Saints, for her father, Henry Romeyn Wright, who made a fortune in dry goods during the Civil War. The multiple peaked gables and intricate interior details reflect the Japanese-influenced aesthetic of the 1880s. Alice Morgan Wright was a leading figure in the American suffrage movement and once was jailed in London with Emmeline Pankhurst. In 1921 she helped found the New York League of Women’s Voters. An influential artist of the Art Deco style, Wright maintained a studio on the fourth floor of the house, and her works can be found in museums and private collections throughout the country.

Like most cities, Albany has blighted areas with crime problems. Use precautions that one would use in any big city. The areas between Washington Ave. and New Scotland Ave. are generally safe to walk, especially east of Lark Street. However, there have been physical assaults near the SUNY Albany downtown campus. Arbor Hill near Henry Johnson Blvd. is known as one of the most dangerous areas, though it holds no particular interest to travelers. Occasional muggings and armed robberies have been known to happen to drunk suburbanites on Lark, Madison and other bar streets.

The Albany metro area, the Capital District, has many more attractions.
The city of Troy offers well-preserved 19th-century architecture (making it a location for period films) and fine antique shopping downtown.
About a 20 minute drive north of Albany is Watervliet and the military arsenal museum.
The Cohoes Falls are the second-largest in the state (a distant second to Niagara Falls, but impressive nonetheless).
The area in and around the city of Saratoga Springs (about 40 minutes north of Albany) features wonderful shops, restaurants and bars, a national park (about 15 miles from Saratoga proper) at the site of the Battle of Saratoga (the turning point of the Revolutionary War), a lovely state park with a mud and mineral bath spa run by the state, a par 29 and two championship 18 hole courses as well a stately restaurant.
Just across the river is Rensselaer.
Visitors to the Albany area should consider day trips to destinations in the Berkshires of western Mass., including Tanglewood, Mass MoCA, and the Clark Art Institute.
The Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
Several state parks are within easy driving distance, among them Thacher State Park. A scenic 30-minute drive west on route 85, it tops an escarpment and has great views of the city and several beautiful hiking trails, including a lower trail which winds and turns near the bottom of the escarpment and actually goes behind two waterfalls. Spring is the best time to view these falls due to the thaw and increased water volume. Steep inclines and rocky paths on the lower trail could challenge less robust hikers.
Albany is at one end of the very scenic, and historically important, Erie Canal which runs all the way to Buffalo.
With its impressive industrial heritage, Albany is a part of the American Industry Tour between Boston and Chicago.
