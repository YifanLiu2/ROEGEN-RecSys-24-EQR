There are several highways that reach Fairbanks.
Fairbanks can be reached driving west from Whitehorse, Yukon. In the Yukon, the highway is named Highway 1, until it enters Alaska. The 1488 miles (2395 km) portion of the highway between Delta Junction (66 miles (106 km) east of Fairbanks) and Dawson Creek, British Columbia is known as the Alaska Highway
Fairbank can also be reached driving east from Manley Hot Springs.
Highway 3 (George Parks Highway) - Fairbanks can be reached driving north from Wasilla. The quickest route from Anchorage is to take Highway 1 and transfer to Highway 3.
Highway 6 - Fairbanks can be reached driving southwest from Circle.
If you are driving up from Anchorage, the Highway 3 (George Parks Highway) is a beautiful trip. Plan plenty of time in your schedule for sight-seeing, meals and photographs. During the summer, when the roads are clear, the trip can easily be made in 7 or 8 hours, with stops for snacks and bathroom breaks - depending on road construction and motorhome-convoy-slowdowns. You will pass through Denali National Park on your way which is a popular attraction. However, if you plan to stay the night have reservations well in advance. By "lower-48" standards, accommodation near the park is either "4-star" or "rustic". Both can be pricey, but worth every penny, especially if you spend a day in the park.
Though many think Denali Park is the highlight of the trip there are long stretches of breath-taking beauty. It is not uncommon to see moose, caribou, dall sheep, bear, and other wildlife along the road - have your camera ready. There are plenty of gas stations scattered along the route, but as expected, the prices are much higher than in Anchorage or Fairbanks. Fill up before you leave.
There are several good places to eat along the way as well. Most places will have specialties like reindeer or buffalo on the menu as well as more traditional fare.
All in all, you should make the drive at least once. It's worth it.

Fairbanks had a somewhat bad reputation for crime back in the 1980s and 1990s. Crime rates have improved significantly since then and downtown Fairbanks is well policed. However, it is wise to avoid the area around South Cushman street after dark. It is the poorest and most dangerous area of Fairbanks, has high rates of drug activity, prostitution, sexual assaults and muggings, and suffers from urban blight, but attacks on tourists are very rare and there's little reason for tourists to be in this area at night. Other constant problems in Fairbanks are break-ins in parked vehicles, house robberies, and petty theft. Don't leave valuables visible in your car, lock your car and house doors, and you should be fine.
